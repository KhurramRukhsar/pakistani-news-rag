SBP seeks tax on foreign investment,"RO
Ties tax benefits to one-year minimum retention as rupee weakens
As the local currency comes under renewed stress, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday proposed linking tax benefits with a minimum one-year retention period for foreign investments in government debt and equity markets to bring predictability in outflows.
Dr Mohammad Ali Malik, an SBP executive, suggested the 10% reduced income tax rate should be tied to at least one-year retention of investment made through the Special Convertible Rupee Account (SCRA). He made the proposal during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by Pakistan People's Party (PPP)'s Syed Naveed Qamar.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Langrial said that investors were securing tax advantages by making short-term investments. He recommended a minimum six-month holding period for investments in Roshan Digital Accounts and other schemes to qualify for tax benefits. With this, the central bank seeks more predictable dollar outflows.
However, the committee warned that such a move could deter investors, which the government could not afford.
Dr Malik argued that the condition would not disrupt current inflows, as significant investments in treasury bills, government bonds, and SCRAs were not presently being made. He said linking tax incentives with long-term investments could help stabilise outflows.
Under SBP regulations, non-residents may freely invest and trade in government marketable securities, including Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), Treasury Bills (TBs), registered corporate debt instruments, and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)'s registered bonds through SCRAs.
Following months of stability, the rupee has again come under pressure due to increased debt repayments. The rupee's value has depreciated to around Rs284 per US dollar in the interbank market, with even higher rates in the open market.
A senior executive from a private commercial bank said large interbank transactions are being settled at nearly Rs3 above the average market rate.
In an economic alert issued Saturday, advisory firm Tola Associates warned that ongoing unrest in the Middle East and Pakistan's reliance on imported oil posed serious risks of economic disruption.
Crude oil prices, it stated, have surged over the past two weeks, rising from $63.76 on June 2 to $76.31 per barrel by June 19 due to the ongoing Gulf conflict.
Tola Associates noted a dual inflationary impact on Pakistan's economy: higher crude prices widen the current account deficit and weaken the rupee against the dollar, which further fuels inflation.
If crude oil hits $80 per barrel, the rupee may slide to Rs285.4 per dollar; if it rises to $100, the rupee could depreciate further to Rs292.1. In that case, local petrol prices may need to rise by Rs35 per litre, the firm said.
The government has already formed a committee, chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, to review the implications of Israel's illegal act of war against Iran on Pakistan's economy and petroleum flows.
Tola Associates said that the direct impact of higher crude prices on domestic petrol rates may further fuel inflation and make life more difficult for the people of Pakistan. It has estimated the additional impact of inflation by 1.8% in case crude oil price increases to $80 and 8.7% if the prices surge to $100.
The current account deficit is also projected to widen to $4.3 billion in the next fiscal year, if crude oil hits $100 price.
The standing committee also reviewed another proposal: taxing income from government debt investments even if withdrawn before maturity. Currently, some investors evade taxes by prematurely selling and rebuying securities — a tactic known as ""coupon washing.""
The FBR proposed in the budget that tax be charged on the investment regardless of early withdrawal, estimating an additional Rs10 billion in revenue. However, the committee adjusted the proposal, reducing the required holding period from one year to six months.
Last month, the FBR had discussed the coupon washing measure with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But the IMF was sceptical that people who buy government securities do not pay taxes.
Additionally, the committee approved raising the cash withdrawal threshold for non-filers — subject to a 0.8% tax — from Rs50,000 to Rs75,000. However, it rejected the FBR's recommendation to increase the tax rate to 1%, which had been 0.6% before the budget proposal.

Budget debate focuses on govt's performance,"US
Treasury benches highlight achievements, opposition criticises record
The Sindh Assembly continued its debate on the provincial budget for the fifth consecutive day on Saturday. The session, chaired by Deputy Speaker Anthony Naveed, focused on the government's ongoing efforts to improve public services, uplift living standards, and address core issues across the province.
Sindh Health Minister Dr. Azra Fazal Pechuho shared her department's performance in detail. She highlighted that 19 chest pain units are currently operating in Karachi. She also announced plans to procure CT scan and MRI machines and improve ICU facilities in public hospitals.
The minister dismissed rumors that Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) has been handed over to any NGO. MQM-Pakistan MPA Iftikhar Alam criticised the Sindh government, claiming discriminatory treatment towards Karachi. He questioned the necessity of the billion-rupee Karimabad underpass.
He demanded a district-level revenue distribution formula similar to the NFC Award. Sindh Education Minister Syed Sardar Shah criticised the federal government's economic survey, alleging that outdated data was used to misrepresent Sindh's performance.
Sindh Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar outlined various initiatives taken to improve law and order in the province. He mentioned a noticeable decline in several categories of crime compared to previous years.
According to the minister, 7,441 mobile phones were snatched in the past year, but the frequency of such incidents has dropped.

Freedom from eternal Hindu scorn? Paradox of Jinnah's Pakistan,"US
.
The irony of Pakistan's birth is this: the people who would inhabit its land never truly allowed to escape possessive identities, the ancient curse of caste and hierarchy, or the feudal-clientelist systems that still strangle them. They were denied the chance to build a modern state rooted in self-determination and individual rights. Jinnah provided an exit — outwardly embraced but never implemented by the State of Pakistan, yet.
Both Muslims and Hindus were marginalised after the British seized Bengal in 1757. Yet while Hindus adapted, Muslims sank into a slumber of self-condemnation. Even Sir Syed's push for modern education and Iqbal's calls to awaken Muslim potential were met with apathy.
Pakistan was not born from organic grassroots struggle. It emerged unexpectedly — a byproduct of lobbying by Muslim ashraafia in UP, demanding British-granted political rights, employment, and support for business opportunities. These concessions came not from British compassion but to counterbalance Hindu nationalism.
Jinnah and the Muslim League (1906), initially loyal to the British Raj (a shield against Hindu majoritarianism), sought a negotiated constitutional role for Muslims in a united India, mirroring the early Congress demands (1885). But Congress later rejected any reforms for Hindu self-rule that accommodated Muslims. The British, however, enforced electoral reforms and held legislative elections in 1937.
Muslims remained blind to Hindu discrimination, evident in communal violence particularly after Bengal's partition, and to the League's hard-won safeguards like separate electorates (1909). Gratitude failed to translate into votes: The League flopped in 1937. Why?
The answer was naked self-interest. Muslim-majority provinces clung to their feudal strongholds, abandoning the plight of minority-province Muslims — their support could have fortified the League's fight against Hindu domination. Let's see how each province failed to support Jinnah's Nobel cause:
Punjab, ruled by British-crafted feudal-military-bureaucratic loyalists (the future PakRaj), gave the League just 2/84 seats. Sindh, trapped in sufi-wadero culture but resentful of Hindu traders, granted only 3/35 seats. Sindhi nationalists triumphed. NWFP (KPK), obsessed with Pashtun nationalism under the Red Shirts, rejected the League entirely (0/36 seats). Bengal, home to the 1857 Revolt's sepoys, was receptive (40/119 seats), but peasant parties dominated. Balochistan had no elections; Kashmir remained a princely state.
Congress won 8 of 11 ministries but refused to share power, oppressing Muslims under its rule, as documented in Jinnah's 1938 'Suffering Muslim Minorities' report.
A crushing outcome for Jinnah. Yet he didn't give up and reinvented the League: from an ashraafia guild to a mass movement, shifting focus from resisting British to defying Majority Hindu rule. He synthesised Hindu discrimination with religious emotion, weaponised it, and crafted the 'Two-Nation Theory' demanding a separate Muslim state in the 1940 Lahore Resolution. (Congress had demanded full independence in 1930.)
British control waned. Their constitutional reforms — falling short of independence but including Muslim safeguards — were rejected by Congress, radicalising Hindus against both the British and Muslims. Jinnah established that Muslims, a perpetual minority in united India (Hindus 66%, Muslims 24%, 1941 Census), without doubt face eternal discrimination by Hindus' legislative domination - passing laws adversely affecting Muslims, leading to their social, economic and cultural erasure.
The British last-ditch effort to preserve India under a weak federal structure (Jinnah favoured) collapsed due to Congress's objection after the July 1946 elections, splitting the subcontinent: Congress won Hindu support for united India; the League became Muslims' sole voice for Pakistan.
Jinnah's political mantra and surging public sentiment coerced reluctant provinces to switch sides: Sindh endorsed Pakistan first (1943) under GM Syed, backing Jinnah in 1946, though Syed later became disillusioned by Pakistan's federal politics and demanded Sindhudesh. Punjab joined only when Pakistan's inevitability became obvious (1946). East Bengal overwhelmingly accepted Pakistan in 1946. NWFP, perhaps fearing Afghan annexation, agreed but remained immersed in the Pakhtunistan dream. Balochistan was reluctant but coerced (March 1948) and still rebels.
Kashmir, a Muslim-majority princely state, was invaded by Pakistan in 1947 after its Hindu ruler opted for India. India's intervention birthed the Line of Control and conflict between the two nations. India blamed Pakistan for the recent Pahalgam incident and launched retaliatory strikes. However, Pakistan's swift and overwhelming response — leveraging advanced Chinese military technology — forced India into an immediate ceasefire, at least for now.
British intransigence after the January 1946 elections pushed Jinnah to call for Direct Action Day (16 August 1946), triggering Bengal riots that spread nationwide. The Raj's indifference, poor management and hasty withdrawal ignited history's largest migration and over a million deaths. Pakistan — a state for some Muslims of India — was born on 14 August 1947.
Jinnah was fully aware of the new country's socio-political and economic impediments and its ""moth-eaten, truncated"" territory. Besides, he knew that millions of Muslims spread across India could not benefit from his design, yet he endeavoured to provide freedom to those who did not want it to begin with. Jinnah's calculus — perpetual Hindu domination of all Muslims versus a flawed independent Pakistan — drove him to choose the latter.
The ultimate irony is that post-1857, the British cultivated a Punjab-centric feudal-military-bureaucracy in a close, dependent relationship to secure their rule, which oddly could not help them retain power in India. They never imagined this system would outlive them, morphing into the governing structure of Pakistan, as the PakRaj. Jinnah was acutely aware of their presence and inherent opposition to a modern, democratic, egalitarian Pakistan and their dominance of politics, governance and economy.
Jinnah's stark warning was that while Pakistan could not be easily challenged externally, it would collapse under its own contradictions — the PakRaj, denied genuine and fair democratic rule, resulted in Pakistan's breakup in less than a few decades. Alas!
There is never a precise time to undo past wrongs; one must willfully choose to correct the course — it is always a matter of will.

PSX posts fourth weekly decline,"US
KSE-100 index suffers 2,120-point loss amid Israel-Iran conflict, rising oil prices
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) extended its bearish run in the outgoing week, which was the fourth consecutive weekly decline, as escalating geopolitical tensions following Israeli airstrikes on Iran, surging global commodity prices and weak regional markets dented investor sentiment.
The benchmark KSE-100 index lost 2,120 points, or 1.74% week-on-week (WoW), to close at 120,023, slipping below key technical levels after touching the intra-week low of 119,770. Average daily trading volumes contracted 9.4% to 822 million shares, reflecting cautious participation amid macroeconomic uncertainty and rising oil prices, which hit a five-month high at $77 per barrel.
On a day-on-day basis, the PSX on Monday remained range bound and registered thin gains of 82 points as investors treaded cautiously ahead of monetary policy announcement later in the day, where the central bank left policy rate unchanged at 11%. Despite the conflict between Israel and
Iran, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a slight rise of 0.07% and settled at 122,225.
On Tuesday, the market witnessed a volatile trading session, mirroring global market trends amid escalation in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The index swung between a high of 666 points and low of 409 points, before closing down by 254 points.
On Wednesday, the bourse dived over 1,500 points as it came under pressure in the wake of heightened Israel-Iran conflict and unease over Pakistan's weak economic indicators. The KSE-100 recorded a sharp drop of 1,505 points at 120,466.
The PSX extended the downward trend on Thursday and ended lower by 463 points to settle at 120,003, following a volatile session as early gains, driven by policy optimism, were wiped out by selling pressure amid Middle East tensions.
The market ended the week by closing flat on Friday as investors remained cautious amid uncertainty about the Israel-Iran conflict. Although the index touched the intra-day high of 120,829, it closed with a slight rise of 21 points.
In its report, AKD wrote that the market maintained a bearish momentum during the week as geopolitical concerns continued to weigh on investor confidence. The benchmark KSE-100 index closed the week at 120,023, down 2,120 points, or 1.74% WoW.
The week began with the monetary policy committee maintaining the status quo on Monday, aligning with market expectations. Several macroeconomic indicators were released during the week, including a current account deficit of $103 million for May 2025 and net foreign direct investment of $194 million for the month.
Additionally, the State Bank's auctions saw a reduction in Pakistan Investment Bonds' (PIBs) cut-off yields in contrast to an increase in T-bills' yields. Furthermore, the State Bank-held forex reserves rose $46 million, ending the week at $11.7 billion as of June 6. In the currency market, the Pakistani rupee depreciated 0.26% WoW against the greenback, closing at 283.7/$.
Syed Danyal Hussain of JS Global noted that following the spike in commodity prices and a decline in Asian markets due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, the KSE-100 index dropped 3.5% (4,330 points) from its recent high seen last week. On a WoW basis, the index was down 1.7%, with average volumes falling 9.4% to 822 million shares.
Brent oil prices continued to climb up to $77 per barrel, hitting a five-month high, on supply-side fears. Accordingly, the SBP opted to maintain policy rate at 11% in its monetary policy meeting held earlier in the week, he said.
Moreover, the current account recorded a deficit of $103 million, however, the 11MFY25 figure remained comfortable with a surplus of $1.8 billion. Notably, exports fell 19% YoY while imports were up 9% YoY in May 2025.
The analyst pointed out that Pakistan secured a syndicated loan of $1 billion from a foreign commercial bank and arrangements were also underway to secure a refinancing of $1.3 billion from Chinese banks by the end of June 30.
In other news, the government raised Rs557 billion in the PIB auction against the target of Rs300 billion, with yields falling 29 to 64 basis points. Lastly, he added, June 19 was the final date for the submission of Expressions of Interest for PIA's acquisition, where five bids were received by the Privatisation Commission.

Mob attacks murder suspect in court,"US
Suspects flee Rawalpindi Judicial Complex after breaking through police checkpoints
A serious security breach occurred at the Rawalpindi Judicial Complex when a group of enraged individuals launched a violent assault on a murder suspect during police custody during peak court hours on Saturday.
The suspect, Hammadwho is facing charges in a police custody killing casewas physically attacked by members of the complainant party, despite being handcuffed.
The mob, reportedly 15 to 20 individuals strong, began punching, kicking, and assaulting the accused in full view of law enforcement. In an effort to shield the suspect, police swiftly moved him into Courtroom No 27 and locked the door. However, the attackers pursued them, violently pounding on the courtroom door in an attempt to break in.
As chaos erupted, the presiding judge was forced to abandon the ongoing hearing and take refuge in his chambers. The locked door left lawyers and litigants trapped inside the courtroom for a significant period, while commotion continued outside.
The attackers continued to disrupt proceedings, assaulted police personnel, and attempted to forcibly enter the courtroom. After breaking through police checkpoints, they ultimately fled the Judicial Complex. The incident laid bare alarming gaps in the security arrangements for judicial officers, court staff, and detainees within the complex.
Following a written request by the investigating officer, a formal case was registered at Civil Lines Police Station under relevant penal codes. As of now, no arrests have been made.
Sub-Inspector Qamar Sadiq, posted at Saddar Bairooni Police Station and assigned to the investigation, said that the accused was brought to court to obtain physical remand. The complainant party, already present at the premises, launched a premeditated attack on the suspect.
He confirmed that he managed to secure the accused inside a courtroom, but the mob attempted to force their way in, attacking both the door and the officers present.
The disturbance led to a suspension of judicial proceedings, while police officers and attackers clashed outside the courtroom. The named individuals in the FIR included Raja Manan, Raja Matloob, Ghufran, and Raja Usman, along with other unidentified suspects.
All accused individuals managed to escape after breaking through police security barriers.

While speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Mayor declared that Karachiites no longer need to travel abroad for premium beach experiences, as the city now boasts its own world-class leisure destination. The resort, completed in just six months, offers state-of-the-art facilities and is now open to the public.
The mayor described the project as a milestone achievement for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and a step toward modernising the city's infrastructure.
Wahab announced that another beach resort is in the pipeline, likely to be developed in Ibrahim Hyderi or Malir, ensuring broader access to high-quality recreational spaces for citizens. He stressed that enhancing Karachi's leisure and tourism sector remains a top priority under his administration.
The mayor outlined several key projects aimed at improving Karachi's livability and economic vitality, which include cleaning of 46 major stormwater drains to prevent urban flooding during monsoon; beautification of II Chundrigar Road, the city's financial hub; preservation of historic landmarks such as Denso Hall, Empress Market, and Frere Hall; development of a mangrove conservation park to promote environmental awareness.
The inauguration was attended by Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad, City Council Parliamentary Leader Karamullah Waqasi, Deputy Parliamentary Leader Dil Muhammad, and various UC chairmen and officials.
In a separate meeting with the Sindhi Muslim Housing Society's Managing Committee, Mayor Wahab directed the KMC Land Department to take immediate action against illegal constructions and encroachments on KMC-owned properties. He asked for weekly progress reports to ensure enforcement transparency.
Meanwhile, the mayor has formally written to the Federal Minister for Commerce and Chairman of the Export Development Fund (EDF) Board, Jam Kamal Khan, expressing deep concern over the continued neglect of Karachi in the allocation and utilisation of Export Development Funds.
The Mayor has urged the federal government to ensure that Karachi receives its rightful share of support and funding, commensurate with its critical role in Pakistan's economy.

Sharif family accused of self-branding as lawmakers from South Punjab voice disappointment
Lawmakers from the treasury benches hailed the Punjab government's 2025-26 budget as ""historic"" and ""tax-free,"" while opposition legislators dismissed it as a self-promotional exercise for the Sharif family, highlighting continued neglect in critical sectors across the province.
On the third consecutive day of the general discussion on the annual budget, treasury members lauded Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz's leadership, asserting that they now enjoyed the freedom to voice their concerns — something they claimed had been suppressed in the past.
Opposition lawmakers, primarily from Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), criticized the budget as anti-people, lacking substance and practical relief. They described it as ""a budget of words"" rather than action.
Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarian (PPPP) MPA Mumtaz Ali Chang voiced disillusionment, stating that he had hoped Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz would back her passionate opposition speeches with meaningful action.
""This budget is a letdown, especially for South Punjab,"" he said.
Ramesh Singh Arora praised the budget and said that the religious and sacred sites of minority communities were fully protected under the current government.
PTI lawmaker Qazi Ahmad Akbar criticised the ruling party for naming projects after the Sharif family and claimed that while Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa had allocated over 34% to the social sector, Punjab's allocation was a mere 9%.
""Instead of making jobs in Punjab, the government is busy boasting about sending people abroad after offering training,"" he said.
Other opposition members, including Tayyab Rashid and Khalid Zubair Nisar, lamented the neglect of development projects in their constituencies.
""Billions are allocated for education, yet children in villages have no shoes on their feet or pencils in their hands,"" Nisar said.
The House was adjourned until June 23 at 11 am by Chairman Raja Shaukat after completion of the day's agenda.

Horror of child pornography,"US
.
Another horrifying incident has come out of the hotbed of child exploitation, Muzaffargarh. A young boy, sent to collect his brother's unpaid wages, was sexually assaulted and filmed by a man his family once relied on for employment. This case, shocking as it is, comes on the heels of an even darker international child pornography ring recently exposed in the same district.
That Muzaffargarh has surfaced twice in a matter of weeks for crimes of such depravity is no coincidence. It is a reflection of a deep rot, one that festers in the absence of credible child protection mechanisms. In these rural stretches of Punjab, where trust is easily exploited and oversight is minimal, predators thrive. And yet, the state continues to respond with the same laxity.
Pakistan does not lack the legal framework to prosecute such crimes. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2016 and the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Act, 2020 are both designed to deter child sexual abuse and child pornography, with penalties ranging from long-term imprisonment to capital punishment. But laws alone are no match for a system that is broken at every level — from undertrained police officers to overburdened courts, from unmonitored cyber spaces to non-functional child protection units. Predators are emboldened when they know investigations will be half-hearted and the justice system is too slow to deliver.
What is needed now is not another press conference, but a national-level response. The FlA's cybercrime wing must be strengthened with advanced tools, training and jurisdiction to act swiftly across provinces.
Child protection bureaus must be activated in every district with the authority to intervene and the funding to support victims. Police must be trained in both handling abuse cases and managing digital trails of child pornography. Most importantly, the harshest punishment should be meted out to perpetrators as a form of deterrence.

Court shields foreign students at Harvard,"KR
Trump's student ban blocked again
A federal judge on Friday indefinitely paused Donald Trump's bid to block Harvard from enrolling foreign students as the US president said a ""deal"" with the Ivy League school was in the works, reported AFP.
The order by District Judge Allison Burroughs will allow international students to continue to attend the elite university while a lawsuit filed by Harvard plays out in the courts.
Trump, who has cut federal grants for Harvard and tried a host of different tactics to block the institution from hosting international students, said that his administration has been holding negotiations with Harvard.
""Many people have been asking what is going on with Harvard University and their large-scale improprieties that we have been addressing, looking for a solution,"" Trump said in a post Friday on Truth Social.
""We have been working closely with Harvard, and it is very possible that a deal will be announced over the next week or so,"" he said. ""If a settlement is made on the basis currently being discussed, it will be mindboggingly historic, and very good for our country.""
Trump did not provide any details about the purported ""deal.""
The Trump administration has sought to remove Harvard from an electronic student immigration registry and instructed embassies to deny visas to international students hoping to attend the Massachusetts-based university.
Harvard has sued the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies to block the efforts, arguing that they were illegal and unconstitutional.
Harvard previously secured two temporary restraining orders from Burroughs against the government's move to bar international students, and the judge extended it with a preliminary injunction on Friday.
International students accounted for 27 per cent of total enrollment at Harvard in the 2024-2025 academic year and are a major source of income.
In court filings, Harvard argued that Trump's actions were ""retribution for Harvard's exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government's demands to control Harvard's governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students.""

CDWP greenlights Rs55b uplift projects,"US
Three schemes totaling Rs47.43b are sent to ECNEC for final nod
The Central Development Working Party (CDWP) — a key planning and project-approval body — has approved five development projects worth Rs55.164 billion for sustainable economic development in the country.
A CDWP meeting held on Friday under the chairmanship of Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal greenlighted these projects. Out the five, three projects totaling Rs47.439 billion were referred to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) for final approval.
The agenda focused on development projects across key sectors, including environment, food and agriculture, health and physical planning and housing. A project related to the environment sector — installation of Weather Surveillance Radar at Sukkur — worth Rs5725.013 million was also approved.
The chair noticed inordinate delay in implementation of the project with Japanese grant and directed the relevant authority to complete it on priority basis.
A project related to food and agriculture — Balochistan Livelihoods and Entrepreneurship Project — was also recommended to ECNEC. The revised cost of the project is Rs12461.661 million. It will be financed through World Bank and International Development Association (IDA) and MDTF.
The main objective of the project is to promote employment opportunities for rural communities and ensure the sustainability of enterprises in eight districts of Balochistan including Chagai, Killa Abdullah, Killa Saifullah, Mastung, Nushki, Pishin, Sherani, and Zhob.
The project aims to benefit rural households by supporting livelihoods through enterprise development and job creation. Furthermore, it will extend benefits to communities for enterprises development in sectors — agriculture, livestock, forestry, mines and minerals, tourism, and industry.
Ahsan Iqbal directed that the additional scope of work should include tangible and impact oriented interventions under the project.

'Oil output hikes justified',"US
Rosneft says OPEC may bring forward its output hikes by around a year
OPEC+ group of leading global oil producers could bring forward its output hikes by around a year from the initial plan, Igor Sechin, head of Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft, said on Saturday.
He also said that the decision by the OPEC+ to speed up output increase now looked far-sighted and justified in the light of the confrontation between Israel and Iran.
The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, led by Russia, shocked oil markets in April by agreeing a bigger-than-expected output hike for May despite weak prices and slowing demand.
OPEC+ has since decided to continue with more than planned hikes.
""The announced increase in production since May of this year is three times higher than the alliance's initial plan. In addition, the entire increase in OPEC+ production could be shifted a year ahead of plan,"" he said without elaborating.
""The decision taken by OPEC leaders to forcefully increase production looks very far-sighted today and, from the market's point of view, justified, taking into account the interests of consumers in light of the uncertainty regarding the scale of the Israel-Iran conflict,"" he added.
OPEC+ crude output represents about 41% of global oil production. The group's main objective is to regulate the supply of oil to the global market.
Having spent years curbing production, eight OPEC+ countries made a modest output increase in April before tripling it for May, June and now July.
Besides the 2.2 million bpd cut that the eight members started to unwind in April, OPEC+ has two other layers of cuts that are expected to remain in place until the end of 2026.
Oil prices had initially fallen in response to the OPEC+ decision to increase oil production, but the outbreak of Israel's aerial war on Iran has so far been the main factor behind their return to around $75 per barrel, levels unseen since the start of the year.
Speaking at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, Sechin, a long-standing ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, also said there will be no oil glut long-term despite the production rise due to low stockpile levels, though rising usage of electric vehicles in China might hit oil demand.

Sri Lanka draw first Test with BD as rain hampers play,"CN
BD skipper Shanto scores centuries in both innings of match
The first Test between Bangladesh and Sri Lanka fizzled out into a damp draw on Saturday, with rain robbing the match in Galle of a proper climax.
Sri Lanka were set a tall order of 296 in 37 overs and were tottering at 72-4 when stumps were drawn 9.5 overs into the final hour, with both captains shaking hands and accepting no result was possible.
The day belonged to Bangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto, who scored centuries in both innings.
Shanto made an unbeaten 125 in the second innings after posting 148 in his first dig.
It was the second time he had achieved the feat, scoring two centuries in a match against Afghanistan in 2023.
However, questions will linger over his captaincy. In pursuit of his landmark, Shanto might have taken his eye off the larger prize.
Bangladesh were 247 runs ahead when play resumed after a rain delay and, with 50 overs still to be bowled on the day, an earlier declaration could have forced a result.
Instead, Bangladesh batted on for 12 more overs and, with the the innings break taken into account, more than an hour of potentially valuable time was lost on a wearing fifth-day pitch.
The delay gave Sri Lanka some hope but their top order crumbled under pressure. Lahiru Udara was stumped off a cleverly flighted delivery by Taijul Islam, while Pathum Nissanka gifted his wicket to Nayeem Hasan by spooning one straight to short mid-wicket.
Taijul struck two crucial blows, removing the experienced Angelo Mathews and Dinesh Chandimal in quick succession, but time ran out for Bangladesh.
Mathews, playing his 119th and final Test, walked off to a standing ovation as the crowd rose for one of Sri Lanka's greats.
There was a silver lining for Sri Lanka in the form of debutant Tharindu Rathnayake.
A six-wicket haul from two innings on debut was praiseworthy enough but Rathnayake also showcased his rare ambidextrous skills. He dismissed Mominul Haque with off-spin, then switched to left-arm orthodox to account for Litton Das and Jaker Ali.
He also pulled off a sensational run out, firing a direct hit from mid-on to catch Mushfiqur Rahim short of his ground on 49.
The second Test will be played in Colombo next week.

"KW&SC, Rangers crack down on water theft","US
Key suspects identified in the illegal operation
In a coordinated effort to combat illegal water extraction, the Karachi Water & Sewerage Corporation (KW&SC), aided by Rangers, conducted a major operation against organised water theft in the Manghopir area of the metropolis.
According to KW&SC's Anti-Water Theft Cell, the operation focused on dismantling unauthorised connections in Ramzan Goth and Zebo Goth, where illegal pipelines, siphoning water from main supply lines, were traced and disconnected.
Officials confirmed that a similar crackdown is being planned for Pakhtoonabad, where systemic water theft has been reported.
Sources revealed, the KWSC has compiled evidence regarding those involved in these illegal activities, as well as their alleged political patronage. Despite previous cases registered against the offenders, water theft has continued in these areas.
Key suspects identified in the illegal operation include Gul Dad, Mian Dad, Obaidullah, and Pervaiz Mama, among others.
The modus operandi of the accused is that they install unauthorised connections on government water lines, store stolen water in large underground reservoirs within their homes and then illegally distributed across the city via tankers for commercial gain.
Officials have vowed to intensify operation against such criminal networks to ensure fair water distribution and curb losses to the public exchequer. Further actions are expected as investigations continue.

Senate rejects 18% tax on solar panels,"PL
Upper house turns down tariffs on steel sector
The Senate has approved with a majority vote the report of its standing committee on financerejecting an 18% tax on solar panels, sales tax on homeopathic items and stationery, and tariffs on the steel sector.
In its report, presented in the upper house of parliament on Saturday, the committee also opposed increased taxation on 800cc vehicles, suggesting a 12.5% cap.
It proposed no increase in tax on print media and IT services and urged that taxes on services falling under provincial jurisdiction be reconsidered.
It also called for a review and further increase in government employees' salaries. The committee also proposed setting the minimum wage at Rs40,000 or Rs50,000 and exempting income tax for monthly salaries up to Rs100,000.
The Senate session began under the chairmanship of Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan Nasar. During the session, Senate Standing Committee on Finance Chairman Saleem Mandviwalla, presented the report containing the budget proposals and recommendations.
Earlier, Senate Leader of Opposition Shibli Faraz objected that the report had not been presented to them earlier and questioned how a 100-page document could be read and reviewed in 10 minutes.
He criticized the government for not reducing its expenditures and instead taxing those already burdened with taxes.
Responding to the criticism, Senator Mandviwalla stated that he had remained in contact with Shibli and Mohsin Aziz of the PTI. He said all parties, including the PML-N, the PPP, and the PTI, participated in the discussions, offered suggestions, and voiced their concerns.
He said the committee staff worked till 2 am and while the draft may not have been shared due to an oversight, all recommendations in the final version reflected the committee's discussions.
Concluding the budget debate, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb acknowledged the valuable, balanced, and constructive input provided by senators over the past one and a half weeks.
He said this consultation helped guide the government's economic policies and reinforced its commitment to transparency, fiscal responsibility, and sustainable development.
""During the past fiscal year, no mini-budget was introduced, inflation was brought under control, foreign reserves increased, and the current account improved significantly,"" he added.
He announced tax relief for salaried individuals earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million annually by reducing the income tax rate from 2.5% to 1%. This, he said, was a symbolic and practical gesture to show that the government does not wish to overburden the middle class.
He also announced a 10% increase in government employees' salaries and a 7% raise in pensions. Taxes on agricultural pesticides were removed, and, following the prime minister's direction, 1,000 graduates would be sent to China for further opportunities.
Regarding solar panels, the finance minister said the proposed 18% sales tax on imported parts was meant to protect local industry and create a competitive environment for solar technology investment in Pakistan.
However, after consultation, the government decided to reduce the tax to 10%, applicable only to 46% of imported components, resulting in a 4.6% price hike for imported panels.
He warned against profiteering, noting that some opportunistic elements had already begun increasing prices before the tax's implementation. He assured that the government would take strict legal action against such exploitation in the public interest.
Aurangzeb said the relief and social protection measures included in the 2025-26 budget are not merely temporary reliefs but a practical reflection of the state's recognition and acceptance of its responsibilities.
""A key measure is the increase in the budget of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) from Rs592 billion to Rs716 billion.
""Expanding the scope of financial assistance under BISP reflects the government's commitment to providing economic protection to the most vulnerable segments of society,"" he added.

Study finds more microplastic in glass bottles than plastic,"KR
Results catch researchers by surprise
Drinks including water, soda, beer and wine sold in glass bottles contain more microplastics than those in plastic bottles, according to a surprising study released by France's food safety agency on Friday.
Researchers have detected the tiny, mostly invisible pieces of plastic throughout the world, from in the air we breathe to the food we eat, as well as riddled throughout human bodies.
There is still no direct evidence that this preponderance of plastic is harmful to human health, but a burgeoning field of research is aiming to measure its spread.
Guillaume Duflos, research director at French food safety agency ANSES, told AFP the team sought to ""investigate the quantity of microplastics in different types of drinks sold in France and examine the impact different containers can have"".
The researchers found an average of around 100 microplastic particles per litre in glass bottles of soft drinks, lemonade, iced tea and beer. That was five to 50 times higher than the rate detected in plastic bottles or metal cans.
""We expected the opposite result,"" PhD student Iseline Chaib, who conducted the research, told AFP.
""We then noticed that in the glass, the particles emerging from the samples were the same shape, colour and polymer composition — so therefore the same plastic – as the paint on the outside of the caps that seal the glass bottles,"" she said.
The paint on the caps also had ""tiny scratches, invisible to the naked eye, probably due to friction between the caps when there were stored,"" the agency said in a statement.
This could then ""release particles onto the surface of the caps"", it added.
Wine fine
For water, both flat and sparkling, the amount of microplastic was relatively low in all cases, ranging from 4.5 particles per litre in glass bottles to 1.6 particles in plastic.
Wine also contained few microplastics — even glass bottles with caps. Duflos said the reason for this discrepancy ""remains to be explained"".
Soft drinks however contained around 30 microplastics per litre, lemonade 40 and beer around 60.
Because there is no reference level for a potentially toxic amount of microplastics, it was not possible to say whether these figures represent a health risk, ANSES said.
But drink manufacturers could easily reduce the amount of microplastics shed by bottle caps, it added.
The agency tested a cleaning method involving blowing the caps with air, then rinsing them with water and alcohol, which reduced contamination by 60 per cent.
The study released by ANSES was published online in the Journal of Food Composition and Analysis last month. AFP

Bayern advance at Club World Cup,"US
Kane enjoying 'special feeling' after the 2-1 win against Argentina's Boca Juniors
Bayern Munich's England striker Harry Kane said Friday he is relishing the Club World Cup's ""special"" atmosphere and is confident the German team can now go all the way.
Kane scored the opener for Bayern in a 2-1 win over Argentina's Boca Juniors at Hard Rock Stadium that took his side through to the last 16.
He said it had been a tough challenge in the heat and humidity of South Florida.
""There's something special about these World Cup games and next year will be the same,"" he said with a nod to the 2026 World Cup.
""When you come off that pitch and you're sweating and you're dripping and you're cramping and you've given everything on the pitch. There's a special feeling inside, especially when you win. That's what we had today.""
Boca responded to Kane's opener through Miguel Merentiel, but Michael Olise sealed the win six minutes from time.
""Really tough game. I thought the first half was really good, I mean we probably should have been 2 or 3-0 up. They hung in the game and the second half made it more difficult,"" said Kane, who acknowledged the incredible support of more than 55,000 Boca fans in the 63,587 crowd.
""I mean it felt like an away game out there for sure, their fans were really loud. It was a great experience to play in front of them and I think that's what makes the win even more special, because it feels like a good away win,"" he said.
""So we're really happy, really pleased and we'll sleep well tonight.""
Bayern's win was the first for a European team against South American opposition in the tournament and Kane said he was enjoying pitting himself against opponents European clubs rarely face.
""I think it's great to experience different teams and I think you've seen in this tournament already, the South American teams especially have caused big problems for some of the European teams.
""So it shows how big football is worldwide and how good some of these players are. You have to be ready for the next game, the next opportunity. So yeah, I'm loving this tournament so far and hopefully we're going to be here for a while,"" he said.
Kane added that he was confident Bayern had a real chance to win the competition.
""I think we have a good opportunity. We started the tournament really well. I think the style we play is difficult for any team.""
Flamengo floor Chelsea
Flamengo produced a brilliant second-half fightback to beat Chelsea 3-1 at the Club World Cup on Friday and qualify for the last 16, while Bayern Munich joined them in reaching the knockout phase with a battling win over Boca Juniors.
In Philadelphia, Pedro Neto gave Chelsea an early lead but Flamengo, roared on by their frenzied supporters who made up the majority of the 54,019 crowd, did not deserve to be behind and came roaring back in the second half.
Bruno Henrique came off the bench in the 56th minute and quickly equalised before setting up former Real Madrid, Manchester City and Juventus defender Danilo to make it 2-1.
Chelsea were stunned, and their hopes of pulling level again were effectively destroyed when substitute Nicolas Jackson was sent off in the 68th minute for a dangerous tackle on Ayrton Lucas.
Wallace Yan then sealed the victory for the Rio de Janeiro club, the Brazilian league leaders, when he made it 3-1 late on.
""It was a special day for me and our club,"" said Flamengo coach Filipe Luis.
""We knew we would have chances against Chelsea, because we have one way to play and they know how to follow that path.""
Flamengo have won both matches in Group D and their place in the knockout stage was confirmed later when Esperance of Tunisia defeated Los Angeles FC 1-0 in Nashville.
Youcef Belaili scored the only goal of the game in the 70th minute in front of a sparse crowd featuring Nicole Kidman.

"Russia offers stakes in its Nigeria oil, gas fields","FI
Gazprom proposes joint ventures with OGDCL in exploration projects
Russia has offered Pakistan stakes in its oil and gas fields in Nigeria, a move that will help secure energy supplies and ease pressure on foreign exchange.
Russian energy giant Gazprom wants Pakistan's largest oil and gas explorer – Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) – to enter into joint ventures in its overseas oil and gas exploration projects.
At present, Pakistan produces 15% of crude oil locally whereas remaining needs are met through expensive imports that build pressure on foreign exchange reserves.
Earlier, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) tried to explore oil and gas in Iraq but that venture did not yield any result. Now, a Pakistani delegation, led by Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik, which is on a visit to Russia, has informed Moscow that Pakistan is interested in getting stakes in the fields that are already being developed to avoid risks.
Ali Pervaiz Malik, who had replaced former petroleum minister Musadik Malik, was keen to address issues of oil and gas sectors. OGDCL Managing Director Ahmed Hayat Lak is also part of the delegation.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the petroleum minister held a meeting with the chief executive officer of Gazprom, a Russian company responsible for overseas investment in oil and gas fields.
During the meeting, the CEO of Gazprom offered Pakistan's petroleum minister to form joint ventures between OGDCL and Gazprom in those fields which were being operated by the Russian company outside Pakistan and Russia.
At present, Gazprom is operating in different countries such as Bangladesh, Vietnam and Nigeria. He informed the Pakistani side that OGDCL could enter into a joint venture with Gazprom in any field.
Pakistani companies including OGDCL, Mari Petroleum, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) and Government Holdings Private Limited (GHPL) had also formed a joint venture with a state-owned firm of the UAE in Dubai in an offshoring block.
The UAE had offered a field to Pakistani companies, which had already been developed to avoid risks and was not a new block.
Sources said that the Pakistani side informed the CEO of Gazprom that it was not interested in those blocks which had not been developed so far and wanted to follow the Dubai project model. Pakistan wants to get stakes in those fields which have already been developed by Gazprom.
According to sources, Gazprom offered the petroleum minister to buy stakes in a developed hydrocarbon block in Nigeria, where no risk was involved. It proposed that Gazprom, a Nigerian state-owned company and OGDCL could become partners in that field.
Sources said that the Russian company would now send a proposal to OGDCL for evaluation as it would be a pure commercial deal. The Pakistani side had already offered Russia to become part of OGDCL's bid for offshore drilling in Pakistan.
Officials say a joint venture with Gazprom in Nigeria will also become a base for engaging the Russian company in offshore drilling in Pakistan.
OGDCL and other Pakistani companies have already reached an understanding with a Turkish firm to offer a joint bid for an offshore exploration field in Pakistan.
Officials say Pakistan is also looking towards the Russian firm to become its partner in this venture. Russia has been struggling to establish a firm footing in Pakistan's energy sector for the last one decade but it has not been able to achieve success.
It was also working with Pakistan to build an LNG pipeline from Karachi to Lahore for transporting imported gas. However, US sanctions on Russian firms were a key hurdle, which could not allow implementation of the project.
The structure of Pakistan Gas Stream Project was changed almost six times to avoid US sanctions but nothing could provide successful. Now, Gazprom has offered Pakistan to become a partner in oil and gas fields in Nigeria. Pakistan is hopeful that this joint venture could become successful.

Field Marshal Asim in Turkiye amid war,"US
Dar meets Erdogan as Pakistan emerges key player
After a nearly weeklong visit to the United States, Field Marshal General Syed Asim Munir on Saturday arrived in Istanbul in what seems part of Pakistan's diplomatic efforts to seek an end to the ongoing Iran-Israel war.
His meeting at the White House with US President Donald Trump discussed the Middle East crisis in detail and the army chief reportedly communicated Pakistan's concerns about the escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.
The army chief, in line with Pakistan's stated position, pushed for a diplomatic solution to the conflict that has the potential to engulf the entire region. After over two-hour long meeting with the Pakistani army chief, President Trump said Pakistan knew better about Iran than most others.
He also said Pakistan was not happy about ""anything."" Though, the US President did not elaborate, Pakistan's unhappiness stems from the fact that the Iran-Israel war has huge repercussions for the country.
It is believed that Trump listened to the Pakistani military leader's opinion on the Iran-Israel war carefully and some even linked the US President's decision to delay his decision on joining Israel against Iran for two weeks to his meeting with Field Marshal Munir.
The army chief's arrival in Istanbul lends credence to reports that Pakistan might be playing some role to defuse the crisis. Interestingly, the Iranian foreign minister is also in Istanbul as part of ongoing diplomatic efforts to end the Israel-Iran war.
There is no clarity whether the army chief will have any meeting scheduled with the Iranian foreign minister. But observers believe that such a meeting is not ruled out given Pakistan's desire to seek an end to the conflict.
Pakistan has emerged as one of the key players as it enjoys close ties with Iran while developing a close bonhomie with President Trump. Experts say Pakistan is uniquely positioned to play a role of a mediator between the US and Iran.
However, others say that the US has a direct channel of communications with Iran through President Trump's special envoy on the Middle East. Pakistan, nevertheless, may be part of the multiple diplomatic channels seeking a political solution to the crisis.
Meanwhile, a statement issued here by the foreign office said Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, called on the President of Türkiye, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Istanbul during his visit to attend the 51st session of OIC CFM. He was accompanied by Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
During the meeting, the DPM/FM, conveyed warm greetings of Prime Minister, Shahbaz Sharif, to President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an, and underscored the profound importance that Pakistan accords to its enduring bilateral relations with Türkiye.
Both the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to further deepen and diversify the longstanding brotherly cooperation between the two countries.
The leaders expressed strong condemnation of the continued Israeli attacks in blatant violation of fundamental principles of international law; reiterated support for Iran's sovereignty, territorial integrity and its right to self-defense under the UN Charter; agreed to continue diplomatic efforts to de-escalate the situation; and urged the international community to play its part in restoring peace and stability in the region.
Both sides emphasised the urgency of galvanizing efforts to bring an immediate halt to the Israeli aggression in Gaza and unhindered provision of humanitarian assistance to the besieged people of Gaza.
The DPM/FM congratulated President Erdogan on the Award conferred by the Islamic Cooperation Youth Forum in recognition of his leadership as well as successful holding of the OIC CFM session.

Pitt takes the wheel,"US
F1' star finally drives Formula One car
Brad Pitt, whose new F1 film is out next week, has now driven a Formula One car for real after testing a McLaren at Austin's Circuit of the Americas, reported Reuters.
The reigning world champions confirmed the Hollywood A lister drove a 2023 McLaren MCL60 car at the Texas track on Thursday. Media reports said the British-based team had been carrying out a private test with F1 regular Lando Norris and F2 driver Alex Dunne.
It was the first time 61-year-old Pitt, who plays the fictional racing driver Sonny Hayes in the Apple Originals film, had driven a real Formula One car on track. The cars used in the making of the film were Formula Two cars, modified by Mercedes to look like real Grand Prix racers.
Champions McLaren had teased the drive on Thursday with a social media post of overalls with the initials BP and the caption ""It's a Sonny day in Austin"".
Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, a co-producer of the film, said in March that Pitt had shown real speed while testing the F2 cars. ""Watching Brad drive around at speeds over 180 miles an hour was really impressive to see because it's not something you can just learn overnight,"" he said.
""The dedication and the focus that Brad put into this process has been amazing to witness.""
Director Joseph Kosinski, who directed the hit Top Gun: Maverick, explained how Hamilton was the first person he reached out to with the idea of a film.
""I sent him an email and just said 'I want to tell the story in your world. I want to make it as authentic as possible. Will you help me?'"" he said. ""And luckily Lewis said yes... He had actually talked to me earlier about playing a role in Top Gun: Maverick. So that's how I knew Lewis.""

PPP straddles the fence on ally's hybrid model claims,"PL
Asif's confession lays bare uncomfortable truth
The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), once a fierce critic of the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for claiming to be ""on the same page"" with the establishment, now finds itself in a rather awkward silence after its key ally in the ruling alliance not only admitted to the existence of a hybrid model but appeared to wear the newfound power-sharing arrangement with the military as a badge of honour.
The recent confession by Defence Minister Khawaja Asif – about what has long been an open secret – has laid bare an uncomfortable truth: the PML-N-led government is now openly conceding to operating under a power-sharing arrangement with the military.
Asif not only just lifted the curtain but drew it wide open, calling the current setup ""exemplary"".
What raised more than a few eyebrows was Asif's thinly veiled dig at his own party leader Nawaz Sharif. He even went on to say that Sharif's failure to implement such a hybrid model in the 1990s led to his early political exits – twice.
The remark effectively undercuts Nawaz Sharif's oft-repeated claim that he was shown the door for ""serving the country"", making his once-defiant slogan ""Mujhe Kyun Nikala"" (why was I removed?) ring hollow.
The PPP, which once rode the moral high horse in its opposition to military interference in civilian rule, now seems to have bitten its tongue. Its leaders, who once fired on all cylinders against PTI's so-called hybrid rule, suddenly appear to be walking on eggshells.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari not only coined the term ""puppet PM"" for Imran Khan but later wore that verbal jab as a political trophy, priding in having popularised the phrase during the waning days of the PTI government.
Ironically, the PPP, formerly the loudest critic of the hybrid model, now appears at a loss for words about a system they themselves are actively part of.
When asked to comment on Khawaja Asif's remarks, Chaudhry Manzoor, a PPP leader from Punjab, deflected, saying the question should instead be directed to the PML-N.
When it was pointed out that the PPP had been vocally critical of such arrangements in the past, and now that its ally has openly admitted to it – thus making PPP complicit – he responded, ""Unfortunately, I have neither listened to the interview nor do I have any knowledge about it"".
Senior PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira, when approached for comment, questioned whether anything Khawaja Asif said was actually new. ""Wasn't this known to everyone all along?"" he asked.
When queried whether the PPP was now comfortable being part of a hybrid model, Kaira said he could not speak on behalf of the party and would need to consult the leadership to clarify their position.
He also dodged the question regarding the PPP's historical criticism of hybrid arrangements, saying that only the party could take an official stance.
Attempts to reach the party's Information Secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan and PPP leader from Sindh, Shazia Marri, for comments were unsuccessful.

"New SOP for appointment, transfer of SHOs","CN
The move has been welcomed by law enforcement experts
In a move to enhance transparency and professionalism within the Sindh Police Department, IG Ghulam Nabi Memon has issued a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) governing the appointment and transfer of SHOs across the province.
The revised policy mandates that only officers who have successfully completed the Upper School Course will be eligible for SHO postings, while those facing corruption charges or serious criminal cases will be automatically disqualified.
As per the new SOP, the power to appoint SHOs has been delegated to the respective district's SSP. A committee comprising the Range DIG and the SSP will oversee the process to ensure fairness and accountability. Similarly, each appointed SHO will serve a minimum term of one year, barring exceptional circumstances such as misconduct, poor performance, or physical incapacity.
Moreover, officers will not be posted as SHOs in their home districts without prior approval from the IG Sindh. No officer can be reposted to the same police station within three years of their previous assignment there.
SHOs may only be transferred before completing their tenure in cases of corruption, inefficiency, or prolonged official inquiries exceeding 30 days. Officers removed under such conditions will be ineligible for SHO reappointment for at least one year.
Outgoing SHOs must formally transfer all official records and property to their successors, ensuring a smooth transition.
The police training branch and establishment wing have been instructed to conduct regular professional development courses to enhance officers' skills.
Immediate implementation
Immediately across all districts and zones of Sindh. The notification also clarifies that no officer can use this policy to demand preferential postings at specific police stations.
This reform is part of IG Sindh Ghulam Nabi Memon's broader efforts to institutionalise meritocracy and curb malpractices within the Police Department.
The move has been welcomed by law enforcement experts, who see it as a step toward restoring public trust in the force.

Bumrah strikes but Duckett and Pope hold firm,"US
Pant scores ton as India dismissed for 471 in first Test
India spearhead Jasprit Bumrah struck an early blow before England's Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope kept the tourists at bay on Saturday to leave the first Test at Headingley intriguingly poised.
At tea on the second day, England were 107-1 in reply to India's first innings 471, a deficit of 364 runs.
Duckett, dropped on 15, was 53 not out and Pope unbeaten on 48 after they had come together at 4-1 when Bumrah dismissed Zak Crawley.
India had been threatening a score in excess of 500 earlier Saturday after Rishabh Pant (134) joined opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and captain Shubman Gill as one of three batsmen to make hundreds in the innings.
But a collapse either side of lunch saw India lose their last seven wickets for 41 runs inside 12 overs.
England captain Ben Stokes led from the front with an economical 4-66 in 20 overs, while fast bowler Josh Tongue wrapped up the innings on his way to 4-86.
Stokes had opted to field first after winning the toss Friday in seemingly ideal conditions for batting.
As a result, his openers now had to face the outstanding Bumrah under grey skies, illuminated by the Headingley floodlights, that favoured the unorthodox fast bowler.
And the last ball of the first over of England's reply saw Bumrah produce a near unplayable delivery that angled in and seamed away to take Crawley's outside edge, with Karun Nair holding a sharp catch at first slip.
England should have been 39-2 when Duckett's thick outside edge off Bumrah flew to backward point only for Ravindra Jadeja, so often superb in the field, to drop a two-handed catch.
Bumrah's opening spell yielded fine figure of 1-21 in five overs.
But with India keen not to over-burden Bumrah following a back injury, he only bowled one more over before tea.
Pope, fresh from his 171 against Zimbabwe last month, survived a delivery from Mohammed Siraj on 34 on umpire's call.
Duckett, meanwhile swept left-arm spinner Jadeja to complete a fifty with his eighth four in 68 balls faced.
India resumed on their overnight 359-3, with Gill 127 not out and Pant unbeaten on 65.
Gill, in his first innings as India skipper since succeeding the retired Rohit Sharma, surpassed his previous highest Test score of 128 with a classic off-drive for four against Chris Woakes.
Pant, by contrast went to a hundred in spectacular style, the wicketkeeper charging down the pitch to Shoaib Bashir before hoisting the off-spinner high over deep midwicket for six despite one hand coming off the bat.
The 27-year-old then celebrated his century with an acrobatic somersault.
Pant's seventh hundred in 44 Tests, and fourth against England, came off 146 balls including 10 fours and four sixes in a typically aggressive innings.
The pair were in complete command until Gill's mistimed pick-up shot off Bashir flew straight to deep square leg as the 25-year-old skipper fell for 147, having faced 227 balls including 19 fours and one six.
Gill's exit ended a partnership of 209 in 49 overs with Pant that had taken India to 430-4 and opened the door for a flurry of wickets to give England hope.
Nair, who six years ago made an unbeaten triple-hundred against England, fell for a duck when brilliantly caught by a diving Pope at extra cover off Stokes.
Pant, having played a succession of extraordinary strokes, was lbw offering no shot to Tongue to end an innings that featured 84 runs in boundaries before the paceman polished off the tail.

Israeli fire kills 8 near aid centres,"US
.
Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli fire killed at least 12 people on Saturday, including eight who had gathered near aid distribution sites in the Palestinian territory suffering severe food shortages.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that three people were killed by gunfire from Israeli forces while waiting to collect aid in the southern Gaza Strip.
In a separate incident, Bassal said five people were killed in a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, where thousands of Palestinians have gathered daily in the hope of receiving food rations.
The Israeli army told AFP it was ""looking into"" both incidents, which according to the civil defence agency occurred near distribution centres run by the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
Its operations began at the end of May -- when Israel eased a total aid blockade that lasted more than two months -- but have been marred by chaotic scenes and neutrality concerns.
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with the foundation over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
The health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said on Saturday that 450 people had been killed and 3,466 others injured while seeking aid in near-daily incidents since late May.
The Israeli blockade imposed in early March amid an impasse in truce negotiations had produced famine-like conditions across Gaza, according to rights groups.
Israel's military has pressed its operations across Gaza more than 20 months since an unprecedented Hamas attack triggered the devastating war, and even as attention has shifted to the war with Iran since June 13.
Bassal told AFP that three people were killed on Saturday in an Israeli air strike on Gaza City in the north, and one more in another strike on the southern city of Khan Yunis.
Israeli forces also demolished more than 10 houses in Gaza City ""by detonating them with explosives"", he added.
Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by rescuers and authorities.
Earlier this week, the UN's World Health Organization warned that Gaza's health system was at a ""breaking point"", pleading for fuel to be allowed into the territory to keep its remaining hospitals running.

Polio: no sign of abating,"US
.
The confirmation of Pakistan's 12th polio case in 2025 — a boy from Bannu just short of his third birthday — marks another grim milestone in a worsening public health crisis. This year's cases, spanning six districts in K-P, four in Sindh, and one each in Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan, reveal a concerning trend. Despite decades of effort, the virus is regaining footholds in large cities, most notably Karachi. While we are still doing better statistically than last year, the only reason is that the 74 cases in 2024 represented a 12-fold surge from 2023, shattering earlier optimism and underscoring systemic vulnerabilities.
Several interrelated crises drive this setback, including operational gaps, misinformation, militancy and security, and border-related issues. Several inaccessible areas in K-P and Balochistan have not seen comprehensive vaccination efforts for several months, and even years, because of security challenges, staff shortages and logistical difficulties. Anti-vaccine propaganda and outright threats from extremist groups further complicate the issue.
Finally, the Afghan border was already a cause for concern for health authorities due to low vaccination rates across the border and among refugees, and security threats. This could worsen significantly if Israel's vicious campaign against Tehran leads to a large number of Iranians fleeing to Pakistan.
The evolving nature of the challenges means there is no single solution for any part of the country. While ongoing vaccination efforts are laudable, creative solutions are required to fill lingering coverage gaps, particularly in high-risk zones where door-to-door campaigns were replaced with site-to-site efforts which, though safer, have been much less effective.
We must also bridge the trust deficit between parents and the government. Political leaders, health bodies and local influencers must unite to dispel myths, ensure the safety of vaccinators and guarantee every dose reaches every child. Polio eradication is still possible within a few years, but only if we act with unprecedented urgency and cohesion.

Paulino pips Naser at Paris Diamond League,"US
The Olympic champion posted a new meeting 400m women's record in 48.81 seconds
Olympic champion Marileidy Paulino outfought Salwa Eid Naser to win the women's 400 metres at the Paris Diamond League meet on Friday, Faith Cherotich won the steeplechase and Grace Stark set a personal best to outgun Tobi Amusan in the 100m hurdles.
Dominican Republic's Paulino needed a season's best time of 48.81, a new meeting record, as the world champion came from behind to pip Bahrain's Naser, who took silver at last year's Olympics.
""All I focused on was to get to through to the finish line feeling strong, although I am not feeling very well, my stomach has been playing up a bit,"" Paulino said.
Kenyan Cherotich took bronze at the Paris Olympics behind Ugandan silver medallist Peruth Chemutai in the 3,000m steeplechase, and the pair left the rest of the field behind early in the race.
This time 20-year-old Cherotich came out on top as she left her rival behind in the closing metres, with a personal best time of 8:53.37, to repeat her wins in Doha and Oslo.
""It's great that I have already won three Diamond Leagues this season being the youngest in the field,"" Cherotich said. ""The big goal are the World Championships in Tokyo and I want to win.""
Nigeria's world record holder and 2022 world champion Amusan had to settle for second place as American 24-year-old Stark led from the start to win the women's 100m hurdles in 12.21 seconds, knocking one tenth of a second off her personal best.
""I wanted to break that 12.3 so bad, I was really pushing for it in Stockholm,"" Stark said. ""I'm just so excited to break 12.3, I really knew I could do it this year.""
In the men's 400m hurdles, Olympic champion Rai Benjamin barely broke sweat in setting a meeting record 46.93, doing enough down the home straight to hold off Qatar's Abderrahman Samba, who had set the previous record back in 2018.
""I just took it easy because we just had a really fast race in Stockholm. There was no need to come out and force something, especially because the season is so long,"" Benjamin said.
Ukrainian Olympic high jump champion Yaroslava Mahuchikh broke the world record with a leap of 2.10 meters at last year's meeting, but she could only manage 1.97 this time to take second place behind Australia's Nicola Olyslagers.

The economy of ignorance,"US
.
The title might sound oxymoronic to the economic practices prevalent in most parts of the world. But it is, although unfamiliar, one of the most lucrative, sought-after and practiced pursuits in societies with a considerable knowledge divide. That is, in societies where obscurantism is systematically maintained, it acts both as a cause and a manifestation of the sustenance of the stakes and estates of the stakeholders.
The opacity, apart from keeping populations from rights enjoyed by their peers in many other social settings, makes them prey to oppressive, coercive and extractive practices. This way, a systematically cultivated ignorant population serves both as a means to greater ends and as an end in itself. This makes ignorance one of the most widely harnessed, though not professed, practices in a society.
The economy of ignorance, a practice as old as the first humans, has thrived and evolved over millennia, often justified through brute force, divine rights over socio-economic and political stakes, slavery, colonialism and their modern manifestations. The 'economy of ignorance' refers to systems or situations where ignorance — whether deliberately fostered or otherwise — creates economic and other related advantages for some at the expense of others. It involves withholding or selectively dictating knowledge, invoking divine perceptions and sentiments, spreading misinformation or structuring systems and social institutions to limit access to realities unfolding around. In this system, ignorance becomes a tool for economic exploitation, allowing those in power to systematically perpetuate and benefit from others' lack of understanding.
Paradoxically, many societies teeter on the cusp where ignorance, not enlightenment, sustains the powerful few to the detriment of the larger population, often operating within a pervasive and ""untaxed"" economy of ignorance.
Pakistan, an economically potent, cognitively vibrant and culturally rich society, exhibits all the characteristics of a dominant socioeconomic system thriving on and built around public ignorance, sustained for decades. This ignorance manifests in the widespread acceptance of ridicule, senselessness and misplaced, cult-like sentimental idealism among individuals and society, as well as its complacent compliance with the forces and actors that have exploited the nation since its inception. Reflect on the number of tombs, seminaries and reputable educational, vocational and research institutes — and the people engaged in each — and you'll stop wondering about the intentions behind the status quo.
This is evident in the exploitation of ethnic and religious sentiments by political leaders and clerics, the entrenched power of tribal and feudal warlords, the flourishing business of parasitic pirs, and a forcibly sustained political culture centred on dynastic, despotic and ill-informed cults. Social influencers populate nearly every street, while absurd content creators, pseudo-intellectuals and pirs earn more than even a PhD by selling hollow services. In this way, much of our economy thrives on ignorance — whether it's the ignorance of policy, of the people, or of the parties — while the people of Pakistan remain perpetually on the receiving end.
We have a wide range of individuals — media-persons, judges, bureaucrats, humanists, rights groups, feminists, musicians, NGO workers, literary figures, civil society activists, etc — who, while advancing their interests, consistently fail the very people they claim to represent. They capitalise on the public's innocence and contribute to the growing mass ignorance. In other words, all saviors — whether authorised or self-proclaimed — carefully, consistently and successfully fail the people and the causes they pretend to serve, yet manage to maintain their relevance.
Beyond the economic dimension, the economy of ignorance also lies at the heart of socio-political and intellectual stakes for its practitioners. The deep and multifaceted stakes of all the so-called saviors and empathisers — both in power and in public spheres — testify to this. Even the knowledge economy — a mere fraction of the country's economic activity — embeds itself in and thrives on ignorance. Doesn't it?

FO assails Amit Shah for 'weaponising water'
Pakistan on Saturday slammed India's Home Minister Amit Shah's ""brazen disregard"" for international agreements after the latter said New Delhi would never restore the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Islamabad.
""We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably,"" Shah said in an interview with Times of India on Saturday.
Responding to Shah's comments, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said they reflected ""a brazen disregard for the sanctity of international agreements"" and noted that the IWT is an apolitical agreement without provisions for unilateral action.
India put into ""abeyance"" its participation in the 1960 treaty, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, after 26 civilians in IIOJK were killed.
""India's illegal announcement to hold the treaty in abeyance constitutes a clear violation of international law, the provisions of the treaty itself, and the fundamental principles governing inter-state relations,"" the Foreign Office stated.
""Such conduct sets a reckless and dangerous precedent — one that undermines the credibility of international agreements and raises serious questions about the reliability and trustworthiness of a state that openly refuses to fulfil its legal obligations.""
The statement added that ""weaponising water for political ends"" is irresponsible and contrary to the behaviour of a responsible state. It demanded that India immediately restore the full implementation of the IWT.
""For its part, Pakistan remains firmly committed to the treaty and will take all necessary measures to protect its legitimate rights and entitlements under it,"" the statement concluded.
The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, have dimmed Islamabad's hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.
Last month, Reuters reported that India plans to dramatically increase the water it draws from a major river that feeds Pakistani farms downstream, as part of retaliatory action.
""No, it will never be restored,"" Shah told The Times of India earlier today. ""We will take water that was flowing to Pakistan to Rajasthan by constructing a canal. Pakistan will be starved of water that it has been getting unjustifiably.""
The latest comments from Shah, the most powerful cabinet minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet, reveal Delhi's intentions as Islamabad hopes for negotiations on the treaty in the near term.

NEV policy to help address air pollution crisis,"US
.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan addressed a high-level Dissemination and Feedback Workshop on Pakistan's National Electric Vehicle (NEV) Policy 2025-30 in Lahore on Saturday.
He highlighted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vision for a clean, smog-free and pollution-free Pakistan, stating that the NEV policy was not just a policy document but a road map for a greener and more sustainable future.
Khan explained that the NEV policy sets a clear target as by 2030, 30% of all new vehicle sales in Pakistan would be electric. This ambitious transition is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 4.5 million tonnes and save approximately 2 billion litres of oil.
He stressed that the move would also help Pakistan to address its growing air pollution crisis and reduce dependence on imported petroleum, which costs the country billions of dollars each year. The policy is also designed to create 15,000 green jobs across the country, contributing to both environmental and economic development.

SEPCO line superintendent stabbed to death,"US
The police was informed that a scissor was used in the attack.
A trader allegedly stabbed a line superintendent of Sukkur Electric Supply Company (SEPCO) to death in a commercial area of Sukkur district.
Slain Faheem Samejo was carrying out recovery of the electricity bills in Mehran Markaz when he was attacked by a shopkeeper, identified as Hasnain Qureshi, after a heated argument.
The fatally wounded Samejo's last video recording after the attack shows blood gushing out from left side of his belly. He can be seen moving on his feet before falling on the ground. Samejo succumbed to the deadly wounds in the Civil Hospital.
His death sparked a strong protest from the officers and staff of SEPCO who suspended power supply of the concerned locality and threatened the authorities of stopping electric supply to entire Sukkur if the killer is not arrested.
According to the B-Section police, the suspect escaped from the town after the incident and the police raids conducted for him arrest came to naught.
A spokesman for SEPCO claimed that Samejo had asked the consumer Qureshi to pay his utility bill but the suspect first hurled abuses and later attacked him with a sharp object. The police was informed that a scissor was used in the attack.
The police have detained a worker of Qureshi's shop.
The incident's FIR could not be registered by the evening.

"Gaza bleeds, humanity fails","US
.
If anyone kills a person, it is as if he has killed all of mankind; and whoever saves a life, it is as if he has saved all of mankind. Qur'an [5:32]

Considering the second line of the above verse, it feels that we, as humans, are also the killers of humanity. In Islam, there is no difference between committing and witnessing cruelty. One becomes an accomplice when he does not take action against the oppressors; hence, he is also called an oppressor if wrongdoing occurs in his presence.
Fifty-seven Muslim countries are not too few to unite for justice. As a Muslim Ummah, it is an obligation to protect humanity from the perspective of justice and rights. Among all Muslim countries, one is bleeding while the rest are watching videos, clips and news about how many have been killed. Yes, it is Gaza. We have been watching and reading news of genocide.
Is it Gaza, or a forgotten piece of land of humanity that absorbs blood like water and plants fingers, hands, feet, and arms, amputated limbs, in the rubble? On humanitarian grounds, this cruelty must be condemned. As human beings, we can play a role by standing with the truth, but today, that truth remains hidden in our hearts — like a sorrowful episode that feels inescapable.
For the past 20 months, Gaza has become an experimental laboratory for shedding blood and killing humanity, a genocide on a large scale, with the death toll surpassing 54,000, including children, men and women. Thousands have been killed, their limbs left lifeless, broken easily by the Israeli military. Now, their only shelter is the earth, and the sky their roof. An acute shortage of basic necessities such as food, shelter and clothing has made survival nearly impossible.
Even serving them with food has faced barriers. Trucks filled with aid have been blocked at the border. According to Tom Fletcher, the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, tons of food is blocked at the border while people are starving in Gaza.
Tragically, women and children have suffered the most in this long and brutal war. Their very survival is threatened by relentless starvation and forced displacement. Due to malnutrition, babies are now being born with abnormalities, and premature births have become common.
UN reports state that one in ten babies is underweight or premature. Miscarriages, stillbirths and abnormalities are increasing rapidly due to a lack of medical supplies — including painkillers and basic hygiene products -— caused by the ongoing blockade. According to the Executive Director of UN Women, Sima Bahous, ""Violence leaves scars not on the body but on the mind. Mental health is not a luxury. It is life-saving."" She adds, ""In Gaza, 75% of women suffer from depression. Girls say they wish they were dead.""
This endless war has snatched away loved ones from these girls and women, many of them killed in bombings or dragged roughly by soldiers, leaving deep scars on their mental and physical health.
""I was torn into a thousand pieces to the extent that I wanted to scream to the whole world, saying: 'Save my daughter from death, save her!'"" says Aya, a victim of Gaza.
Although the war shows no signs of ceasing, real solutions will only come if the superpowers, the UN and the OIC take serious and honest action. Instead, the US continues to defend Israel in the name of regional security, while the situation on the ground tells a different story.
Post-Iran attack, Israel has witnessed retaliatory actions aimed at rebalancing power. Resilient in its response, Iran launched missiles in defence.
Statements alone will never solve the ongoing genocide. True commitment to the cause of Palestine matters now more than ever. To prevent further mental and physical suffering, the Muslim Ummah must assemble and stand firm for Gaza. Now, it must be humanity first.

Chris Brown pleads not guilty,"US
Singer faces trial over 2023 London nightclub assault case
American R&B singer Chris Brown on Friday pleaded not guilty in a UK court to a charge stemming from an alleged London nightclub brawl in 2023, reported AFP.
Brown, 36, in a navy blue three-piece suit and tie and wearing glasses, stood in the dock as the charge was put to him, replying: ""Not guilty, ma'am.""
The singer, who is on £5 million ($6.7 million) bail, made no comment as he arrived earlier to find a large group of photographers gathered outside the central London court.
He spoke only during the hearing to confirm his name and date of birth and enter his plea to the charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent.
He smiled and waved to fans in the public gallery as he left.
A five to seven-day long trial was fixed to start on October 26, 2026.
Currently on the UK leg of an international tour, Brown spent nearly a week in jail last month before being released on bail. Police arrested the star at a five-star hotel in the northwestern city of Manchester hours after reportedly flying in by private jet.
Under the terms of his bail, he will forfeit the £5 million guarantee if he fails to return for court proceedings.
Judge Tony Baumgartner gave him the green light to continue his scheduled tour, which began on June 8 in Amsterdam.
The singer, who had a troubled relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna, is next due to perform in London on Saturday ahead of dates in Manchester, Birmingham, Dublin and Glasgow.
The tour will continue in France and Portugal in early July before a string of concerts in the US, wrapping up in Memphis in the US in October.
Brown is charged in relation to an assault in which the victim was allegedly struck several times with a bottle before being pursued, punched and kicked.
The alleged incident took place at the exclusive private member's club Tape in Hanover Square in London on February 19, 2023 while Brown was touring in the UK.
Grammy winner
Other bail terms include that he should surrender his passport if he is not travelling.
He is also required to live at a specific address known to the court and is not permitted to visit the nightclub where the alleged assault took place or contact the alleged victim, Abraham Diah.
Shortly after being released from prison in May, Brown posted an Instagram story referencing his Breezybowl tour.
""From the cage to the stage. Breezybowl,"" he posted. Akinlolu also entered a not guilty plea to the same charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. Both men are also jointly charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
They will enter pleas to that charge on July 11, the court was told. Brown also faces a third charge of having an offensive weapon, a bottle, in public.
The Grammy-winning singer is known for mid-2000s hits such as Kiss, Kiss.
He rose from a local church choir in Virginia to sudden fame with his rich R&B voice and later rap.
'History of Violence'
In January, Brown filed a $500 million lawsuit against Warner Bros Discovery and producers of the documentary Chris Brown: A History of Violence, accusing them of defamation and knowingly spreading false information about him.
Filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, the lawsuit targetted Warner Bros Discovery and Ample Entertainment, the production company behind the documentary that aired in October. The film chronicled Brown's history of legal troubles and abuse allegations, including a claim by a woman who alleged the singer drugged and assaulted her during a 2020 yacht party reportedly hosted by music mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs.
According to Rolling Stone, Brown claims the documentary presented him as a ""serial rapist and sexual abuser,"" despite no sex-related convictions and evidence that the allegations in question had been discredited. The suit alleges the producers acted ""in pursuit of likes, clicks, downloads and dollars,"" ignoring journalistic standards and promoting ""false information"" despite being provided proof to the contrary.
""To put it simply, this case is about the media putting their own profits over the truth,"" the filing reads. It further asserts that the Jane Doe referenced in the film had previously been ""discredited"" and accused of being an ""aggressor"" in past incidents.
A spokesperson for Warner Bros Discovery responded to the lawsuit, saying: ""We stand behind the production and will vigorously defend ourselves against this lawsuit.""
While the documentary revisits many of these incidents, the lawsuit argues it goes beyond public record and ventures into ""malicious and defamatory territory.""

Himalayan snow at 23-year low,"US
.
Snowfall in Asia's Hindu Kush-Himalayan mountain range has reached a 23-year low, threatening nearly two billion people dependent on snowmelt for water, scientists warned in a report.
The Hindu Kush-Himalayan range, which stretches from Afghanistan to Myanmar, holds the largest reserves of ice and snow outside the Arctic and Antarctica and is a vital source of fresh water for about two billion people.
Researchers found ""a significant decline in seasonal snow across the Hindu Kush Himalaya region, with snow persistence (the time snow remains on the ground) 23.6 percent below normal — the lowest in 23 years,"" the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) said.
""This trend, now in its third consecutive year, threatens water security for nearly two billion people,"" it said in its Snow Update Report. The study also warned of ""potential lower river flows, increased groundwater reliance, and heightened drought risk"".
Sher Muhammad, the lead author of the ICIMOD report, told AFP that ""this year the snowfall started late in January and remained low in the winter season on average"".
Several countries in the region have already issued drought warnings, with upcoming harvests and access to water at risk for populations already facing more frequent heatwaves.
The inter-governmental ICIMOD organisation is made up of member countries Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan.
It urged countries that rely on the 12 major river basins in the region to develop ""improved water management, stronger drought preparedness, better early warning systems, and greater regional cooperation"".

FBR clarifies concerns over tax law amendments,"US
Says changes aim to introduce stricter procedural checks, prevent misuse of authority
As the Finance Bill 2025 undergoes debate in the National Assembly and within business circles, concerns have emerged regarding certain proposed amendments to tax laws. Several reports in the digital and print media suggest a lack of clarity and public understanding surrounding some key provisions.
A particular point of contention involves the proposed changes to arrest powers under tax fraud investigations. Currently, Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 provides legal grounds for arrest in such cases, along with safeguards, such as immediate intimation to a Special Judge and mandatory court appearance within 24 hours.
The proposed amendment, however, introduces stricter procedural checks. It requires a prior inquiry and written approval from the Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR) before any investigation is initiated.
Only after the CIR's authorisation can an investigation officer — vested with the powers of an officer in charge under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 — proceed with an arrest. Even then, the officer must have reasonable grounds to believe that tax fraud has occurred. If an arrest is found to be mala fide, the case will be referred to the Chief Commissioner for a fact-finding inquiry.
These new provisions mark a shift from the previous framework, where an Assistant CIR could authorise arrests. The amendments are being positioned as a move towards greater transparency and procedural fairness.
In a recent press statement, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has maintained that these measures aim to strike a balance — reassuring compliant taxpayers while ensuring that tax evaders face strict legal consequences.

"Inflation, rupee dip lift FBR taxes","US
Revenue up in 5 years against 18% in previous decade; questions remain on sustainability
Owing to massive inflation-driven increases in nominal collections, sharp currency depreciation, and a greater reliance on indirect taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has achieved its annual revenue growth rise from an average of 18% over the past decade to 24% in the recent five years.
The FBR has demonstrated a remarkable acceleration in tax collection growth over the past five years, surpassing the average pace observed over the preceding decade. Data from the FBR, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Research reveals that annual revenue growth averaged 24% during this period, significantly higher than the 10-year average of 18%.
""The rise in FBR's annual revenue growth, from an average of 18% over the past decade to 24% in the recent five years, reflects a mix of policy adjustments and economic factors,"" noted AHL. ""The higher growth is partly attributed to inflation-driven increases in nominal collections, currency depreciation, and a greater reliance on indirect taxes.""
This upward trend illustrates both nominal tax collections and growth rates, with the former rising from Rs3.11 trillion in the base year, fiscal year 2016, to Rs14.13 trillion in the most recent year — reflecting a strong compound growth trajectory. Notably, growth rates peaked at 35% in certain years before moderating, highlighting the recent surge in tax mobilisation.
Several factors have driven this performance. Inflation and currency depreciation played a central role, inflating nominal tax collections, especially on goods and services subject to ad valorem taxes. The weakening rupee also raised the local currency value of import-based taxes, a key revenue source.
On the policy front, the withdrawal of tax exemptions under International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes expanded the taxable base, while the government's reliance on indirect taxes — such as sales tax and customs duties — further fuelled collection growth, though it raised equity concerns. Administrative reforms, including efforts to document the informal economy, digitise tax filings, and curb evasion, also contributed to improved compliance and revenue outcomes.
Despite this strong showing, questions remain over the sustainability of such growth. Much of the recent gains are rooted in inflationary effects and indirect taxation — factors that may not sustain momentum without deeper structural reforms. Reliance on import-based taxes leaves revenues vulnerable to external shocks or a decline in trade volumes, while over-dependence on indirect taxes disproportionately burdens lower-income groups, underscoring the need for a more balanced and equitable tax policy.
Looking ahead, the FBR's continued progress will depend on its ability to broaden the tax base by formalising untapped sectors, shift towards more stable revenue streams such as direct taxes, and enhance transparency to build public trust and voluntary compliance. While the recent growth trajectory signals a positive departure from past trends, its translation into lasting fiscal strength will ultimately hinge on the government's commitment to comprehensive and sustained reforms amid evolving economic challenges.

Heavy downpours wreak havoc in Dir,"CN
Child killed, infrastructure inundated
Torrential rains battered Upper Dir on Saturday, causing infrastructure damage and claiming a child's life.
Heavy downpour lashed on the areas of Kohistan in Upper Dir, including Jahaz Banda, Lamoti, Badgoi, and Jandri, triggering flash floods in streams and the Kohistan River.
The intense rainfall swept away at least three key bridges in Jahaz Banda, Lamoti, Jandri and nearby areas, severing road links and isolating local communities.
Residents resorted to road repairs on a self-help basis amid the destruction.
Several houses, fertile farmlands, and link roads were washed away in the floods. Kumrat Road was also inundated at various points, leaving scores of tourists stranded. Long queues of vehicles were seen along damaged sections of the route.
Floodwaters entered Patraak Bazaar, inundating shops and homes, causing substantial losses to both residents and traders. Multiple hydropower units were also swept away, resulting in power outages in several areas. Crops and fruit orchards were severely affected by the cloudburst.
Dir Bala Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Fayaz along with local police reached the affected areas and launched relief and recovery operations.
Speaking to the media, he said temporary restoration of roads and bridges will be ensured as soon as possible to facilitate movement and aid.
It is pertinent to mention that National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an impact-based advisory warning of an intense heatwave from June 18 to 22, urging the public to take precautionary measures to minimise health risks.
The heatwave is expected to severely affect parts of southern Punjab, Sindh, eastern Balochistan, and southern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, according to the advisory issued by NDMA's National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) on Wednesday.
""High-pressure systems in the upper atmosphere are likely to persist, leading to extreme temperatures, particularly in Jacobabad, Dadu, Larkana, Sukkur, Khairpur and Nawabshah,"" the advisory stated. Daytime temperatures are forecast to soar between 46°C and 48°C.
In Punjab, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Rajanpur are likely to be hit hard, while Sibi, Nasirabad, Dera Murad Jamali, and Jaffarabad in Balochistan, and Tank, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan in KP will also experience extreme heat.
The public has been advised to avoid unnecessary outdoor activity, especially between 11am and 4pm, wear light-coloured and loose-fitting clothing, and stay hydrated.
""Do not leave children or the elderly unattended in parked vehicles,"" the advisory added, stressing the importance of checking on vulnerable individuals.
The NDMA is monitoring the situation closely and is coordinating with relevant provincial and local authorities. Citizens have been encouraged to follow updates from the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), NDMA, and local disaster management authorities.
Any emergencies should be reported to local helplines or Provincial Disaster Management Authority control rooms.

"Sanam, Mohib announce birth of their first baby","US
Couple breaks news on IG weeks after son's arrival
Actors Sanam Saeed and Mohib Mirza have announced the birth of their first child, a baby boy named Vali Hasan Mirza. While the couple shared the news in a joint Instagram post on Friday, the celebratory post reveals that Vali was born on May 18.
In the caption, Sanam wrote: ""Our hearts are full. With love, wonder, and the tiniest little fingers — we welcome our son Vali Hasan Mirza into the world surrounded by love. All that is by the will of Allah — there is no power except through Him. Please keep our little one in your prayers.""
This joyous milestone follows years of quiet companionship between the actors. While rumours of a relationship circulated for some time, the couple confirmed their marriage in early 2023 during an appearance on a cricket talk show hosted by Fahad Mustafa. Later, on The Knock Knock Show, Mohib revealed that his feelings for Sanam began while filming the TV series Deedan in 2016. At the time, he was still married to actor Aamina Sheikh, with whom he shares a daughter. The two divorced in 2019. Before Mohib, Sanam was married to her childhood friend, Farhan Hasan, before the couple parted ways.
Just weeks before Vali's birth, Sanam posted a heartfelt Mother's Day tribute to her own mother, announcing her pregnancy: ""I'll be one very soon Inshallah. I pray I'm every bit like her and more. My saviour, my protector, my role model.""
Sanam has spoken candidly about her relationship with Mohib on various occasions, calling her decision to marry at 35 the best one she ever made. ""I was more sure of myself, more grounded, and more emotionally mature,"" she said in a 2024 interview. The actor pointed out that societal perceptions often discourage marriage after a certain age, especially for women. ""Yes, 35 is considered an older age for marriage, but that doesn't mean if someone has failed in their first marriage or hasn't married by this age, they shouldn't marry at all,"" she added.
Ever the doting husband, Mohib has reciprocated this praise by gushing about Sanam's character. ""She is one of the most focused and diligent actors I've ever worked with. She inspires me,"" he shared in an interview earlier this year. ""You won't know a more balanced person.""

"In Hunza Valley, a small revolution among women","US
.
In a sawdust-filled workshop nestled in the Karakoram Mountains, a team of women carpenters chisel away at cabinets — and forge an unlikely career for themselves in Pakistan.
Women make up just a fraction of Pakistan's formal workforce. But in a collection of villages sprinkled along the old Silk Road between China and Afghanistan, a group of women-led businesses is defying expectations.
""We have 22 employees and have trained around 100 women,"" said Bibi Amina, who launched her carpentry workshop in 2008 at the age of 30.
Hunza Valley's population of around 50,000 is spread across mountains abounding with apricot, cherry, walnut and mulberry orchards.
The Aga Khan opened a girls' school in Hunza in 1946, kickstarting an educational investment that pushed the valley's literacy rate to 97 percent for both men and women. That rate far outstrips the country average of around 68 percent for men and 52.8 percent for women.
As a result, attitudes have shifted, and women like Amina are taking expanded roles. ""People thought women were there to wash dishes and do laundry,"" Amina said of the generation before her.
Trained by the Aga Khan Foundation to help renovate the ancient Altit Fort, Amina later used her skills to start her own business. Her carpenters are currently at work on a commission from a luxury hotel.
Cafe owner Lal Shehzadi spearheaded women's restaurant entrepreneurship in Hunza. She opened her cafe at the top of a winding high street to supplement her husband's small army pension.
Sixteen years later, her simple set-up overlooking the valley has become a popular night-time tourist attraction. She serves visitors traditional cuisine, including yak meat, apricot oil and rich mountain cheese.
""At the start, I used to work alone,"" she said. ""Now, 11 people work here and most of them are women. And my children are also working here.""
Following in Shehzadi's footsteps, Safina quit her job to start her own restaurant around a decade ago. ""No one wanted to help me,"" she said. Eventually, she convinced family members to sell two cows and a few goats for the money she needed to launch her business.
Now, she earns the equivalent of around $170 a month, more than 15 times her previous income.
The socio-economic progress of women in Hunza compared to other rural areas of Pakistan has been driven by three factors, according to Sultan Madan, the head of the Karakoram Area Development Organisation and a local historian.
""The main reason is the very high literacy rate,"" he told AFP, largely crediting the Aga Khan Foundation for funding training programmes for women.
""Secondly, agriculture was the backbone of the economy in the region, but in Hunza the landholding was meagre and that was why women had to work in other sectors.""

Belarus frees jailed opposition leader after appeal from US,"US
.
Belarus freed top opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky and more than a dozen other political prisoners Saturday following an appeal from the White House, Minsk said, a sign of warming ties between Washington and Belarus-ally Moscow.
The release came just hours after US special envoy Keith Kellogg met Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk, the highest-profile visit of a US official to the authoritarian state in years.
Tikhanovsky's wife Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who took the mantle of the opposition movement after her husband's jailing, thanked US President Donald Trump directly for brokering the deal.
European politicians and members of Belarus's exiled opposition also welcomed the news.
The European Union hailed Tikhanovsky's release as a ""symbol of hope"" and a leading activist called it an ""important moment"".
Tikhanovsky, 46, had been imprisoned for more than five years.
The popular Youtuber had planned to run against Lukashenko in the August 2020 presidential election, but was arrested and detained weeks before the vote.
He was sentenced in 2021 to 18 years in prison for ""organising riots"" and ""inciting hatred"", then to another 18 months for ""insubordination"".
Svetlana — a political novice at the time of her husband's arrest — ran against Lukashenko in his place but lost after what the opposition described as widespread falsification. She later fled Belarus.

Two suspects killed in encounters,"US
CCD officials had taken the suspect to the Hayer area for recovery operations
The Crime Control Department (CCD) reported the deaths of two suspects in police encounters in different areas of the city.
A police spokesman said both suspects were killed by gunfire from their own accomplices during confrontations with law enforcement.
The first encounter took place in the Hayer area, where suspect Waqas Masih was killed.
CCD officials had taken the suspect to the Hayer area for recovery operations when his accomplices opened fire on the police party. In the ensuing gunfight, the suspect in custody was fatally struck by bullets, allegedly fired by his own associates.
Police sources indicate that Waqas Masih was involved in multiple serious criminal cases. The second encounter occurred in the Sherakot area, where Ali Raza, identified as the ringleader of a dangerous dacoit gang, was killed during a police operation.
According to CCD records, Ali Raza was wanted by police across Punjab, including Lahore, for more than 80 serious crimes.
The deceased suspect's criminal activities reportedly included vehicle snatching, theft, robbery, and burglary operations throughout the province.
Meanwhile, Shahdara police have arrested a man accused of fatally stabbing his cousin over a domestic dispute. Police said the arrested suspect, identified as Abu Huraira, allegedly stabbed his cousin in the chest with a dagger during a family altercation.

Taxman gets arrest powers,"US
Taxman gets arrest powers
A National Assembly panel on Saturday approved special powers for tax authorities to arrest individuals involved in tax fraud, while it deferred the approval of another fiscal law that would have suddenly deprived government entities of their cash surpluses.
Meanwhile, teachers and researchers will now be subject to full income tax, as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) did not agree to the government's proposal to extend the 25% income tax rebate for another fiscal year.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Langrial informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that the IMF had refused to extend the rebate.
The committee, chaired by Syed Naveed Qamar, approved legal powers for the FBR to arrest taxpayers involved in tax fraud without prior court approval.
However, additional safeguards were added to limit the discretionary use of these powers.
At one point, Qamar remarked that the tax fraud ""law has been borrowed from the National Accountability Bureau"".
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance had already cleared the controversial proposal. Now, following minor amendments by the National Assembly panel, the bill is expected to become law from July 1.
Tax fraud has been defined as: ""knowingly, intentionally or dishonestly doing any act or abets any action to cause loss of tax under this Act, including: using or preparing false, forged and fictitious documents including return, statements, annexures and invoices; false claim of input tax credit based on fictitious transactions; issuance of any tax invoice without supply of goods; tampering with or destroying of any material evidence or documents required to be maintained; generating fake input through manipulation of return filing system of the Board and making fake entries in the sales tax returns or in the annexures; and making fictitious compliance of section 73, including routing of payments back to the registered person, or for the benefit of the registered person, through a bank account held by a supplier or a purported supplier.""
Upon committing any of the above offences, the FBR will have the authority to arrest the individual without first seeking a warrant from any court of law.
FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial said the criminality of tax fraud has been divided into two parts. In some cases, court permission will be required before an arrest is made.
He explained that crimes such as suppression of taxable supplies under the Sales Tax Act, suppression or nonpayment of withholding tax for more than three months, dealing in goods liable to confiscation and making taxable supplies without registration will require court approval for arrest.
According to the proposal, an Inland Revenue officer not below the rank of assistant commissioner – or any officer authorised by the board – may initiate an inquiry upon approval from the commissioner, if there is material evidence pointing to the commission of tax fraud or an offence warranting prosecution under the act.
The inquiry officer shall have the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including summoning and enforcing attendance of any person, examining on oath, requiring discovery and production of documents and receiving evidence on affidavits.
The inquiry officer must complete the inquiry within six months. During proceedings, the officer must provide the accused with a chance to be heard and confront them with details of the alleged fraud.
A final report will then be submitted to the commissioner, who may either approve a full investigation, request further details, or close the matter.
Upon approval, the investigation must be completed within three months. The board may authorise a commissioner — through a three-member committee notified by the chairman — to issue an arrest warrant if the tax loss exceeds Rs50 million.
Arrests will only be made if the accused fails to respond to three notices, attempts to flee, or is likely to tamper with evidence.
When asked, Langrial said the accused can also be arrested at the airport if there is suspicion of an escape attempt.
Cash surplus
The standing committee held an extended discussion on a government proposal to assert full rights over the cash surpluses held by state-owned enterprises.
The proposed amendment to the Public Finance Management Act aimed to grant the federal government control over these surpluses.
""The federal government's budget deficit would never end, and it now wants to bankrupt the public sector companies,"" Syed Naveed Qamar said.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb argued that the companies were acting like ""states within a state"" and were not cooperating.
He added that even government-nominated board members were not being heeded, blaming bureaucrats for the lack of progress.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Kayani withdrew the bill from the agenda, saying the government would reintroduce it after incorporating the committee's recommendations to strike a balance between fiscal discipline and autonomy.
One major state-owned company was reported to be sitting on a cash surplus of Rs253 billion.

'Arribada' vanishes from shores,"PK
Globally, Olive Ridley turtles are known for their synchronized nesting behaviour
The rare and awe-inspiring natural event known as arribada-a synchronized mass nesting of Olive Ridley sea turtles-has vanished from Pakistani shores, experts say. Once a common sight along the country's coastline, this unique species has not been recorded nesting in Pakistan since 2001.
Arribada, a Spanish word, meaning 'arrival', refers to a remarkable phenomenon where thousands of female Olive Ridley turtles come ashore to lay eggs. This event occurs at select beaches across the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, and is considered one of nature's most spectacular events.
According to marine experts, five of the seven known species of sea turtles used to frequent Pakistani waters until the 1970s. However, in the following decades, only two species-the Green Turtle and the Olive Ridley-continued visiting the region. Now, only Green Turtles remain.
Olive Ridley turtles, the smallest and most abundant species of sea turtles globally, are known for their olive-green shells and preference for warm tropical waters. Despite their adaptability, they have mysteriously disappeared from Pakistani beaches over the past two decades.
Experts believe both environmental and human-induced factors may be responsible for their disappearance.
According to Moazzam Khan, Technical Advisor to WWF Pakistan, climate change could be a significant contributor to the disappearance of Olive Ridleys from the country's coastline.
However, Dr. Babar Hussain, Natural Resource Management Coordinator at IUCN Pakistan, points to a more immediate cause-the Tasman Spirit oil spill that occurred off the coast of Karachi in 2003. ""This incident had a devastating impact on marine biodiversity,"" he said. ""Since the spill, no Olive Ridley turtles have been sighted along our shores.""
Globally, Olive Ridley turtles are known for their synchronized nesting behaviour. During arribada, hundreds of female turtles come ashore in moonlit hours to dig nests in the sand, each laying between 100 and 120 eggs. Once the eggs are laid and buried, the females return to the sea. After 45 to 60 days, hatchlings emerge and instinctively crawl toward the ocean.
These mass nesting events are observed in countries like Mexico, Costa Rica, and India. For instance, La Escobilla beach in Mexico hosts up to 450,000 nests annually, while Costa Rica's beaches receive nearly 600,000 female turtles during the breeding season. In India, Odisha's Gahirmatha and Rushikulya beaches are world-famous arribada sites.
Despite confirmed Olive Ridley migration routes near Pakistan, the country has not seen a nesting event in over two decades. Experts stress that this ecological loss is not just a scientific concern but also a missed opportunity for promoting eco-tourism. ""The arribada is not only a spectacle of nature's coordination but also a reminder of how delicately balanced marine ecosystems are,"" said Moazzam Khan.

Pak hockey in severe crisis yet again,"US
Rs 1b annually required for hockey to prosper: Mujahid
Pakistan hockey has once again plunged into a severe financial crisis. The national hockey team, which participated in the final of the FIH Nations Cup scheduled in Malaysia, has been struggling for daily expenses for several days. The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) was supposed to pay each player Rs. 30,000 per day for ten days, but so far, no player has received this compensation.
Not only the players, but also the coaching staff and officials have been deprived of their daily allowances. This situation impacted the players' morale during the FIH Nations Cup final against New Zealand, where the Green Shirts suffered a heavy 6-2 defeat.
According to sources, players have been paying for their food and personal needs out of their own pockets, which has led to considerable frustration. Some players even had to seek financial help from their families to meet basic necessities.
Unfortunately, this situation is not new for Pakistan hockey. In recent years, the national team has missed several international events due to financial constraints.
Earlier this year, non-participation in the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup, also held in Malaysia, was largely due to unpaid dues. Likewise, the daily allowance of Rs. 20,000 for the 2024 Asian Hockey Champions Trophy held in China was not paid on time, leading to players expressing strong dissatisfaction.
Hockey players have questioned why millions are spent on cricket leagues in the country while their modest compensation is not paid on time.
PHF Secretary General Rana Mujahid Ali, commenting on the dire situation, stated that the federation immediately needs Rs. 60-70 million to cover players' dues, daily allowances, and administrative costs. He noted that participation in such an international tournament incurs a minimum expense of Rs. 15 million, yet the required funds are not provided.
According to the PHF Secretary, if the Government of Pakistan allocates Rs. 1 billion annually to hockey, the team can regain its lost glory.

Govt scrambles for oil backup plans
Amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has warned oil marketing companies (OMCs) to maintain a minimum of 20 days of oil stock in accordance with licensing requirements.
The prime minister has already constituted a high-level committee to explore alternative options in the wake of the Iran-Israel conflict to pre-empt any potential oil shortages in the country.
Oil Marketing Companies are obligated to maintain 20-day oil reserves under their licensing terms. Ogra has previously issued directives to this effect and has now reiterated its warning, stating that companies failing to comply will face penalties and fines.
In a statement, the Ogra spokesperson said, ""The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has confirmed that the country currently holds sufficient stocks of petroleum products to meet existing demand"".
However, in light of future needs and the volatile market environment, Ogra has formally advised all OMCs to adhere strictly to the mandatory 20-day stock levels, as stipulated in their respective licences.
""OGRA remains committed to monitoring the situation closely and will continue to take proactive steps to ensure national energy security,"" the spokesperson added.
In response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel's recent attack on Iran and the resulting fluctuations in global oil markets, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif constituted a high-level committee to oversee petroleum pricing and supply dynamics.
The committee is headed by the finance minister and includes senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory bodies and energy sector experts. It has already held its first meeting and is scheduled to reconvene early next week to assess possible supply routes and contingency measures.
During its initial meeting, the committee explored alternative oil supply routes from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), including pipeline transport, in case the Strait of Hormuz – a critical global oil supply route – is blocked due to escalating hostilities.
The committee was informed that Saudi Arabia possesses an existing pipeline network, including the East-West Pipeline (Petroline), which transports crude from its eastern province to the Red Sea port of Yanbu.
Similarly, the UAE's Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline (Adcop) to Fujairah is designed to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, ensuring uninterrupted exports.
The Petroleum Division, in a submitted report, stated that the Strait of Hormuz handles 20% of global crude oil exports.
Any closure of this route by Iran could severely impact global supply chains, including Pakistan's. Under a worst-case scenario, global oil prices could surge to $100$150 per barrel.
While there is currently no immediate threat of a spike in prices, Pakistan is in discussions with international oil suppliers to ensure continuity of supply.
At present, the country has access to up to one million tons of furnace oil storage capacity through abandoned power plants.
Experts have recommended that the government utilise these facilities to store strategic oil reserves. It has also been proposed that the government purchase these storages, as the power sector plans to dispose of them as scrap.

Ex-teacher held for 'grave' crime,"CN
Dozen booked for illegally exhuming body and relocating it to build a shrine
Gujar Khan police have booked about a dozen people for digging up a grave, desecrating the grave and the corpse and shifting the body to another grave in the Changa Meera area, arresting the principle accused.
The grave was dug up in the darkness of night, the body was exhumed and reburied elsewhere.
According to the First Information Report (FIR), an elderly man named Muhammad Ashfaq, who passed away on March 3, was buried in the Changa Meera graveyard.
Complainant Kamran Sajid, a relative of the deceased, reported to police that he was at his home in Mauza Pindi when he received a call from a person named Muhammad Nazir.
Nazir informed him that during the night, unknown individuals had exhumed the body of his father-in-law's brother, Muhammad Ashfaq, from his grave and relocated it elsewhere.
Upon reaching the graveyard, the complainant confirmed the body was missing. Locals informed him that individuals named Hanif Hanfi, Akhtar, Imran, and 10 unknown accomplices had participated in the act and reburied the body approximately 100 meters away.
Prior to the incident, the suspect Hanif had reportedly announced in the mosque his intention to establish a shrine (dargah) for Muhammad Ashfaq, who was considered a saint in the area.
According to the complainant, the deceased was a humble and spiritual person and was not associated with such practices.
Police responded promptly, collected evidence, and registered a case under Section 297 of the Pakistan Penal Code (pertaining to the desecration of graves).
'Main suspect held'
Saddar SP Nabeel Khokhar confirmed that the main suspect, Hanif Hanfi, has been arrested, and efforts are ongoing to locate the other accused.
The suspect's intention was allegedly to establish a shrine at the site of the new grave. With the consent of the family and approval from the court, the body was reburied in its original grave, he added. The SP further said that raids are being conducted to arrest the remaining suspects, who will be brought to justice soon.
Meanwhile, the scope of the investigation had been expanded and during the inquiry, it was revealed that the prime suspect, Hanif Hanfi, is a former schoolteacher who prefers to be addressed as ""Master.""
He has a passion for poetry and has even authored a book. A resident of Changa Meera village, Hanfi has been living at a local shrine instead of his family home due to alleged domestic disputes.
Meanwhile, police are conducting raids to apprehend the remaining suspects, who have gone into hiding.

"K-P budget to be approved only after Imran's nod, says CM's aide","CN
Barrister Dr Saif says  people voted for vision of Patron-in-Chief so all decisions should reflect public mandate
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister's Advisor on Information Barrister Dr Saif has said that the provincial budget will not be approved without consultation with Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan.
He noted that people voted for the vision of the Patron-in-Chief therefore all key decisions, including the budget, should reflect the public mandate.
Speaking to the media, Dr Saif warned that people would not tolerate any disrespect to their democratic mandate. He further cautioned that any attempt to impose an emergency in the province would be short-lived, adding, ""A fake government will not survive even a day.""
The advisor clarified that the authority to dissolve the provincial assembly rested with the Chief Minister, who could exercise it at his discretion.
K-P is the only province where a genuine government has been formed based on Form 45. In contrast, the federal and other provincial governments rely on Form 47 - which is based on a ""false foundation"" and can be toppled with the slightest push, said the K-P CM aide.
He reiterated that the people of K-P voted for the ideology of Imran Khan thus all significant decisions must be made in consultation with him.
He urged the federal government to refrain from ""petty tactics"".
He accused the federal government of relentlessly trying to undermine the K-P government, adding that the people of the province were being punished for supporting the Patron-in-Chief.
""Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is a vital unit of the federation, and weakening it is tantamount to weakening Pakistan itself,"" said Saif.
He warned that any conspiracy against the province would have serious repercussions.
Under the vision of the Patron-in-Chief and the leadership of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, the province is witnessing rapid development, which is hard to digest by the federal government.
He termed K-P a stronghold of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), adding the movement for the release of the Patron-in-Chief will gain full momentum from the province.
He alleged that false cases had been registered to confine the Patron-in-Chief, but assured that all such fabricated cases would soon be dismissed.

Heatwave brings life to standstill,"US
Citizens lament tree cutting in Multan
With temperatures soaring to 45 degrees Celsius, life in Multan has nearly come to a standstill.
The intense heatwave has left residents anxious and exhausted, as most areas remain deserted during the day. Residents are avoiding unnecessary travel, while markets and other public places witness visibly low footfall.
The citizens are not only battling extreme heat, but also persistent power outages. Several parts of the city continue to face unscheduled load-shedding, adding to their misery. With high electricity tariffs, even those who have air conditioners or refrigerators are forced to limit their usage.
Residents complain that rising heat is no longer a seasonal issue, but a result of poor urban planning and environmental neglect. The city has seen a drastic decline in its green cover in recent years.
Trees, once a natural defence against heat, are now alarmingly few. The authorities have failed to give attention to plantation and preservation of existing trees.
What concerns environmentalists and locals alike is the unregulated cutting of mango orchards around the city. These orchards, once a signature of Multan's identity and a vital source of shade, are rapidly vanishing due to unchecked development and urban sprawl.
A local resident, Salman, urged the government to take immediate steps to stop the destruction of green assets.

President says skill development vital,"PL
Urges equipping every household with learning tools
President Asif Ali Zardari formally launched the Benazir Hunarmand Programme at a ceremony held at Aiwan-e-Sadr on Saturday.
Speaking on the occasion, the president underscored the importance of education and skill development, stating that every household should be equipped with the tools of learning and education.
He said that BISP was based on the philosophy of Zulfikar Bhutto Shaheed whose legacy was carried forward by Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, who believed in inclusive prosperity and education for all.
""We are determined to realize her vision for the uplift of marginalized segments of society,"" the president said.
First Lady Aseefa Bhutto Zardari was also present at the launch of the programme. Highlighting the importance of the Benazir Hunarmand Programme, President Zardari noted that skills development was crucial not only for national progress but also for preparing a skilled workforce to meet the growing demand in international markets.
""We should equip our youth with modern technical skills needed globally,"" he remarked.
He particularly stressed the significance of the nursing profession, calling it one of the most sought-after fields internationally, and urged that special priority should be given to training in this area.
President Zardari also underlined the importance of learning foreign languages alongside modern skills to enable our youth to get jobs in foreign markets.
Referring to his previous tenure, the President recalled that he had launched the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), which became a cornerstone of social protection in Pakistan.
He expressed gratitude to former Finance Minister Naveed Qamar, acknowledging his valuable role in the launch and implementation of BISP.
He said, ""Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) will be improved further and more programmes will be added.""
The President said that the Benazir Hunarmand Programme is a continuation of that legacy, aimed at uplifting communities through empowerment and opportunity.
He reiterated his resolve to ensure that the youth of Pakistan are provided with the skills, education, and opportunities necessary to build a prosperous country.

EU cracks down on pet cruelty with new law,"US
Microchipping, mutilation bans among new rules
Compulsory microchips as well as bans on ear-cropping and tail-docking are among a set of new rules to protect cats and dogs that European lawmakers approved Thursday.
The European Union is home to more than 72 million dogs and 83 million cats, according to the European Commission, which so far has only regulated health requirements for them related to travel within the bloc.
But an uptick in trafficking pushed the EU to propose a set of common rules for breeding, housing and handling the animals, whose sales generate an estimated 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) annually.
The European Parliament in Strasbourg voted on a text put forward by the commission in 2023, which introduces minimum welfare criteria for dogs and cats in kennels and shelters.
Lawmakers also voted to ban the keeping or selling of dogs and cats in pet shops, a provision not included in the original text, meaning buyers would have to buy them directly from breeders or kennels.
""With this proposal, we would create the first-ever minimum rules, giving member states the possibility to go beyond these standards,"" said the text's rapporteur, Veronika Vrecionova of the hard-right ECR group.
Approved with 457 votes in favour and 17 against, the bill says all dogs and cats should be identified with a subcutaneous microchip when they are sold - a system already in use in some member states - and registered in an EU database.
That would increase traceability and tackle illegal traffic, predominantly of dogs, with animal protection groups singling out eastern EU countries like Romania and Bulgaria.
Painful mutilations, like cutting tails or ears, will also be banned in most cases, as will electric, choke and spiked collars without safety stoppers.
The law also prohibits inbreeding and the breeding of animals with accentuated traits, such as overly short legs, that could affect their welfare.
The measures enjoyed broad consensus among political groups but the extent of their application had been the cause of contention, leading to some amendments.
An exception for breeders keeping a small number of animals, which had upset some on the left, was weakened by parliament, which lowered the threshold for breeders to qualify.
Yet other exemptions opposed by animal rights activists remained.
The ban on mutilations, for example, is less stringent for hunting dogs. Similarly, coercive collars will still be allowed to train police, military and border patrol dogs.

Vondrousova ousts top seed Sabalenka,"US
The Czech player finished the job in an hour and 20 minutes to reach Berlin Open final
Marketa Vondrousova powered past world number one Aryna Sabalenka 6-2 6-4 at the Berlin Open on Saturday to book a place in her first final since she won Wimbledon in 2023.
Czech Vondrousova controlled the tempo from the outset with big serving on the grass as she wrapped up the win in one hour and 20 minutes.
She broke the Belarusian twice in the first set while saving both break points she faced.
The second set saw the players trade early breaks and Sabalenka saved two break points to stay in touch at 3-2, before the match settled into a rhythm at 4-4. Sabalenka, who saved four match points against Elena Rybakina on Friday, could not repeat that escape as Vondrousova broke for 5-4 and served it out on her first match point with an ace.
""I feel like on grass you have to take risks, you know, and that was the point; I was like, okay, let's try. The match would continue otherwise, so you have to go for it. I was feeling really well today so, yeah, I'm just very happy,"" Vondrousova said.
""I didn't play for a long time, so I'm just so happy to be back healthy and so grateful to play these matches. When I saw the field, I was like, okay, let's try to win the first round, and now this is happening. So thank you guys for the support.""
While Sabalenka struggled to find consistency, racking up 30 unforced errors, Vondrousova stayed measured and composed throughout, limiting her own tally to 12.
Despite previous wins over Sabalenka, this was Vondrousova's first career victory against a reigning number one.
Currently ranked 164, the Czech has battled injuries since July 2024 and entered Berlin unseeded after missing three months this season with a shoulder injury.
Vondrousova will play qualifier Wang Xinyu in Sunday's final, after the Chinese player beat Russian Liudmila Samsonova 6-4 6-1 in an hour and 15 minutes to reach the first final of her career. After securing the first break of the match, Wang built up a 5-2 lead before Samsonova hit back to narrow the gap.
But Wang held firm, converting her fourth set point to break again and close out the set. Wang dominated the second set, breaking for 3-1 and saving two break points to hold for 4-1. She broke again for 5-1 on her fourth chance and calmly served out the match. The 23-year-old Wang, ranked 49th in the world, has enjoyed a breakout week in the German capital, beating second seed Coco Gauff in the round of 16. ""This week has been a dream for me. I've been playing unbelievable tennis here. I don't know, it's something with Berlin I guess,"" Wang said. ""Coming to every match here, I wasn't expecting anything, you know. For me, it was really just to enjoy the stage... We're always saying that (you should) celebrate before the final because if you lose that, you don't celebrate anything for this incredible week.""

Water disaster in making,"US
.
India's obsession to settle scores with Pakistan is going over the board. It seems to be completely unmindful of international commitments as well as norms of diplomacy and neighbourhood. Home Minister Amit Shah's threat not to restore the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Islamabad, and continue to divert the water flowing to Pakistan to other Indian states is a step beyond foolishness, and speaks of the BJP coterie's tendency of playing to the gallery.
Such suspension is not possible under the nomenclature of the World Bank and global conventions for a lower riparian state. Delhi is also trying to influence nature by forcefully diverting the surplus flow from the three western rivers of the Indus water system, and by mulling construction of a 113km long canal on its pathway.
Pakistan is already suffering from water stress since India has taken this bizarre unilateral step. Islamabad's call to talk it out in the backdrop of the recent four-day war has fallen on deaf ears. The stand-off, nonetheless, has also attracted some domestic interplay as Omar Abdullah, Occupied Jammu & Kashmir Chief Minister, has vented his anger over the flawed strategy of diverting water from his state, while it is in the midst of a drought. This row is, sooner than later, going to become an intra-state ordeal, mounting a climatic catastrophe in the region. To what extent is Delhi willing to go with the tide of anger and invite disaster on its own riverine system as well as hydropower installations is anybody's guess.
As for Pakistan, it seeks a dialogue with India so as to discuss all irritants in bilateralism. That is why it was receptive to the mediation brokered by US President Donald Trump, and is willing to nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize too in recognition of his diplomatic strides. The only way ahead for India is to desist from escalating the situation and resort to logic in the water domain. The flimsy conception of holding back water from the glaciers for long in its north is an assured precursor to disaster.

Lehecka stuns Draper to reach Queen's final,"US
He blasted 36 winners and hit 16 aces in the semifinal to seal the win
Czech world number 30 Jiri Lehecka stunned Britain's Jack Draper to reach the Queen's Club final with a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 victory on Saturday.
Lehecka blasted 36 winners and hit 16 aces to end Draper's bid for a maiden final appearance at the Wimbledon warm-up event in west London.
The 23-year-old will face French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz or Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in Sunday's final.
""It means a lot. You don't meet a player like Jack every day, he's an amazing competitor,"" Lehecka said.
""It's not easy to use my serve (on grass) but I've been working on it for the last few weeks. I'm happy with it.""
Draper was hoping to become the first British singles champion at Queen's since five-time winner Andy Murray's most recent victory in 2016.
After booking his spot in the semi-finals Draper revealed he had held the Queen's trophy as a child around 12 years ago.
But Draper, ranked sixth in the world, will have to wait at least another year to get his hands back on the silverware after producing an unusually error-strewn display in sweltering conditions.
Lehecka had already ended the hopes of one Briton at Queen's after beating Jacob Fearnley in the quarter-finals on Friday.
The 23-year-old also defeated world number 12 Alex de Minaur in his opening match of the tournament, but knocking out Draper was his biggest scalp yet.
Draper's careless double-fault gifted Lehecka a break in the opening game of the first set.
The ice-cool Lehecka ignored the searing temperatures as he cruised through the rest of the set.
Draper needed to apply pressure on Lehecka to get back in the match and he did exactly that in the fourth game of the second set.
Even then, Lehecka staved off four break points and repelled another in the sixth.
But Draper kept slugging away from the baseline and finally landed a big blow with a winner down the line on set point.
Rock legend and avid tennis fan Jon Bon Jovi, watching in the stands, rose from his seat to salute Draper's gritty fightback. AFP

Why China and Russia will not enter Iran-Israel war,"PK
.
The escalating war between Israel and Iran is currently being led by two main developments that may eventually determine how this war might end. The first development is that President Trump has announced that he is giving Iran two weeks to reconsider its position before the US may take a final decision to enter the war on Israel's side. The second development is that the Iranian foreign minister is traveling to Geneva to meet the foreign ministers of European countries, as the two sides explore the possibility of finding a diplomatic solution to the problem before the US weighs its options to join the war.
Interestingly, there is also an increased debate on the subject of whether, at some stage of this ongoing conflict, the other two great powers, China and Russia, may join this war. In case they don't, it is assumed that the world will once again turn to a unipolar moment with the US acting as the de facto global hegemon. I tend to disagree with this assessment and try to justify my claim based on pure, realistic logic.
The Israeli military strikes on Iran, despite the ongoing process of negotiations between the US and Iran, once again proved the realist assumption that in the anarchic structure of the international system, states cannot be certain about each other's intentions and must continue to acquire capabilities to maintain balance of power to protect themselves. That the weak states are taken advantage of was proved in how China bore a century of humiliation from 1840 to 1940, where the Europeans and the Japanese took advantage of its weakness and vulnerability.
The same happened with Russia, which, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, became weak and vulnerable, and NATO expanded eastwards and included its former republics as member states. This disregard for Russian security by the US and its allies only happened because Russia was weak. As President Putin reoccupied the office of Russian President in 2012, Russia started contesting NATO's eastward encroachment. Russia grew powerful, became the regional hegemon and started protecting its sphere of influence.
The realist logic is based on state survival first; and to survive, great powers must continue to acquire power, enhance their capabilities and safeguard their interests at all costs. And that's what Russia did. The US never allowed Europeans to interfere in its sphere of influence in the western hemisphere, and there should be no doubt that both China and Russia go by the same strategic and realist logic and would not want outside interference in their sphere of influence.
The US premise of viewing Russia and China as posing geopolitical threats to the world is a premise based on wrong assumptions. There was a time that the US indulged in exporting liberal hegemony in the world with disregard to the power politics and the concept of balance of power, as the other two great powers, Russia and China, were weak.
The US and its western allies were able to expand NATO eastwards only because of this slack in the international system of the time. If the US decision of NATO expansion seemed rational at that time, then from the Russian perspective, Russia's decision to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO under the changed international environment of multipolarity may also be considered rational.
Professor Mearsheimer, famous realist scholar, professes the theory that all states are rational. But he also states that theories are simplifications of realities, and realities are complicated. Theories are utilised to navigate the world; and sometimes, depending on the prevailing international conditions and environment, theories may prove wrong. If in the unipolar moment the eastward expansion of NATO was a rational decision based on the realist theory of power maximisation then the Russian decision to fight war in Ukraine in the changed international environment may also be considered as a rational decision by a state acting on the realist logic of state survival and power maximisation.
To answer the question of why China or Russia will not directly participate or join the war, even if the US intervenes in the war on behalf of Israel, is also based on realist logic. If the US intervenes in this war, it will not be able to fully pivot towards the Asia-Pacific to contain China. So, from the Chinese point of view, the involvement of the US and its allies in the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East may go on forever, as that would prevent the US from deploying its assets against China to contain it.
Russia also has no interest in dominating Eastern Europe or the whole of Europe. It did that when it was the Soviet Union and had the military capability with hundreds of deployed combat divisions in Eastern European countries. Today, Russia doesn't have that capability. So, the US and Western premise of portraying Russia and China as global threats is a myth.
The US and China are two powers fueled by two different ideologies. The US ideology of liberal internationalism is on the wane as democracies all over the world are receding and autocracy, authoritarianism and nationalism are dominating the world politics. China's rise is based on the Confucian ideology of peaceful rise. But over time, China's economic capability is giving rise to its military capability based on the pure realistic logic of survival in an anarchic system.
The US also took the same route in becoming the most powerful state. The classic security dilemma guides the US-China relationship in which the rise of a great power instills fear in the mind of the existing power, thus creating global concern and fear of war.
Great powers never fight directly with each other. During the long bipolar period many proxy wars were fought, but the US and the Soviet Union never fought a direct war with each other. Great powers will continue to engage in security competition like both the Soviet Union and the US did during the Cold War, but to imagine that they will ever directly engage in a hot war is a wrong assumption.
Lastly, both the Korean War and the Vietnam War proved costly for the US, as even without directly participating in the war, the Soviet Union and China ensured that the US was not able to achieve its political objectives in these wars. Iran can rest assured that Russia and China, without directly participating in the war, will ensure that its sovereignty and territorial integrity are respected. Iran will pay a cost in engaging in this war, but it will not be the regime change or discontinuity of uranium enrichment for its civil nuclear energy.

CM vows plantation on 50k acres,"CN
1.375 million trees to be sown on forest wasteland in Punjab
The Punjab government plans to plant 42 million trees on 50,869 acres under the Chief Minister Plant for Pakistan Initiative.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif said in a statement highlighting key features of the initiative on Saturday that the provincial budget reflected her government's eco-friendly vision, with landmark steps launched under the Punjab Green Programme to combat climate change and promote sustainable development.
She added that 1.375 million trees were being planted on 3,790 acres of forest wasteland under the CM Agroforestry Initiative.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz highlighted, ""Large-scale tree plantation and environmental projects are being launched under the Punjab Green Programme.""
She said the scope of the Green Pakistan Programme had been expanded and plantation of 466.463 million trees on 251,000 acres was being pursued.
She added, ""Plantation of five million trees in rows on 10,223 miles in the canal area of Punjab has been initiated.""
She underscored, ""Provision of world-class facilities for the promotion of eco-tourism in Lal Suhanra National Park and Salt Range are being ensured.""
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said, ""A wireless network, digital cameras, GPS devices and CCTV cameras are being provided for eco-tourism."" She added, ""Construction of an eco-friendly certified multi-storey building has been started to establish a protected nature area, where modern facilities have been provided for the staff.""
She also announced a Shielding Summits Programme for disaster prevention in the mountains of Murree and Kahuta with the recruitment of 600 fire watchers, provision of fire vehicles and watch towers.
The Chief Minister said, ""Restoration of forest tracks and construction of tanks for springwater are also part of the project.""
She added that a GIS-based protection system had been introduced for immediate detection of fire and encroachment with drone and satellite technology.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said, ""A digital communication cell has been established, modern monitoring equipment and additional staff are being provided to the Monitoring and Evaluation Wing of the Forest Department.""
She added, ""Digital tree enumeration in rows and a GIS-based survey have been started in Punjab.""
The chief minister said, ""Modern machinery has been purchased for forestry work. The process of plantation and forestry operations has been accelerated.""
She pointed out, ""Establishment of 104 Forest Command and Control Centres for 24-hour monitoring across the province is significantly increasing the capacity for forest protection.""
Meanwhile, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Punjab government have agreed for financial cooperation for establishing an environment protection observatory, use of modern agricultural machinery and launching an advanced public transport system.
Senior Provincial Minister Marruyum Aurangzeb held a meeting with an ADB delegation regarding key initiatives. The meeting featured a detailed discussion on a 'New Country Partnership Strategy' for Pakistan.
Both sides exchanged views on Pakistan's strategic growth challenges and deliberated on promoting a transparent development process, boosting exports and investments, establishing a modern trade system, and ensuring efficient and transparent utilisation of public capital.
The senior minister said the provincial budget includes record-breaking projects focused on health, education, skill development and overall improvement in public life. A cardiac hospital is being established in Sargodha, while the Nawaz Sharif Cancer Hospital is being set up in Lahore. She said new public health schemes included Clinic on Wheels, specialised mother and child health centres, and the establishment of new outpatient departments (OPDs).
She emphasiwed that comprehensive steps were being taken to introduce technology in sectors such as agriculture, industry, fisheries, dams and IT. For the first time, a Socio-Economic Registry is being developed to accurately assess public needs and base planning on realistic foundations.
She said historic initiatives had been introduced in Punjab for environmental protection, with practical measures under way to make every sector eco-friendly. The introduction of electric buses is helping to reduce pollution sources, while the establishment of the environmental observatory will enable effective monitoring of climate changes.
The ADB delegation offered full support for a modern, green and prosperous future of the province.

In sync with Samina,"PL
Veteran actor reflects on art, pain, and purpose
""I had to return everyone's money. I ended up in the hospital. Four days in a coma."" That's how Samina Peerzada described the cost of her artistic vision during a recent appearance on Mazaaq Raat with host Imran Ashraf. While discussing her directorial debut Inteha (1999), Samina reflected on what a bittersweet experience it had been.
The star wasn't just the director of the film; she also produced and co-wrote it. ""I made that film with love. It was a super-duper film,"" she exclaimed. ""I put everything into it, but I didn't get my money back. That's why I returned to acting.""
Discussing the behind-the-scenes politics, she reaffirmed that there is little support in the industry when ""educated people"" try to make films. Recounting a major betrayal she experienced while producing Inteha, she shared, ""The betrayal came from someone I trusted — he used to call me his sister. I became so depressed that I ended up in a hospital and fell into a coma for four days.""
Inteha was ahead of its time. The film tells the story of Sara (played by Resham), an upper-class, educated young woman in a relationship with her university boyfriend (Zeeshan Sikandar), who is forced into a feudal marriage with her cousin Zafar (Humayun Saeed). The film broke cultural taboos by addressing marital rape, domestic violence, and feudal oppression. It sparked intense debate, prompting both government bans and parliamentary discussions, before eventually returning to screens in cities like Karachi, thanks to Samina's relentless efforts. The film ultimately earned critical acclaim.
Foray into horror
Speaking about her recent horror film Deemak, starring Faysal Quraishi, Samina emphasised its emotional depth: ""I had never done this genre before. This type of cinema was completely new for me. But when I read the story, it was full of emotional layers. It said something deep. That's why I did it."" She explained how the film follows the lives of ordinary people and takes unexpected turns. ""It beautifully portrays the consequences of wrongdoing and how sometimes one person's sin is paid for by generations to come. That layering of meaning moved me.""
The horror themes of Deemak even seemed to spill into her real life. Samina recalled an eerie incident while shooting: ""I went to turn off the lights in my garden and as I walked back, I swear someone pushed me so hard that I flew across the garden. My knees were scraped, I had injuries on my back, my shoulders, and even my face. And yet, I had to go to the shoot, bandaged and bruised.""
Even for someone as seasoned as the veteran actor, some scenes in Deemak proved tough. ""There were scenes that genuinely scared me. I thought it wouldn't be that hard, but it really was."" Her husband, Usman Peerzada, encouraged her by saying, ""What could be hard for you?""
On love and violence
Reminiscing about her relationship with Usman, she recounted their romantic courtship. ""He was performing in a play. I was young and full of opinions, so I immediately criticised one of his performances."" Samina recalled that on their second meeting he brought her flowers that he had picked himself. Touched by this gesture she decided to make things official. ""On our second meeting, I proposed. I said, 'If you're interested, great. If not, take your flowers and leave.'"" That was the beginning of a 50-year-long successful marriage.
When asked what kept their love alive, she said, ""He never disappointed me. The way he cared for my mother, my sisters, my family, that made space in my heart."" Speaking about her own efforts, she added, ""I stood by him too. When he wanted to make Nazdeekiyan, I became the producer."" Samina recounted that even though she was terrified of fish, she shot a fish tray commercial with a big smile, just to help fund costumes for Nazdeekiyan.
Despite her storybook romance, the actor warned viewers not to get swept away by idealism. When asked about unrequited love, she said, ""It happens to people, but its outcome is rarely good. Thinking about what recently happened to that girl breaks my heart so much, I can't even express it.""
Samina was referring to the tragic killing of 17-year-old TikTok creator Sana Yousaf, who was fatally shot at her home in Islamabad's G-13 sector on June 2 just hours after her birthday celebration. The alleged killer, Umar Hayat, reportedly acted out of rage after repeated romantic rejections. The case sparked nationwide outrage and protests, with figures like Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari condemning the act and stressing the need to protect young women from violence rooted in entitlement and misogyny.
Ashraf echoed Samina's sentiment, repeating, ""No means no!"" as they discussed how one-sided love can curdle into cruelty. However, they also acknowledged that things do not have to take such a dark turn. If people know how to regulate their emotions and take their rejections gracefully, they turn into poets, writers and artists.
He continued to praise Samina throughout the show, calling her a monumental force in the entertainment industry. Talking about her own chat show Rewind with Samina Peerzada, Ashraf noted, ""It's not just hosting. It's like you step into people's hearts through their eyes. You understand what someone's thinking or feeling. What is your secret?""
In her poetic way, Samina responded, ""It's all a matter of rhythm."" She compared conversation to music, saying one must listen carefully to sense its rhythm before leading it. ""When the rhythm is right, the conversation lands on the sam (the first beat in classical music). But if you're bey-taal (offbeat), then nothing works.""

Pakistan to recommend Trump for Nobel Peace Prize,"DK
.
Pakistan said on Saturday it would recommend US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, an accolade that he has said he craves, for his work in helping to resolve the recent conflict between Pakistan and India.
Some analysts in Pakistan said the move might persuade Trump to think again about potentially joining Israel in striking Iran's nuclear facilities. Pakistan has condemned Israel's action as a violation of international law and a threat to regional stability.
Pakistan agrees that US diplomatic intervention ended the fighting, but India says it was a bilateral agreement between the two militaries.
""President Trump demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi, which de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation,"" Pakistan said.
""This intervention stands as a testament to his role as a genuine peacemaker.""
Governments can nominate people for the Nobel Peace Prize. There was no immediate response from Washington. A spokesperson for the Indian government did not respond to a request for comment.
Trump has repeatedly said that he's willing to mediate between Pakistan and India over the disputed Kashmir region, their main source of enmity.
In a social media post on Friday, Trump gave a long list of conflicts he said he had resolved, including India and Pakistan and the Abraham accords in his first term between Israel and some Muslim-majority countries.
He added: ""I won't get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do.""
Mushahid Hussain, a former chair of the Senate Defence Committee in Pakistan's parliament, suggested nominating Trump for the peace prize was justified. ""Trump is good for Pakistan,"" he said. ""If this panders to Trump's ego, so be it. All the European leaders have been sucking up to him big time.""
But the move was not universally applauded in Pakistan, where Trump's support for Israel's war in Gaza has inflamed passions.

Jail staffer booked for 'raping' child,"US
Police say incident took place at suspect's house in Adiala Jail's residential colony
Saddar Beroni police have registered a case against a man, reportedly a jail employee, for allegedly raping his 11-year-old paternal niece. The case was registered on the intervention of Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Khalid Hamdani.
The young girl had been staying at the house of the suspect identified as Irfan at the Adiala Jail's residential colony for four days. The suspect had been taken into custody, and investigations are ongoing.
The victim's father complained to the police that his daughter had gone to stay at her paternal uncle Irfan's house four days prior. When she returned home, she complained of stomach pain to her mother.
Upon taking her to a lady doctor, they were informed that the girl had been sexually assaulted, which was causing her persistent bleeding.
The victim's father requested an official medical examination for his daughter and legal action against the perpetrator based on the findings.
Police sources claimed that the suspect is a jail employee and resides in the Adiala Jail's housing colony.
According to the police, the person in custody is indeed the victim's paternal uncle and is currently being interrogated. The medical process for the victim has also been initiated.
Saddar SP Nabeel Khokhar said that the investigation would focus on establishing the facts of the case while interrogating the person in custody.

NICVD boss dismisses corruption charges,"CN
Says public health facility undergoes govt as well as private audit
Professor Tahir Saghir, Executive Director of the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), has denied allegations of financial irregularities, claiming that the institute operates with full transparency and a commitment to public service.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Prof. Saghir said that the NICVD provides free treatment to over 2,000 patients daily, including 35-40 emergency angioplasties, alongside 1,000-1,200 emergency cases and 800-1,000 OPD visits. ""This is a high-volume centre, and our teams work day and night to serve patients,"" he added.
About corruption charges, Prof Saghir clarified that the NICVD undergoes both government and private audits annually. While audit objections are routine, he said that all queries are responded to with detailed explanations.
He highlighted procurement reforms, saying that previously only 20-30% of medical supplies were acquired through tenders, whereas now over 90% of purchases are processed via the Sindh Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (SPPRA) digital system, minimising human intervention. ""This data is also shared with international bodies, including the IMF,"" he added.
Refuting a human rights report alleging Rs40 billion in corruption, Prof Saghir pointed out that the NICVD's total annual budget is only Rs9 billion. ""Where did the extra Rs31 billion come from?

He cited Sindh government recognition of the institute's performance, which led to an increased budget after NICVD saved Rs1 billion last year, followed by an additional Rs2 billion allocation.
Prof Saghir provided an example of emergency decision-making, explaining that when the main A/C unit in the emergency ward failed, the administration hired temporary cooling systems for Rs200,000-250,000 to ensure patient comfort, bypassing lengthy tender procedures.

Textile industry for adopting proposals,"US
Voices concern over imposition of both minimum and advance tax on exporters
Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMA) and Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) have jointly urged the government to consider and implement the textile industry's key budget proposals through the Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) budget anomaly committee.
The demand came during a post-budget meeting of both associations, which was attended by PHMA Chairman Abdul Hameed, former PHMA chairmen Naseer Butt and Shehzad Azam Khan, PRGMEA Chairman Dr Ayyazuddin and former PRGMEA chairmen Ijaz Khokhar and Sohail Afzal Sheikh.
Meeting participants stressed that the government must not only examine industry recommendations through the anomaly committee but also implement the committee's final report once compiled.
PHMA Chairman Abdul Hameed pointed out that Pakistan's value-added textile, apparel, bed wear, home textile and towel sectors contribute over $11 billion in annual exports and provide livelihoods to millions. He expressed concern over the replacement of the simplified Final Tax Regime (FTR) with the more complex Normal Tax Regime (NTR), which now subjects exporters to both 1% minimum tax and 1% advance tax on export proceeds, regardless of the actual profit.
Former PHMA chairman Naseer Butt, while speaking at the meeting, said that dual taxation was counterproductive for an already distressed export sector. He warned that many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) were operating on thin margins and may be forced to close down if the policy was not reversed immediately.
Shehzad Azam Khan, also a former PHMA chairman, highlighted the issues of refund delays, rising production costs and inflation. He stressed that exporters were burdened with more taxes than their earnings and demanded that the government urgently facilitate timely refunds and ensure stable energy pricing.
PRGMEA Chairman Dr Ayyazuddin, in his remarks, raised concerns over changes to the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS), particularly the removal of zero-rating on local purchases and the imposition of sales tax on imported cotton yarn. He emphasised that these changes undermine the very objective of the EFS, which was introduced to reduce liquidity pressure and digitise export procedures.
Ex-PRGMEA chairman Ijaz Khokhar said that Pakistan's regional competitors like Bangladesh and Vietnam provide tax-free access to raw material for exporters, giving them an edge in international markets. He called for restoring the original EFS framework under SRO 957(I)/2021.

Dar says Israeli aggression threatens regional stability,"CN
Iran threatens 'more devastating' response to Israel's attacks
Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has emphasised the urgent need for unity among Muslim nations to confront growing challenges facing the Ummah.
Addressing the 51st session of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers in Istanbul, the deputy prime minister strongly condemned Israel's recent attacks on Iran, calling them a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter.
He warned that the rising tensions in the Middle East, fueled by Israeli aggression, pose a serious threat to regional peace and stability.
Calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza, the foreign minister denounced the ongoing genocide of Palestinians, highlighting the tragic loss of thousands of innocent lives, including women and children.
""The time has come for the Muslim Ummah to unite,"" Dar stressed. ""The OIC is expected to play a decisive and leading role in addressing these critical issues.""
He also raised serious concerns over India's actions in the region, accusing New Delhi of weaponizing water resources against Pakistan. ""Blocking Pakistan's water is tantamount to declaring war,"" he asserted.
Dar reiterated Pakistan's call for the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions. He condemned Indian aggression and said that India had targeted innocent Pakistani civilians. In response, Pakistan exercised its right to self-defense, he added.
Highlighting the growing issue of Islamophobia, the deputy prime minister called for collective action by the Muslim world to counter rising anti-Islam sentiment globally.
He also extended his gratitude to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the Turkish leadership for their warm hospitality during the conference.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Western leaders of providing ""unconditional support"" to Israel.
A trenchant critic of Israel's actions in both Gaza and Iran, Erdogan called for ""high-level peace talks"" between Tehran and the United States, according to his office, adding that Turkey was ready to play a ""facilitator"" role to help bring an end to the war.
Erdogan, who met Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi on the sidelines of Saturday's meeting, said Turkey would not allow borders in the Middle East to be redrawn ""in blood"".
""It is vital for us to show more solidarity to end Israel's banditry — not only in Palestine but also in Syria, in Lebanon and in Iran,"" he told the OIC's 57 member countries.
According to Qatar's foreign ministry, Araghchi also met the Gulf state's top diplomat in Istanbul, who said he was working to bring the sides ""back to the path of dialogue"".
Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian warned of a ""more devastating"" retaliation should Israel's nine-day bombing campaign continue, saying the Islamic republic would not halt its nuclear programme ""under any circumstances"".
Israel said on Saturday it had killed three more Iranian commanders in its unprecedented offensive, while Foreign Minister Gideon Saar claimed the campaign had delayed Tehran's alleged progress towards a nuclear weapon by two years.
""We will do everything that we can do there in order to remove this threat,"" Saar told the German newspaper Bild, asserting Israel would keep up its onslaught.
Israel and Iran have traded wave after wave of devastating strikes since Israel launched its aerial campaign on June 13, saying Tehran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies seeking an atomic bomb, and on Saturday Pezeshkian said its right to pursue a civilian nuclear programme ""cannot be taken away... by threats or war"".
In a phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Pezeshkian said Iran was ""ready to discuss and cooperate to build confidence in the field of peaceful nuclear activities"".
""However, we do not agree to reduce nuclear activities to zero under any circumstances,"" he added, according to Iran's official IRNA news agency.
Referring to the Israeli attacks, he said: ""Our response to the continued aggression of the Zionist regime will be more devastating.""
Israel's military earlier said that a strike in Qom, south of Tehran, killed Saeed Izadi, a top Revolutionary Guards official in charge of coordination with Hamas. Two other commanders were killed overnight, it added.
Israel said it had also attacked Iran's Isfahan nuclear site for a second time, with the UN nuclear watchdog later reporting that a centrifuge manufacturing workshop had been hit.
Top diplomats from Britain, France and Germany met Araghchi in Geneva on Friday and urged him to resume nuclear talks with the United States that had been derailed by the war.
But Araghchi told NBC News that ""we're not prepared to negotiate with them (the Americans) anymore, as long as the aggression continues"".
Trump, dismissive of European diplomatic efforts, said he was unlikely to ask Israel to stop its attacks to get Iran back to the table.
""If somebody's winning, it's a little bit harder to do,"" he said of Israel's campaign.
Any US involvement would likely feature powerful bunker-busting bombs that no other country possesses to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility in Fordo.

EU seeks 'digital sovereignty',"US

At a market stall in Berlin run by charity Topio, volunteers help people who want to purge their phones of the influence of US tech firms. Since Donald Trump's inauguration, the queue for their services has grown.
Interest in European-based digital services has jumped in recent months, data from digital market intelligence company Similarweb shows. More people are looking for e-mail, messaging and even search providers outside the United States.
The first months of Trump's second presidency have shaken some Europeans' confidence in their long-time ally, after he signalled his country would step back from its role in Europe's security and then launched a trade war.
""It's about the concentration of power in US firms,"" said Topio's founder Michael Wirths, as his colleague installed on a customer's phone a version of the Android operating system without hooks into the Google ecosystem.

College excluded from PSDP,"US
Mir Younas berated the provincial government for neglecting a project of educational importance.
Leader of the Opposition in Balochistan Assembly Mir Younas Aziz Zehri staged a walkout from the house in a protest over exclusion of Jhalawan Medical College from Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
In an address before leaving the session, Mir Younas berated the provincial government for neglecting a project of educational importance.
""Despite consistently raising this issue, no corrective measures have been taken. The project director remains in-charge, even though he is clearly unqualified,"" alleged Zehri, citing mismanagement and inefficiency in the college's administration.
Former Chief Minister and National Party leader Dr Malik Baloch echoed these concerns, warning that continued funding lapses and administrative failings could draw the attention of the Pakistan Medical Council (PMC).
""If PMC takes notice, the college's accreditation could be at risk — threatening the future of hundreds of medical students,"" he cautioned.
In response, Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti assured to review the decision.

Govt urged to rethink new taxes,"US
E-commerce strategists warn Finance Bill 2025 could halt formalisation
E-commerce and chain store strategists have demanded the government rationalise the proposed taxes on online and registered businesses in order to maintain the pace of documentation in the retail sector and promote financial inclusion in the economy.
They urged the government to refrain from burdening taxpayers with additional taxes and duties to encourage the formalisation of retail and online businesses, which will promote the generation of long-term and sustainable dividends for the economy.
They also called on the government to pause the immediate enforcement of these policies, and instead initiate a structured dialogue with stakeholders to co-create pragmatic and growth-friendly tax policies.
Pakistan E-Commerce Association (PEA) Karachi Chapter President Shoaib Bhatti said that the proposed tax measures in the financial bill will severely risk the e-commerce sector, disrupting both established and small businesses by imposing an excessive compliance burden all at once.
He urged the government to avoid imposing the additional 2% withholding sales tax on e-commerce and retail sectors, which are already paying 18% general sales taxes. In comparison, informal retail segments in major shopping centres and bazaars are not paying taxes at all, he said.
Pakistan's e-commerce sector has grown over 35% annually in the past five years, with over 100,000 small online sellers active as of today, supporting the incomes of over a million people nationwide, added Bhatti.
Increasing the tax burden on this segment, he said, will be tantamount to slowing down its growth and contribution to the national economy.
According to estimates, the total market size of the e-commerce sector is estimated to be Rs2.2 trillion ($7.7 billion), which is still under 2% of the national GDP and up to 4% of the retail segment.
Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP) Chairman Hasan Javed remarked that the new tax will create an imbalance between documented and undocumented retail and online segments, as one pays an overall 20% GST and the second one will pay merely 2%, hence promoting a cash economy.
""Established online and chain stores are already paying 15-16% provincial taxes to the government, and an additional 5% federal levy will increase their cost of doing business. Therefore, we appeal to the provincial government to reduce the tax rate at their end,"" he remarked.
The proposed tax measures place heavier obligations on e-commerce than on the traditional retail and wholesale sectors. Rather than encouraging formalisation, these measures could push businesses back into informality — or out of operation entirely, he said.
The Finance Bill introduces multiple taxes and complex procedures across all related businesses, with no stakeholder consultation or phased rollout, which could adversely hit the sector.
What's more, a number of e-commerce stores shut down in the past two years due to tough competition among players and higher logistics and operating costs.
Saad Shah, CEO Ucaaz, said established e-commerce and chain stores have been highly regulated with tax compliances and equipped with payment systems, however, increasing the burden of tax and levies on these stores will not be favourable for them.
He pointed out that various online and chain stores not only offer high-quality branded products to customers, but also offer them handsome discounts on products due to their efficient business models which attract footfall and generate tax revenues for the government, unlike grocery shops in major retail and wholesale markets in big cities.
The e-commerce sector is developing a growing and inclusive ecosystem that also generates jobs for the youth, and provides entrepreneurial and investment opportunities for the masses. Disrupting this sector will ultimately hurt all stakeholders, stated Shah.
