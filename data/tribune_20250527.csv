Iran rejects temporary halt on uranium enrichment,"US
.
Iran will not consider temporarily suspending uranium enrichment to secure a nuclear deal with the US, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Monday, adding that no date had yet been set for a sixth round of talks with Washington.
The negotiations between Washington and Tehran aim to resolve a decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear ambitions, and both sides have taken a tough stance in public over the issue of Iran's uranium enrichment.
Asked about reports that Iran could freeze enrichment for three years to reach an agreement, spokesperson Esmail Baghaei told a press conference: ""Iran will never accept that.""
Baghaei also ruled out the possibility of an interim nuclear deal with the US, dismissing media reports that a provisional agreement was being considered as a temporary step towards a final deal.
President Donald Trump said on Sunday that US negotiators had ""very good"" talks with an Iranian delegation over the weekend. Iran is waiting for further details from mediator Oman regarding the timing of the next round of talks, Baghaei said.
""If there is goodwill from the American side, we are also optimistic, but if talks are aimed at curbing Iran's rights then talks will get nowhere,"" he added.

"I won't accept slavery, says Imran","PK
Aleema said her brother sent across three key points during their meeting.
Amid swirling whispers of backroom bargains and quid pro quo compromises, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan has doubled down, declaring he would rather ""rot in jail for life"" than kneel before what he denounced as ""a system of Pharaohs and Yazidiyat"".
The former prime minister urged his party to brace for a sweeping nationwide movement.
""Whatever torture they inflict, I will never accept slavery,"" Imran Khan conveyed from Adiala Jail through his sister Aleema Khan, who spoke to reporters on Monday.
""Even if they keep me in jail for life, I will not surrender,"" Imran told his sister, adding that the party should now prepare for a nationwide movement rather than concentrating on Islamabad.
Aleema said her brother sent across three key points during their meeting. ""He has not been given even the basic rights entitled to an ordinary prisoner. In the last eight months, he has been allowed to speak to his children only once.""
""We sisters are not allowed to meet him, and even the books we try to send are withheld by the jail administration,"" Aleema lamented.
She further alleged that Imran's personal doctors were not being allowed to examine him and that court orders on contempt petitions were being flouted. ""Bushra Bibi has been jailed to pressure him. But even then, he said: 'I will not bend.'""
Aleema also criticised vloggers and YouTubers who claim that a deal has been struck for Imran's release.
""Now we understand these are planted stories to cool down public sentiment. They say Americans have arrived and a deal is done, but all of it is just to manage public expectations.""
Imran's message to his party, according to Aleema, was clear, asserting that the PTI was a party of ideology, not selectable.
""Young people other than the founder are also in jail. We received votes for our ideology, not personalities. Anyone not aligned with this ideology has no place in the party. Those playing on both sides of the wicket are also not welcome.""
She added that Imran was visibly angry when he said: ""Time has changed. Just look at the judiciary. The Al-Qadir case hasn't been fixed for a hearing in three months. Other cases related to May 9 and bail are also pending. Judges promised hearings, but didn't deliver.""
'Imran to be released before Eid'
On the other hand, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed optimism that the incarcerated party supremo might be released before the upcoming Eid-ul-Azha.
Speaking to journalists outside the Islamabad High Court (IHC) alongside Senator Shibli Faraz, Gohar urged party workers to remain calm, saying all legal avenues were being exhausted.
""We are making every effort for his release. We've held protests, raised the issue in Parliament, and approached the courts,"" he said. ""Workers have every right to raise questions, and we value their emotions. No one can fathom how and why Imran Khan has spent two years behind bars.""
According to Gohar, Imran remains steadfast in faith. ""He says we turn to Allah in hardship, and He will show us the way.""
He noted the party's patience was being tested. ""Our people are tired, and even judges are tired of writing judgments. We are doing our best to ensure Imran Khan's cases are fixed and decided on merit.""
Senator Shibli Faraz added that the acting chief justice of the IHC had personally assured Barristers Gohar and Latif Khosa that Imran Khan's petitions would be scheduled for hearing this week. ""This wasn't just any assurance. It came from the acting chief justice himself, and we take it seriously.""
He warned that blocking access to justice leads to instability. ""People approach courts for justice. If denied, it leads to injustice and unrest. We believe in the Constitution and will continue to press for justice.""
""The 26th Constitutional Amendment was the handiwork of PPP and PML-N. They've already destroyed their politics. Once Imran is free, their governments will fall,"" Faraz added.
Court allows photogrammetric, polygraph tests
In a related development in Lahore, an anti-terrorism court granted permission to police to conduct photogrammetric and polygraph tests of the PTI founder once again.
The court accepted the prosecution's request, directing that results be submitted by June 9.
Earlier, DSP Legal Javed informed the court that investigations could not proceed without these tests. Imran Khan refused the tests twice in writing, and a third time verbally.
""We assure the court that we will cooperate, and justice will not only be done but seen to be done.""

Property dealer shot dead over dispute,"US
Eyewitnesses claimed that the victim was seated between the suspects on their motorcycle
Armed suspects shot and killed a man in Zaman Town, Korangi, on Monday, before fleeing.
The deceased was shifted to Jinnah Hospital for medico-legal formalities, while police reached the spot. The deceased was identified as 45-year-old Noor Muhammad Farooqi, a property dealer and contractor.
Eyewitnesses claimed that the victim was seated between the suspects on their motorcycle, when one of them told the victim to run, before opening fire. The victim managed to reach the alley despite being injured, however, the accused returned, shot the victim again, then fled.
Police recovered four 9mm pistol shells from the scene, and have launched a manhunt for the accused. Initial investigation suggests the shooting was due to personal enmity or a grudge.
Citizen guns down fleeing 'mugger'
A citizen opened fire on bandits on Shaheed-e-Millat Road, killing one. The bandits had reportedly looted citizens before attempting to flee on a bike, when a citizen, having witnessed the crime opened fire from behind. A 26-year-old was fatally shot, while his two accomplices fled the scene.

HEC's Morocco conference draws fire amid varsity funding crisis,"US
Public varsities face salary delays while HEC urges foreign travel on taxpayers money
Despite Pakistan's worsening financial crisis and growing fiscal deficits in public universities, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) continues to approve lavish expenditures using public funds. In its latest move, the HEC has issued letters to vice-chancellors and rectors of public sector universities across the country, inviting them to attend a conference in Rabat, Morocco - at the expense of their own university budgets.
Organised by the HEC itself, the conference is scheduled for the last week of June in Morocco's capital. The commission has asked interested vice-chancellors to confirm their participation and contact HEC Islamabad by May 28. However, the travel costs are to be covered by university funds - which primarily originate from taxpayer money and student fees.
Public universities in all four provinces receive funding from the federal government via the HEC, while institutions in Sindh are additionally supported by the provincial government with several billion rupees annually. Yet, under Sindh government policy, if a university head travels abroad, the leave notification typically clarifies that expenses must not be paid by the university or the government.
In this case, however, the HEC's letter explicitly places the financial responsibility of the Morocco trip on universities themselves. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the HEC will cover the travel expenses of a few high-ranking officials from its own budget.
This development comes as multiple universities are grappling with financial distress. Regular employees at the Federal Urdu University have reportedly not received salaries in months, while retired staff await overdue pensions.
The University of Balochistan faces a similar crisis. Even the newly-established federal university in Hyderabad is short on funds, and several institutions in Sindh are reportedly borrowing from banks just to pay staff.
Ironically, the conference was originally slated to be held in Pakistan on May 12. However, the venue was changed to Morocco due to what the HEC described as ""regional conditions.""

PSX closes in the red over budget caution,"US
KSE-100 sheds 882 points, weighed down by delay in IMF's approval of circular debt plan
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) started the week on a bearish note on Monday as the KSE-100 index fell 882 points over investor caution ahead of the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, which has been delayed to June 10.
Additionally, the delay in International Monetary Fund's (IMF) approval of Pakistan's circular debt resolution plan further dampened market sentiment. However, trading activity remained robust, with volumes standing at 636 million shares and traded value at Rs18.6 billion.
According to Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp, stocks closed lower amid pressure in the pre-budget session. Reports of higher petroleum levies and concerns over the pending IMF approval of the circular debt resolution plan alongside delay in federal budget, which will now be presented on June 10, impacted market sentiment.
Mehanti added that rupee depreciation and geopolitical tensions also played a role in bearish activity at the PSX.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 881.55 points, or 0.74%, and settled at 118,221.12.
In its review, Topline Securities remarked that the bourse experienced profit-taking as uncertainty continued to weigh on investor sentiment. The KSE-100 index shed 882 points and closed at 118,221, after touching the intra-day low of 952 points.
The bearish trend was primarily driven by concerns over delay in the federal budget announcement and the lack of clarity about the IMF conditions tied to it. In the absence of positive triggers, investors chose to trim their positions and adopt a cautious stance, it said.
K-Electric led the volumes chart with 247 million shares traded, closing at its upper circuit, following news that the company had secured a dollar-linked tariff for its transmission and distribution business.
Energy stocks came under pressure amid rumours of a potential delay in the clearance of circular debt, with Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDC) and Pakistan State Oil (PSO) emerging as major losers. Engro Holdings, Systems Limited, PSO, Fauji Fertiliser Company and OGDC erased 452 points from the index, Topline added.
In its commentary, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) noted that the week started off on a negative note, with the KSE-100 index falling towards the 118,000-point range.
Some 30 shares rose while 66 fell. K-Electric (+21.19%), Pakistan Services Limited (+8%) and Attock Refinery (+4.03%) contributed the most to index gains while Engro Holdings (-1.82%), Systems Limited (-3%) and PSO (-3.46%) were the biggest drags, AHL said.0
It pointed out that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) had approved K-Electric's multi-year distribution tariff for the period FY24 to FY30. The company had proposed a seven-year tariff control period to facilitate long-term investment. For FY24, the average distribution tariff has been set at Rs3.31 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) while the use-of-system charge has been fixed at Rs1,348.66/kW per month.
""The KSE-100 is declining into support of the large price gap, from where the upside is expected to resume and breach 120,000 points,"" AHL stated.
JS Global analyst Muhammad Hasan Ather commented that the KSE-100 fell 0.8% to the intra-day low of 118,150 as investor sentiment weakened due to the government's delay in presenting the federal budget and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the IMF's fiscal targets.
""Market direction is contingent on clarity from the upcoming IMF discussions and the budget announcement; volatility is likely to persist until fiscal policy details are finalised,"" Ather said.
Overall trading volumes increased to 635.5 million shares compared with Friday's tally of 338 million. Shares of 467 companies were traded. Of these, 188 stocks closed higher, 235 fell and 44 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 246.9 million shares, gaining Rs1 to close at Rs5.72. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 36.7 million shares, gaining Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.27 and Telecard Limited with 30 million shares, gaining Rs0.93 to close at Rs8.22. During the day, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs90.4 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

NA panel questions PTCL's property sale,"US
Asks how properties worth billions of rupees can be sold; summons CEO in next meeting
A parliamentary committee directed Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) to provide specific clauses of its sale and purchase agreements that authorise the company to proceed with the sale of its properties and expressed dismay over the absence of the firm's CEO.
""Where is the CEO of PTCL? How is PTCL selling properties worth billions of rupees?"" The committee chairman termed the CEO's absence an insult to parliament.
He stated, ""We summon the PTCL CEO and his continuous absence is an affront to the committee. We will not take up PTCL's agenda unless the CEO is present. If he is in Islamabad, then he must be called.""
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication met on Monday under the chairmanship of Syed Aminul Haq.
PTCL officials informed the committee that the CEO was attending a meeting at the UAE embassy, to which the chairman responded that committee members had arrived from remote areas to attend the session and those who were unable to come were participating online.
""Scheduling a meeting at the UAE embassy on the same day when this session was going to be held is not appropriate,"" he remarked.
The chairman asked, ""How is PTCL selling off properties worth billions of rupees?"" The committee also summoned officials from the Ministry of Law for the next meeting. Furthermore, the committee instructed that in the next meeting, it must be ensured that the CEO of PTCL appears before the panel to respond to its queries.
The committee reconstituted its sub-committee, to be convened by Gohar Ali Khan, with the same composition and terms of reference.
Meanwhile, amid increasing data leak concerns, a new messaging application, branded as a local alternative to WhatsApp, is set for launch for government employees, which will be expanded in phases.
It was revealed by an official of the National Information Technology Board (NITB) while briefing the NA standing committee.
According to officials, Beep will support encrypted messaging, audio and video calls, and conference calling with over 100 participants, with an additional layer of security and data hosting within Pakistan. The committee was informed by Zarar Khan, Secretary of the Ministry of IT, that an assessment was under way while keeping in view the cybersecurity. ""We are trying to address vulnerabilities and trying to ensure the launch by June 30,"" he added. The app would be rolled out across the country but in phases, the committee was informed.
Haque said that unlike WhatsApp, Beep's servers would be located in Pakistan. ""Its data centre will be in Pakistan, ensuring 100% safety and security."" Moreover, the committee was informed that the security agencies had responded to a letter from the Ministry of Interior, stating that due to the prevailing security and law and order situation, internet services in Panjgur district would remain suspended for the next six months.
The committee voiced concern over the three-year internet suspension in Panjgur, highlighting its impact on businesses and students. It decided to hold an in-camera session with the interior secretary for a detailed briefing on the law and order situation.
Committee member Pullain Baloch informed the meeting that people of his constituency had to travel 15 to 20 kilometres to access internet services. He added that PTCL's internet coverage in the area was nearly non-existent. In light of that, the committee directed the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) chairman to conduct a survey of internet coverage in the region and submit a detailed report.
The NA committee reviewed the delayed Coding and DG Skills Programme, drawing sharp criticism from members. The chairman voiced frustration at the year-long delay, citing missed opportunities amid rapid AI advancements.
Ignite, the implementing body, attributed the delay to updating the content for current tech trends. They reported training 4.6 million students across 19 batches in 15 top freelancing courses, with 28% female participation. A 2024 survey showed trainees generated $1.65 billion in revenue.

Super typhoid threat looms: experts raise alarm,"PK
Link surge to antibiotic resistance, unsafe living conditions
A concerning rise in super typhoid cases is being reported across the metropolis, with medical experts attributing the surge to widespread misuse of antibiotics, which has weakened people's immune systems and led to the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. According to physicians, oral medications are now ineffective against this strain, and treatment depends solely on specific antibiotics administered intravenously.
General physician at Jinnah Hospital Karachi Dr Faisal Javed shared these insights during a conversation with The Express Tribune. He revealed that the number of super typhoid cases is steadily increasing, and the extensively drug-resistant (XDR) variant exhibits a dangerously high resistance to commonly used antibiotics. He warned that case numbers are expected to rise further after Eidul Azha.
Typhoid is caused by the Salmonella Typhi bacterium, which spreads through contaminated water, unhygienic utensils, and substandard food - conditions prevalent in areas with poor sanitation infrastructure.
""In Pakistan, the rampant and incorrect use of antibiotics has led to the development of XDR or 'super typhoid,' a strain that no longer responds to most standard medications,"" Dr Faisal said. ""Only specific and often expensive IV antibiotics are proving effective.""
He expressed concern over the role of unqualified practitioners and under-equipped laboratories, which frequently prescribe medications based on unreliable tests like ""Typhi Dot"" or stool analysis. These tests can yield false positives, particularly if a patient has previously been exposed to the bacteria, leading to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment.
According to Dr Faisal, a blood culture test is the only reliable method for diagnosing super typhoid. Although it takes about seven days to deliver results, it remains the most accurate way to determine effective treatment.
Symptoms of typhoid include high fever, abdominal pain, constipation or diarrhea, gas, and body aches. The XDR strain tends to cause more severe symptoms. If left untreated, the bacteria can impact vital organs including the liver, brain, stomach, and bone marrow - posing a serious threat to life. In some cases, patients may deteriorate before accurate diagnosis is possible, making recovery more difficult.
Dr Faisal recommended that patients eat easily digestible foods like Khichdi (a soft mixture of rice and lentils), yogurt, boiled vegetables, and fruits to help the body heal. He also urged the government and food safety authorities to enforce stricter hygiene standards among restaurants and street vendors, many of whom use contaminated water to wash utensils, aiding in the spread of the disease. Public awareness campaigns should emphasise handwashing before meals and after using the toilet as essential preventive measures.

'Lilo & Stitch' smashes Memorial Day records,"US
Disney remake wins over viewers on long weekend
Theatres across North America are enjoying an exceptional Memorial Day holiday weekend, with two new much-anticipated blockbusters bringing in an estimated box office totaling well over $250 million, analysts said on Sunday.
Disney's family-friendly Lilo & Stitch earned an estimated $183 million, a record for the four-day Memorial Day weekend, according to Variety.
The film has already taken in an additional $158 million internationally, industry tracker Exhibitor Relations reported.
""This is a sensational opening,"" placing the film among the top three Disney live-action remakes, said David A Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research.
Maia Kealoha (as Lilo), Hannah Waddingham, Courtney B Vance and Zach Galifianakis star, while Chris Sanders again provides the voice of the chaos-creating blue alien Stitch.
Paramount's new spy thriller Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning - the latest, and ostensibly last, in the hugely successful Tom Cruise series - opened to an estimated $77 million in ticket sales in the United States and Canada.
Gross called that an ""excellent"" opening, probably the best ever in the series. Ticket sales, however, need to make up for a huge production budget estimated at $400 million.
In third, dropping two spots from its opening last weekend, was Warner Bros and New Line's horror film Final Destination: Bloodlines, at $24.5 million.
Kaitlyn Santa Juana stars as a young woman who has to deal with the grisly aftereffects of her grandmother having long ago cheated Death.
Fourth place went to Disney and Marvel's superhero film Thunderbolts, at $11.6 million. Florence Pugh and Sebastian Stan lead a motley bunch of misfits and antiheroes. The film has taken in more than $350 million worldwide.
And in fifth was Ryan Coogler's vampire thriller Sinners, raking in $11.2 million. The film has now earned $259 million domestically to become one of the highest-grossing R-rated films ever, according to Variety. afp

The event, convened by the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan, brought together esteemed members of the judiciary, international experts, and senior government officials to explore the future of judicial reforms through digital transformation.
Supreme Court Justice Shahid Waheed presented an overview of the progress and evolution of information technology within Pakistan's judicial system, highlighting the milestones achieved and the structural challenges that remain.
The symposium featured perspectives from international experts, Li Xiaohui, an expert from the Supreme People's Court of China, who shared China's digital journey in judicial reforms.
In his keynote address, the chief justice highlighted that the integration of technology into the justice system is not simply a matter of modernisation but it is essential to making courts more accessible, transparent, and efficient for the people they serve.
He described the symposium as timely and forward-looking, aligning with the reform agenda to be deliberated by the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) in its forthcoming meeting.
The chief justice acknowledged the vital contributions of Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Judges Supreme Court of Pakistan/Chairman & Members of the National Judicial Automation Committee (NJAC), and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) for leading this initiative.
He also extended a warm welcome to international guests and expressed gratitude to Justice Zhang Jun, the Chief Justice of the Supreme People's Court of China, and Justice Kadir Ozkaya, the Chief Justice of the Constitutional Court of Türkiye, for their continued support and commitment to judicial cooperation.
Reflecting on the reforms underway, the top judge highlighted the key digital innovations recently implemented by the Supreme Court, including e-filing, QR codes on judgments, expanded video-link hearings, the launch of a citizen feedback portal, and the use of data analytics for case management. However, he also acknowledged ongoing challenges such as the digital divide, evolving legal frameworks, and cyber security vulnerabilities.
He stressed that resistance to technological change must not impede progress, and emphasized the need for a comprehensive national framework to guide judicial digital transformation including robust cyber security protocols, ethical guidelines for AI use, and a culture of collaboration involving High Courts, judicial academies, government institutions, academia, and the legal community.
The chief justice reaffirmed that the technology is a powerful tool to build institutional trust, eliminate barriers to access, and enhance the quality of justice.
He called upon all stakeholders to move forward with unity and resolve to shape a judicial system that meets the needs of the present and earns the confidence of future generations.

Adnan Siddiqui reflects on in-flight turbulence,"US
Actor recalls being faced with the fragility of life
On Sunday, actor Adnan Siddiqui took to Instagram to share a deeply moving reflection on a turbulent flight from Karachi to Lahore. The video he posted captured the visibly shaking cabin of the aircraft, but it was his caption that resonated most, with raw emotion, existential clarity, and a dash of dark humour.
""Yesterday, somewhere between the sky over Karachi and the sprawling fields of Lahore, I found myself caught between heaven and a very real sense of mortality,"" Siddiqui wrote. What began as a routine journey soon ""turned into the kind of moment that strips away the noise, the routine, the illusion of control and leaves you staring straight into the eyes of your fragility.""
As the aircraft began to shake violently mid-air, panic quickly set in among the passengers. Siddiqui described the scene with stark honesty: ""Around me, fear took hold: gasps, cries, people clutching one another, some openly panicking. It was definitely chaotic.""
Despite the fear, Siddiqui tried to remain centered: ""I tried to stay calm, holding on not just to the armrest but to my thoughts, my breath, and my faith."" In those intense moments, he said, ""only one thing filled my heart: my family. My children's faces. And I felt a sharp ache of leaving this world without one last hug from them, without telling them how much I love them.""
The actor said he prayed for everyone on board. ""Strangers, yet suddenly bound together by fear, by hope, by the sheer intensity of the moment. I asked Allah for mercy, a safe landing, and another chance.""
Just as they were nearing the runway in Lahore, the plane suddenly pulled back up for a go-around. Siddiqui commended the pilot, writing, ""What presence of mind! Kudos to the captain.""
The aircraft landed safely soon after, but the actor emphasised it wasn't just the end of a journey. ""It was Allah's grace. It is a powerful reminder that life is painfully fragile, heartbreakingly brief, and profoundly sacred.""
With characteristic wit, he added that during the chaos, ""I was so quiet that I opened my phone and wrote a quick goodbye note just in case. I wrote it like it might be read at my funeral, or maybe go viral. When we landed, I read it, made a face, and deleted it. Still, I meant every word.""
At the end of the day, his message was clear: ""Keep your people close. And thank Allah for this moment, life, and chance.""

Atif Khan slams TMA Mardan corruption,"US
Atif Khan criticized the lack of progress on the solarization of mosques
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Member of the National Assembly and former provincial minister Muhammad Atif Khan has expressed concern over alleged corruption and misappropriation in development projects under the Tehsil Municipal Administration (TMA) Mardan.
In a written complaint to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary, Atif Khan criticized the lack of progress on the solarization of mosques and called for strict action against those involved in the alleged embezzlement.
According to details, Atif Khan, who currently serves as the PTI MNA and President of the party's Peshawar Region, submitted a formal letter addressing the stalled development projects and misuse of funds in his constituency.
The projects, which include the solarization of mosques, were reportedly part of last year's development agenda under TMA Mardan.

"Hear child's voice,SC tells family courts","PK
Says every child is a rights-bearing individual
The apex court has ruled that all courts, particularly family courts and judges of the district judiciary must hear and respect the voice of the child in every custody and guardianship matter.
""This is not an aspirational goal but a binding obligation under the CRC [UN Convention on the Rights of the Child],"" said a 12-page written order on a review petition filed by a father in a children custody case.
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child: Article 3 mandates that the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration in all actions concerning them.
Article 12 of the CRC guarantees every child the right to express their views freely in all matters affecting them, with due weight given in accordance with their age and maturity.
The court noted that earlier proceedings regrettably failed to provide the children an opportunity to be heard, an omission which, it said, undermines both domestic constitutional protections and our international commitments.
""Given the central importance of a child's voice in custody determinations, we found it imperative to re-examine the case to ensure that these rights are not only acknowledged but meaningfully upheld.
""To rectify this oversight and to ensure that the children's welfare and perspectives were given due consideration, this court deemed it necessary to interact directly with both children involved.
""The interaction enabled the bench to make an independent assessment of their emotional well-being, level of comfort, and expressed preference,"" the judgment added.
The verdict issued by a division bench comprising Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi noted that courts, especially family courts, have a moral and legal responsibility to see, hear, and protect every child not as a passive subject of proceedings, but as a rights-bearing individual whose dignity must be safeguarded at every stage of the judicial process.
It also noted that in matters involving children, such as custody, guardianship, and family disputes, the courts must recognize that a strictly adversarial approach often exacerbates conflict, delays resolution, and undermines the child's sense of stability and security.
In contrast, Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), particularly mediation, offers a more collaborative, efficient, and child-sensitive mechanism for resolving such disputes. While the CRC does not explicitly reference the term ADR, its spirit and structure clearly support its use.
""In General Comment No. 12 (2009), the UN Committee on the CRC explicitly encourages States to develop mechanisms that ensure meaningful child participation in family law proceedings, including through non-judicial and informal processes such as mediation.
""Such processes must be voluntary, child-friendly, and facilitated by professionals trained to respect the evolving capacities of the child and prioritize their best interests.
""Properly designed ADR mechanisms reduce the psychological burden on children, promote parental cooperation, and lead to faster, more sustainable outcomes that support the child's long-term welfare.""
It said family courts and guardianship tribunals must prioritize mediation as a first recourse, particularly where parties demonstrate a willingness to engage in good faith.
""Adjudication should be pursued only when mediation fails or is deemed unsuitable due to concerns of safety, coercion, or imbalance of power.
""This approach not only aligns with our international obligations under the CRC but also reinforces the constitutional commitment to protect the dignity, welfare, and future of every child,"" it said.

'HIV cases on rise among youth',"US
Experts blame use of unsafe instruments in parlours and tattoo stores
A health expert has delivered a stark warning about the rapid rise in HIV cases among young people, primarily caused by unprotected and unregulated beauty and tattoo services, and shared needle use among drug users.
The expert, Dr Faizan, underscored the vital need for regular testing and education. He emphasised the crucial need for regular annual health checks to combat this growing health threat. He revealed that over the last six years, the HIV rate among young people has alarmingly escalated from 2.5 per cent to a staggering 5 per cent, primarily attributed to high-risk behaviours such as frequenting unlicensed beauty parlours and tattoo shops, and injecting drugs with shared syringes.
He cautioned young people to exercise extreme caution when using barber shop services, advising them to ensure that new and sterilised equipment is used for shaving and hair cutting to minimise the risk of HIV transmission.
He emphasised that unsterilised tattoo needles, shared razors or shaving equipment, and unsterilised nail clippers or piercing equipment can pose a significant risk. ""The risk of HIV transmission is real if the equipment is not properly sterilised,"" he cautioned. ""It is crucial for individuals to choose licensed and reputable parlours and tattoo shops, ensure that equipment is sterilised, and avoid sharing personal care items.""

PTI protests 'drone strikes' in tribal dists,"AT
Says K-P govt has made its anti-drone policy clear
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) held a protest in Peshawar against drone strikes in the tribal districts, with participation from government ministers, members of the assembly, and party officials.
PTI made it clear that drone attacks in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa are unacceptable and warned that if they are not stopped, the party will take all necessary steps to halt them.
The protest was organized on the instructions of PTI's founding chairman, who had called for demonstrations in the tribal areas.
The protest in Peshawar's Hashtnagri area was attended by PTI's provincial president Junaid Akbar, former National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser, Peshawar region president Atif Khan, provincial ministers Ihtesham Ali, Abdul Karim Tordher, Meena Khan Afridi, Arif Ahmedzai, Pir Maswar, district president Irfan Saleem, Arbab Sher Ali, Kamran Bangash, Fazal Elahi, Shandana Gulzar, and other party officials.
Speakers at the protest condemned the drone strikes, stating that innocent civilians are being targeted.
They described the attacks as a violation of human rights and an affront to national sovereignty, and urged the federal government to take immediate notice.
They noted that the founding chairman of PTI has consistently opposed drone strikes and raised his voice against them at international forums. Due to PTI's firm stance, no drone strikes occurred during its time in power.
The speakers added that the entire nation stands with the founding chairman's position.
PTI was the first party to oppose drone strikes and even staged a sit-in to block NATO supply lines.
The founding chairman was the only leader who had the courage to say ""Absolutely Not"" to a superpower, claimed speakers.
""If these attacks are not stopped, we will stop them ourselves,"" the speakers warned. The provincial government has also issued a policy statement declaring that drone strikes will not be accepted within the province.
They emphasized that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has endured conflict for over 40 years, which has devastated its economy. The province relies heavily on trade with Afghanistan and seeks good relations with its neighbor.
The leaders also vowed to continue their struggle against the 26th Constitutional Amendment and said that the nation would once again take to the streets to demand the release of PTI's founding chairman.
They criticized Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, claiming he only holds a mandate of 16 seats and questioning the legitimacy of his administration, alleging that even the families of some government lawmakers do not acknowledge them as MNAs.

Real-time surveillance of highways planned,"US
Patrol posts to be connected with PSCA
The police have launched an initiative to integrate the Punjab Highway Patrol (PHP) with the Safe Cities Authority's advanced monitoring network to enhance road safety and law enforcement across the province.
Under the new system, all PHP posts will be digitally connected with the Safe Cities Authority in the districts, enabling real-time monitoring of highways.
""This integrated surveillance system will ensure effective implementation of traffic laws and better protection of citizens' lives and property,"" said PHP Deputy Inspector General Dr Muhammad Athar Waheed.
A Punjab Police spokesperson confirmed that 39 PHP personnel had been deployed in Safe Cities Authority offices in 13 districts, working in three shifts to ensure 24/7 monitoring.
The system will facilitate immediate reporting of accidents and criminal activities on highways.
The authorities announced plans to install modern cameras at all PHP posts across the province in the next phase of the project. ""This integrated network will significantly improve traffic monitoring and allow for automated e-challans against traffic violators,"" Dr Waheed added.
The initiative represents a significant technological upgrade for highway surveillance in Punjab, combining PHP's ground presence with the Safe Cities Authority's digital monitoring capabilities, the DIG said.
Meanwhile, the Lahore chief traffic officer (CTO) has launched action against 3,896 vehicles belonging to 73 government departments for unpaid e-challans, with notices dispatched for penalty payments.
The CTO revealed that the defaulting vehicles – including some of the police – had been identified through a verification process.
""Detailed records of these vehicles have been compiled and shared with the respective departments,"" he stated.
The police department vehicles feature prominently among the defaulters, despite being prioritised for clearance.
""Legal notices for penalty settlements have been formally initiated,"" the CTO said, emphasising equal enforcement of traffic regulations for all vehicles.
Officials indicated strict follow-up actions planned against persistent defaulters.
In another development, a stolen vehicle was traced and recovered in Lahore within minutes with the help of Safe Cities Authority cameras and the suspect was apprehended.
A citizen had parked his vehicle on the Mall Road and left briefly for shopping.
Upon his return, he found the vehicle missing and called the Emergency Helpline 15 to seek police assistance.
As soon as the call was received, a virtual patrolling officer of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority initiated the search using surveillance cameras.
The vehicle was traced at multiple locations and all information was shared with the police station concerned.
The police, acting on the provided information, recovered the vehicle and arrested the suspect.
According to the spokesperson of the Safe Cities Authority, the extensive network of modern surveillance cameras installed across Punjab has made swift crime tracing possible. The spokesperson urged citizens to call the helpline in case of any suspicious activity or emergency, to ensure timely assistance and public safety.
Chairing a meeting to review the arrangements for Eidul Azha, Divisional Commissioner Zaid bin Maqsood emphasised the need for organised parking at cattle markets, with the Lahore Parking Company (LePark) assisting in traffic and parking management.
A total of 30 official cattle markets will be established in the division, including six in Lahore, eight in Sheikhupura, six in Nankana Sahib and 10 in Kasur.
Zaid bin Maqsood instructed all deputy commissioners to ensure the provision of all necessary facilities at the cattle markets, including traffic control, organised parking, sanitation, livestock health, medical camps and security arrangements.

I have lived many emotions on this court, says Spaniard at his farewell
In a tearful lap of honour of centre court on Sunday evening, Rafael Nadal bade a formal farewell to the French Open in Paris following an homage to the exploits that furnished him with a record 14 titles.
Dressed in a black suit, black shoes and a dark shirt, the 38-year-old Spaniard soaked up the applause from the 15,000 spectators in the stands during a 45-minute ceremony at the end of the daytime matches.
A four-minute video splicing images of Nadal unleashing his trademark shots and fist pumps from over the years at the Roland Garros Stadium brought cheers and chants of ""Rafa! Rafa!""
""I played here for 20 years,"" Nadal said. ""I suffered. I won and I lost. I have lived many emotions on this court.""
From his first appearance in May 2005 until his departure in 2024, Nadal contested 116 matches. He was outwitted on the court four times.
He had pocketed four crowns when Robin Soderling was the first to beat him in 2009. Novak Djokovic saw him off in the 2015 quarter-finals and Nadal withdrew before his third round match against Marcel Granollers in 2016.
Djokovic vanquished him in the semis in 2021 and Alexander Zverev dispatched him last year in the first round.
In the prelude to the 2025 competition – the first since his retirement from the ATP circuit in November – French Open directors announced they wanted to celebrate the 124-year-old tournament's greatest champion.
""Thank you to Roland Garros for giving me the opportunity to be again on the most important court of my tennis career,"" said Nadal who was forced to withdraw from the 2004 tournament due to injury.
Dressed in pirate shorts, bandana and a bicep-revealing gilet, the fist-pumping 18-year-old blazed through a field that included the world number one Roger Federer.
""I've had incredible rivals,"" Nadal added. ""Roger, Novak and others who pushed me to my physical and mental limits.""
After thanking tournament administrators, his friends and family, Djokovic, Federer and Andy Murray – the other members of what tennis writers dubbed ""the Big Four"" came out to share the stage.
""After all these years fighting for biggest things in our sport, we showed that we can fight in a good way,"" Nadal told his old foes.
""Thank you. We respected each other and it is important that you are here. I appreciated pushing myself to the limit because of you all. You mean everything to me and that we can be good friends sends a message to the world.
""I hope we continue to do positive things together.""

Call for shifting to milk-free tea,"US
.
On World Tea Day, a health expert has emphasised the importance of public awareness in consuming tea without milk, highlighting its numerous benefits, as tea without milk is more beneficial than milk tea because excessive milk consumption with tea can lead to potential health risks, including chemical and psychiatric issues, such as addiction.
Dr Shagufta Feroz has warned that excessive milk tea consumption can cause digestive issues, mental health concerns, cardiovascular problems, nutritional deficiencies and addiction due to caffeine dependence.
Furthermore, milk tea may also cause skin issues like acne. Moderation is key, and being mindful of sugar content, caffeine intake, and serving sizes can help minimise its negative effects.
Dr Feroz also discussed the trend of having tea with breakfast and in the evening, highlighting its potential impact on health and suggesting mindful consumption habits to maximise benefits while minimising risks.
Despite not producing tea, Pakistan is the world's largest importer of tea, reflecting its immense popularity among Pakistanis, who have made it an integral part of their daily lives, she mentioned.

Unauthorised cattle markets,"IN
Roads that are already under strain become virtually impassable.
As Eid-ul-Azha approaches, the perennial chaos of illegal cattle markets is once again playing out across not only Karachi but cities and towns throughout the country. Despite repeated assurances from local administrations to restrict animal sales to designated sites, little has been done to clamp down on these illegal markets.
The consequences are immediate and far-reaching. Roads that are already under strain become virtually impassable. Pedestrians are forced onto dangerous detours. Stagnant water, animal waste and lack of veterinary oversight contribute to alarming hygiene conditions. With thousands of animals transported from across the country, the risk of disease transmission, including zoonotic infections, increases significantly - putting both livestock and human populations in danger. Year after year, administrations announce plans for designated markets, issue press releases, and sometimes even identify ""no-cattle zones"". Yet enforcement remains sporadic and selective. Illegal markets are allowed to flourish, often because of the profits they generate and the influence of those behind them. This nationwide problem demands a nationwide response. Authorities must move beyond lip service and engage in sustained, coordinated crackdowns on illegal markets. This includes removing encroachments, levying fines and holding officials accountable for negligence. Equally important is the need to improve legal cattle markets, ensuring they are well-managed and accessible to traders from various regions. Citizens, too, have a role to play. Buying animals from illegal setups may seem convenient, but it fuels the very cycle that turns our urban spaces into unregulated livestock yards every year.
Eid-ul-Azha is a time of spiritual reflection and sacrifice. But it should not come at the cost of our cities' health and safety. It is high time the state reasserted its writ, doing away with illegal cattle markets.

Protests grip Bangladesh,"US

Primary school teachers in Bangladesh joined public sector workers in protests against the interim government on Monday amid growing discontent and political uncertainty in the South Asian country.
Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, took over as interim head of the country of 173 million last August after deadly student-led protests forced then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India. Yunus' administration has faced pressure from civil servants, teachers, political parties and the military as the caretaker government attempts to guide the country through a fragile transition before holding a general election.
Wahiduddin Mahmud, the planning adviser in Yunus' cabinet, however, said the de-facto prime minister was not quitting. ""We are not going anywhere till our job is done,"" Mahmud said during the weekend, adding that Yunus acknowledged the obstacles but remained committed to holding a fair election.
The interim government has been caught between competing demands for swift general elections and reforms. Yunus has said the elections could be held by June, 2026 while the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has been pushing for polls by December.
Bangladesh's army chief, General Waker-Uz-Zaman, added to the pressure by calling for elections to be held in December during a speech last week, expressing his dissatisfaction over the political situation.

Former senator and spokesperson to President Asif Ali Zardari Farhatullah Babar launched his memoir ""Zardari presidency - now it must be told"" at the Karachi Press Club on Monday. The 500-page book chronicles key moments from Zardari's 2008-13 presidency, offering a rare insider's account of a tumultuous period in Pakistan's history.
""This is not a biography of President Zardari,"" Babar clarified, ""but a first-hand account of bizarre and dramatic events that impacted both the presidency and the nation.""
The memoir recounts more than 80 episodes, including the discovery of Osama Bin Laden, civil-military tensions, the Memogate scandal, and the fallout over Raymond Davis. It also sheds light on Zardari's strained ties with the judiciary and military, including a moment when troops surrounded the Presidency to pressure a defiant president.
The book discloses for the first time the draft charge sheet for General Musharraf's impeachment and reveals backchannel diplomatic efforts such as a failed nuclear no-first-use proposal to India and secret talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Babar describes Zardari as a resilient but deeply political figure - misjudged, underestimated, and often vilified. ""Zardari has been sinned against far more than he has sinned,"" he said, likening his endurance to that of Sonya in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment.
Babar maintained he did not seek permission from Zardari or the PPP to write the book, which he called a duty to history. ""This is the account of a president walking a tightrope between allies, judges, and generals,"" he said, ""written by someone who witnessed it all - pen in hand.""

Residents protest health teams' markings on homes,"US
District Bar
Association's human
rights cell all set to
challenge issue
in high court
Residents of Rawalpindi and cantonment areas have expressed their frustration over the actions of anti-polio and dengue surveillance teams, who have been marking identification numbers on doors, windows, walls, signboards, and PVC pipes of residential and commercial buildings. These markings, often made with permanent black markers, have significantly defaced the exterior of properties, damaging their aesthetic appeal.
The practice has sparked widespread outcry, particularly from homeowners who have spent large sums on painting and maintaining their properties.
In response, the Human Rights Cell of the District Bar Association has announced plans to challenge the issue in the High Court, calling for the establishment of a proper mechanism that preserves property appearance while allowing for health monitoring.
Many residents complain that their homes are repeatedly marked during monthly visits by polio, dengue, and lady health workers, leaving behind a trail of unsightly codes and numbers. This has led to mounting tensions, with reports of verbal altercations between citizens and health teams. The presence of women in these teams has occasionally led to confrontational encounters with male family members.
Despite the backlash, the Health Department has no formal system to regulate or monitor this process. According to insiders, senior officials have directly instructed teams to ensure markings are clearly visibletypically using permanent inkwithout considering the damage done to personal property. These marks are difficult to remove and have marred the appearance of nearly every home in the city and the cantonment.
Citizens are now urging the Health Department to develop an alternative systemsuch as maintaining written records with homeowner verification through signatures, thumb impressions, or CNIC copiesinstead of using permanent markers on buildings.
Malik Saleh Advocate, head of the District Bar Association's Human Rights Cell, emphasised that it is the state's duty to provide services without violating citizens' rights or damaging their homes. ""No institution has the authority to deface cities like this,"" he said, announcing that a formal petition will be filed with the Rawalpindi Bench of the High Court this week.
Chairman of the Citizen Action Committee, Malik Zaheer Awan, also vowed to join the legal challenge. He argued that by writing on private property, municipal and health authorities are lowering the value of homes and causing distress rather than delivering public service.
Residents like Ibrahim Khan have taken a firm stance, vowing not to allow anyone to mark their homes again. ""Whoever writes on my property will be responsible for the damage,"" he warned. Sultan Mehmood, another homeowner, expressed similar frustration. ""No matter how many times I repaint my doors, they're always defaced again the next day.""

"Alcaraz, Sinner launch French Open bids","US
Swiatek makes strong start to advance into second round
Title rivals Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner start their French Open campaigns on Monday, after three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek eased into the second round at Roland Garros.
Alcaraz beat Sinner in straight sets in the Italian Open final just over a week ago as the Italian world number one returned from a three-month doping ban.
The Spaniard edged Sinner in five sets in the semi-finals at Roland Garros last year and believes the two-time reigning Australian Open champion will pose an even greater threat to his crown in Paris after brushing off the cobwebs in Rome.
""The level he has played in (Rome) is insane after three months without playing, without any tournament,"" said Alcaraz.
""I'm pretty sure he's going to be better and better. If he's winning in Roland Garros and he's going farther, I think much better he's going to feel. He's going to be a really dangerous player in Paris.""
First up for Alcaraz though is Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri, who replaced the injured Kei Nishikori in the draw.
Sinner takes centre stage in the night session against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who can expect to enjoy much of the support under the lights on Court Philippe Chatrier.
It is the first of two successive potential French opponents for Sinner, who could meet the retiring Richard Gasquet in the second round. Gasquet, 38, takes on another wild card, Terence Atmane, in his 22nd and final Roland Garros.
""It's definitely going to be different,"" Sinner said of the atmosphere that awaits him in Paris after he received a warm welcome back in front of home fans in Italy.
Sinner served a suspension for testing positive twice in March last year for traces of the banned anabolic steroid clostebol. Doping authorities accepted that it was the result of an accidental contamination involving his physio.
Norwegian seventh seed Casper Ruud, a two-time French Open runner-up, got his bid for a first Grand Slam title under way with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over veteran Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos-Vinolas.
Swiatek entered the tournament on a near year-long trophy drought but showed signs of form in a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova. Her struggles since the last of her four French Open titles have been well documented, but she broke her 42nd-ranked opponent four times in a strong display.
The five-time Grand Slam champion's remarkable win-loss record in the tournament now stands at 36-2.
""I knew I needed to stay proactive and try to use my weapons. I'm happy with my performance and it was a solid match,"" said Swiatek, who also beat Sramkova in the second round of this year's Australian Open.
Swiatek, who has dropped to fifth in the world rankings, will next face former US Open champion Emma Raducanu after the Briton defeated China's Wang Xinyu 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.
Raducanu is playing at the French Open for the first time since a second-round exit on her debut in 2022.
Former Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina battled past Argentinian qualifier Julia Riera 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, two days after lifting her first WTA title since April 2024 in Strasbourg. Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka, who had a match point against Swiatek in the second round at Roland Garros a year ago, has a tough opening match against 10th seed Paula Badosa. Australian Open champion Madison Keys plays Australian qualifier Daria Saville in round one. Stan Wawrinka, the 2015 French Open champion, is drawn against Britain's Jacob Fearnley.

"Man City, Chelsea, Newcastle secure UCL","US
Liverpool and Arsenal had already secured their place in the Champions League
Manchester City, Chelsea and Newcastle secured places in next season's Champions League as Liverpool celebrated with the Premier League trophy after a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace in Sunday's dramatic final round.
A record-equalling 20th league title for Liverpool and relegation for Ipswich, Leicester and Southampton had long since been decided, leaving the focus of attention on the battle for European places.
Liverpool and Arsenal had already secured their place in the Champions League by finishing in the top two, while Tottenham will join them after winning the Europa League on Wednesday.
City ensured a disappointing season did not end in disastrous fashion by qualifying for Europe's top competition for the 15th consecutive season by beating Fulham 2-0 to finish third.
Ilkay Gundogan's overhead kick from close range put Pep Guardiola's men in front before Erling Haaland secured the points for the visitors from the penalty spot.
""It's not perfect, but we'll be in Europe next season in the Champions League,"" said Guardiola.
Chelsea ended Nottingham Forest's dreams of a first appearance in the Champions League since they were European champions back in 1980.
Levi Colwill tapped in Pedro Neto's cross for the Blues' goal in a 1-0 win at the City Ground to secure fourth place for Chelsea.
""We brought this club where it has to be,"" said Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca.
Forest have to settle for seventh and a place in the UEFA Conference League.
Newcastle narrowly avoided throwing away their place in the top five after losing 1-0 at home to Everton.
Carlos Alcaraz's header earned the Toffees victory on Tyneside.
However, the Magpies finished fifth on goal difference after Aston Villa were controversially beaten 2-0 at Manchester United.
Villa's hopes were dented when goalkeeper Emi Martinez was sent off just before half-time for bringing down Rasmus Hojlund outside his box.
Yet the visitors thought they had taken the lead at Old Trafford only for Morgan Rogers' effort to be ruled out for kicking the ball out of the hands of Altay Bayindir.
Villa were furious at the call and were hit with a sucker punch moments later when Amad Diallo headed in Bruno Fernandes' cross.
Christian Eriksen's penalty sealed the win as United finished the campaign in 15th.
A place in the Europa League is Villa's consolation for finishing sixth.
Palace spoil Liverpool party
There was a mutual guard of honour at Anfield as Palace paid homage to Liverpool before the hosts repaid the favour to mark the Eagles' FA Cup victory over City last weekend.
Liverpool's last title celebrations in 2020 took place in front of an empty stadium due to coronavirus restrictions, meaning it was the first time in 35 years they could celebrate lifting the trophy in front of the Reds' support.
""It's always special to win something, but at certain clubs maybe a little bit more,"" said Liverpool manager Arne Slot.
Former Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp made his first return to Anfield since an emotional farewell 12 months ago.
Palace, though, spoiled the party when Ismaila Sarr slotted home the opening goal after just nine minutes.
Liverpool's Ryan Gravenberch was sent off in the second half but the 10 men still secured a point thanks to Mohamed Salah's deflected leveller.
Tottenham suffered a hangover from their Europa League celebrations as Brighton came from behind to win 4-1 and secure eighth place.
A double from Jack Hinshelwood, Matt O'Riley's penalty and Diego Gomez condemned Spurs to a 22nd league defeat of the season and a 17th-placed finish. Arsenal needed an 89th-minute winner from Martin Odegaard to beat bottom-of-the-table Southampton 2-1.

Markhor population sees positive trend,"US
Experts say community-led initiatives essential to conservation
""With capacity-building programmes and engagement of local communities in conservation initiatives, a positive population trend has been observed in the Markhor species"". WWF-Pakistan stated this on World Makhor Day while appreciating the conservation efforts of local communities in Gilgit-Baltistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
According to the organisation, close coordination between conservation organisations, government departments and local communities has resulted in an increase in the Markhor species and their habitat range in Pakistan.
In June 2024, WWF-Pakistan, in collaboration with Pakistan Post, issued stamps showcasing the Kashmir markhor. According to WWF, the markhor species in Pakistan faces numerous threats that jeopardise its survival. However, the involvement of communities has improved the habitat and population of these species. The markhor, declared the national animal of Pakistan, is a large wild goat species native to South Asia and Central Asia, mainly existing in Pakistan, India, the Karakoram range, parts of Afghanistan and the Himalayas.
Since 2015, it has been classified as Near Threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Often based on their horn configuration, the markhor has been divided into five sub-species, namely Astor markhor, Bukharan markhor, Kabul markhor, Kashmir markhor and Suleiman markhor.
Remarking on the day, WWF-Pakistan Director General Hammad Naqi Khan lauded the efforts of local communities in the protection of the Markhor species and highlighted the need for transnational conservation efforts to safeguard their future.

CPEC key to unlocking vast mining sector potential,"US
The summit concluded with a call for deeper Sino-Pakistan collaboration
Pakistan's Embassy Deputy Head of Mission in Beijing Bilal Mahmood Chaudhary has emphasised the transformative role of mining cooperation under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) during his keynote address at the 4th Asia Mining Innovation and Development Summit in Beijing.
Chaudhary underscored Pakistan's vast mineral wealth, including 186 billion tons of coal reserves, over 5 million tons of copper and 400 tons of gold at the Reko Diq mine, alongside 500 million tons of iron ore. ""These resources position Pakistan as a pivotal player in regional industrial growth, particularly under CPEC 2.0, which prioritises value addition and downstream processing,"" he stated at the event on Sunday.
Highlighting the alignment of China's advanced mining technologies with Pakistan's resource base, he noted that CPEC's upgraded phase aims to foster ""mutually beneficial partnerships"" in line with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
The deputy head referenced recent milestones, including the $2.3 billion railway project linking mining hubs with Gwadar Port - a CPEC phase-II initiative set to expand the port's capacity to 2 million tons annually by 2030. He also cited flagship projects like the Saindak Copper-Gold Mine, operated by China's MCC Group, and the Duddar Lead-Zinc Mine in Balochistan, which achieved a peak output of 500,000 tons in 2019 under China Huaye Group. These ventures, he said, exemplify ""win-win collaboration"" through job creation and technology transfer.
To streamline investments, Chaudhary outlined Pakistan's policy reforms, including the National Minerals Harmonisation Framework 2025, which offers tax incentives and expedited licensing under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). ""Our goal is to transform mineral wealth into industrial growth and human development,"" he asserted. National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) Vice President Shaikh Muhammad Shariq, while sharing his sentiments, stressed the financial sector's commitment to supporting mining ventures. ""CPEC-driven projects are unlocking new avenues for sustainable financing, ensuring that infrastructure and energy initiatives align with long-term economic resilience,"" he said.
The summit concluded with a call for deeper Sino-Pakistan collaboration, building on President Asif Ali Zardari's February 2025 visit to China, which reaffirmed mining as a strategic priority.
Bilal Chaudhary remarked, ""Our iron-clad friendship will shine brighter through innovation and shared prosperity.""

Liverpool lift EPL trophy after Palace draw,"US
Arne Slot's side secured Premier League crown with a demolition of Tottenham
Virgil van Dijk lifted the Premier League trophy after Liverpool's 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace on Sunday as the Reds held a title party with their own fans for the first time in 35 years.
Arne Slot's side wrapped up their record-equalling 20th English crown with a demolition of Tottenham in April, but the long-awaited trophy presentation was saved for the final game of the season.
Liverpool's last title in 2020 was won during the Covid-19 pandemic, meaning the trophy was held aloft by then-captain Jordan Henderson in front of an empty stadium.
The Reds made the most of their first title celebration in a packed Anfield since 1990 as the 61,000-capacity crowd partied along with the great and good of Liverpool's illustrious past.
""It's always special to win something, but at certain clubs maybe a little bit more,"" Slot said.
""I don't think you expect anything like this. If you look at the Premier League in the last few seasons it was always a race to the end.
""To be part of it was already nice, let alone to win it.""
Alan Hansen, who captained Liverpool in their last trophy lift at a full Anfield in 1990, presented the silverware to current Reds skipper Van Dijk.
Kenny Dalglish, Liverpool's manager 35 years ago, was watching from the stands, as was Jurgen Klopp, who masterminded the Reds' Premier League triumph in 2020 before leaving last year.
Fireworks, smoke and red ticker tape filled the air as the trophy was paraded around Anfield, with the famous Kop stand adorned with banners and flags emblazoned with slogans hailing their heroes.
Even Trent Alexander-Arnold -- the Liverpool right-back controversially set to leave in a widely-expected move to Real Madrid -- was embraced by fans on his final appearance for his boyhood club.
Alexander-Arnold had been booed after coming on as a substitute for the recent draw with Arsenal in the first game following his announcement that he will depart when his contract expires in June.
Rousing scene
With Anfield in party mood, tearful Alexander-Arnold was granted a fond farewell as he was cheered when he came off the bench in the second half, the Liverpool-born defender responding by kissing his badge.
""I've played hundreds of games for the club but I've never felt so loved and cared for than today,"" Alexander-Arnold said.
Liverpool failed to win any of their four games after sealing the title.
But that couldn't detract from the festive atmosphere, which was in full swing before the game even kicked off as Slot's team were given a guard of honour onto the pitch by Palace's players, before the Reds returned the favour to salute the FA Cup winners.
Ismaila Sarr's ninth-minute goal for Palace couldn't spoil the occasion either.
Liverpool midfielder Ryan Gravenberch, who had been booked for diving, was shown a straight red card after his foul on Daichi Kamada in the 68th minute.
But Mohamed Salah ensured Liverpool avoided defeat in their finale when he bundled home in the 84th minute.
Salah's 29th goal this season equalled the Premier League record of most goal involvements in a season, previously held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer, who both achieved 47 in a 42-game season.
The Egypt forward finished as the Premier League's golden boot winner for a record-equalling fourth time.
""It's incredible. Last time we did not have the chance to lift the trophy in front of the Kop. Today we have the chance,"" Salah said.
""It is an incredible feeling. Winning the second one with the fans in Anfield, you can see what it means.""
Liverpool's players gathered in one long line to sing club anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone' in a rousing scene after the trophy presentation.
The party is set to continue on Monday when Liverpool will parade the trophy through the city on an open-top bus.

"Internet suspended in Panjgur, panel told","US
Interior ministry says BLA using alternate systems, not official internet
The National Assembly's Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication was informed on Monday that internet services in Balochistan's Panjgur district remain suspended due to security clearance being withheld by intelligence agencies for the next six months.
However, interior ministry officials clarified that terrorists of the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) were not using Pakistan's official internet infrastructure, but an alternative system.
During the committee's meeting, chaired by Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunication Aminul Haque at the Parliament House, officials from the Ministry of Interior briefed members on the prolonged internet shutdown in Panjgur.
They said that a formal request for security clearance was made on March 22, but clearance was denied without detailed justification, only citing ""security concerns"" as the reason for continued data suspension.
Committee member Pauline Baloch expressed strong concern, saying the internet issue in her constituency had persisted for several years.
""If nothing has been resolved in the past three years, what hope is there in the next six months?"" she asked.
""It appears Panjgur is being permanently disconnected,"" she added, taking a solemn oath and alleging that the region was being deliberately punished.
Separately, the committee also lauded Pakistan's cybersecurity apparatus for successfully fending off cyberattacks during recent heightened tensions with India.
Committee Chairman Aminul Haque said cyberattacks were launched against Pakistan between May 5 and 6, but were effectively thwarted. ""Our cybersecurity team and the National CERT deserve commendation for defending Pakistan's digital assets and even launching counteroffensives,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Acting CEO of the National Information Technology Board (NITB) Faisal Ratyal briefed the committee on the development of ""Beep"", a secure government communication app designed for federal employees.
The app will include voice and video conferencing capabilities and aims to provide a safer internal communication platform.
Committee members were informed that a high-level committee had been formed to oversee Beep's rollout, and an additional security layer was being incorporated to enhance protection.

OPEC+ oil output rise may aid Pakistan,"US
Coalition expected to 
hike oil production by 411,000 bpd, saving country $2.3b on imports
OPEC Plus' anticipated decision to raise oil production by 411,000 barrels per day starting in July could provide Pakistan with much-needed macroeconomic relief, carrying significant implications for the country's external account, inflation trajectory, and energy sector stability.
Sources close to the group indicate that this larger-than-expected output hike may be part of a broader strategy to restore as much as 2.2 million barrels per day to the market by November 2025. According to Ismail Iqbal Securities, the move is widely seen as an attemptled particularly by Saudi Arabiato regain lost market share and pressure high-cost producers out of the market.
The oil producers are expected to approve a hike more than three times the previously agreed 137,000 bpd at their upcoming meeting on June 1. If implemented, the decision is likely to exert downward pressure on already-struggling global crude oil prices. This would benefit oil-importing economies such as Pakistan, which continues to grapple with elevated energy costs and persistent trade and fiscal deficits.
Pakistan imports around 21 million tonnes of crude and petroleum products annually. In the first ten months of FY25, its energy import bill surged to $12.7 billionnearly 26% of the total import bill. With Brent crude averaging around $74 per barrel so far this fiscal year, a drop in global prices following the OPEC+ hike could provide meaningful financial relief.
Insight Securities estimates that if Brent oil falls to $65 per barrel, Pakistan could save up to $1.8 billion on crude imports, with an additional $500 million in savings on RLNG imports. Pakistan imported $2.9 billion worth of RLNG during the same period, and because its price is indexed to global crude benchmarks, any decline in oil prices translates directly into reduced RLNG costs.
These savings would ease pressure on Pakistan's current account, improve foreign exchange reserves, and reduce the need for immediate external financing.
Lower oil prices would also aid Pakistan's fiscal goals. The government recently increased the petroleum development levy (PDL) by Rs18/litre to finance tariff differential subsidies under the TDS scheme. With a PDL target of Rs100/litre and a projected 10% increase in fuel consumption, authorities could generate up to Rs2 trillion in FY26without raising retail prices if global oil prices fall.
In the domestic energy sector, a reduction in RLNG prices could lower electricity generation costs and reduce circular debt. This would alleviate financial strain on power utilities and cut the burden of energy subsidies. Gas distributors such as SNGP and SSGC could also benefit from improved cost recovery and liquidity, enabling timely payments to companies like OGDC and PPL.
Additionally, a decline below the $75/bbl base case assumed by OGRA could result in full cost recovery for gas utilities, enhancing their profitability.
The anticipated price drop could boost investor sentiment, particularly in the power, chemicals, and textile sectors, supporting the KSE-100 index. However, risks remain from potential new taxes in the upcoming budget and political resistance to high petroleum levies.

Joachim Trier tearjerker takes home Cannes hearts,"US
Despite not winning top prize, 'Sentimental Value' moved viewers
Director Joachim Trier, who won the Grand Prix second prize at the Cannes film festival Saturday, makes Scandinavian films that can melt the chilliest of hearts.
Sentimental Value, his moving story about a quietly fractured Norwegian family with Elle Fanning got an extraordinary 19-minute standing ovation when its Cannes premiere ended in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Even the director found himself crying behind the camera as he shot it, he told AFP.
""It sounds cheesy, but I wept a lot making this film because I was so moved by the actors,"" he said of his cast, which play members of an arty family in Oslo who struggle to communicate.
""The actors are my friends. I know that they were halfway a character and halfway themselves. And that they were also dealing with stuff,"" said the maker of The Worst Person in the World.
That film landed the Norwegian two Oscar nominations and won then-newcomer Renate Reinsve the best actress award at Cannes in 2021.
Many critics said it also should have won the Palme d'Or top prize. And many thought Trier should have won it again Saturday, with some calling Sentimental Value a contender for best film of the year.
""I think it was my destiny to win the Grand Prix,"" a rueful Trier told reporters afterwards - a reference to the failing fictional director portrayed in the film, who had also won the same prize in 1998.
""I am almost as good as him now,"" Trier joked.
Fanning said The Worst Person in the World - which brought Trier to her attention - is ""easily one of the best films in the last decade or even longer. It is just perfect,"" she told AFP.
It was the last film in his Oslo Trilogy of intelligent, bittersweet explorations of life in the Norwegian capital.
'Crying and crying'
Trier is famous for the rapport he builds with his actors.
""We were a family too,"" he told AFP of the shoot for Sentimental Value, rehearsing his script around the kitchen table of the beautiful old wooden home in Oslo where the film was shot, itself a character in the story.
The heads that keep butting in Trier's on-screen family are the absent father, an arthouse filmmaker who has long been put out to grass, played by Swedish legend Stellan Skarsgard, and his stage actress daughter (Reinsve).
""I think a lot of families carry woundedness and grief,"" Trier said.
The bad old dynamics are changed by the arrival of an American star - Fanning playing someone only millimetres from her real self - a fan of the father.
She comes bearing lots of Netflix dollars to revive one of his long-stalled scripts.
""We don't get too many Hollywood stars wanting to be in small Norwegian-language films,"" Trier joked of Fanning's interest in his films.
""When Joachim sent me the script, I read it and I was just crying and crying by the final page,"" Fanning told AFP.
Trier 'magic'
The director comes from a family steeped in the Scandinavian film industry. He dedicated his Grand Prix at Cannes to his grandfather, Erik Lochen, a member of the Norwegian resistance during World War II.
""He was captured and his way to survive after the war was to play jazz and to make films,"" Trier said.
Lochen's film The Hunt also competed for the Palme d'Or at Cannes, in 1960. It didn't win either. It was beaten by a film called La Dolce Vita.
Trier admitted that that history, which is alluded to in his new film, made it all very ""meta"".
""You're making a film about a family with your filmmaking family. And you've got a meta Hollywood star,"" he said.
But there are not that many parallels with his biological family.
""It's not like I'm throwing anyone under the bus. My whole family has actually seen the film and are very supportive,"" he said.
The filmmaker father, he insisted, is a mash-up of great auteurs such as Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieslowski and John Cassavetes. afp

Speaker sides with Opposition to block 'Goonda Bill',"US
Malik Ahmad Khan criticises legislative powers being handed to bureaucracy
Speaker of the Punjab Assembly, Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan, cautioned Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership on Friday against pursuing a no-confidence motion, warning that more than 20 of its lawmakers might defect if the party insists on proceeding.
During the Assembly session, Speaker Khan indirectly advised PTI to reconsider its strategy, hinting at potential fractures within the party's provincial ranks.
The session also witnessed rare alignment between Speaker Khan and opposition members in their strong criticism of the proposed Punjab Control of Goonda Bill 2025. The bill, introduced by the Punjab government, seeks to establish new authorities and empower the bureaucracy with significant legislative powers.
Opposition legislators accused the government of attempting to suppress the public through ""backdoor legal tactics,"" vowing to resist the bill at every platform.
Speaker Khan echoed their concerns, declaring that he would oppose any legislation infringing on public rights or bypassing democratic norms. He even expressed willingness to meet Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in person to urge a review of the bill.
In another heated exchange, PTI MPA Ahmer Rasheed Bhatti raised the issue of private school fee hikes during summer vacations. He noted that despite Lahore High Court's directive to charge only half the usual fees, some schools had increased fees by 26%.
Speaker Khan expressed serious displeasure over the matter and referred it to the Assembly's standing committee on education. Punjab Law Minister Sohaib Ahmad Malik assured the House that the issue would be thoroughly investigated.
Bhatti also criticized the growing trend of delegating lawmaking powers to the bureaucracy, calling it a threat to legislative sovereignty.

While the war raged on, mediators presented a proposal for a 70-day ceasefire and hostage-release deal to Israel and Hamas, a Palestinian source said.
The territory's civil defence agency said many of the casualties at the school in Gaza City were children, while the Israeli military said the site was housing ""key terrorists"".
Moreover, a US-backed foundation tasked with supplying aid to Gaza made a faltering start on Monday, with no clear sign that it had distributed promised supplies, a day after its chief unexpectedly stepped down.
The aid plan, which has been endorsed by Israel but rejected by the UN, is unfolding amid fierce Israeli attacks on the enclave.
With food still critically short after a nearly three-month blockade, Washington says it is working to restore a ceasefire more than 19 months into the war, but progress is elusive.
A Palestinian official said Hamas had agreed to a US proposal for a truce and the release of 10 Israeli hostages, but an Israeli official dismissed the proposal as unacceptable, denying it was Washington's.
US special envoy Steve Witkoff rejected reports that Hamas had agreed to his proposal, telling Reuters that what he has seen is ""completely unacceptable"".
Israel has faced a mounting international outcry this month, including from Western allies, as it launched a new offensive in Gaza, already largely destroyed by Israeli bombardment and where the population of 2 million is at risk of famine.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which intends to use private contractors working under a broad Israeli security umbrella, said it would begin deliveries on Monday, with the aim of reaching one million Palestinians by the end of the week.
""We plan to scale up rapidly to serve the full population in the weeks ahead,"" it said in a statement.
The Switzerland-registered foundation has been heavily criticised by the United Nations, whose officials have said the private company's aid distribution plans are insufficient for reaching the more than two million Gazans.

Kuwait resumes visa access for Pakistanis,"SA
Kuwait stopped issuing visas to people holding passports of Pakistan, Iran, Syria and Afghanistan in 2011
The Kuwaiti government officially resumed issuing a wide range of visas to Pakistani nationals, in a significant step towards bolstering bilateral relations and addressing critical labour needs, several media outlets in the Gulf region reported on Monday.
UAE-based Gulf News quoted Pakistan's Ambassador to Kuwait, Dr Zaffar Iqbal, as announcing plans to bring 1,200 Pakistani nurses to Kuwait's healthcare sector, adding that an initial group of 125 nurses had reached the Gulf state last week.
According to media reports, Kuwait stopped issuing visas to people holding passports of Pakistan, Iran, Syria and Afghanistan in 2011 because of security concerns. Now, it decided to allow work, family, visit, tourist and commercial visas to Pakistani citizens.
The focal person of the Overseas Pakistanis Ministry welcomed Kuwait's decision, saying that the lifting of the visa ban would provide employment, trade and tourism opportunities to thousands of Pakistanis in Kuwait. He hoped Pakistan would earn valuable foreign exchange after this decision.
According to Kuwait-based Arab Times, Ambassador Iqbal confirmed that Pakistani citizens had begun receiving approvals for various visa applications from this month that restored a vital channel for travel and employment between the two countries.
Iqbal also told Arab News that Pakistan and Kuwait were in the final stages of signing a new labour memorandum of understanding (MoU), designed to streamline worker mobility and cooperation. ""Some provisions are already being implemented ahead of the formal signing,"" he noted.

The border bully,"IN
Social media added fuel to the fire.
As tensions between India and Pakistan momentarily ease, a deeper unease continues to fester, especially among those who live closest to the LoC. In Azad Kashmir, entire communities have once again been upended by a conflict they did not cause. These people bear the brunt of every cross-border escalation. During the recent skirmishes, over 30 lives were lost, more than 1,100 families were displaced, and hundreds of homes were destroyed. Even now, with a fragile ceasefire in place, children carry invisible psychological scars, and the dread of renewed violence hangs thick in the air.
Meanwhile, Indian television channels continue to fuel the fire. Instead of welcoming the ceasefire, several news anchors and talk show hosts appear to be more interested in inciting further aggression. Guests scream for retribution. Hashtags trend are calling for war. There's something deeply disturbing about watching a media ecosystem treat the prospect of large-scale violence as entertainment. This isn't journalism - it's provocation dressed as patriotism.
The hysteria began almost immediately after the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, a popular tourist spot in Indian-occupied Kashmir. Without waiting for any investigation, many Indian news outlets - most of them backed by powerful business interests with ties to the ruling Hindu nationalist party - pointed fingers at Pakistan. Some even went so far as to suggest military strikes before the Indian government had made any official statement.
Social media added fuel to the fire. From across the border came a flood of memes and hate-filled posts aimed at Pakistanis. For me, it was especially disheartening. As a law graduate from the United States, I shared classrooms and dormitories with Indian students. We were taught the values of peace, equality, and respect for all nationalities. To see some of those same people reposting venomous content online is deeply unsettling. It felt like the war wasn't just being fought in the skies or at the borders, but on timelines, newsfeeds and WhatsApp groups. Even prominent artists - usually voices of peace and cultural diplomacy - joined the chorus of hostility. Some, ironically designated as UN Ambassadors for Peace, fanned the flames instead of promoting calm. These dark days have shown how deeply hate can penetrate even the most idealistic circles.
Unsurprisingly, India's leadership has struggled to sell the ceasefire as a win. The lack of a decisive military success, combined with domestic political pressures, has led to fears that further escalation may still be on the table, and the Indian aggressor may strike Pakistan with greater force. In Pakistan, the mood has been one of pride, especially after the air force successfully downed Indian aircraft in retaliation - an act New Delhi refused to acknowledge. But even amid that pride, we must remember: there is no glory in war. Victory, if one dares to call it that, comes with funerals and broken homes.
The new normal that this conflict has introduced is alarming. Future tensions between India and Pakistan may no longer be limited to cross-border firing. Drone strikes, cyberattacks and covert operations are increasingly part of the strategic landscape. This escalation presents multiple new threats, and the primary victims will, as always, be ordinary civilians.
Pakistan must prepare for this evolving threat landscape, given that it has exercised considerable restraint. Even after the recent hijacking of the Jaffer Express in Balochistan - an attack that many believe was aided by Indian intelligence - Pakistan has not opted for indiscriminate retaliation. The involvement of convicted Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav in destabilising efforts across Balochistan only adds to the list of provocations.
India may have acted as the aggressor, but Pakistan has responded with caution and responsibility. Our response has been defensive, not expansionist. Our air force's success in repelling Indian attacks further reinforced our commitment to deterrence, not destruction.
War should not be glorified. It should be feared, avoided and condemned. Peace must not be framed as weakness, and diplomacy must never be drowned out by drumbeats of war.

Roots of Indian rage,"FR
It is in this general backdrop that two major ideologies slowly came to take centre stage in India.
Over the past four decades, India's state apparatus has slowly been sold off to private capital. Consequently, economic anxiety defines the daily experience of ordinary citizens - the collective frustration of which the BJP strategically redirects towards Muslims. A national-level hero's journey of resurgence must, it turns out, have a villain.
India's 1991 neoliberal economic reforms under Finance Minister Manmohan Singh entailed three primary initiatives: deregulation, privatisation, and trade liberalisation. The first involved slashing oversight on corporations: licensing requirements to set up industries were eliminated, production quotas were substantially eased, and firms were allowed to diversify and expand without needing government approvals. The second entailed divesting from state owned enterprises. Major entities - including BALCO, Hindustan Zinc, IPCL, VSNL (now Tata Communications Limited) and many more - were sold to private parties over the subsequent decade. The third involved discontinuing 'artificial' import restrictions and state-led export promotion initiatives in an effort to integrate into global 'free' markets. More broadly, corporate taxes were slashed, interest rates deregulated, and restrictions on foreign direct investment lifted. Collectively, these measures led to improvements in surface level economic indicators. GDP growth, a better managed fiscal account, and the strengthening of trade relations were all observed. On the other hand, however, inequalities surged.
With fewer checks on corporations, collective bargaining via trade unions and farmer associations weakened - and workers were left to fend for themselves in a dog-eat-dog modality. Government funds were systematically redirected away from education, healthcare, and food/fertiliser subsidy programmes, especially under the BJP. With state support gutted, stable employment became the sole lifeline for most: making for a hyper-competitive job market with no room for slip-ups. Employers exploited this by demanding unpaid overtime, while some employees voluntarily extended their hours in the hopes of sustaining a 'respectable' lifestyle. All this, combined with rising average commute times to and from work, eroded space for leisure. The result was a declining public interest in art, literature, and intellectual engagement. Book reading was slowly replaced with mindless 'doom scrolling' on apps like Instagram, and academic/cultural conferences became less popular over time - in their stead appearing fleeting pastimes such as 'e-sports' (PC/console gaming) and the consumption of pornography, for which India ranked #3 in the world in 2024 with 30.75 billion views. Low self-esteem, rampant misogyny, and declining levels of critical thinking ability were all consequences.
According to data from the World Inequality Index, India's top 1% increased its income share from 10.2% in 1991 to 22.6% in 2022, whereas its share of wealth shot up from 16.1% to a whopping 40.1% during the same period. Conversely, the bottom 50% saw income and wealth shares drop from 22.2% to 15%, and 8.8% to 6.5%, respectively. In effect, resources were painstakingly redistributed from lower and lower-middle classes to the upper echelons of society. This rapidly transforming economic landscape, combined with the rise of digital connectivity, led to the erosion of communal bonds. Extended families were replaced with nuclear ones. Social gatherings became less frequent, eventually being transposed to the virtual realm. Religious occasions such as Holi and Diwali were ironically less about the reinforcement of deep sacred values of equity, compassion, and spiritual renewal, and more about escapism from cutthroat capitalism via consumer excess: presents, dance parties, and mass indulgence in drugs and alcohol. Isolation, frustration, emptiness, and resentment defined the daily experience of most non-propertied citizens.
It is in this general backdrop that two major ideologies slowly came to take centre stage in India. The first, hyper-nationalism, was fueled by the desperate desire for some sort of respect and belonging. This was represented by Hindutva - a belief that the nation belonged primarily to Hindus and existed to serve them. BJP was always its primary torchbearer, and its original 'moment of glory' was the destruction of the Babri Mosque in 1992, the intention behind which was to replace it with a temple dedicated to Rama, a Hindu deity. The event, led by RSS and BJP - triggered a particular kind of catharsis in both participants and observers, catapulting Hindutva to the political mainstream for subsequent years and decades. Sure enough, by 1998, BJP was able to form its first coalition government under AB Vajpayee. Over the years, and particularly following the 9/11 attacks, BJP presented the 'Muslim' as the source of all - or most - troubles - a convenient scapegoat to detract from rapidly expanding economic vulnerabilities. In 2002, the horrific Gujarat Massacre took place under the watch of Narendra Modi, then Chief Minister of the state. Approximately 800 Muslims were slaughtered, demonstrating that the nascent Prime Minister was more than just talk: he was the 'strongman' that would revive past glories and show no mercy to his adversaries. All while continuing to push anti-poor policies, crippling the most vulnerable - Hindus included.
The second ideology, which rose to global presence post 2010 alongside social media ubiquity, was postmodernism: the prioritisation of subjective experience over 'empirical' (quantifiable, verifiable) reality. The BJP's general communication is heavily reliant on precisely this. The unregulated Indian media's disinformation campaign on 9th May is an accurate recent manifestation. It is also why Indian authorities have continued to evade the demand on them to offer evidence for Pakistan's alleged involvement in Pahalgam, and why they have insisted on dragging the 'Muslim terrorist' trope from the War on Terror to this day despite its obvious irrelevance. For authoritarians like Modi, who rely exclusively on stoking myopic, hateful tribalism as a strategy to detract from worsening material conditions, postmodernism has been a godsend. With it, ruling elites can rest assured their economic exploitation is never brought into the limelight. Since 2014, Modi has made Indian Hindus feel a visceral animosity for Muslims that far exceeds that of bygone years. What was contempt yesterday is bloodlust today. And 'limited conflicts' scratch that itch unlike anything else. Voters in Bihar, scheduled for elections this year (what a coincidence!), must have watched the recent ordeal closely.
In many ways, the India of 2025 represents a worst-case scenario and cautionary tale for countries in the Global South, including Pakistan, that have been experimenting with neoliberal ideology to shape economic policy. Democracies cannot survive runaway economic inequality.

"Cinemas struggle as LEDs, mobile take over","GB
People believe technology has reshaped entertainment
The traditional cinema experience is rapidly losing its charm, as audiences increasingly turn to LEDs and mobile screens to watch their favourite films. The once-thriving charm of crowded theatres and the magic of the big screen is slowly fading.
This shift in viewer preferences has raised concerns about the future of cinema in Pakistan, with the industry facing a significant challenge in maintaining its relevance. At the core of this change is the rise of affordable smartphones and LED TVs, which have revolutionised how people consume entertainment.
With the convenience of streaming movies and shows anytime, audiences are no longer restricted by cinema schedules, making home viewing a far more attractive option.
Film enthusiast Sohail Khan said, ""People prefer watching movies on their terms, without the hassle of theatre timings and crowds. I prefer watching movies on my mobileit's convenient and cosy."" He pointed out how technological advancements have fundamentally reshaped entertainment consumption.
Another avid viewer, Ihsan Sikander, added, ""LEDs offer a better viewing experience, and cinemas are still overpriced. Why would I spend money on expensive tickets when I can enjoy the same film from home?"" He suggested that cinemas need to reinvent themselves to remain competitive against home entertainment options.
Cinema owner Mukhtar Baig acknowledged the decline in footfall at theatres, attributing it to the rise of streaming services and affordable tech. ""Theatres must adapt to evolving viewer habits and offer unique, immersive experiences,"" he said. ""This shift in preferences poses serious questions about the future of cinema in the country.""
As streaming becomes the norm, stakeholders agree that traditional cinema must innovate to survive in a changing entertainment landscape.

Jerusalem annual 'Flag March' descends into chaos,"US
Far-right Israelis confront Palestinians, other left-wing Israelis
A large rally in Jerusalem marking Israel's capture of the city's east in a 1967 war descended into chaos on Monday as far-right Israeli Jews confronted and assaulted Palestinians, fellow Israelis and journalists, witnesses said.
The annual ""Flag March"" drew thousands chanting, dancing and waving Israeli flags shortly after far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir visited the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, a longtime flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
Violence broke out in the walled Old City of East Jerusalem shortly after midday, a Reuters witness said, when young marchers began harassing the few Palestinian shopkeepers who had yet to shutter their stores ahead of the rally.
The marchers, mostly young Israelis who live in settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, then began to target Israeli left-wing activists and journalists observing the rally.
The demonstrators shouted nationalistic slogans and called for violence against Palestinians, chanting: ""Death to Arabs"".
A Palestinian woman and journalists were spat on by a group of young settlers, and nearby Israeli police did not intervene, the Reuters witness said. Police officials did not respond to a request for comment.
No arrests were reported as of late afternoon. A police officer at the scene said young Israeli marchers could not be arrested because they were under the age of 18.
Moshe, a 35-year-old Israeli settler from the West Bank and supporter of the current right-wing government, walked through a Palestinian neighbourhood of the Old City with a rifle slung over his shoulder and his daughter on his shoulders. It was a ""very happy day"" because all of Jerusalem was ""under the government of Israel,"" he said, declining to give his last name.
Left-wing opposition leader Yair Golan, a former armed forces deputy commander, described images of violence in the Old City as ""shocking"". He said in a statement: ""This is not what loving Jerusalem looks like. This is what hatred, racism and bullying look like.""
""We will keep Jerusalem united, whole, and under Israeli sovereignty,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting held in East Jerusalem earlier on Monday.
A spokesperson for the Palestinian presidency based in the West Bank condemned the march and Ben Gvir's visit to Al-Aqsa. Israel's ongoing war in Gaza, ""repeated incursions into the Al-Aqsa mosque compound and provocative acts such as raising the Israeli flag in occupied Jerusalem threaten the stability of the entire region,"" Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a statement.
Clashes flared throughout the day as left-wing Israeli activists intervened to escort Palestinians away from young far-right Israeli Jews threatening passersby, witnesses said. Journalists covering the rally were repeatedly harassed and in some instances assaulted, the Reuters witness said. Reuters

Industrialists urge tax reforms,"PK
Calls grow for ending harassment, introducing business-friendly policies
Industrialists urged the government to widen its tax network instead of introducing new taxes and discouraging upright taxpayers including businesspeople and the salaried class.
They also demanded that the tax collection body and the body introducing new taxes should be two different organisations so that already-registered taxpayers cannot be pressurised. Once the tax collection target is not notched, new taxes are imposed on existing taxpayers instead of bringing new ones into the tax net.
On top of that, salaries and privileges of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials should depend on their performance and achievement of tax collection targets.
SITE Superhighway Association of Industries (SSHAI) President Masood Pervaiz said the government should focus on capital generation and broadening the taxpayer base to scale up its overall revenue pie rather than increasing taxes on industries and businessmen.
It is contradictory that the government imposes new ways to generate taxes from existing taxpayers, who are already contributing to the national exchequer, while increasing its own luxury expenses, including taxes and imported cars.
To enhance revenues and export receipts, the government should reduce the overall cost of utilities to make Pakistani products more competitive in the international market, especially considering the country has one of the lowest labour costs in the world.
The next budget for 2025-26 should be public-friendly at all costs, and the tax target should be set against the real income of the government rather than an ambitious goal that ultimately burdens taxpayers, he said. The government should focus on promoting industrial and manufacturing sectors to enhance exports, rather than just supporting manpower exports which drain future talent.
Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders & Small Industry (HCSTSI) former president Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani urged the government to make the upcoming federal budget truly reflective of the ground realities faced by the business community, especially SMEs and traders of Hyderabad. He emphasised that the SME sector, which significantly contributes to the national economy, deserves priority treatment through inclusive and growth-driven policies.
Shaikhani stated that the FBR must shift from coercive tactics to facilitation-based reforms. Simplified tax procedures, a reduction in turnover taxes, and an end to harassment will boost business confidence. A unified, trader-friendly tax system with digital one-window operations should be introduced to widen the tax net without intimidation.
He demanded allocation of funds for establishing new industrial zones in Hyderabad. He pointed out that despite its potential, Hyderabad remains deprived of modern infrastructure. Upgrading industrial areas like SITE with gas, electricity, and roads will encourage investment and job creation.
He also called for targeted subsidies on electricity and gas tariffs for industries. He warned that without affordable energy, small industries cannot survive. He stressed that Pakistan's exports require strong support through simplified refund processes, export incentives, and participation in international trade events.
Shaikhani also asked the government to include SME financing schemes, revival of sick units, and a one-time amnesty for undocumented businesses. He reiterated that the budget must be business-centric and that the traders of Hyderabad are ready to support the government in economic revivalif their voice is heard and respected.
Federal B Areas Association of Trade and Industries (FBATI) spokesperson and eminent industrialist Syed Raza Hussain said the government should introduce business-friendly policies in the next budget to enhance the overall production of industries and exports on a long-term basis.
The government should improve the business climate of the country, including reducing the cost of production, promoting ease of doing business, and facilitating industrialists and businessmen with tax incentives and low-markup financing schemes.
He mentioned that the government should withdraw tax policies that hurt the trust and confidence of industrialists, which are tantamount to discouraging local and foreign investment in the country, especially at a time when the country is engaged in military conflict with its arch-rival.
He said the government should engage all stakeholders in consultations and design a comprehensive mega plan to enhance tax revenues and exports, attract investment, and generate jobs in different manufacturing sectors.

Revisiting a victor,"US
What we know about 'The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping'
Fans of The Hunger Games, the odds are generously in your favour. After showing us the conniving boy that became the vicious President Snow, the beloved dystopian film franchise is gearing up for another prequel - this one set some years after The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes.
Announced long before the 2025 release of its source material, The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping will serve as the film adaptation for Suzanne Collins' novel of the same name. As per The Hollywood Reporter, the book was first announced in June last year, which was shortly followed by news on the screen adaptation. Slated for a November 20, 2026 release, the film will be the latest in a franchise that has brought all preceding novels to the big screen.
Similar to The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Sunrise on the Reaping follows the youth of a character that the fans are familiar with, except this one is adored for aiding the protagonists as their Capitol-assigned mentor in the original books and films. Now, Haymitch Abernathy - tribute, friend, and rebel - will tell his own story.
District 12 lineup
Sunrise on the Reaping follows the 50th year of the annual Hunger Games, also known as the second Quarter Quell. In the Capitol's celebration of another 15-year lap, the Games introduce a fresh twist by doubling up on the usual 12 tributes that fight to the death each year.
This time around, two girls and two boys are reaped from each district, adding up to a total of 42 teenagers forced to endure the Capitol's cruel punishment. Unbeknownst to young Haymitch, his dictated participation is only the first step towards a long life of misfortune.
Leading a promising cast that appeases fans with every update, Joseph Zada will bring Haymitch to life on the big screen, along with Whitney Peak who will portray Haymitch's girlfriend, Lenore Dove Baird. Zada takes the torch from Woody Harrelson, who played the fan-favourite District 12 victor in the original quartet of films.
Aside from Zada and Peak, others actors representing District 12 include Ben Wang who plays Wyatt Callow, the second male tribute reaped from District 12, along with Mckenna Grace and Molly McCann who play the female tributes Maysilee Donner and Louella McCoy respectively. Additionally, Iona Bell will portray Lou Lou, the Capitol's chilling replacement for Louella.
Familiar names
The official Instagram account for The Hunger Games is announcing all cast members steadily. With a post dedicated to a character each, the videos show text from the novel disappearing until only the character's name remains. The page then burns to reveal the actor behind the respective character, prompting a flood of reactions to each cast member in the comments.
Portraying the tributes' band of allies are Kelvin Harrison Jr, Maya Hawke, and Lili Taylor, who play Beetee Latier, Wiress, and Mags Flanagan. Having previously appeared in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the characters were formerly played by Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and Lynn Cohen respectively.
Other familiar characters to be reintroduced in Sunrise on the Reaping are double agent Plutarch Heavensbee, President Coriolanus Snow, future Capitol escort Effie Trinket, and interviewer Caesar Flickerman.
Formerly portrayed by Elizabeth Banks in the films centered around Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, a younger version of the elaborately dressed Effie will be played by Maleficent star Elle Fanning. Meanwhile, Black Mirror star Jesse Plemons is set to play Plutarch, the Capitol insider who aids the district rebels in the future story. The role was originally portrayed by Philip Seymour Hoffman.
President Snow, who holds the record for appearing in every Hunger Games novel and film, will be brought to life this time by Conclave star Ralph Fiennes. The evil dictator was last seen as the protagonist of his own story in The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and was played by Tom Blyth, though the late Donald Sutherland famously portrayed him in his prime in the first four films.
The latest addition to the cast is Succession star Kieran Culkin, who will borrow the role of Caesar - the Capitol host who sits down with every tribute before the Games - from Stanley Tucci. ""Kieran's scene-stealing presence and undeniable charm are perfect for Caesar Flickerman, the sickeningly watchable host of Panem's darkest spectacle. Stanley Tucci made Caesar unforgettable - and now Kieran will make the role entirely his own,"" said Lionsgate Motion Picture Group co-president Erin Westerman.
No surprises?
As per Variety, the novel Sunrise on the Reaping sold a staggering 1.5 million copies in its first week on sale in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, producing twice the first-week sales of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes and three times that of Mockingjay.
""After traveling with Coriolanus, who is endlessly manipulative and controlling, it was a relief to wear both Haymitch's voice and character. He has a much greater capacity for hope, love, and joy. More than Coriolanus - or Katniss, for that matter,"" Collins said.
Speaking of revisiting a character whose future the readers are already familiar with, the author added, ""It's another way to approach a story, but it has its advantages. If you look at Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, we learn in the prologue that the lovers will die. So you're really not focused on what's going to happen, but on how or why it happens.""

"Books for bros, not women","US
A UK publisher has vowed to focus on men only to drive up readership
One thing we can probably safely assume about Andrew Tate and his brigade of men's rights activists is that they probably do not have much time for casual reading, devoted as they are to bringing to the limelight that famously overlooked Y-chromosome demographic.
However, Tate and his band of merry men may doubtless be delighted to learn that starting June 2026, there will be at least one UK publisher committed to fuelling the dreams of male writers only, making one giant in the barren world of men's rights. Or least men's publishing. Conduit Books, founded by British novelist and critic Jude Cook, aims to focus on publishing literary fiction and memoirs exclusively by men.
""This new breed of young female authors ushered in a renaissance for literary fiction by women, giving rise to a situation where stories by new male authors are often overlooked, with a perception that the male voice is problematic,"" explained Cook to the Guardian.
As a taster for the high calibre of work we can expect from the male sector of human population, as opposed to the presumably frothy airport-novel variety being that is the domain of women, the Conduit Books website promises that the upcoming published material will be ""Ambitious. Humorous. Political. Cerebral."" Cook himself illustrates his and his fellow men's anguish best when he notes, ""Excitement and energy around new and adventurous fiction is around female authors – and this is only right as a timely corrective"".
Not all men
Before we award Cook's timely corrective a standing ovation and join him in side-eyeing new and exciting adventurous fiction penned by female authors (unworthy of the attention span of that vanishingly rare commodity: male readers), it is necessary to caution that sadly, it is not time for all men to celebrate. Males born before the nineties can put both their pens and their party hats away, because in addition to dragging sexism back into fashion as a necessary corrective measure, Conduit Books (treading the well-beaten path already paved by stalwarts of the fashion and entertainment industries) also seeks to remain committedly ageist. It is not just any old male writer who will do; Conduit Books' ideal man will be under the age of 35. If you, dear male writer with one foot in the grave, have just blown out the candles on your 36th birthday cake, I'm afraid the prospects are grim.
However, Cook stresses that he is by no means as exclusive as hopeful writers may be led to believe: Conduit Books is wide open for any writers who identify as queer, non-binary, neurodivergent, or persons of colour. Just not men who are too old, or women of any age. Or description.
Down with women
Old age pensioners aside, Cook maintains that granting men such special attention is a necessary measure in the wake of women writers flooding the market over the past 15 years. Whilst he concedes that this renaissance was born in the wake of a male-dominated literary scene in the '80s, '90s and early 2000s, he is determined to swing that pesky pendulum back the other way.
Cook's unspoken question is this: what on earth would possess your average male reader to pick up a book written by a woman? There is no singular answer for this, but Cook's fears are not his alone. As any Harry Potter fan is aware, JK Rowling herself was cautioned against using her first name Joanne when Philosopher's Stone was released in 1997 because her publisher feared that an audience of young boys would be unwilling to read a book penned by a woman. For the same reason, Robert Galbraith, Rowling's pseudonym for the Cormoran Strike books, too, is also decidedly male.
Cook may have had a UK-specific market in mind when he aired his sad, nostalgic thoughts on male representation on the days of yore, but it is certainly true that those prolific men enjoyed quite the reach. Twenty years ago, could any of us set foot at a Karachi thelay wala's stall without being bombarded by those special whisker-thin-paged pirated copies of John Grisham's courtroom dramas or Stephen King's magnum opus on murderous clowns? Judging by the average Pakistani millennial's voracious knowledge of the American legal system's brutal litigious leanings (thank you, Rainmaker and Runaway Jury) or the varying supernatural horrors wreaking havoc upon the hapless residents of Maine (King, this is your moment in the sun), it would be foolish to ignore the global tentacles of male Western authors. Men like King, Grisham, and even Dan Brown (can any of us forget the literature lover's mania for the Mona Lisa circa 2004?) once reigned supreme. And now, to Cook's chagrin, thanks to the likes of Jodi Picoult and Emily Henry, that top spot has been encroached upon by women.
If we need any proof, we need only take a casual glance at this week's New York Times bestselling fiction list (print and E-book combined), which is positively contaminated by female names: Danielle L Jensen, Freida McFadden, Ocean Vuong, Emily Henry, and Kennedy Ryan. Picoult, that queen of modern literary fiction, is not on this week's list, but her 2024 bestselling novel titled By Any Other Name (Cook must have loved this) explored the theme of silenced female voices in history by focusing on the struggles of a modern playwright trying to get her work produced. In other words: with thriller-bestseller magnate Harlan Coben having turned his attention to Netflix instead of churning out more books, male bestsellers are in danger of extinction as women refuse to budge from the top.
Has the world gone mad?
Have we already reached that saturation point where, in an effort to dismantle centuries'-old patriarchy, we have gone so far the other way that, as Cook hints (but does not say), men's rights are being eviscerated? In a world that already contains Tate and his fanclub, it should hardly come as a surprise that the world of literature, too, should turn the spotlight on diminishing male representation. The sacred treasurers of men's rights around the world have always stood guard for their gender, a fact that is beautifully evident in Pakistani dramas glorifying a ""working woman"" trotting out a five-course meal for her in-laws after a busy day at work.
Cook may have never heard of Pakistani dramas and their utmost regard for the male gender, but he is no wallflower when it comes to looking out for his fellow men. He laments that male-centric narratives such as fatherhood, masculinity and negotiating the 21st century as a man have all taken a backseat as the publishing world's focus remains fixed on women.
Does our hero have a point? Can only a man lure another man into picking up a work of fiction? Is the work of a woman unworthy of being read by a man? Is dick lit the answer to chick lit? Judging by the depleting number of adult males who read fiction by choice, perhaps Cook, the Emmeline Pankhurst of male readers, may have unlocked the only doorway to dragging lit bros back into the light.

Polio campaign launched to immunise over 10m children,"US
80,000 health workers mobilised across 30 districts as part of national effort
The Sindh government's Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) has launched a province-wide anti-polio campaign, which will continue until June one.
According to the EOC Sindh spokesperson, the campaign aims to vaccinate over 10.6 million children under the age of five across 30 districts of the province.
More than 80,000 trained polio workers will go door to door to administer the drops, supported by 25,539 security personnel. In addition to polio drops, children aged six to 59 months will also receive Vitamin A supplements to help boost their immunity.
Following successful rounds in February and April, this phase is considered crucial in strengthening nationwide efforts to eradicate the poliovirus. Although significant progress has been made, environmental samples from districts like Karachi, Hyderabad, and Larkana still show traces of the virus.
So far, four polio cases have been reported in Sindh this year.
The spokesperson emphasised that as long as the poliovirus exists anywhere in the world, it remains a threat to our children.
This campaign reflects our collective commitment to reaching every child and eliminating polio for good.
The campaign is currently underway in 1,292 union councils across Sindh, where district administrations, the health department, and partner organisations are actively supporting polio teams.
EOC Sindh urges parents, teachers, religious scholars, media, and community leaders to play a proactive role in this national cause.
If a child has missed their polio drops, citizens are encouraged to call the helpline at 1166 or send a WhatsApp message to 0346-7776546.

Sugar data collection system planned,"US
Decisions on export, import will be based on real-time data from new mechanism
Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain chaired a high-level meeting on Monday to review and assess the country's sugar stock situation.
The meeting was attended by relevant stakeholders and senior officials from the food security ministry and the departments concerned.
In a major step towards ensuring transparency and efficiency in sugar sector management, the stakeholders decided to establish a mutually agreed data collection system and monitoring mechanism. These systems will be instrumental in accurately tracing the per-acre yield and overall production of sugarcane across the country, according to a press statement issued by the ministry.
Speaking on the occasion, the federal minister emphasised the importance of reliable and real-time data. He said that decisions regarding the import and export of sugar would henceforth be based on verifiable data collected through the new system. ""This will help stabilise domestic markets and safeguard the interests of both farmers and consumers.""
The minister directed all departments to work in close coordination to finalise and implement the proposed systems at the earliest, which would ensure uniformity, transparency and accountability in sugar sector management. The meeting affirmed the food security ministry's resolve to enhance policy decisions through data-driven approaches and to foster a sustainable agricultural economy.

"Servicemen, civilians to get equal pay raise","US
Aurangzeb says govt will simplify returns filing process for salaried class
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Monday that there was no proposal in the budget to increase salaries of the armed forces more than the civilian government employees and assured that the nation's defence needs would be fully met.
In a media interaction after attending a seminar, the finance minister also said that India did not leave any stone unturned to derail Pakistan's $7 billion package but it could not succeed. ""There is so far no such proposal"" for increasing the defence salaries more than that of the civilian employees, the finance minister said, responding to a question.
The statement clears the air after rumours swirled suggesting that the government was considering significant increase in the salaries of the armed forces. The government is considering a proposal to increase salaries in the range of 6% to 10% due to low single digit inflation rate.
While responding to another question, Aurangzeb said that whatever support the government could provide for meeting the defence needs would be fully provided. ""This is about meeting the needs of the country, not just meeting the needs of the armed forces of Pakistan,"" he added.
The finance minister also talked about malicious Indian designs to choke Pakistan's external financing.
""There is immense support by the IMF despite the kind of efforts [India made] to derail the IMF programme,"" he said and added that had there been shortcomings in the implementation of the programme, there would have been some problems.
Pakistan's case was discussed and approved on merit, because it met all the quantitative and structural benchmarks, he said. ""These are very tense moments. The entire nation has rightly celebrated the way our armed forces and political leadership have stood up against aggression,"" he continued.
""There was no stone left unturned in terms of ensuring that the meeting with the IMF does not happen and if the meeting does happen, then these items are not on the agenda, whether it's the second tranche under the Extended Fund Facility or the $1.3 billion under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF),"" the minister said.
""However, we are beyond that, and our case was discussed and decided on merit.""
Addressing an event, organized by the Karandaaz Pakistan and the Pakistan Banks Association (PBA) in Islamabad, Aurangzeb said that the federal government was preparing to introduce ""bold measures"" in the upcoming budget with a focus on strategic direction. ""We are going to bring some bold measures during the budget for FY 2025-26,"" he said.
He said that rather than making the math work, the government intended to make the budget document more strategic. The federal budget for FY 2025-26 will be presented on June 10, 2025 and the Economic Survey will be launched a day earlier.
To yet another question about the delay in concluding IMF talks, the finance minister said that the IMF talks would continue next week virtually, but the main discussions had already taken place.
He said that the government had achieved macroeconomic stability in the past too but ""we have squandered"" the opportunity. ""Because it is easy to get into a sugar rush, ie pump liquidity into the market, go for consumption-led growth,"" which triggered balance of payment and FX issues, he said.
To break away from the boom and bust cycle, Aurangzeb said, Pakistan needed to stay the course in terms of structural reforms. He stressed that the government remained committed to simplifying tax return filing process for the salaried class.
He added that 70 to 80% of the salaried class did not necessarily hold equity or income portfolios and they should not be required to fill 150 columns. ""We are trying to bring it down to nine items, five on the wealth and four on the income tax side."" The minister added that the government wanted to implement a simplified process by the end of September.
The finance minister admitted that the government could not perform well on the state-owned enterprises reform in the last year but hoped that the agenda would be expedited in the new fiscal year. He said that the PIA transaction had been launched again and expressed optimism about its completion.
On debt servicing, Aurangzeb said that in the ongoing fiscal the government debt servicing cost had decreased by Rs1 trillion but stated that it was not a success, as the reduction was because of reduction in the interest rates. ""Next year, we are going to restructure and reorganise the debt management office along modern lines,"" he said.
Aurangzeb termed the country's economy crossing the $400 billion mark as a matter of satisfaction. ""Our economy has crossed the $400 billion level. This shows we're moving in the right direction"", he added. But he argued that to become a $3 trillion economy by 2047, Pakistan needed to tackle the challenges of 2.6% population growth rate and climate change.

'Raza's commitment a reflection of his passion and loyalty to Qalandars'
Former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Ramiz Raja on Monday lavished praise on Sikandar Raza for his match-winning performance and unwavering commitment that played a crucial role in Lahore Qalandars' triumph in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10 final.
Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ramiz commended Raza's extraordinary dedication, revealing that the Zimbabwean all-rounder changed multiple flights just to make it to the match in time.
""The way Sikandar showed commitment is truly admirable. He not only managed to reach Pakistan against the odds but also played and led his team to victory,"" Ramiz said.
The 62-year-old added that while the win was a team effort, Raza's performance stood out.
""Sikandar Raza played a phenomenal innings in the final. Every player contributed, but he added the winning spark. Perera also played a fantastic knock and played his part in the win,"" he added.
Ramiz revealed behind-the-scenes details, noting that Raza arrived in Lahore just hours before the final.
""Lahore Qalandars had prepared two squad listsone with Sikandar Raza and another with Shakib Al Hasan, in case Raza couldn't make it in time."" he revealed.
""He landed in Lahore around 6 PM on the day of the final. When he arrived at the ground, he bowled just three or four deliveries in the warm-up and then went straight onto the field,"" Ramiz shared.
The former PCB chief described Raza's commitment as a testament to his love for cricket and loyalty to the Lahore Qalandars.
""This is a remarkable example of dedication. It shows Sikandar's love for the game and the franchise. Lahore Qalandars, in return, take great care of their players, and we have all seen that,"" he said.

Injured Mustafizur out of Pak-BD T20s,"US
Left-arm pacer sustains clip fracture, to be replaced by Khaled Ahmed
Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman has been ruled out of Bangladesh's upcoming T20I series against Pakistan after injuring his left thumb during his final Indian Premier League (IPL) match. The left-arm pacer sustained a clip fracture, which will sideline him for at least two to three weeks.
According to team physio Delowar Hossain Siva, Mustafizur needs rest and rehabilitation.
""He suffered a clip fracture on his left thumb and won't be available for selection for the next two to three weeks,"" he said.
""We will conduct a follow-up evaluation after two weeks to monitor his recovery progress,"" he added.
In Mustafizur's absence, fast bowler Khaled Ahmed has been called up to the squad as his replacement.
Meanwhile, the three-match T20I series, originally set to begin on May 27, will now start on May 28 and run through June 1. All matches will be held at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium, with an 8:00 PM start time.
The change in schedule comes after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) requested a slight delay to help the players settle and train before the series. The arrived in Lahore on May 25 and will have two practice sessions on May 26 and 27.
This tour is also significant for Pakistan, as it marks the first assignment under new white-ball head coach Mike Hesson.
Despite some big names missing from Pakistan's squadincluding Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Afridithe selectors have opted for a blend of youth and experience based on recent performances in the HBL PSL. Notable inclusions are Hasan Ali, Hussain Talat, and Sahibzada Farhan. Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman also return after recovering from injuries.
The series was initially planned as a five-match contest, with games in both Lahore and Faisalabad. However, concerns within the Bangladesh camp led to the series being reduced to three games, all to be held in Lahore.
Players gather in Lahore
The third and final group of Bangladesh cricket team members, consisting of four players and support staff, arrived in Lahore on Monday ahead of the upcoming three-match T20I series against Pakistan.
This group of players includes Litton Das, Shoriful Islam, Najmul Hossain Shanto and Towhid Hridoy, along with members of the support staff. The Bangladesh squad arrived in Pakistan in three separate groups for the series.
Earlier, on Sunday, a 10-member contingent arrived in Lahore as part of the first phase. This group featured players such as Hasan Mahmud, Tanvir Islam, Parvez Hossain Emon, and Tanzim Hasan Sakib.
Originally, Bangladesh were scheduled to arrive on May 21 in two groups for a five-match T20I series, with the opening match planned for May 25 in Faisalabad.
However, due to logistical challenges and evolving security considerations, the tour was revised to a three-match series.
The decision to revise the schedule was finalized after a productive meeting between Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials, including chairman Nazmul Abedeen and President Farooq Ahmed.
Both boards reached a mutual agreement to proceed with the series under the revised plan. According to the updated schedule, all three T20 Internationals will be played at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore, on May 28, May 30, and June 1.
Squads
Pakistan: Salman Ali Agha (captain), Shadab Khan (vice-captain), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wicketkeeper), Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wicketkeeper), Saim Ayub.

Ukraine says hit by record drone salvo,"SG
Trump rebukes 'carzy' Putin over bombardment
Russia fired its biggest ever drone barrage on Ukraine, authorities said on Monday, just hours after Donald Trump called Vladimir Putin ""CRAZY"" and warned Moscow risked new sanctions if it kept up its deadly bombardment.
The US president has sought to broker an end to the three-year war, but has failed to extract major concessions from the Kremlin, despite repeated negotiations and several phone calls between him and Russia's president.
For three consecutive nights Russia has pummelled Ukraine with large-scale drone attacks, saturating its air defences and killing at least 13 people on Sunday, officials said.
Russia fired ""355 Shahed-type drones"" including decoys, in the largest drone attack of the invasion between Sunday night and early Monday, as well as nine cruise missiles, Ukraine's air force said.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Monday that there were ""no longer any range restrictions"" on arms supplied by Western allies to Ukraine, allowing Kyiv to attack ""military positions in Russia"".
It was not immediately clear when the decision was made nor which countries had changed their policy.
The Kremlin said any Western decision to lift range limits on arms delivered to Ukraine would be ""dangerous"" and ""at odds"" with peace efforts.
In a rare rebuke of the Russian leader, Trump said on social media late Sunday: ""I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!""
""I've always said that he wants ALL of Ukraine, not just a piece of it, and maybe that's proving to be right, but if he does, it will lead to the downfall of Russia!""
Earlier, Trump told reporters he was ""not happy"" about Russia's attacks on Ukraine and was ""absolutely"" considering increasing sanctions on Moscow.
French President Emmanuel Macron said he hoped Trump's anger at Moscow translated ""into action"", and that the US president realised Putin was not ready for peace.
The Kremlin played down Trump's criticism, saying Putin was taking measures ""necessary to ensure Russia's security"". ""This is a very critical moment, which is fraught with emotional stress for everyone, as well as emotional reactions,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the attacks showed Russia had a sense of ""impunity"".

Expert urges smart summer plans for kids,"US
.
As summer vacations approach, an education expert has advised the parents to consider engaging their kids in meaningful activities like educational travel, creative writing, AI learning and other skill-building pursuits, rather than investing in costly summer camps.
During a conversation with a local channel, education expert Sadia Amir emphasised the importance of engaging kids in meaningful activities during summer vacations. She recommended opting for skill-building pursuits like educational travel, creative writing and AI learning instead of investing in expensive summer camps.
By doing so, parents can provide their children with valuable learning experiences while also saving on costs, she added. Sadia Amir stressed that while the syllabus cannot be ignored, travel and skilful activities should also be accommodated during summer vacations, providing a balance between academics and extracurricular pursuits.
She suggested that working parents should prioritise spending quality time with their kids and allowing them to relax at home, rather than enrolling them in school or private summer camps, to promote a more relaxed and bonding-filled summer break.
The expert also emphasised the importance of fostering close relationships with family and loved ones, suggesting that nurturing these bonds is essential for emotional well-being and a healthy summer experience for kids.
Sadia expressed concern that many parents enrol their kids in summer camps at school or elsewhere as soon as summer break starts, which she believes can be detrimental to their well-being, depriving them of a much-needed break and relaxation time.

King Charles in Canada,"US
To open parliament tasked with countering Trump
King Charles III arrived in Ottawa Monday for a historic visit to open Canada's parliament, a brief trip seen as part of the pushback against US President Donald Trump's annexation threats.
The 76-year-old monarch, who is Canada's head of state as part of the Commonwealth, was greeted at the airport by Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has invited him to give an address opening Canada's new legislature.
The so-called throne speech outlining the government's priorities is typically given by the British monarch's representative in Canada, the governor general.
Queen Elizabeth II, the king's late mother, delivered a throne speech in Canada just twice during her long reign, in 1957 and 1977.
Charles, making his first visit to Canada since his coronation, has never commented on Trump's repeated talk of making Canada the 51st US state.
But he will be closely watched for any comments on Canada's sovereignty, and on trade.
Trump has slapped tariffs on Canadian goods including sector-specific levies on autos, steel and aluminum, rattling the Canadian economy, although he has suspended some of them pending negotiations.
Queen Camilla will accompany Charles on the 24-hour visit to Ottawa.
Carney has said his newly-elected government has been given a mandate ""to define a new economic and security relationship with the United States,"" a neighbor he believes Canada ""can no longer trust.""
He has promised to curb reliance on trade with the United States by boosting internal commerce while forging deeper economic ties with allies overseas.
The government's path to build up Canada and create new relationships will be outlined in Charles's speech, Carney said Monday.
""This historic honour matches the weight of our times,"" he said in a statement.
A government statement described the visit as ""a momentous and historic occasion that underscores Canada's identity and sovereignty as a constitutional monarchy.""
Trump repeatedly returned to his annexation musings during Carney's Oval Office visit earlier this month, insisting it would be a ""wonderful marriage"".
Carney stood his ground, saying Canada was ""never for sale.""
Trump's envoy to Canada, Ambassador Pete Hoekstra, dismissed the notion that inviting Charles to open parliament was an effective way to make a statement on annexation.
""If there's a message in there, there's easier ways to send messages. Just give me a call. Carney can call the president at any time,"" he told the public broadcaster CBC last week. AFP

'Open trade may hurt key sectors',"PK
Ministry opposes immediate opening of imports on fears of job losses
The Ministry of Industries has cautioned the federal government that its aggressive trade liberalisation plan may hurt at least 15 major job-creating sectors, urging phased implementation that excludes imported finished goods in the initial stage.
The warning came the day Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif convened a meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC) on June 9 to approve development and macroeconomic targets for the next fiscal year, just a day ahead of the federal budget announcement. The timing may challenge the planning ministry's ability to publish relevant documents based on NEC decisions just hours before the budget is presented.
According to sources, during a recent meeting of the steering committee overseeing the implementation of the new National Tariff Policy, multiple ministries advised against fully opening the economy to foreign competition in the upcoming fiscal year.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the meeting, although no official statement was issued afterward. The government plans to significantly reduce import duties starting next fiscal year as part of its broader trade liberalisation agenda. However, domestic industries have expressed reservations, prompting the prime minister to form a steering committee under Aurangzeb to review the potential fallout.
Sources said the Ministry of Industries urged the steering committee on Monday to reconsider the decision, recommending a gradual reduction in tariffs that starts with raw materials and intermediate goods rather than finished products.
The finance minister, however, stated that such decisions fell outside the steering committee's purview and should be raised directly with the prime minister. Some members disagreed, arguing that assessing the impact on vulnerable industries was well within the committee's mandate.
Under the current plan, customs duty slabs will be reduced to four levels: 0%, 5%, 10%, and 15%, down from the existing five-tier system that tops out at 20%.
The Ministry of Industries informed the committee that most industries fear the new policy may force closures. It identified at least 15 sectors likely to be adversely affected, including chemicals, polyester, iron and steel, automobiles, and ceramicsall of which are major job generators.
There are also concerns that a sudden opening of the economy could lead to a surge in imports, triggering a balance of payments crisis. The country's foreign exchange reserves are already under pressure, with the rupee's value slipping close to Rs284 against the US dollar. Additionally, difficulties have emerged in opening some letters of credit due to major debt repayments this month.
If external account pressure increases, the government may be forced to devalue the rupeea move in line with recommendations from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The Ministry of Commerce had initially proposed a six-tier duty structure0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, 12%, and 20%but the prime minister did not agree.
During the steering committee meeting, some members advocated for duty reductions on raw materials and intermediate goods first, cautioning against cutting tariffs on finished goods too soon. However, liberalisation proponents argued that deferring reductions on finished goods would make them harder to implement later during the five-year rollout.
The steering committee ultimately decided to revise the duty reduction plan by initially lowering tariffs on raw materials and intermediate goods only. A key point of contention was whether the estimated Rs200 billion in lost duties should be distributed across all duty slabs, including additional customs and regulatory duties. While relevant ministries pushed for a prudent rollout plan, private sector representatives called for uniform reductions across the board.
As per the government's plan, additional customs duties will be abolished over four years, starting with the upcoming budget, while regulatory duties will be phased out over five years. The Fifth Schedule of the Customs Actcovering imports of capital goods and industrial raw materialswill also be scrapped in five years.
One technical debate centered on why the duty on Purified Terephthalic Acid (PTA), a raw material used to produce other raw materials, was excluded from the reduction plan, even though a duty reduction for Polyester Staple Fiber, which is derived from PTA, was included.
New plan
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has convened the NEC meeting on June 9 to approve the Annual Development Plan and set macroeconomic targets for FY2025-26. The NEC, chaired by the prime minister and comprising the four provincial chief ministers, is responsible for approving federal and provincial development plans.
Sources said the government plans to set the GDP growth target at 4.2% for the next fiscal year, up from the disputed 2.7% figure for the current year. The initial draft of the new annual plan projects a cautiously optimistic outlook, with agriculture expected to post modest gains and the industrial sector poised for a stronger rebound. This is expected to be driven by improvements in large-scale manufacturing, better energy supply, and stability in the construction sector.
The Annual Plan 202526 is aligned with the ""URAAN Pakistan"" strategy, which aims to boost foreign exchange earnings through higher exports, increased remittances, and greater foreign direct investment. It is based on the export-led 5Es Framework, which prioritises diversification, global competitiveness, import substitution, innovation, Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs) development, and cluster-based industrial growth to reinforce the ""Made in Pakistan"" brand.
With these strategies, Pakistan seeks sustainable growth and greater resilience against external shocks.

PM backs Iran's right to peaceful N-programme,"IN
Shehbaz holds talks with Pezeshkian in Tehran. Thanks, Iran, for your support during the  India conflict
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday declared Pakistan's full support for Iran's right to have a civilian nuclear programme and assured Tehran that Islamabad would work with it on all issues of mutual concern.
Shehbaz arrived in Tehran on the second leg of his regional tour. He held talks with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian at Sa'dabad Palace. The prime minister also called on Iranian Supreme Leader Sayyed Ali Khamenei.
The prime minister was accompanied by Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Information Minister Attaullah Tarrar.
Following the delegation-level talks, Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Pezeshkian addressed the joint media stakeout. On the occasion, Shehbaz expressed gratitude to Iran for its support during the recent escalation between Pakistan and India.
The prime minister affirmed Pakistan's support for Iran's peaceful nuclear programme. ""We stand with our Iranian brothers and reaffirm our support for Iran's peaceful nuclear programme,"" he said. ""Pakistan fully supported Iran's right to have civilian nuclear programme.""
Shehbaz told the media that Pakistan stood by its brothers and sisters in Iran to promote peace, progress and prosperity. He assured the Iranian leadership that Pakistan would work with Iran on all issues of mutual concern.
The prime minister stated that Pakistan came out of the recent crisis with India as victorious because of ""the brave actions of our outstanding armed forces"", who were strongly supported by the people of Pakistan. He repeated his offer of talks with India for the sake of peace in the region.
""We want peace and we will work for peace in the region through talks  and resolve our outstanding issues, including Kashmir, according to the United Nations Security Council resolutions which were acknowledged even by the Indian Lok Sabha when Nehru was the prime minister of India,"" he said.
""For the sake of peace, we are ready for talk on different issues, including water, trade and also counter-terrorism if India is serious,"" he added. ""If they accept our offer, we want to talk for the sake of peace. If India remains aggressive, Pakistan shall defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" he warned.
Earlier, Shehbaz and Pezeshkian held wide ranging talks. Both sides resolved to enhance cooperation to boost bilateral trade and investment and work together for maintaining peace and security in the region. Shehbaz told the media that he had a productive meeting with President Pezeshkian.
""There was total agreement that the two brotherly neigbouring countries must enhance cooperation in diverse fields including trade, investment and economy,"" he said. ""We have decided to transform these relations into a very productive cooperation.""
While welcoming the prime minister and his delegation, the Iranian president said that the two countries should cooperate on making their borders secure from the activities of terrorists and criminal groups. He said that peaceful bilateral relations were in the interest of the two countries.
The president welcomed the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, saying that settling issues through dialogue was essential for stability in the region. He urged both sides to have positive consultations with each other and with international partners.
The Iranian president told reporters that the two sides discussed issues facing the Islamic world and the top priority was the issue of Palestine. ""As always we support the cause of Palestine and condemn the atrocities carried out by Israel,"" he added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz said that Pakistan condemned Israeli actions which were causing untold misery for the people of Gaza, where more than 50,000 Palestinians were murdered by the Israel forces. ""It is high time that the international community uses its influence to bring lasting ceasefire in Palestine.""
Meeting with Khamenei
Later, the prime minister, along with his delegation, paid a courtesy call on Iranian Supreme Leader Dr Sayyed Ali Khamenei and briefed him about recent conflict with India, and India's hegemonic and revisionist designs. He thanked the leadership of Iran for supporting Pakistan against Indian aggression.
He also briefed the Supreme Leader about the steps taken to elevate Pakistan-Iran ties to the highest levels and maintained that his government was committed to further deepen strategic cooperation with Iran in the complex geo-political times.
Dr Khamenei appreciated the efforts of Prime Minister Shehbaz in promoting regional peace and stability with farsightedness. He praised his personal commitment to further strengthen Pakistan-Iran relations and prayed for greater prosperity, growth, and development of Pakistan and its people.
$10 billion trade
Prior to his visit to Tehran, Prime Minister Shehbaz said in an interview with IRNA that the trade between Pakistan and Iran had witnessed a significant increase in the past three to four years, adding that it would be taken to $10 billion in the next few years from the current $3 billion.
""We want to take it up to $10 billion in the next few years, but I think the potential is much greater than that as well. We are discussing signing a free trade agreement [FTA]. I think in the next 10 years, the trade volume between the two countries will expand a great deal,"" he said.
For that purpose, the prime minister stressed the need for having sustained economic engagements in the long-term. ""I personally believe that strong economic linkage between Pakistan's Balochistan and Iran's Sistan-Baluchestan  can be very effective in dealing with terrorism,"" he added.
Speaking about his Iran's visit, the prime minister said that the objective of his visit was to thank Iran for supporting and standing by Pakistan during the conflict with India. ""I want to thank Iranian leadership for its support and its offer for mediation, which we accepted but India rejected,"" he added.
Responding to a question, he said that there could be no peace and justice in the region till resolution of the Kashmir and the Palestine issues, reiterating that it was critically important that these issues should be resolved in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri and the Palestinian peoples.
When asked about Iran-US talks, the prime minister said that the negotiations, diplomacy and engagement were the best solutions. ""I have great faith in Iran's leadership. I am quite hopeful that positive things will come out of these negotiations.""

Why Awami League banned again,"US
The ban on Awami League will have three major ramifications
Awami League, the majority party in the December 1970 general elections in Pakistan, was banned on March 26, 1971 when President General Yahya Khan refused to transfer power to the party. The banned League launched freedom movement and succeeded in carving the state of Bangladesh out of Pakistan. Thus, Awami League emerged as the founder party of Bangladesh, but ironically Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rehman in January 1975 banned all political parties including, Awami League, and established one-party system in the newly-established country under Baksal party. Years after Mujib's assassination in August 1975, his daughter Sheikh Hasina revived Awami League and managed to come to power in 1996. Later, in 2009, Hasina assumed power for a second time and continued to lead the country till August 2024 when she had to escape to India due to a popular movement against her government. In May 2025, the interim government of Dr Muhammad Yunus banned the League.
Despite Hasina's autocratic and repressive rule spanning more than 15 years, Awami League still has its support base in Bangladesh. Thus the ban on the party might be counter-productive. In its May 12, 2025 issue, The Diplomat writes, ""Bangladesh's interim government has banned all activities, including the online presence, of the Awami League (AL), led by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, until the ongoing trials for crimes against humanity and genocide involving its leaders - these relate to the party's deadly crackdown on the July uprising of 2024 - are concluded.""
Why has the interim government banned Awami League and how will it impact the polarised politics of Bangladesh? Will Awami League resurface under the new name? What will be the implications of the ban?
When banned in March 1971 by the military regime in Pakistan, Awami League faced charges of sedition. Banned for the second time, in May 2025, the party is fighting allegations of extrajudicial killings and corruption for which its leaders, including former PM Hasina, are under trial.
The Diplomat further writes, ""The decision, which came nine months after Hasina's ouster from power by students-led mass protests, has been taken under the Anti-Terrorism Act, which was enacted by the AL back in 2009. The interim government banned the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the AL's notorious student wing, under the same act on October 23 last year. The ban on the AL marks a significant escalation in Bangladesh's turbulent political landscape. It also raises questions about the efficacy and implications of banning political parties in a country with a history of such measures.""
A few weeks ago, a massive demonstration held outside the residence of Dr Yunus by the newly formed National Citizens Party (NCP) and Jamaat-e-Islami demanded that Awami League be banned because of its role in crushing the student movement of July-August 2024 in which more than 1,400 people were killed. Surprisingly, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) also welcomed the ban on Awami League even though it had opposed it in October last year. New Delhi has also, quite understandably, criticised the ban, saying it undermines democracy and is meant to promote an exclusive mode of politics.
Despite the fall in Hasina's popularity, particularly due to her taking refuge in India, Awami League is not at all a dead horse and its role in Bangladeshi politics cannot be dismissed. The vacuum left behind due the ban on the League cannot be filed by NCP, Jamaat or BNP. The League will not remain under Hasina's influence forever, and a new leadership will emerge and try to restore its vote bank. As The Diplomat aptly remarked, ""The ban on the AL has major implications for Bangladesh. Its removal from the political arena leaves a vacuum in the ideological space once dominated by Bengali nationalism. Since before the country's independence, Bengali nationalism has been the AL's ideological cornerstone and a unifying political tool to justify its regime and marginalize opposition voices, especially those promoting religious or ethnic identity politics.""
The ban on Awami League will have three major ramifications:
One, the credibility of the caretaker government will dwindle because it has neither the mandate nor the legitimacy to take major policy decisions. Banning Bangladesh's founder party and attempting to erase Sheikh Mujib from the minds of people - by removing his picture from the currency notes - will not work. Furthermore, taking a decision under the influence of NCP or Jamaat reflects how fragile the caretaker government is. The reports that Dr Yunus wants to resign as the interim chief executive of the country also reflect how vulnerable the caretaker government has become due to the growing resentment against his failure to hold national elections.
Two, Awami League still has a network that is collaborating with India. It's because the decades of the League rule had deepened New Delhi's influence in Bangladeshi bureaucracy, judiciary and civil society. The League-RAW nexus is no secret and India's reaction to the ban on the League is understandable. Economic predicament of Bangladesh and the growing restrictions by New Delhi on trade shipments from Indian ports will have negative fallout on Dhaka. With Bangladesh surrounded by India from three sides and having to grapple with a colossal Indian influence on its media, civil society, bureaucracy and judiciary, the caretaker government of Dr Yunus will be unable to fully protect the sovereignty of Bangladesh. Hundreds and thousands of patients from Bangladesh seek medical treatment in Indian hospitals which may not be possible anymore because of the growing visa restrictions imposed by the Indian missions. China and Pakistan cannot be a substitute to Bangladeshi nationals in the context of medical treatment.
And three, the reports of a rift between the Bangladesh army chief and the caretaker chief executive reflect growing schism between the two pillars of power. The army chief is perturbed over the growing influence of Islamists in Bangladesh under the alleged patronage of the caretaker government. While BNP is demanding general elections this year, there are suspicions that the caretaker government wants to prolong its hold on power. In that case, Bangladesh will plunge into another phase of chaos and disorder.

Champions Barca thrash Bilbao,"US
Lewandowski scored brace in 3-0 victory
A rapid pair of goals by Robert Lewandowski early in the first half and a penalty by Dani Olmo deep in added time ensured a comfortable 3-0 victory for Barcelona over Athletic Bilbao on Sunday, ending the season on a high note for the LaLiga champions.
With the title clinched more than a week ago, Sunday's match at San Mames stadium had little at stake for either side.
Barcelona ended their LaLiga campaign at the summit with 88 points, four ahead of Real Madrid, with Atletico Madrid third on 76 points. Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal round out the top five, ensuring their places in next season's Champions League.
They are followed by Real Betis and Celta Vigo who will represent Spain in the Europa League while eighth-placed Rayo Vallecano booked a spot in the Conference League.
Barcelona manager Hansi Flick opted to rest several regular starters, including his top goalkeepers Wojciech Szczesny and Marc-Andre ter Stegen, giving third-choice keeper Inaki Pena his first start in more than four months.
However, the night belonged to Lewandowski, who put Barcelona ahead in the 14th minute. The Polish striker coolly controlled a pinpoint pass from Fermin Lopez, beating the offside trap before deftly lobbing the ball over goalkeeper Unai Simon. Four minutes later, Lewandowski doubled his tally, heading home from a corner after a clearance error by Athletic's midfielder Unai Gomez.
Despite the victory, Lewandowski fell short of matching Kylian Mbappe's 31 goals for the LaLiga season, missing a clear opportunity for a hat-trick shortly after the restart. He finished second in the LaLiga scoring race with 27 goals.
In the 92nd minute, Olmo was fouled inside the box and, with Lewandowski having been substituted three minutes before, it was the Spanish international who stepped up to fire a tidy shot from the spot and wrap up Barcelona's win.
""We knew it was the last game of the season and we had a plan to win it; we played well in the first half, we had everything under control all the way. It's almost the perfect season. Now let's enjoy the moment,"" Lewandowski told Movistar Plus.

'Judges' transfer cleared by 4 judicial forums',"US
CB says law secretary's clarification raises concerns
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Monday raised questions over the claim that transfer of three provincial high court judges to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) was interference on part of the executive in judicial affairs, noting that every transfer was made after approval of four different judges.
However, some members of the constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court, hearing petitions filed against the transfer and the subsequent change in the IHC judges' seniority list, stated the executive did keep the chief justicesof Pakistan and respective high courtsin dark about the seniority issue. On Monday, a five-member CB led by Justice Mazhar, heard the judges' transfer case.
During the hearing, Karachi Bar's lawyer Faisal Siddiqi argued that the IHC was established under Article 175 of the Constitution, which pertains only to the provinces regarding the appointment of judges.
He said judges cannot be transferred to the IHC, and even if a transfer does occur, it cannot be permanent nor would a fresh oath be required upon return of that judge to his original high court. Justice Mazhar asked whether Article 200 has become ineffective after the enforcement of Article 175-A. Siddiqi responded that under the current transfer system, the powers of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) are being undermined, which is against the spirit of the Constitution.
Siddiqi stated that seniority develops over decades and tampering with it overnight through executive powers is an authoritarian move.
Justice Mazhar noted that the transfer process involves approvals at four stages: the approval of the chief justice of the concerned high court, the approval of the chief justice of the receiving high court, the approval of the judge being transferred, and the approval of the chief justice of Pakistan.
""If any one of them refuses, the transfer cannot proceed. If the process were in the hands of the executive, it would be a different matter, but here it requires the approval of four judicial forums.""
Siddiqi told the court that the transfer was made with bad faith and that the judiciary was kept in the dark about the sensitive issue of seniority.
Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan argued that under Article 200, the transfer of judges can be permanent or temporary. A temporary transfer is mentioned in the notification and comes with additional benefits, while a permanent transfer entitles the judge to official residence.
Justice Shakeel Ahmed questioned whether the oath and seniority of judges are to be decided by the law secretary. He asked whether anyone had sought the law secretary's opinion on the matter. ""Why did the law secretary include clarifications on seniority and oath in the final summary?
He remarked that the need for the law secretary to clarify that transferred judges do not need to take a new oath raises concerns. The Supreme Court then adjourned the hearing until today (Tuesday).

Administration allows illegal construction near Governor's House,"US
Governor House spokesperson Faisal Farooqui said that the governor house has nothing to do with it.
On one hand, a 'grand operation' against illegal encroachments is underway in the city on the instructions of the commissioner Karachi, while on the other hand, encroachments are being erected on footpaths in the name of beautification by his subordinate administration. This type of encroachment was seen on main Abdullah Haroon Road in District South, adjacent to the governor house.
Such constructions have been carried out on the long footpath of the governor house from Metropole Hotel to Karachi Press Club roundabout blocking more than half of the footpath.
Governor House spokesperson Faisal Farooqui said that the governor house has nothing to do with it. This construction is being carried out by the administration of the concerned district on the instructions of the commissioner.
The Express Tribune tried to contact commissioner's spokesperson Ghulam Muhammad Khan in this regard, but he did not respond to phone calls and WhatsApp messages.
It may be noted that on the instructions of the commissioner, the concerned district administration is working on the beautification of Sharae Faisal and Abdullah Haroon Road. Citizens are surprised to see encroachments on the footpaths being established officially.
Because action is taken from time to time in the city to remove encroachments on sidewalks, such action was also taken two days ago on Abdullah Haroon Road near Zainab Market.

Bilawal slams PTI's 'fascist' govt in K-P,"US
Vows to continue struggle against 'corrupt and incompetent' administration
Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has accused the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government of trying to shield ""rampant corruption"" by blocking the PPP's peaceful protest, calling the move a failed attempt to suppress dissent.
In a statement, Bilawal condemned the use of tear gas against PPP's political workers, who had taken to the streets in K-P to protest against lawlessness and rising unemployment in the province.
""It is deeply regrettable that peaceful political workers were targeted with tear gas shelling,"" he said, adding, ""We are not the ones to be cowed by such cheap tactics. Our pursuit of this corrupt and incompetent provincial government will continue.""
The PPP chairman further lambasted the PTI-led K-P administration, terming its action against unarmed political activists as an act of cowardice. ""By unleashing violence on unarmed workers, the PTI government has shown its true colours,"" he added.
Bilawal said the 'Save the Province Movement' (Suba Bachao Tehreek) had now become the voice of every citizen of K-P. ""We will not be intimidated by batons and brute force,"" he asserted.
He maintained that PPP workers were fully prepared to confront the corrupt K-P government head-on. ""The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have now seen the real fascist face of the PTI's provincial government,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi also raised serious concerns regarding the performance of the provincial government, accusing it of widespread corruption and a failure to maintain law and order.
While speaking to journalists outside the Balochistan Assembly, Governor Kundi criticised the provincial government, claiming that key members of the provincial cabinet, including the chief executive, were involved in major financial misconduct.
He said that mismanagement and embezzlement involving billions of rupees had weakened the governance structure and left the public without relief.
He expressed alarm over the security situation, alleging that the provincial authorities had effectively ceded ground to militant elements. ""The public is suffering, but those in charge are not responding. Terrorist groups are acting freely, and the government appears incapable of stopping them,"" he added.
Referring to a recent bombing that claimed the lives of several children, the governor said the incident highlighted a pattern of repeated security failures.
He pointed out that similar attacks had taken place in the past, notably in Khyber, and lamented that vulnerable communities remained frequent targets of such violence.

Lions confiscated after social media stunt,"AT
Unlicensed big cats, illegal weapons spark Wildlife Act violations
Two African lions have been seized by the Punjab Wildlife Department after a viral TikTok video showed them being paraded through a residential neighbourhood in Gujranwala alongside firearms.
The wildlife department officials said the video featured a man identified as Luqman - known on social media as ""Loha"" - walking a chained lion through the Batala Sharam Singh area on the outskirts of the city.
Automatic weapons were also seen in the footage, prompting fears of both a potential animal attack and a threat to public safety.
Following the video's circulation online, Deputy Director Wildlife Rangers Gujranwala Region Sheikh Zahid Iqbal ordered immediate action.
Senior Wildlife Ranger Muhammad Umair led the investigation, tracing the incident to a private farmhouse where two African lions were being kept without a license or any legal documentation.
""No permits or registrations had been submitted to the department, as required under the Punjab Wildlife Act,"" said Ranger Umair.
A formal case has been registered against a man named Muhammad Akram, believed to be connected to the illegal possession. However, Luqman, the individual seen in the video, is still at large.
Under the amended Punjab Wildlife Act of 1974 - revised in 2025 - the private keeping and public display of big cats in residential areas is strictly prohibited. The act also criminalizes sharing social media content that features wildlife in ways that may endanger the animals or the public.
Officials emphasised that the lions have now been transferred to a certified wildlife breeding facility, and legal proceedings are underway. ""This is not just a violation of animal welfare lawsit's a public safety issue,"" said a spokesperson for the Wildlife Department.
""No one is above the law, and using wild animals for online fame will not be tolerated.""

"Trump attacks opponents, judges","US
Trump performed the traditional presidential duties on Memorial Day of visiting Arlington National Cemetery.
President Donald Trump marked the annual day for honoring the US war dead Monday by tearing into his ""scum"" opponents and judges who don't rule in his favor.
Trump performed the traditional presidential duties on Memorial Day of visiting Arlington National Cemetery -- the resting place for some 400,000 fallen soldiers and others.
And after laying a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Trump delivered a speech that likewise stuck mostly to the typical presidential script of praising US war heroes.
However, the 78-year-old Republican began his day with a lengthy, all-caps tirade on his Truth Social platform in which he declared: ""HAPPY MEMORIAL DAY TO ALL, INCLUDING THE SCUM THAT SPENT THE LAST FOUR YEARS TRYING TO DESTROY OUR COUNTRY.""
The post claimed that ""warped radical left minds"" had allowed in millions of illegal immigrants, ""many of them being criminals and the mentally insane.""
As well as blaming his political predecessors, Trump accused ""USA hating"" judges of being ""on a mission to keep murderers, drug dealers, rapists, gang members, and released prisoners from all over the world, in our country so they can rob, murder and rape again.""
Trump is locked in a series of court battles with federal judges who have repeatedly imposed temporary restraining orders to freeze potentially unconstitutional actions, pending further rulings.
With the Republican Party controlling Congress and rarely pushing back against the White House, the only significant remaining roadblocks to Trump's unprecedented drive to test constitutional norms are the courts.

Fury over police burial without consent,"US
Govt, judiciary, and nationalist leaders clash as court rebukes police in Moro incident
The controversy concerning the burial of a nationalist worker's dead body by police in Noushehro Feroze district has now embroiled the government, the judiciary and the nationalist parties, besides sparking an outrage in the province.
As the Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon spoke at length over the issue at a press conference on Monday, a court in Noushehero Feroze issued a show cause notice to the district's SSP over the burial.
The deceased Irfan Ali Laghari had sustained a fatal gunshot wound during the May 20 clash between the police and the nationalist workers in Moro and died on May 23 in a hospital in Hyderabad. The home minister Lanjar's house was also partially set ablaze on that day in Moro, a rural town of Noushehero Feroze.
Laghari's family, backed by the nationalist parties' leaders, is blaming the police for burying his body in Syed Muhammad Shah graveyard in Moro on May 24 without handing it over to them. The exercise was done amid a considerable police deployment.
This stance has provoked an indignation among the nationalists as well as the legal fraternity, depicting the police action as an unprecedented ruthlessness.
However, the police and the senior minister are refuting this charge. They claimed that they made several attempts to hand the body over to Laghari's family for burial but they refused while putting forward their demands for taking action against the district's police officers, quashing FIRs and releasing arrested persons.
Meanwhile, the Sessions Judge of Noushero Feroze Nadeem Badar Qazi on Monday issued a show cause notice to SSP Bashir Ahmed Brohi stating that the police made a false representation of the court's May 24 order. ""... this court never authorised you for burial [of the] dead body without handing it over to the legal heirs,"" the order reads.
""Your actions appear to be intentional, misleading and in direct contravention of the judicial order dated May 24 passed by this court."" The judge stated that the SSP was 'categorically' ordered to hand over the dead body to the legal heirs either through policemen or with the help of some NGO.
""No record has been produced by you to indicate that the legal heirs have refused to accept his dead body from you as well as through NGO."" The judge observed that it has come to the court's notice that it is circulating on social media concerning the court for having declared Laghari's body heirless.
""In fact the court has neither declared the dead body as heirless nor allowed you and police to bury the it without consent."" Police contend that they buried the body in the light of the court's May 24 order.
Meanwhile, in a joint statement on Monday the leaders of five factions of Jeay Sindh Tehreek described the provincial minister Sharjeel's press conference about Laghari's burial as misleading. They blamed the government for putting Lanjar house on fire to create a cause to start a violent crackdown on the peaceful protesters.

Faran Tahir won't fade to beige,"PK
Actor talks claiming identity and dodging stereotypes
Faran Tahir isn't here for watered-down representation. The Pakistani-American actor, best known for playing the menacing Raza in Iron Man, is steadily rewriting the Hollywood script for South Asian and Muslim actors, and doing it on his terms.
For Tahir, the goal has never been assimilation. It's about owning your identity, and using it as a strength. ""Some people see our colour or our faith as weaknesses,"" he told Jamal Ouazzani on the Saturday installment of the Jins podcast. ""But there's another way to look at it. These are your uniqueness. Find the strength in it rather than be dejected by it.""
In fact, his primary advice to young South Asian and Muslim actors is to learn to say no when you must, and show up when it matters. ""We see doctors, cab drivers, storekeepers, people from our part of the world are part of this reality. We need to show our identity and own our identity."" And always have the conversation, even if you don't win. ""That idea, that concept, it stays. Maybe next time, it lands.""
""When I started, there weren't too many good roles we could bring our talents to,"" he recalled. ""And there was not enough choice of talent."" Rather than accept the one-dimensional parts often thrown his way, Tahir leaned into theatre, where he could tackle complex roles and grow as an artist. ""If I could handle verse, do Shakespeare, there was a place for actors like me.""
His breakout role in Iron Man was a tightrope walk. Playing a villain while being visibly Muslim required nuance. ""I wanted to strip away any real allusions to faith. Raza was a mercenary, a soldier of fortune, not a religious zealot,"" he explained. By adding linguistic and cultural ambiguity, he worked with the production to avoid lazy tropes. ""Worldliness was important to me rather than making the character a savage.""
Still, the grind isn't easy. ""Not all work is good work,"" he said bluntly. Tahir chooses roles that let him sleep at night. ""If I can't look at myself in the mirror when I wake up, I shouldn't be doing it."" He's found stability through voice acting, television, and theatre, work that gives him the freedom to say no.
Hollywood, in Tahir's world, is a global stage. ""These colours we bring to stories? They're not invaluable. They are the story.""

Around 60% of serious cases lack complete challans
The performance of police investigation teams in Rawalpindi during the first four months of 2025 has been described as deeply disappointing, with only a fraction of case challans (charge sheets) submitted within the stipulated timeframe.
From January 1 to April 30, a total of 16,195 cases were registered across 30 police stations in the district. However, 60pc of serious casesincluding those involving murder, attempted murder, abduction, sexual assault, robbery, and narcoticswere not followed by complete challans.
Instead, investigating officers submitted incomplete reports, creating an illusion of performance for senior officials.
In this period, police recorded 100 murder cases, 212 attempted murder cases, 520 cases of women abduction, 51 cases of rape or sexual abuse against women and children, 1,288 robberies, 2,369 thefts, and 569 narcotics cases.
While challans for cases registered in the last quarter of 2024 were submitted to the courts, delays in newer cases have allowed suspects in serious crimes to secure bail and disappear.
Police are legally required to submit challans within 14 days of a case being registered, but not a single case met this deadline.
Investigation teams argue that it is virtually impossible to complete challans for serious cases in two weeks, citing delays in forensic lab reports which often take three to six months or more.
Supreme Court advocate Shahzeb Khan has called for urgent reforms, recommending that forensic labs be established in every division and operate independently of government control.
He also suggests extending the challan deadline to 30 days and relieving investigation officers from routine security and night duties so they can focus solely on their caseload.
Retired senior investigation officer Iftikhar Ahmed added that there is no real investigative framework in Pakistan.
He claimed investigating officers lack autonomy and are often overruled by senior officers.
He also highlighted systemic issues, including the absence of financial support for investigationsforcing officers to cover court and transportation expenses from their own pockets, which in turn opens the door to corruption.
""Until we ensure investigative independence, timely forensic results, and proper funding, legal reforms will remain ineffective,"" he said.
The police's failure to present complete and timely charge sheets has been highlighted as a key reason for the dismal conviction rates.
Investigating officers frequently submit incomplete or temporary charge sheets, misleading senior officials into thinking the cases are progressing. Many cases take over a year before a final charge sheet is submitted, allowing defendants to secure bail and disappear.
A senior police investigator, speaking anonymously, pointed out that political influence, inadequate resources, and administrative duties were hampering professional investigations.

"SC reviews landmark verdict amid absences, silence and restraint","PL
Live-streamed review of PTI reserved seats case marks several firsts in judicial history
The highest court in the land on Monday waded into uncharted waters as it began hearing review petitions against its July 12 judgement - a verdict that had handed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) reserved seats in the national and provincial legislatures - but without six of the original judges, including the judgement's author.
The hearing broke new ground in more ways than one, marking several firsts in judicial history.
The review petitions, filed by the ruling PML-N and PPP alongside the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), are being heard by a 13-member larger bench.
Curiously, the majority of the new Supreme Court bench were not part of the original decision, and no explanation has been offered as to why the court's constitutional committee did not recommend including the six judges from the earlier ruling.
For the first time since the 26th Constitutional Amendment was passed, the Supreme Court proceedings were broadcast live, a move hailed as a step toward transparency, though the absence of key judges cast a long shadow.
Despite the high stakes, not a single judge offered observations in favour of the majority judgement under review. Even Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi - both signatories to the original ruling - remained unusually tight-lipped, adopting a tone of marked restraint.
In contrast, two judges who had not been part of the original bench raised a fundamental question: if the PTI was not a party in the initial case, how could it receive relief?
They wondered as to how reserved seats were given to PTI when they were not a party, neither before the ECP nor the Peshawar High Court (PHC).
Justice Aminuddin Khan observed that it was an admitted fact that all PTI-backed returned candidates had joined the Sunni Ittehad Council, which had not contested the general elections.
He pressed further, asking whether any PTI-backed returned candidate had approached any forum to declare himself as a PTI candidate.
'Should the SC shut its eyes?'
The elephant in the courtroom, however, remained the role of the ECP during the controversial February 2024 polls, with most judges sidestepping the discussion on it. Though the majority judgment had held the ECP to account, only Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail pointed to the electoral body's failings.
Justice Mandokhail - part of the minority who believed PTI was entitled to reserved seats - said that the presiding officers and returning officers failed to perform their duties in accordance with the law and constitution during the February 2024 general election.
He challenged the opposing counsel, Makhdoom Ali Khan, by asking: ""Should the Supreme Court shut its eyes?""
Commenting on the matter, lawyer Abdul Moiz Jaferii flagged what he saw as a glaring lapse in judicial due diligence.
""What I found most amazing was how some of the judges who were not part of the original proceedings had clearly not read the judgment under review. You are seated to determine an error floating on the face of the record.""
""You are extraordinarily doing so without the author judge and many other judges senior to you who were part of the original proceedings. Surely you can read the judgment for yourself and not rely on the arguments of counsel to refresh the most basic principles of the case for you,"" he added.
Observers also noted that the government's side appeared in a rush to tie up loose ends. Counsels for the PML-N, PPP and ECP all fell in line behind the arguments presented by Makhdoom Ali Khan, despite the original verdict's criticism of the ECP's conduct.
Insiders suggest that Justice Aminuddin Khan's upcoming Hajj might be behind this urgency. There is speculation that the ruling coalition is keen to see the matter settled before his departure.
On the other side of the aisle, PTI and its allied Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) have engaged four senior counsels to defend the majority ruling. SIC's Faisal Siddiqi is slated to present his arguments today (Tuesday).
Legal circles believe that the current impasse stems from the ECP's misreading of the Supreme Court's January 13 verdict, which declared PTI's intra-party polls illegal.
Besides, the court under former chief justice Qazi Faez Isa also came under fire for dragging its feet on PTI's review petition – a delay that many say left the political field clouded in uncertainty.
Even the majority judgment had flagged constitutional tensions at the heart of the matter.
The majority verdict had quested how the matter of intra party elections - a matter of internal governance of a party - could trump the fundamental rights of citizens to vote and of political parties to effectively participate in and contest elections by obtaining a common symbol for their candidates, guaranteed under Articles 17(2) and 19 of the Constitution.

"Gold falls Rs2,600 on global slowdown","US
After weekend spike, bullion drops to Rs351,500/tola; rupee slips Rs0.09 to 282.06/$
Local gold prices declined on Monday, tracking a slowdown in the international bullion market. According to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), the price of gold dropped by Rs2,600 per tola, settling at Rs351,500 in the local market. The price of 10-gram gold also fell by Rs2,228, closing at Rs301,354.
The downturn comes after a notable gain over the weekend when gold prices surged by Rs3,100 per tola on Saturday to hit Rs354,100.
Globally, gold prices also saw a dip on Monday. The international rate stood at $3,331 per ounce (including a $20 premium), reflecting a decrease of $26, according to APGJSA. Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, noted that market activity was subdued due to a US bank holiday, with early closure and minimal trading volumes.
""The market is practically flat today. The high was $3,356, while the low touched $3,323. It's currently hovering around $3,335,"" he said.
Agar added that the recent easing of trade tensions between the US and Europe also contributed to the decline. The issue of additional European tariffs, hinted at by former President Donald Trump on Friday, was resolved over the weekend after discussions with the European Union. Trump agreed to delay the tariffs, which led to pressure on gold prices.
He further predicted that prices may continue to slide once international markets resume full operations on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee recorded a minor loss against the US dollar on Monday, slipping by 0.03% in the inter-bank market.
The local currency closed at 282.06, down by Rs0.09 from the previous session, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
During the preceding week, the rupee had also weakened slightly, depreciating by Rs0.31 or 0.11%, ending at 281.97 against the greenback compared to 281.66 a week earlier.
""At the close of the trading session, the Pakistani rupee depreciated by 0.03% day-on-day (DoD) against the US dollar, settling at 282.06. On a calendar year-to-date (CYTD) basis, the rupee has weakened by 1.24%, while the depreciation stands at 1.32% on a fiscal year-to-date (FYTD) basis,"" wrote Ismail Iqbal Securities.
On the global front, both the euro and the US dollar gained ground against traditional safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. The uptick followed former US President Donald Trump's announcement of a July 9 deadline for finalising a trade agreement with the European Union, effectively withdrawing his earlier threat of imposing a 50% tariff starting June 1.

Liverpool man detained after vehicle strikes crowd,"US
.
Several people were injured on Monday when a car ploughed into football fans celebrating Liverpool's Premier League title victory while police said a 53-year-old man had been arrested.
An AFP journalist in Liverpool saw at least four people taken away on stretchers, after witnesses reported seeing people knocked by a dark-coloured vehicle swerving through the huge crowds.
It was not immediately clear how many people had been hurt. But tens of thousands of people turned out in torrential rain for the jubilant celebrations to see the northwest English side's victory parade, involving players on an open-topped bus and fireworks.
The bus carrying the team had passed by on Water Street just minutes before the car rammed the crowd, witnesses told media.
""It was extremely fast,"" said Harry Rashid, 48, from Solihull, near Birmingham, central England, who was at the parade with his wife and two young daughters.
""Initially we just heard the pop, pop, pop of people just being knocked off the bonnet of the car,"" he told reporters.
""It was horrible and you could hear the bumps as he was going over the people.""
Other witnesses reported hearing screams and seeing an angry crowd surround the vehicle before police arrived.
Merseyside Police called for calm and said the arrested man was ""a 53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area"".
""Extensive enquiries are ongoing to establish the circumstances leading up to the collision,"" a spokesperson added, urging the public not to speculate on the circumstances of the collision.
Cordons were put in place and ambulances and a fire engine were also at the scene, with the injured being treated on the street.

Change of heart in Kabul,"US
Islamabad strived restlessly to make the Taliban 2.0 leadership realise that harbouring criminals
It is a good omen that Afghan Taliban are listening to the international community, and have realised the existential threat that they too face from non-state actors holed inside Afghanistan. The visible change of heart, wherein Kabul is now reportedly acting against the TTP and the likes, augurs well not only for the strife-torn country itself, but for the region at large. The prime beneficiary of this new policy will be Pakistan as it is a direct victim of the cross-border incursions launched from the Southwest Asian state, causing a spike in death and destruction in the restive provinces of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
To reach this point of consensus, wherein Kabul has come out of the denial mode and is making strides against the disgruntled elements, much rubbing of shoulders had taken place. Islamabad strived restlessly to make the Taliban 2.0 leadership realise that harbouring criminals, and all those who are wielding guns, in return for their support in the yesteryears would be tantamount to a catastrophe. The law and order deterioration inside Afghanistan too was a case in point wherein these 'guests' were going over the board to serve their vested interests, pushing the fragile government in Kabul in a crisis of its own. Last but not least, the visit of Pakistan's special envoy to Kabul, followed by the deputy prime minister's high-level talks with Afghan authorities, has borne fruit and the non-state actors are now reportedly feeling the heat.
The recent tripartite dialogue involving Islamabad, Beijing and Kabul was epoch-making in not only helping the Taliban earn the international legitimacy they have been looking for, but also look at the broader picture of connectivity and congeniality. Now is the time for the Afghan Taliban to walk the talk, and come full circle in exterminating the terror nexus. Militants from foreign countries must be shown the door, and the outlawed TTP leadership brought to book for their crimes against humanity on both sides of the divide. This jiff of fresh air from Kabul necessitates graduation in all forms and manifestations.

Ayeza Khan nails the effortless airport look,"PL
Actor has got that cool girl energy on lock
On Saturday, Ayeza Khan gave her Instagram followers a dose of effortless travel style with a carousel captioned: ""Just me and my matcha, travel buddies for life! Catch you all at 4PM!"" The actor did not drop any further hints about where exactly we should expect her to be except that she mentioned Lahore and very sweetly added, ""Same ritual: Dad drops me to the airport, every time.""
In the photos, Ayeza sports oversized headphones, sipping matcha while checking her phone, standing in the sun with a relaxed air of confidence. In a sheer, white lace top layered over a neutral bralette, charcoal wide-leg trousers, tabi-style shoes, and a crisp white handbag slung across her shoulder, the star demonstrated how to be a showstopper while being entirely laidback.
Adding a personal touch, she also posted a shot from the backseat of her dad driving, the two chatting in the front, an endearing father-daughter ritual her followers adored. Fan accounts rushed to the post to admire Ayeza's photos. One wrote, ""I just admire this dad and daughter's beautiful bond,"" while another commented, ""The Pakistani entertainment industry is nothing without you.""
On Sunday, she followed up with another carousel in a similar outfit, humorously captioned: ""If someone asked me how to sleep enough, I'd tell them to sleep partially in the car and then partially in the plane,"" a relatable travel exhaustion post that had fans laughing and commenting.
Recently, Ayeza's fashion game has been unmatched. We may be days away from Eidul Azha, but that hasn't stopped the Meray Paas Tum Ho actor from celebrating early. On Thursday, Ayeza shared snaps from a self-declared ""Chand Raat"" hangout with her siblings, complete with long drives, gol gappay, and gola ganda.
Dressed in a flowy, multi-coloured floral dress cinched with a golden belt, and accessorised with matching gold jewelry, Ayeza lit up the night with her signature smile.

The two ladders,"PK
A ladder many of us climb through sheer luck and good fortune
We live in a segregated society - one where those on the bottom rung of the ladder are never allowed to question those at the top rung. This stratification is more than an economic segregation; it is also a stratification based on status. For example, someone who is viewed on the higher ranks of their profession can never be questioned by those who are just starting their journey. Our language reinforces this stratification - terms such as paon ki khaak (a term implying one's insignificance and worthlessness in comparison to someone else) are used to describe an unassailable gap in the stations, and reminds people to stay in their place, and not dare question the decisions or behaviour of those at the top. Perhaps the most tragic part of this stratification is the existence of this ladder in academic institutions. In part because of our culture of obedience, and in part because of the status quo, unethical practices of the senior professors at our academic institutions are tolerated, or even accepted, by those who are in the junior ranks. Senior faculty get away with poor treatment of the students in their labs simply by virtue of their seniority.
I have heard numerous stories of students (and junior faculty) having to give up a rare opportunity to travel abroad or be present at a conference to their professors (who may or may not be qualified) - just because the professors ask them to. Anything other than complete submission would end the career. Original ideas of the students are stolen by their professors - and bad ideas of the professors cannot be questioned - because everyone is supposed to stay on their own rung. This 'staying in one's place' also creates a strange psyche where credit is given not because of ideas but because of one's position. I am troubled when gifted students in Pakistan doubt their own ideas just because they do not go to a prestigious institution, or because they are conscious about their accent. They have been told to doubt their own intelligence, not because doubt is an important part of inquiry, but because their ideas are probably not good just by virtue of where they come from.
Then there is another ladder. A ladder many of us climb through sheer luck and good fortune. It is the ladder of opportunity. Immigrants in the US and elsewhere, who got the opportunity to study, work and settle, climbed this ladder. I am part of those who happened to be lucky and were guided by the kindness of mentors and support of others. Yet, many around me, who came from the same background as I did, today support exclusionary ideas and would be eager to support politicians and policies that would close the very path that gave them the success that they enjoy today. They cheer rhetoric that demonises immigrants just like themselves. In some cases, they may be OK with immigrants from their own tribe, but have nothing but disrespect for immigrants who may look different, or practise a different faith. They think that people like them were different back in the day, and today someone who wants to imagine a similar future somehow is inferior and their desires are contaminated. These people - and there are plenty of them around - are the ladder pullers. With a false sense of self, and a deeply troubling opinion of others just like them, they are unable to recognise that their good fortune exists simply because a generation before them no one pulled the ladder.
These two ladders may seem different, but those at the top act exactly the same. They benefit from the system that propels them upward, and yet are blind to the injustice that is meted out to those who are at the bottom of the ladder. Justice does not need a grand theater to manifest - it can start with the simple idea of imagining that others may have the same desires as we do.

Qalandars the champions,"US
Qalandars have been led by just one man - pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi
The PSL X has gone to Lahore Qalandars - for a third time. The Qalandars won the T20 title back to back in 2022 and 2023, and now in 2025 - equalling Islamabad United's record of winning the crown thrice. However, in each of their victories, Qalandars have been led by just one man - pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi - something which is unparalleled in the decade-long history of PSL. It has been just one triumph each for all of Shaheen's counterparts, past and present, including Misbah-ul-Haq, Darren Sammy, JP Duminy, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Rizwan and Shadab Khan. Ironically though, Shaheen, the thrice victorious captain, does not find himself among the 16 announced for the upcoming Bangladesh T20I series at home, whereas the national squad is said to have been selected ""based on the players performance in the ongoing PSL"".
The recently-concluded PSL season, meanwhile, has seen the premier cricket league complete a decade of its inception - something that speaks of its tremendous all-round success. While the league has proved a big hit from the point of view of professional development of the players involved, it has also brought huge monetary benefits for all those associated with the event in any capacity - players, officials, franchise owners, broadcasters, etc. It has also served to lift the training and playing facilities, over the years, which had been subpart before the league came into being. The sporting gala has also helped set off economic activities in the country which have otherwise slowed down due to the policy of fiscal tightening being pursued by the incumbent government. To top it all, the league has played an instrumental role in the revival of international cricket in Pakistan, which had become a sporting outcast in the wake of the 2009 terrorist attack in Lahore on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team.
The decade of the PSL success is worth celebrating - indeed!
