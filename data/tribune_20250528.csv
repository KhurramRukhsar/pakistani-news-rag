All three T20Is will be played at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium, which will host its first T20I series after going through a complete renovation earlier this year. The T20Is will begin at 8pm, with the toss taking place at 7.30pm local time.
Salman Ali Agha will lead Pakistan, while Litton Das to captain Bangladesh. Both sides had their first training session at the Gaddafi Stadium under lights on Monday evening, while they will undergo another training session on Tuesday evening to get themselves ready for the series.
On head to head in Pakistan, both sides have featured in four T20Is with Bangladesh touring Pakistan for T20I in 2020. Pakistan have won three T20Is, while one match was washed out. Overall in five bilateral series, Pakistan have edged out Bangladesh four times with the visitor's only win coming in 2015.
Earlier, Mike Hesson was appointed Pakistan's white-ball coach, while Salman Ali Agha, who has so far led the team in nine T20Is, will continue to the skipper of the side.
Salman Ali Agha, Pakistan captain: ""We had a very productive practice session yesterday and the boys are doing well as a unit. A lot of our players are coming off strong performances in the HBL PSL X, which is one of the most competitive T20 tournaments in the world. That form and momentum are something we are hoping to carry into this series.
""Bangladesh are a quality side with talented players and we are expecting a good challenge from them. I believe fans are in for some thrilling cricket over the next few days.
""I would like to urge fans to turn up in big numbers and support not just us, but the spirit of the game.""
Litton Das, Bangladesh captain: ""We have had a good training session and we are familiar with the conditions here. The players are looking forward to the series. Everyone is focused and understands the challenge Pakistan poses, especially in their home conditions.
""This series is a great opportunity for every player to step up. We are trying a few combinations in the build-up to the T20 World Cup next year and this tour is a valuable part of that process.""
The Pakistan Cricket Board has unveiled the five-member commentary panel for the series. Former Test captains Aamir Sohail and Ramiz Raja, Test cricketer Bazid Khan and former Bangladesh international cricketer Athar Ali Khan alongside Mike Haysman. Zainab Abbas will be the series presenter.

Kuwait visa ban no more,"US
.
Kuwait's landmark decision to lift its 19-year visa ban on Pakistani citizens could make a huge impact on the lives of Pakistani workers seeking employment abroad. The policy change reinstates access to work, family, tourist and commercial visas for Pakistanis, ending a restrictive policy that had been in place since 2011 due to security concerns. Citizens of Iran, Syria and Afghanistan were also included in the 2011 ban.
Relaxation of the restriction shows that the Kuwaitis are prioritising mutual growth, opening the doors for skilled Pakistani workers such as nurses, who make up the majority of the first batch of visa recipients. Indeed, Kuwait has historically benefited from the labour of hundreds of Pakistani health professionals, apart from thousands of people who have worked in all imaginable fields in the tiny oil-rich state.
Kuwait's adoption of an online visa platform also underscores its commitment to modernisation, efficiency and transparency, enabling most applicants to secure visas in under 24 hours. The visa restoration for Pakistanis may also reflect closer diplomatic ties, since years of negotiations between the two nations have led to a new memorandum of understanding to streamline worker mobility and safeguard rights.
At the same time, it is worth noting that Kuwait has been lagging behind other Gulf countries in terms of non-oil economic activity, so much so that even local media, which generally shows restraint while criticising the government, has been lambasting economic policymakers for years.
Much of the criticism has focused on foreign worker policies that have failed to keep up with the times, such as laws dealing with freelancers, education requirements for several visa categories, and property rights, and how places like the UAE have benefited from forward-thinking policies in these areas.
If Kuwait reforms its own rules, it could become a desirable 'home away from home' for thousands of Pakistani entrepreneurs and freelancers.

Incredulous India,"US
To brand a nation that has lost countless lives to terrorism as a terrorist state is a blatant twisting of the truth
In 1991, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a suicide bomber representing the banned separatist organization, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Subsequently, 21st May was declared Anti-Terrorism Day in India. A day dedicated to promoting peace through awareness and education by conducting trainings and workshops to curb the spread of terrorism. The 1991 assassination, however, was not the first time a terrorist attack (even in the modern sense of the word), had occurred in India.
The first Indo-Pak War was fought from 1947-1948 over the Princely State of Jammu and Kashmir, marking the birth of separatist movements and militant groups in the country, regardless of alleged external support. Insurgent groups in the Northeastern states have fought for greater autonomy since the 1970s. The Meenambakkam Bombing was yet another terror attack by the Tamil Eelam Army in 1984. A plethora of terror incidents to draw from, in particular the Bombay Bombings (1993) followed by the post 9/11 attacks (Indian Parliament Attack (2001), Mumbai Train Bombings (2006) and Mumbai Attacks (2008).
Across the border, Pakistan too has bled in its fight against terrorism -losing more than 70,000 (The South Asia Terrorism Portal) people to terrorist incursions, regardless of who's ""war"" was/is being fought. The fallout from the Afghan conflict in the late 70's and 80's sowed the seeds of extremism. Since then, not only has Pakistan fought homegrown militant groups but faced the reality of sectarian violence and weathered the storm of insurgencies with outside influence.
The sacrifices of the soldiers, the unwavering spirit of the people facing a very real threat to life and the resulting heavy toll on the economy are undisputed facts. To brand a nation that has lost countless lives — both civilian and military — to terrorism as a ""terrorist state"" isn't just insensitive; it's a blatant twisting of the truth. An example of 2009, Pakistan's worst hit year, with 2,586 terrorist, insurgent and sectarian related incidents reported, killing 3,021 people and injuring 7,334 according to the ""Pakistan Security Report, 2009"" published by the Pak Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS). Armed with decades of such experience, in the immediate aftermath of the Pahalgham attack, Pakistan volunteered to allow an independent investigation into the matter; a call that fell on deaf ears.
While the fight for terrorism within the two neighbouring countries is alive, it is rife with contentious statements of the other country's deep state machinations. The age-old blame game gives birth to patriotic fervor, which has sky rocketed post the latest skirmish in the decades long Indo-Pak conflict.
Said patriotism in Pakistan played out with an explosion of nihilistic memes and TikTok videos taking jabs at our institutions and the neighbouring state machinery in equal parts. Another extreme, however, was on full theatrical display in India with calls for the annihilation of the state of Pakistan, fueled fervently by the national media itself. Suffice it to say, the root cause being the rise in tensions. What has also been on the rise is Hindutva nationalism in India since Modi's election in 2014. The extreme hate for the Muslims, especially in Pakistan stems from a narrative that is very old and equally dangerous.
The term ""Hindutva"" was coined by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in his writings, through which he changed the narrative Swami Vivekan and established in late 1800s where Vivekananda stated that Hinduism was the only universal religion. Savarkar then traced the word Hindu to not be inclusivist, but exclusivist in nature. He prescribed that there are three essentials to Hindutva — a common nation, a common race and a common civilization in turn — making religious belief and practice secondary in nature and thereby excluding Muslims and Christians altogether.
M.S. Golwalker, a prominent advocate of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), further exploited the ever evolving Hindudtva ideology by declaring that Hindus came ""into this land (Hindustan) from nowhere, but are indigenous children of the soil always, from times immemorial and are natural masters of the country specifically referencing the example of Nazi Germany and how it had shown that it was impossible for ""for Races and cultures, having differences to the root, to be assimilated into one united whole, a good lesson for use in Hindustan to learn and profit by.""
The RSS is the ideological mentor of The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Not surprisingly then, the recent attack on Pakistani soil, killing civilians, including two children by attacking civilian areas in the dead of the night has been dubbed by many as an attack reminiscent of the Israeli tactics being used in Palestine. Equally preposterous, and again seemingly taken directly from the Israseli textbook was the justification peddled out, when the Indian representatives, both state and media, deemed all the civilian casualties as terrorists, even children. Hence, hateful tweets from the Indian citizenry followed — one such asking for Pakistan to be flattened just like Gaza.
What then, one may ask, is the significance of 21st May when the BJP and the ruling class presents terror and hate in the mainstream? To see the practical effects of such hateful rhetoric, one does not need to go too far back. The 2002 Gujrat massacre holds all the key elements of terrorism, played out under Modi, Chief Minister at the time, whose controversial role in the incident itself has been widely debated. So much so, he was even denied visa to the United States in 2005, reportedly based on serious concerns surrounding human rights issues. Bilawal Bhutto's words, if ever appropriate, certainly may be used in this context, ""Osama Bin Laden is dead, but the butcher of Gujrat lives. And he is the Prime Minister of India"".
What then does the future hold for the new Hindutva-led Bharat and subsequent Indo-Pak relations?

Smoking costs Pakistan $2.5b annually,"DE
Tobacco costs Pakistan 164,000 lives
Tobacco costs Pakistan 164,000 lives and $2.5 billion annually — urgent tax increases can save lives and generate revenues.
In a statement, the World Health Organization (WHO) noted that the country loses Rs700 billion — approximately $2.5 billion — annually due to the devastating impacts of tobacco on public health. It called for urgent measures including increased taxation to save lives. It said all tobacco products on the market, without exception and regardless of its manufacturer, are extremely harmful to health and pose a major risk to vulnerable populations such as children and teenagers.
""As World No Tobacco Day — observed on 31 May — approaches, WHO reaffirms its commitment to partnering with Pakistan to address the chronic health crisis caused by tobacco,"" it said.
It said taxation must be used as a tool to reduce tobacco consumption. Taxation can also increase revenues that can be directed towards health and development priorities.
Without additional measures, the harmful impact of tobacco on public health and the national economy will continue to jeopardize Pakistan's efforts to advance the 2030 Agenda with regard to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
It said research has shown that tobacco taxation is effective in increasing revenues for the government while also reducing consumption, tobacco-related diseases and pressure on health systems.
""In 2023, following a tax increase on tobacco products in Pakistan, tobacco use declined by 19.2%, with 26.3% of smokers cutting down on cigarette consumption. Revenue collection from the Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cigarettes increased by 66%, from Rs142 billion in 2022-23 to Rs237 billion in 2023-24.""

PSX inches up as investors stay cautious,"KR
KSE-100 gains 112 points in range-bound session; K-Electric leads volumes for second straight day
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed modestly higher on Tuesday, posting a gain of 112 points, as the KSE-100 index oscillated in a narrow band throughout the day.
Investors were wary ahead of the budget presentation, although cement stocks rose, driven by hopes for announcement of a real estate package in the federal budget.
Analysts noted that there was some mid-session pressure due to investor concerns over the lack of agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on budgetary targets and subsidies.
K-Electric was the volume leader for the second consecutive day, with 267 million shares changing hands, following approval of its multi-year distribution tariff for the period FY24 to FY30.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp commented that stocks staged a recovery amid speculation in the pre-budget session. Hopes for a real estate package in the federal budget sparked a rally in cement stocks.
Investor concerns over the IMF's disagreement regarding key budgetary targets and subsidies and rupee fluctuation caused mid-session pressure. Moreover, the government's measures for increasing tax collection to slash the fiscal deficit aided the positive close, he said.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 111.79 points, or 0.09%, and settled at 118,332.91.
According to Topline Securities, the market saw a range-bound session, with the index moving within a confined band due to the rollover pressure and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming budget. It touched the intra-day high of 587 points and low of 77 points before settling at 118,333, up 112 points.
The positive momentum was mainly driven by Meezan Bank, Systems Limited, Pakgen Power, Pakistan Petroleum and DG Khan Cement, which added 223 points to the index, Topline said.
In its commentary, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) remarked that Tuesday's session was largely flat ahead of the May 28 holiday.
Some 48 shares rose while 50 fell. Meezan Bank (+1.61%), Systems Limited (+1.22%) and Pakgen Power (+6.77%) contributed the most to index gains while UBL (-1.78%), Hub Power (-0.82%) and Pakistan Services (-3.5%) were the biggest drags, it said.
AHL added that headline inflation for May 2025 was projected to rise to 3.04% year-on-year, an uptick from 0.3% in April, but still significantly lower than the 11.8% reading in May 2024. The sharp moderation reflects a strong base effect and easing inflationary pressures across key categories such as food and transportation.
Moreover, cement was the standout sector where Flying Cement (+10%) Dewan Cement (+8.29%) and DG Khan Cement (+3.23%) were the major gainers. ""The market appears to be biding time for a positive catalyst to breach 120,000 on a sustained basis,"" AHL said.
Analyst Ali Najib commented that ""consolidation continues ahead of the budget,"" adding that the PSX had a stable day as the KSE-100 index floated in a narrow range and ended the day on a flat note at 118,333, reflecting a gain of 112 points. He noted that investors were likely to exercise caution in the coming sessions amid the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty.
Overall trading volumes increased to 690.4 million shares compared with Monday's tally of 635.5 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs23.8 billion.
Shares of 459 companies were traded. Of these, 211 stocks closed higher, 210 fell and 38 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 267.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.17 to close at Rs5.89. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 31.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.03 to close at Rs1.30 and PTCL with 20 million shares, gaining Rs0.21 to close at Rs24.28. During the day, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs876.7 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

Legal and ethical dimensions of polygraph testing,"US
.
The recent headlines regarding Imran Khan's refusal to undergo a polygraph test have reignited public discourse around the legal and ethical implications of such investigative techniques. The entry of digital tools like lie detectors into criminal investigations raises important questions: Can a suspect be compelled to undergo a polygraph test without their consent? Are the results of such tests admissible in a court of law?
To address these concerns, it is essential to understand what a polygraph test entails. Commonly known as a lie detector test, a polygraph measures physiological indicators — heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and galvanic skin response — while the subject answers a series of questions.
The assumption is that deceptive responses produce physiological reactions distinct from those linked to truthful answers. However, polygraph testing is not based on an established scientific theory accepted in the field of law or physical science, and thus, its results are not considered conclusive evidence.
The legality of compelling an individual to undergo such a test touches directly upon constitutional protections, particularly the right against self-incrimination and the right to privacy.
In Pakistan, Article 13(b) of the Constitution provides protection against self-incrimination, stating: ""No person accused of an offense shall be compelled to be a witness against himself."" This constitutional safeguard underpins the principle of a fair trial, ensuring that individuals are not forced to provide evidence that may lead to their own conviction.
A landmark judgment in this context is the Indian Supreme Court's ruling in Selvi & Ors v. State of Karnataka (2010), which addressed the involuntary administration of narco-analysis, polygraph tests and brain-mapping techniques. The Court held that such practices violate Article 20(3) of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees the right against self-incrimination, and also infringe on Article 21, which protects personal liberty, including mental and physical privacy.
The Selvi judgment categorically stated that no individual can be compelled to undergo a polygraph test. Informed consent is mandatory, and even when consent is provided, procedural safeguards — such as legal representation and the presence of an independent medical practitioner — must be ensured.
Similarly, in the United States, forcing a suspect to take a polygraph test without their consent may violate the Fifth Amendment, which protects against self-incrimination.
The central legal question relates to the evidentiary value of polygraph results. Courts globally have expressed skepticism regarding the reliability and scientific validity of such tests.
In Selvi, the Indian Supreme Court clarified that while polygraph results may aid investigation if obtained with voluntary consent, they cannot form the sole basis for conviction. Such evidence, due to concerns over reliability and potential misuse, is inadmissible as substantive evidence.
In the United States, admissibility often hinges on the Frye and Daubert standards, which assess whether scientific evidence is generally accepted by the scientific community and meets established reliability criteria. Polygraph results frequently fail these tests, and thus, are typically excluded for fear they may unduly influence juries.
In the United Kingdom, polygraph tests are not used in criminal trials and have only limited application in investigative contexts. Across the European Union, the priority given to human rights leads courts to regard such techniques with caution.
In Pakistan, the Supreme Court's decision in Husnain Mustafa v. The State and another echoed this view. The Court recognised polygraph testing as a modern forensic tool capable of indicating deception but emphasised that its findings cannot be equated with an admission of guilt.
Beyond legal admissibility, polygraph testing raises significant ethical concerns. The possibility of coercion — whether overt or subtle — during the process of obtaining consent cannot be discounted. Moreover, physiological responses may be influenced by anxiety, medical conditions or the testing environment, rather than deception.
Another critical issue is the potential for institutional misuse. In high-profile cases, investigative agencies might use polygraph results to sway public opinion or create an illusion of progress, regardless of the scientific credibility of the findings. Over-reliance on such methods could divert attention from more reliable investigative tools like forensic analysis, corroborative witness testimony and digital evidence.
Polygraph tests also risk undermining the interrogative competence of law enforcement agencies. While these tests may offer psychological leverage or investigative leads, they must not be prioritised over constitutionally sound procedures or used at the expense of a suspect's fundamental rights.
There is broad consensus within the legal and academic community that individuals should not be compelled to participate in polygraph testing and that the admissibility of such results must be heavily restricted. Courts have rightly emphasised that criminal justice cannot be reduced to a spectacle reliant on questionable science.
The controversy surrounding Imran Khan's refusal to undergo a polygraph test underscores the delicate balance between science, law and ethics in criminal jurisprudence.
While polygraph tests may have a supplementary role in investigations, their inherent limitations must not be overlooked. Legal frameworks must continue to uphold voluntariness, due process and the right against self-incrimination — ensuring that justice is not only done but is seen to be done in a fair and constitutionally sound manner.

NA opposition leader protests 'censorship',"US
.
Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan formally wrote a letter to the Speaker of the National Assembly on Tuesday, expressing concerns over what he described as increasing censorship of parliamentary speeches and an alleged breach of constitutional and procedural norms.
In the three-page letter, the NA opposition leader reminded NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq of his constitutional role as the custodiannot the masterof the House. The letter underscores repeated instances where, according to Ayub, opposition members' speeches were either censored or cut and altered when official footage was requested, raising concerns over transparency and fairness.
""Since the commencement of the current Assembly in 2024, opposition members have faced increasing censorship not only through restricted media coverage but also through the editing and significant alteration of our recorded speeches,"" he wrote. ""When I and other members requested access to official footage of our speeches, we found them substantially cut and manipulated.""
""I must also remind you that under the law and tradition, the Speaker is the custodian, not the master of the House,"" Ayub stated, ""The custodian of this august institution cannot arbitrarily suppress or distort the voice of the peoples' representatives.""
The opposition leader emphasized that members of the National Assembly are constitutionally entitled to express their views freely.

Modi's latest vitriolic draws FO rebuke,"US
Terms Indian PM's accusations against Islamabad 'reckless provocation'
The Foreign Office on Tuesday vehemently rejected Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's latest statement accusing Pakistan of supporting terrorism, terming it a ""reckless provocation.""
On the second day of his visit to the state of Gujarat, while addressing party workers in Gandhinagar, Modi spoke about the militant attack in Pahalgam and India's military response, 'Operation Sindoor'.
Speaking about the Pahalgam attack, Modi said, ""This cannot be called a proxy war, because the terrorists killed on May 6 during Operation Sindoor were given state funerals in Pakistan. Their coffins were draped in Pakistani flags and were saluted by the Pakistani military. This proves that these acts of terrorism are not just proxy warfare but part of a well-thought-out war strategy.""
It is worth noting that Pakistani civilian and military officials have repeatedly claimed that Indian strikes in various cities across Pakistan have killed innocent civilians, including women and children.
Modi stated: ""I want to tell the new generation how this country was ruined. The way the Indus Waters Treaty was signed in the 1960s — if you examine its details, you'll be shocked. The treaty even stated that the dams built on rivers in Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned, and their gates would not be opened.""
""For 60 years, those gates were not opened. India's water reservoirs, which should have been filled to 100% capacity, were reduced to just 2-3%. Don't the people of my country have a right to that water? Shouldn't our people get their rightful share?""
""And I haven't even done much yet. We've just announced the suspension of the treaty — and they [Pakistan] are already sweating. We slightly opened the dam gates to start cleaning, and even that much caused floods over there.""
The Foreign Office vehemently rejected Modi's diatribe. ""Pakistan has taken note of the recent remarks by the Prime Minister of India, delivered in Gujarat with the theatrical flourish of a campaign rally rather than the sobriety expected of the leader of a nuclear-armed state,"" noted the Foreign Office.
""The hate-driven invocation of violence in his remarks is deeply disturbing, not only for its content but for the dangerous precedent it sets in a region already burdened by volatility. We regret the continued erosion of maturity and decorum in Indian statecraft,"" it added.
""Such statements blatantly violate the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which obliges member states to resolve disputes peacefully and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty or political independence of other states.""
The Foreign Office said that Pakistan views these remarks as a ""reckless provocation"", intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
Pakistan's record as a leading contributor to the UN peacekeeping and its consistent cooperation in the global counter-terrorism efforts speak louder than any hostile soundbite, according to the statement.
""If extremism is indeed a concern for the Indian government, it would do well to turn inwardtoward the alarming rise of majoritarianism, religious intolerance, and the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities under the increasingly brutal Hindutva ideology.""
The statement said Pakistan remains committed to peace based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. However, any threat to its security or territorial integrity will be met with firm and proportionate measures, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.
The Foreign Office stressed that the international community must take serious note of India's escalating rhetoric, which undermines regional stability and the prospects for lasting peace.
Israeli provocation
A separate statement issued by the Foreign Office spokesperson said that Pakistan condemned in the strongest possible terms the latest provocative actions by Israeli occupation power as well as illegal settlers to undermine the religious, historical and legal status of the Al-Aqsa Mosque.
""Such actions are unacceptable and constitute a flagrant violation of the international law, and have the potential to further escalate an already volatile situation in the region,"" it said. ""Pakistan calls for upholding the sanctity and historical status of the holy sites, and preventing Israel from any further provocations.""
The Foreign Office statement also deplored the continued targeting of the Palestinian civilians in Gaza by the occupation power. The latest reprehensible attack against a school sheltering displaced families in Gaza was an example of continued Israeli impunity.
""The harrowing images being witnessed by the world in the aftermath of the attack that resulted in dozens of deaths, many of them children, should be a wake-up call for the international community. These attacks must end forthwith, and Israel must be held accountable for its heinous crimes,"" it stressed.
The spokesperson said Pakistan reiterated its unwavering support for the Palestinian people's right to self-determination and called for the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.

"Body of nationalist worker exhumed, given to family","AU
Deceased was unlawfully buried by police defying court orders
The body of nationalist worker Irfan Ali Laghari was exhumed on Tuesday from Mulan Muhammad Shah graveyard in Noushehro Feroze on court orders and then handed over to the family of the deceased for burial. Earlier, the police buried the body which ignited controversy.
The Sessions Judge Nadeem Badar Qazi not only ordered the exhumation but he also allowed the family to take the body to Civil Hospital Moro for the postmortem which was already performed in Liaquat University Hospital, Hyderabad, on May 23.
Qurban Ali Laghari, brother of the deceased, informed the court that the police unlawfully took Laghari's body to LUH Hyderabad and buried him on May 24.
A day ago the same judge had issued a show cause notice to the district SSP Bashir Ahmed Brohi stating that the court on May 24 had directed him to handover the body to the family either through the police or a non-governmental organisation. The judge underlined that his order was not complied as the police buried the body.
Laghari's burial will be performed in his village Bijarani Laghari in Moro on Wednesday afternoon.
The deceased has been survived by a child and his widow who is reportedly expacting a baby. Besides Irfan, another resident of the same village, Zahid Laghari, also lost his life in alleged police firing on May 20.
Meanwhile, the Inspector General Sindh Police Ghulam Nabi Memon has formed a five-member inquiry committee to probe the May 20 Moro incident in which two nationalist workers were killed and the house of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar was partially torched.
The DIG Karachi west, Irfan Ali Baloch will head the committee while SSP Anti Vehicle Lifting Cell Amjad Ahmed Shaikh, SSP Shaheed Benazirabad district Shabbir Sethar, DSP CIA Hyderabad Iftikhar Buriro and Sub Inspector Naek Muhammad Khoso are its members. The committee has been given five days to complete the task.
However, some of the nationalist leaders have rejected the committee, arguing that they do not expect a transparent probe by the police. ""A judicial commission comprising two judges of the Sindh High Court and the Sessions Judge Noushehro Feroze should conduct the inquiry,"" said Jeay Sindh Mahaz's Chairman Riaz Ali Chandio.
He alleged that the home minister and the police under him were involved in the killings of peaceful protesters.
As per the postmortem report from the LUH, a fatal gunshot to his face ultimately took Laghari's life after three-days of life saving medical treatment. He had also sustained a gunshot to his leg.
The report pointed out that some abrasions on his forehead, left foot and left leg also existed. The bullet which pierced through his face, stuck in his skull, making a 3.5-centimeter hole. The bullet wound on his leg was 1.5cm in size.

Would always have Babar in team: Arthur,"US
He also praised Rizwan's versatility and wicketkeeping skills
Former Pakistan head coach Mickey Arthur has expressed strong support for star batter and former skipper Babar Azam, describing him as ""absolute class"" despite the player's ongoing exclusion from the national T20I squad. In a recent interview with a local sports platform, Mickey Arthur made his position clear, stating that he would always include Babar in his playing XI.
""It's an interesting one. I would always have Babar Azam in the team,"" Arthur said.
""I think he's a wonderful player. I'm not sure what's happened over the past couple of years, but the Babar I know is absolute class,"" he added.
The 57-year-old, who coached Pakistan during one of its most successful white-ball eras, also praised Mohammad Rizwan's versatility and wicketkeeping skills.
""If Rizwan is your best wicketkeeper, then he has a role to play,"" he said.
""He can adapt his game to fit wherever the team needs him. It's about making the most of his abilities,"" he added.
It is pertinent to mention that the right-handed batter, who led Pakistan in three ICC Men's T20 World Cups (2021, 2022, and 2024), last played a T20I match for Pakistan in December 2024.
He was notably left out of the recent series against New Zealand in March as well.
The 30-year-old faced a challenging period in the format, failing to score a half-century since his 75-run innings against Ireland in May 2024.
Despite this, Babar's overall T20I record remains impressive, with 4,223 runs from 128 matches at an average of 39.83, including three centuries and 36 half-centuries.
Earlier this year, the right-handed batter, alongside wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Rizwan, was left out of the five-match T20I series in New Zealand.
The selection committee defended this move as an effort to provide opportunities for younger talent. Since then, both Babar and Rizwan have not been included in T20I squads, including the upcoming three-match T20I series against Bangladesh starting May 28 in Lahore. In a further shake-up, Mohammad Rizwan was also stripped of the T20I captaincy after just two series, with Salman Ali Agha stepping in as the new captain.
The upcoming series will also mark Pakistan's first international assignment under newly appointed white-ball head coach Mike Hesson.
Originally, Bangladesh were scheduled to arrive in Pakistan in two groups on May 21 for a five-match T20I series, with the first game planned for May 25 in Faisalabad.
However, due to logistical challenges and evolving security concerns, the series has been revised to three matches, all to be played in Lahore.

Empty treasury benches draw ire,"CN
Opposition leader shares alarming stats on rising street crimes
The Punjab Assembly on Friday unanimously passed a resolution congratulating Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir on his elevation to the rank of Field Marshal, praising his leadership in securing a remarkable success in the recent conflict with India.
The resolution, moved by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) MPA Shaukat Raja, commended the armed forces for their strategic excellence and valour.
It stated that General Munir, through his wisdom and military acumen, effectively thwarted every hostile move by India, ultimately securing a decisive victory that reinforced Pakistan's stance on the global stage.
Despite the rare consensus across party lines on the resolution, the Assembly proceedings were overshadowed by criticism from the Opposition, which slammed the government for its visible lack of interest in the session's legislative business, particularly during a general discussion on the province's deteriorating law and order situation.
Opposition Leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar strongly criticised the absence of ministers and officials from the treasury benches, pointing out that only one ruling party MPA was present during the debate, while the official gallery remained entirely empty.
He expressed concern over rising crime, accusing the government of negligence and failing to deliver on its promises to ensure public safety.
""Law and order has collapsed. In just two days, 324 and 370 criminal incidents occurred in Lahore respectively. This proves the seriousness of the situation,"" he said, citing recent police data.
At one point, Panel of Chairmen Sami Ullah Khan also expressed displeasure over the non-attendance of government officials.

One-and-a-half year old beaten to death by father,"FI
The police registered an FIR of murder against the father on the complaint of the mother
A man killed his one-and-a-half-year-old innocent daughter by beating her in the area of Chaklala police station.
The police registered an FIR of murder against the father on the complaint of the mother of the deceased girl, Inayat Fatima. The accused managed to escape from the hospital.
The mother of the one-and-a-half-year-old deceased girl, Inayat Fatima, Asiya Kausar, filed a complaint with the police and took the stand that she had remarried with the accused husband, Hassan Iqbal, eight years ago.
The couple had four children together. Asiya reported that she earned her living by working at people's houses. ""Last evening at four o'clock, my husband called from his brother's phone and told me that my little girl Inayat Fatima had fallen down the stairs and called me home quickly,"" she explained.
""Before I reached the house, my husband had already taken my daughter to the hospital. When I got to BBH, my daughter's body was lying on a stretcher, with blue marks on her body and ears. When I asked my husband about the girl, he ran away from the emergency room,"" she said.
Their second daughter, Abirah, said that her father had landed heavy kicks and punches on Inayat Fatima.

Panahi's homecoming cheered in Tehran after Cannes triumph,"US
Fans relieved after banned filmmaker returned without incident
Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi was given a hero's welcome by supporters on his return to Tehran on Monday after winning the top prize at the Cannes film festival, footage posted on social media showed, reported AFP.
After being banned from leaving Iran for years, forced to make films underground and enduring spells in prison, Panahi attended the French festival in person and sensationally walked away with the Palme d'Or for his latest offering, It Was Just an Accident.
With some fans concerned that Panahi could face trouble on his return to Iran, he arrived without incident at Tehran's main international airport, named after the founder of the 1979 Islamic revolution Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in the early hours of Monday.
""He arrived in Tehran early this morning"" and ""has returned home,"" French film producer Philippe Martin told AFP, citing his entourage. ""He has even learned that he has obtained a visa to go to a festival in Sydney in about ten days' time.""
Panahi was cheered by supporters waiting in the public area as he descended the escalator from passport control to baggage collection, footage posted by the Dadban legal monitor showed on social media.
One person could be heard shouting ""Woman. Life. Freedom!"" — the slogan of the 2022-2023 protest movement that shook the Iranian authorities.
On exiting, he was greeted by around a dozen supporters who had stayed up to welcome him, according to footage posted on Instagram by the Iranian director Mehdi Naderi and broadcast by the Iran International Channel, which is based outside Iran.
Smiling broadly and waving, he was cheered, applauded, hugged and presented with flowers. ""Fresh blood in the veins of Iranian independent cinema,"" Naderi wrote.
'Gesture of resistance'
The warm welcome at the airport contrasted with the lukewarm reaction from Iranian state media and officials to the first Palme d'Or for an Iranian filmmaker since The Taste of Cherry by the late Abbas Kiarostami in 1997.
While evoked by state media including the IRNA news agency, Panahi's triumph has received only thin coverage inside Iran and has also sparked a diplomatic row with France.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called his victory ""a gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression"" in a post on X, prompting Tehran to summon France's charge d'affaires to protest the ""insulting"" comments.
""I am not an art expert, but we believe that artistic events and art in general should not be exploited to pursue political objectives,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei.
The film is politically charged, showing five Iranians confronting a man they believe tortured them in prison, a story inspired by Panahi's own time in detention.
After winning the prize, Panahi made a call for freedom in Iran. ""Let's set aside all problems, all differences. What matters most right now is our country and the freedom of our country.""
In an earlier interview with the Guardian prior to winning the Palme d'Or, Panahi expanded on how his own time in prison ended up forming the bedrock for the events that unfold in It Was Just an Accident.
""I was on my own in a tiny cell and they would take me out blindfolded to a place where I would sit in front of a wall and hear this voice at my back. It was the voice of the man who would question me – sometimes for two hours, sometimes for eight hours,"" he recalled.
The filmmaker added that he spent his time in jail ""fantasising"" about the person behind the voice. ""I had an intuition that someday this voice would be an aspect of something I'd write or shoot and give a creative life to,"" he noted.

Cop martyred in attack targeting polio vaccinators in Noskhi,"US
.
A police officer assigned to protect the health workers was martyred on Tuesday in Balochistan's Noshki district after unidentified assailants opened fire on a polio vaccination team.
The slain officer, identified as Waheed Ahmed, son of Muhammad Hashim and a resident of Jamalabad, Noshki, was part of the security detail deployed to safeguard polio workers administering oral vaccines to children under the ongoing nationwide immunisation campaign.
According to security officials, the attackers fled the scene immediately after the ambush. Law enforcement agencies launched a search operation in the area, while forensic teams gathered evidence from the site.
The attack occurred during a countrywide polio eradication drive, one of several coordinated campaigns underway across Pakistan's provinces.
According to the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), the Balochistan campaign aims to vaccinate 2.6 million children under the age of five, as part of Pakistan's broader effort to eliminate the poliovirus.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind strongly condemned the attack, describing it as a deliberate attempt to undermine a critical public health initiative.
""Such cowardly acts are a direct attack on our mission to protect children from a crippling disease. The sacrifice of this brave police officer will not go in vain,"" he said.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack on the polio team in Noshki.
In a message, the president paid tribute to the dedication and courage of polio workers.
In a separate statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack and extended heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the family of the martyred.

RDA blames ex-officers for Rs1.94b scam,"US
Sources say 230 shady transactions funnelled funds to individuals, companies for 9 years
The Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has held a retired Director of Administration and Finance, a late Deputy Director of Finance, and a retired Assistant Director of Finance responsible for a mega financial scandal amounting to Rs1.94 billion.
The authority has formally referred the matter to the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE), the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for action and recovery of losses.
According to an official statement issued by the RDA Director-General, Kinza Murtaza, serious irregularities have been identified in the financial records of the authority, causing substantial loss to the public exchequer.
The individuals allegedly involved include the retired Director of Admin and Finance, the late former DD of Finance, and the retired AD of Finance.
The DG emphasised that recovering the financial losses resulting from this corruption is imperative. She noted that legal recovery of the amounts due is possible within the framework of the law, including through attachment and confiscation of properties and assets.
Citing relevant legal provisions, she referenced section C-33 of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 for recovery of embezzled funds, sections 12 and 15 of the NAB Ordinance for freezing and confiscating assets, section 50 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) for recovery of civil liabilities from the estate of a deceased person, and Order XXII Rule 4 of the CPC to initiate legal proceedings against legal heirs after the death of an accused.
Murtaza has formally written to the NAB Rawalpindi, FIA, and ACE Rawalpindi, urging swift recovery of the embezzled amount.
Talking to The Express Tribune, sources revealed that senior officials, who served as DGs or Directors of Admin and Finance in the RDA over the past nine years, and who held signatory authority over financial matters, might also face action from NAB, FIA, and the ACE for failing to ensure transparency.
Meanwhile, the official residence of the late DD Finance was sealed in Civil Lines in the nine-year-old mega corruption scandal in the Authority. Despite 236 suspicious transactions involving the RDA's National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) account, transfers were made to eight companies and 12 individuals and the RDA's financial discipline remained silent, the sources added.
It is still to be determined which officials received vehicles in exchange for an Rs110m payment made to a car showroom.
Separate payments of Rs175.7 million, Rs339.44m, Rs161.412m, Rs264.45m, Rs393.16m, and Rs74,25m were paid to several companies and individuals.
Meanwhile, a probe committee appointed by the RDA DG says it is not currently in a position to identify the primary culprit behind the fraud.

Trump administration halts scheduling of new student visas,"US
.
President Donald Trump's administration has ordered its missions abroad to stop scheduling new appointments for student and exchange visitor visa applicants as the State Department prepares to expand social media vetting of foreign students, according to an internal cable seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in the cable that the department plans to issue updated guidance on social media vetting of student and exchange visitor applicants after a review is completed and advised consular sections to halt the scheduling of such visa appointments.
The move comes as the Trump administration has sought to ramp up deportations and revoke student visas as part of its wide-ranging efforts to fulfill his hardline immigration agenda.
In the cable, first reported by Politico, Rubio said appointments that have already been scheduled can proceed under the current guidelines, but available appointments not already taken should be pulled down.
""The Department is conducting a review of existing operations and processes for screening and vetting of student and exchange visitor (F, M, J) visa applicants, and based on that review, plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting for all such applicants,"" the cable said.
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to comment on reports of the cable, but said the US will use ""every tool"" to vet anyone who wants to enter the United States. ""We will continue to use every tool we can to assess who it is that's coming here, whether they are students or otherwise,"" Bruce told reporters at a regular news briefing.
The expanded social media vetting will require consular sections to modify their operations, processes and allocation of resources, according to the cable, which advises the sections going forward to take into consideration the workload and resource requirements of each case before scheduling them.
The cable also advises consular sections to remain focused on services for US citizens, immigrant visas and fraud prevention.

Leadership hails nuclear journey,"US
President, PM, armed forces felicitate nation on 27th Youm-e-Takbeer
The civil and military leadership of the country has felicitated the nation in the 27th Youm-e-Takbeer, as they hail Pakistan's nuclear journey and calls for renewed unity and determination to transform the nation into an economic power.
In their separate messages, President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) and the services chiefs, stressed that the Youm-e-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership and the brilliance of Pakistani scientists and engineers.
Youm-e-Takbeer on May 28 (today) commemorates the momentous occasion in 1998, when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear powerrestoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence.
In his message, the president emphasised that becoming a nuclear power was a calculated decision to ensure peace through strength, maintain the strategic balance in South Asia, and to protect the nation against any external aggression.
""Today, we observe the 27th anniversary of Youm-e-Takbeer – a day when we demonstrated our nuclear capabilities and established strategic deterrence,"" he said.
""Pakistan does not seek conflict and is committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law,"" he added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz, in his separate message, also called for renewed national unity and determination.
The prime minister linked this year's commemoration with Pakistan's recent success in defending itself from ""an unjustified war imposed by India"". ]
He hailed the nation's spirit during the May 6-10 confrontation. ""The joys of Youm-e-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.""
Shehbaz paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan's nuclear programme. ""I salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith,"" he stated.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), meanwhile, the Armed Forces of Pakistan, along with the chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and the services chiefs, extended heartfelt felicitations to the people of Pakistan on the 27th anniversary of Youm-e-Takbeer.
""Pakistan's strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people.
The commemoration of Youm-e-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan's defence unassailable,"" it said.

Seniority list of DSPs raises eyebrows,"SG
The list also includes 10 female officers, reportedly recruited between 1993 and 1994.
The Sindh government has released a seniority list featuring 500 police officers promoted to the rank of deputy superintendent of police (DSP). The notification, issued with the approval of Additional Chief Secretary Muhammad Iqbal Memon, has sparked unease within the provincial police force and triggered scrutiny over alleged irregularities related to age eligibility, appointment dates, and alleged out-of-turn promotions.
A review of the list reveals inconsistencies. Several officers appear to have been under the legal minimum age of 18 at the time of their recruitment — contrary to established government employment rules.
For instance, Muhammad Arshad Afridi's official records indicate a date of birth of November 11, 1973, and a recruitment date of September 14, 1991, making him 17 years and 10 months old at the time of appointment.
Similarly, Rana Nasrullah, born on March 2, 1970, reportedly joined the police force on June 11, 1988, at the age of just 18 years and 3 months. His swift appointment - only a few months after becoming eligible for a national identity card - has raised concerns about procedural irregularities.
The Sindh government's guidelines stipulate that candidates must be between 28 and 32 years old for direct recruitment as DSPs. However, the seniority list includes several officers who were appointed at an age beyond this range, under what has been described as ""special circumstances,"" a justification that has not been clearly explained.
The list also includes 10 female officers, reportedly recruited between 1993 and 1994. Among them are Zille Huma, Zeena Chandio, Sultana Mehdi, Afroza Chauhan, Najam-un-Nisa, Zaib-un-Nisa, Uzma Hafeez, Zain Manzoor, Saeeda Begum, and Zakia Malik.
Interestingly, no officers - male or female - recruited in the year 1992 are featured in the list, while select female officers recruited in adjacent years were included, raising questions over the selection criteria and possible favouritism.
These developments have revived concerns over the violation of the Supreme Court's 2016 directive, which imposed a strict ban on out-of-turn and ""shoulder"" promotions.
At the time, Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali stressed that such practices compromise the rights of eligible officers, while Justice Amir Hani Muslim deemed them discriminatory and unconstitutional.

SBP buys record $223m,"KR
Total FX interventions hit $5.3b in FY25 while rupee weakens to 282.17; bond auctions draw interest
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported net foreign exchange (FX) interventions of $223 million in February 2025, bringing total cumulative purchases to $5.3 billion for the first eight months of FY25 (July 2024 to February 2025). As of the end of February, SBP's foreign exchange reserves stood at $11.25 billion.
A trend analysis shows fluctuations in monthly interventions, with a peak of $1.156 billion in October 2024 and a low of $154 million in January 2025, underscoring the central bank's active role in managing the external account and maintaining reserves.
""SBP conducted net FX interventions of $223m during the month of Feb'25, taking cumulative currency purchases to $5.3b during 8MFY25,"" noted AKD Research. In 2024 alone, Pakistan's central bank made record foreign exchange purchases exceeding $9 billion from the local market to boost its reserves, prompting mixed reactions.
Exchange companies criticised the central bank for excessively favouring exporters without corresponding improvements in performance. They argued that without the SBP's interventions, the rupee might have appreciated to Rs240-250 per US dollar, providing relief to the general public.
On Tuesday, the rupee depreciated by 0.04% day-on-day (DoD) to settle at 282.17 against the dollar, a loss of Rs0.11 from Monday's close of 282.06. The currency has weakened by 1.28% on a calendar year-to-date basis and 1.36% on a fiscal year-to-date basis.
Additionally, on Tuesday, the SBP held an auction for the outright purchase of Government of Pakistan Ijara Sukuk (GIS) on a deferred payment (Bai Muajjal) basis. It accepted Rs53.7 billion against bids of Rs78.2 billion.
In a separate auction of 10-year semi-annual Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), the central bank received bids worth Rs699.9 billion against a target of Rs200 billionan oversubscription of 3.5 times. The SBP accepted Rs187.2 billion, setting the cut-off rate at 12.12% with a current spread of 0.869%, slightly down from the previous spread of 0.999%.
Meanwhile, the T-bill auction attracted even stronger interest, with bids reaching Rs3.3 trillion against a target of Rs650 billion, according to Optimus Research. The SBP accepted Rs772 billion, with cut-off yields declining across all tenors: 1-month at 11.10% (down 15 basis points), 3-month at 11.15% (down 9 bps), 6-month at 11.18% (down 9 bps), and 12-month at 11.20% (down 15 bps).
Gold prices also declined on Tuesday, in line with global trends. In the local market, the price per tola dropped by Rs3,600 to Rs347,900, while the 10-gram rate fell by Rs3,086 to Rs298,268, according to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association. A day earlier, the price per tola had dropped by Rs2,600 to Rs351,500.
Globally, gold prices fell for the second straight session following improved risk sentiment after US President Donald Trump postponed tariffs on the European Union. Spot gold slipped 1.4% to $3,296.79 an ounce by 1301 GMT, according to Reuters.

7-year tariff plan for KE okayed,"US
NEPRA approves Rs39.97/kWh enabling $2b investment tied to performance
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) has approved the seven-year Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) for K-Electric's supply business, covering the period from FY2023-24 to FY2029-30. The decision provides long-term tariff stability and enables K-Electric (KE) to pursue its $2 billion investment plan aimed at improving service quality, reducing losses, and enhancing grid reliability.
As part of the plan, NEPRA has approved KE's average power supply tariff at Rs39.97 per unit under the Multi-Year Tariff for the specified period. Previously, the interim tariff was based on the last MYT and remained effective until March 2023 at a rate of Rs33.82/kWh.
The new MYT aligns KE's supply tariff timeline with those of its generation, transmission, and distribution segments, thereby streamlining regulatory oversight and boosting investor confidence. NEPRA's decision allows KE to recover prudent costs related to fuel, power purchases, transmission and distribution, operations and maintenance (O&M), and working capital, with clearly defined mechanisms for monthly and quarterly adjustments. KE had initially requested a tariff of Rs44.69/kWh, but NEPRA approved Rs39.97/kWh.
A key feature of the decision is NEPRA's acceptance of KE's proposal to recover efficiency losses, using a realistic trajectory for recovery improvements — from 92.76% in FY2024 to 95.48% by FY2030. The authority has also approved the actualisation of sent-out and billed units, to be adjusted annually to reflect economic and operational realities, consistent with the treatment given to other distribution companies (DISCOs). This change is intended to bring KE's supply tariff model in line with the industry's revenue-cap framework.
For its supply business, KE had sought approval for a working capital cost of Rs2.071/kWh, amounting to Rs33.1 billion, based on a total working capital requirement of Rs132.95 billion. KE noted that a large portion of this amount is currently tied up in receivables from government entities, including Tariff Differential Subsidy (TDS) claims, unpaid electricity bills from public sector consumers, and tax refunds. However, these receivables were not included in the current request, as KE is pursuing their resolution separately with the government.
NEPRA approved the calculation of working capital costs using a 3-month KIBOR rate plus a capped spread of 1%, which will be reduced if the actual spread is lower. The approved working capital requirement for FY2023-24 is based on the revised and allowed costs for power purchases, transmission, distribution, and supply margins.
KE stated that it expects sent-out electricity to grow annually at a compound growth rate of 2.6%. This growth will be adjusted based on actual data starting from FY2023, allowing the company to account for any over- or under-recovery of costs. Sent-out units are projected to reach 21,617 GWh by FY2030, up from 18,660 GWh in FY2024.
Distribution charges are estimated at Rs61,385 million, based on a base tariff of Rs3.84/kWh as requested in KE's distribution petition for FY2024 to FY2030. However, NEPRA approved a lower rate of Rs3.31/kWh. KE had also requested transmission charges at Rs2.99/kWh, which have now been linked to the Monthly Demand Index (MDI) as notified by NEPRA.
For Operations & Maintenance (O&M), KE had requested Rs6,758 millionequivalent to Rs0.42/kWhbased on projected billed units for FY2024. After excluding discretionary or non-essential costs, NEPRA approved a total O&M cost of Rs31,963 million for FY2023-24. This includes Rs26,052 million for distribution and Rs5,911 million for supply. NEPRA also noted that KE's actual supply O&M cost of Rs5,911 million was lower than the projected Rs5,926 million based on indexed data from FY2022-23.
NEPRA has instructed KE to ensure an uninterrupted electricity supply and to use recovery-related adjustments responsibly. The regulator will enforce strict performance monitoring, including service quality benchmarks such as the System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI).
This move marks a significant step toward ensuring a predictable and stable power regime for Karachi and its adjoining areas. It is expected to enhance consumer trust while enabling critical infrastructure upgrades by Pakistan's only vertically integrated private utility.

Unbecoming of a PM,"US
.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is perhaps feeling the heat of embarrassment, and is out to provoke his people for more jingoism against Pakistan. His speech at a rally in his hotbed constituency, Gujarat, was unbecoming of the stature of a Prime Minister, and it seems he believes in stooping too low without any concern for diplomatic or interstate ethics.
This reckless provocation has a purpose and that is to derail the momentum of mediation and diplomacy that the US and other major powers are choreographing to usher in peace and stability between the two nuclear states. The fact that they have returned from the brink after a four-day duel, and are keeping their fingers crossed, calls for some statesmanship and not this political vandalism that the Indian premier is resorting to.
For the sake of record-keeping, let us reiterate what Mr Modi uttered in his carried-away saffron fanfare: ""eat your bread or [choose my] bullet."" This appears to be a page taken from the playbook of Nazism, which led the world into a catastrophic World War, devastating civilisations and humanity.
Such brinkmanship is quite common among other BJP and RSS stalwarts too, as they time and again feel like threatening Pakistan to raise their minion status at the cost of regional sanctity. The applause from the crowd adorned in orange and white outfits is a red flag, and it is high time the world community took notice of India's political terrorism following its aggression against Pakistan under the false pretext of Pahalgam killings.
Modi, as an elected leader of one of the world's largest democracies, must reflect on his policies, and the best way out is to clean the Augean stable by addressing the irritants between the two countries.
Pakistan's condemnation is noticeable, and it is right in asserting that the fire-spitting speech was intended to distract attention from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in IIOJK, as well as the failure of the Operation Sindoor. The onus is on India's civil society and the general public to rise to the occasion and checkmate this war-mongering mentality by booting the incumbents out.

China assures of $3.7b refinancing next month,"US
Loans in Chinese yuan to prevent forex dip;  Both sides yet to decide on interest rate issue; Funds will boost forex
China has assured Pakistan of relending $3.7 billion in commercial loans, denominated in Chinese currency, before the end of June, including $2.4 billion that is maturing next month, in a move that will help keep the foreign exchange reserves in double-digits.
Unlike in the past, when Beijing has given loans in non-Chinese currency too, this time Pakistan's strategic ally has decided not to give loans in the United States currency as part of its drive to decouple the economy from the dollar; the government sources told The Express Tribune.
They said that China gave these assurances during recent meetings, aimed at securing the refinancing of loans maturing between March and June 2025. Pakistan has already returned a $1.3 billion loan of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) in three tranches between March and April this year, officials said.
Subject to some clarifications that the commercial bank has sought from Pakistan, it is expected that the ICBC would relend the money in Chinese currency in the next few days, said the government sources. The ICBC had given the loan two years ago at floating interest rates, which translated to around 7.5%.
The central bank's reserves remained around $11.4 billion after a $1 billion injection by the IMF this month. After the next Chinese refinancing, it may increase to $12.7 billion before seeing another dip from the middle of next month, said the sources.
A $2.1 billion or 15 billion RMB syndicate financing loan by three Chinese commercial banks is maturing in June. Pakistan will pay at least three days ahead of the maturity to make sure that the money is given back before the close of the fiscal year. China would give this money in RMB currency, said the sources.
The China Development Bank had given 9 billion RMB, Bank of China 3 billion RMB and ICBC 3 billion RMB. The loan is being extended for a period of three years, said the government sources.
However, the interest rate issue was still undecided. Chinese authorities have given two options to Pakistan. It has proposed that Pakistan should either get the loan at a fixed interest rate or at a floating rate but that would not be based on Shanghai Interbank Offered Rate (Shibor), said the sources.
The timely refinancing of this loan was critical for Pakistan to keep the reserves in the double digits by the end of June. Under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, Pakistan has committed to increase the reserves close to $14 billion in this fiscal year.
The Bank of China's $300 million loan will also mature next month, which Pakistan has to get refinanced to retain the reserves at their critical minimum levels. This loan too would be refinanced in Chinese currency, said the sources.
The move to delink loans from the US dollar is not Pakistan specific rather it is part of the overall Chinese policy to decouple its economy from the US currency. Pakistan remains dependent on Beijing for remaining afloat, the friendly nation that is constantly rolling over the $4 billion cash deposits, $5.4 billion worth commercial loans and $4.3 billion trade financing facility.
The recent IMF report stated that Pakistan's total foreign commercial loans as of December 2024 amounted to $6.2 billion, including $5.4 billion Chinese commercial loans.
The rupee-dollar parity has largely remained stable in this fiscal year, albeit some depreciation during the past few days. The rupee-dollar parity closed at Rs282.2 to a dollar on Tuesday.
When contacted, Ministry of Finance spokesman Qumar Abbasi did not give an official version for the story. He had been requested to confirm whether China has agreed to refinance $1.3 billion ICBC loan paid in March-April and whether it will be refinanced in RMB currency. He also did not respond to a question whether China also agreed to refinance $2.1 billion equivalent CDB-led loan that Pakistan will pay in June.
The IMF report underlined that Pakistan has received firm commitments for $1 billion financing in the next one year. It added that key bilateral partners remain committed to rolling over existing short-term liabilities in the remaining programme period.
But the IMF said that access to external commercial financing is expected to remain limited during the programme period, with a small ""Panda"" bond issuance anticipated in the next fiscal year. The IMF sees a gradual return to the Eurobond and global Sukuk market from fiscal year 2027, reflecting a restoration of policy credibility.

Mahira grows into her stardom,"RO
Actor talks 'Love Guru', showbiz, and finding her rhythm
When Mahira Khan sits down for an interview, she makes it adequately evident that she is indeed a star, a performer who never fails to deliver. Her recent appearance on Excuse Me with Ahmad Ali Butt felt less like a Q&A and more like a rollercoaster ride through memories, mistakes, men and films.From defending Fawad Khan's dance moves to calling Nadeem Baig an ""addiction,"" Mahira's hour and a half-long tell-all speaks to her endless charm and candour.
""I felt like a child again,"" Mahira recalled being on the set of Love Guru, her eyes gleaming. ""I had the time of my life.""
After years of near misses and misfires — she famously said no to Punjab Nahi Jaungi and turned down a few other Nadeem Baig projects — Love Guru is her long-awaited collaboration with Pakistan's blockbuster director. ""Nadeem Baig is an addiction,"" she confessed. ""I wish I'd worked with him earlier.""
Turns out, it was worth the wait. ""I was doing a dance with Nadeem at one point. I couldn't even understand what he was saying, but we just vibed,"" she said about her chemistry with the director.
And while Mahira has always been known as an actor's actor, she was clear: it's directors who fascinate her. ""I'm very amused by directors. Every director has their own unique personality,"" she mused. ""Actors don't really do it for me. But directors, I fall in love with them.""
The brotherhood of blockbusters
Mahira had nothing but praise for her co-star Humayun Saeed. ""There's no one like him. He's generous, secure, and just has a big heart,"" she said. ""He'll give the best line to his co-actor and say, 'It's your scene, speak now.'""
But it wasn't just Humayun who got love. Her long-time collaborator Fawad as well as Fahad Mustafa and Bilal Ashraf, Mahira's favourite trio, were all in the mix.
""I call Bilal 'Billu Bhai.' Every time I needed him, I'd call him and he'd show up."" she smiled. ""Fahad, on the other hand, is a fantastic dancer. I love dancing with him."" On the other hand, Fawad, she candidly dubbed a ""terrible dancer."" While the duo's chemistry has delighted fans for years, Mahira revealed an equally intimate off-screen dynamic. ""What I cherish about Fawad is those moments when he's true to himself. That's rare. I've always protected that side of him.""
Marriage and motherhood
Mahira also opened up about her marriage and the fears that preceded it. ""I was scared,"" she admitted. ""Not of love, but of how it would affect Azlan. I chose to leave a marriage once. I didn't want my son to go through that again.""
It was Azlan who gave her the green light. ""He said, 'Mama, what's wrong with you?' That's when I knew it was time.""
Now, Mahira is happily married to businessman Saleem Karim and glowing with gratitude. ""Azlan loves him for his own reasons, not just because I do.""
Regardless of good and bad times, the star's faith in the universe remains unshaken. ""I tell Azlan all the time: imagine, pray, and work hard for it. I'm a living example of manifestation,"" Mahira said, grinning. ""I even wrote letters to the love of my life and became his Zaalima! But remember, every dream has a price.""
Calling out nonsense
Mahira acknowledged that she should have addressed her differences with Khalil privately, saying, ""He said that I should have called him. He's right."" Following the widely publicised dispute between the two, the actor's mother also suggested the matter could have been handled more discreetly, citing Khalil's seniority. Still, Mahira maintained that the writer's remarks were unacceptable. ""What he said was wrong,"" she said. ""And in our industry, we only call people out when we have nothing to lose. That's not okay  I can separate the artist from the man. And I have done that.""
Mahira and Khalil had a falling out after the writer verbally attacked human rights activist Marvi Sirmed on live television over her feminist views in 2020. Khalil took a hardline stance on the matter and repeatedly said he would neither forgive nor forget Mahira Khan's ""cheap"" tweet criticizing him. He often voiced his disappointment, arguing that instead of posting publicly, Mahira should have reached out to him privately to share her concerns.
As for years of industry trolling, the star recalled regaining her confidence with age. ""I used to feel guilty. Like I didn't deserve success. But now, I don't let it get to me. I actually believe that if people just meet me once, they'll be mesmerised,"" she deadpanned.
Roots in Rampur
Offering rare glimpses into her upbringing, the star spoke about her father, a double-MBA hippie who once lived on a Colombian island, carved wood, and played the flute. ""He went to Woodstock in '69!"" she said. ""He was all about free love.""
On the other hand, her mother was a pioneering remedial teacher who fought to support children with autism and dyslexia. ""She was one of the first to do it in our school. I'm so proud of her.""
Though her parents' marriage was rocky, Mahira's childhood was filled with music, cousins, and laughter. ""I remember my dad playing No Woman No Cry during fights. There was chaos, but there was also love.""
When asked what's next, Mahira laughed: ""I don't plan. I never have. My career's has been entirely intuitive."" She wants to act more, direct soon, and maybe, just maybe, go back to school. ""But only for three months. That's my limit,"" she quipped. The actor closed the podcast with her usual blend of honesty and sparkle: ""I just want to do a lot more. And I want to enjoy it while it's happening because it never comes back.""

Rohit's approach under question,"IE
He continues to struggle against left-arm pacers
Former India opener Virender Sehwag on Monday made a subtle remark about Rohit Sharma's struggles during the powerplay while on commentary during Mumbai Indians' (MI) final league match against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.
The match held at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Monday, saw Sharma once again battling for rhythm early in the innings.
The comment came in response to fellow commentator Aakash Chopra noting that Sharma had not faced many deliveries in the opening overs.
Sehwag quipped that perhaps it was a blessing in disguise, suggesting that Rohit often gets dismissed early when he sees too much of the strike in the first six overs.
""It's good. This way, he would still be at the crease after the powerplay. Otherwise, the more balls he faces in the powerplay, the more chances are there of him getting out,"" Sehwag remarked.
Sharma managed just 24 runs off 21 deliveries at a strike rate of 114.29 before falling to left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar in the 10th over. Attempting a lofted shot, he failed to connect cleanly and was caught by Nehal Wadhera at long-on.
PBKS chased down the 185-run target with ease, winning by seven wickets in 18.3 overs. The victory secured their place in Qualifier 1 and confirmed a top-two finish in the points table.
Meanwhile, MI finishing fourth, will now face the high-stakes route of the Eliminator and Qualifier 2 in their bid to reach the IPL 2025 final.
The 38-year-old's form against left-arm bowlers has been a persistent issue this season. Out of his 13 innings in IPL 2025, he has fallen to left-arm bowlers five times, four of those dismissals coming against pacers.
Despite a scratchy campaign, Sharma has accumulated 329 runs at a healthy strike rate of 147.53, including three half-centuries.

Youm-e-Takbeer: A symbol of unity and strength,"US
The nation stood united, shoulder to shoulder with its government and armed forces.
There come moments in the history of nations when a leader must make a bold decisionone that prioritises national sovereignty and security above all else.
Such decisions etch the leader's name into history, ensuring they are remembered and revered for generations. May 28, 1998, stands as one such historic day, when Pakistan, under the leadership of prime minister Nawaz Sharif, rose with dignity on the world stage and was recognised as a nuclear power.
This landmark day was aptly named Youm-e-Takbeer.
India had conducted nuclear tests on May 11, 1998, in an attempt to dominate the region and assert its superiority. However, Nawaz Sharif, resisting immense international pressure — including a $5 billion aid offer from the United States — chose to uphold Pakistan's dignity and independence.
On May 28, 1998, Pakistan conducted six nuclear tests in Chaghai, effectively neutralising India's nuclear posturing and establishing itself as the first and only nuclear power in the Islamic world.
This bold decision came at a significant cost. Nawaz Sharif and his government faced intense international pressure, economic sanctions, and isolation. Yet, the people of Pakistan stood firmly behind their leadership, sending a clear message to the world: Pakistan would never compromise its sovereignty or national integrity.
Now, 27 years later, that same unwavering resolve has been witnessed again. On May 7, 2025, India once again attempted aggression against Pakistan.
But under the decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan responded with full force.
The nation stood united, shoulder to shoulder with its government and armed forces, reinforcing national resolve.
On May 10, Pakistan delivered a historic blow to Indian aggression, forcing it to retreat. The success of this operation reverberated across the globe.
The world witnessed the might of Pakistan's JF-17 Thunder jets, J-10C aircraft, Fatah missiles, and Shaheen ballistic systems. International media, particularly Western outlets, highlighted India's humiliating defeat, while Indian media —reduced to spreading fake propaganda — was exposed and forced to retract its fabricated claims.
India's arrogance and military adventurism met a crushing response. Prime Minister Modi and his media allies were left to bear the shame of defeat. Pakistan's cyber warfare capabilities further disoriented Indian command structures, compelling India to back down.

"Qalandars not just a team, a movement","US
Their rise reflects passion, unity, and beliefled by the Rana brothers and Shaheen Afridi
The story of Lahore Qalandars is a fascinating one. The owners are two brothers, each with a completely contrasting personality. One, Atif Rana, is cheerful and humorous — he can convey serious messages in a lighthearted tone.
No matter who he's talking to, he doesn't hold back, and sometimes people only realize a day later what he actually meant. Those who meet him once often go on to say, ""Atif Rana is my best friend."" He handles the off-field affairs of the Qalandars.
The other brother, Sameen Rana, is a serious and reserved personality. A chartered accountant by profession, he's a master of his field — no one in the PSL understands finance better. The brothers might never have played cricket even on their rooftop, yet today, they own Pakistan's most successful franchise: Lahore Qalandars. Sameen also manages the team and deals with both the board and the players. He, along with Atif and team captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, form the core think-tank of the Qalandars.
Shaheen joined the team when he was just a kid, not even sporting a mustache — today, he calls the shots. Other franchises rely on large, highly qualified staff, but the way the Rana brothers took this team to the top with limited resources is truly commendable. While others hired high-profile coaches, the Qalandars' coach was so low-profile that few even knew his name — and when the league paused, he left and never returned. Yet, the team still emerged as champions. How? People are left scratching their heads.
Sikandar Raza, the cricketing prince of Zimbabwe, doesn't lack money. Yet when I met him in Dubai this January, he told me he would come to Pakistan well before the PSL began to train with Abdullah Shafique. When the league resumed after a break, he came for just one day, helped the team reach the playoffs, and left again.
No one imagined he would return for the final — but there he was, arriving just ten minutes before the match, present at the time of the national anthem. Critics like Imad Wasim and Shoaib Akhtar attributed this to money, but I can say with absolute certainty — money had nothing to do with it. It was all about commitment and love for the team.
Most teams go into hibernation after the PSL ends and only awaken before the next edition. Not the Qalandars — they stay active all year. Their Player Development Program (PDP) was once mocked by critics. Today, the same people praise it after seeing players like Haris Rauf emerge from it. This year, a young boy from Parachinar, Muhammad Naeem, took the league by storm.
Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Abdullah Shafique — all consider this team their own. It's understandable for Pakistanis, but when a foreign star like Shakib Al Hasan says, ""There should be a franchise like this in Bangladesh,"" you know there's something special.
Poor Shaheen — ever since he became national captain, Babar Azam's keyboard warriors turned against him, portraying him as a villain on social media. But now that he's the PSL's top wicket-taker and has led his team to a third title in four years, all are silent. He earned so much respect he was even named captain of the PSL's team of the tournament.
Just a week before the final, Shaheen confidently told me, ""If God wills, there's a 99.9% chance we will win the trophy,"" — and he was right. I've never seen such confidence in a player. People once claimed Lahore only won because of Rashid Khan. Well, Rashid wasn't even here this time — and they still won. What now?
The early matches were one-sided, and the absence of DRS in later stages affected engagement. Fan interest waned during the tournament, but the final brought back the energy and atmosphere. The match was thrilling — no team in franchise cricket had ever chased 202 runs in a final before. Qalandars did it, giving the league a perfect ending.
Mohsin Naqvi deserves major credit for this. Atif Rana ensured he received a medal from President Asif Zardari, despite his initial refusal. It was Salman Naseer's first tournament as CEO. He performed well, though mistakes were made, and issues arose. He must realize he can't do everything alone — a team is essential.
This league belongs to Pakistan. And in the end, the victory was Pakistan's. When the Qalandars owner took a massive national flag to the ground, that's the message he delivered.

George Floyd lives on through art,"RO
Five years on, graffiti continues to tell slain American's story
Kenda Zellner-Smith hauled up a corrugated metal door to reveal hundreds of wooden boards covered with graffiti, each telling a story of the protests that followed George Floyd's killing by a US police officer.
The 28-year-old has collected and archived the panels that once protected businesses from rioting in Minneapolis, aiming to preserve the legacy of the 2020 murder that shocked the United States.
Five years on, Zellner-Smith said the boards — kept in a storage unit by an industrial site two miles (three kilometres) from where Floyd died - still evoke powerful emotions.
They range from blank plywood with text reading ""I can't breathe"" — the final words Floyd said as Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on his neck — to colourful murals depicting rainbows and love hearts.
""Every time I look at them there's something different I notice,"" she told AFP. ""They reignite an energy or a fire that was felt years ago during the uprising.""
Then a university graduate in Minneapolis, Zellner-Smith was among millions of Americans who joined the Black Lives Matter rallies in 2020 that swept US cities.
The threat of vandalism saw many businesses protect themselves with wooden boards — which became canvases for protesters' slogans and drawings demanding justice.
'Resistance'
Zellner-Smith said she decided to start collecting the boards after seeing one taken down after the protests and thinking ""'Oh my god, these are going to disappear just as fast as they showed up.'""
""Every single day after work, I'd grab my dad's pickup truck and I would just drive around searching for boards,"" said Zellner-Smith, who searched alleyways and dumpsters.
Today, her project called ""Save the Boards"" counts over 600 in its collection, with each stacked vertically in a pair of storage units measuring 10 by 30 feet (three by nine metres).
But with Floyd's legacy under the spotlight on the fifth anniversary of his death as many hoped-for reforms to address racism have not been met, she said the boards are crucial to sustaining the protest movement.
""Art serves as a form of resistance and storytelling, and it speaks to real, lived experiences, and that's what these are,"" Zellner-Smith said.
Her next challenge is finding a long-term home for the boards as grants that cover storage costs are running dry.
A handful are already being exhibited - including in a building restored after it was damaged by arson during the 2020 protests - and most have been photographed to be archived online.
""My biggest push is just to make sure they're still seen. The stories they have to tell are still heard, and that people understand there's still a lot of work to be done,"" Zellner-Smith said.
'Murals gave me hope'
Her initiative is similar to another, more expansive one in Minneapolis called Memorialize the Movement.
That nonprofit exhibited around 50 boards during a memorial event held Sunday on a recreation ground near George Floyd Square, the name given to the area where the 46-year-old was killed.
With Afrobeat music booming from speakers, dozens of people scanned the display that included one piece with squares of black and brown, each filled with phrases like ""We matter"" and ""Protect us.""
Another mostly bare wooden board had just a black love heart with ""No justice, no peace"" written in the middle.
""I think it is absolutely vital that these murals and this story that they tell are preserved for future generations,"" said Leesa Kelly, who has collected over 1,000 pieces while running Memorialize the Movement.
Asked what drove her to start the project, the 32-year-old replied: ""I didn't do this because I was motivated or inspired, I did it because I was experiencing trauma.""
""A Black man was killed. The murals gave me hope,"" said Kelly, who also collected many of the boards herself during the 2020 protests.
Darnella Thompson, 43, was one of those looking at the boards on a warm, sunny day, stopping to take a photo in front of one saying ""Speak up"" and ""Hope.""
""It's overwhelming,"" she told AFP. ""As a person of color who has experienced quite a bit here in this country, it definitely resonates very much with me.""
""It brings up more so sadness than anything because this is continuous,"" Thompson added.

Canada facing 'critical moment': King Charles,"US
.
King Charles III stressed Canada's proud independence on Tuesday as he delivered a major speech to open parliament in Ottawa set against US President Donald Trump's threat to take over the country.
""Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination, and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect,"" Charles said, adding that Canada was facing a ""critical moment.""
Prime Minister Mark Carney invited the 76-year-old British monarch — who is the Canadian head of state — to the capital, accompanied by Queen Camilla.
The king has never publicly commented on Trump's repeated talk of making Canada the 51st US state, but his language was closely watched for veiled references.
Although the speech was read by the king as if his own words, it was written by the prime minister's office to set out the government's priorities to ""build Canada strong"" and how it aims to achieve them.
In addition to his annexation threats, Trump has also launched tariff wars, particularly targeting Canada, a member of the 56-nation British Commonwealth.
""The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing,"" Charles said, in cautious words.
""We must be clear-eyed: the world is a more dangerous and uncertain place than at any point since the Second World War.""
The speech was delivered in the Senate — a former railway station that has been converted while parliament undergoes renovations — with past prime ministers, Supreme Court justices and Indigenous leaders in feather headdresses in attendance.
""You see the enthusiasm for our institutions,"" Carney said in reference to cheering crowds awaiting the king. ""Our sovereignty is strong.""
King Charles's ""speech from the throne"" was the first by a monarch in nearly half a century. It was delivered by Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, in 1957 and 1977.
""In terms of symbolism, it's extraordinary,"" said Felix Mathieu, a politics professor at the University of Quebec in Outaouais.
Tuesday's event, Mathieu said, was a message to Trump to show him that ""Canada is not alone in this fight.""

Scores of premises sealed for 'poor fire safety',"US
Court imposes Rs1.565m fines on owners of sealed factories, warehouses
The Civil Defence Department Rawalpindi has so far sealed as many as 305 small and large factories, workshops, buildings, and warehouses for not installing firefighting equipment and replace old and faulty electrical wiring, despite prior notices issued at the start of the summer season.
The department, following orders from the Punjab Home Department, had launched a major crackdown against factories, multi-story buildings, warehouses, and shops.
A court dealing the cases has so far imposed fines totaling Rs1.565 million on the owners of sealed shops, factories, and warehouses, and the fines have already been collected.
As summer began, the Home Department and the Director General of Civil Defence Punjab had issued notices requiring all multi-story buildings, factories (including those producing plastic, paper, cardboard, shoes, chemicals, and furniture) to install firefighting equipment within one month.
Notices were also issued to replace old, hanging, and faulty electrical wires and switches to prevent fire hazards caused by short circuits. Those who failed to comply were subjected to this enforcement action.
District Officer Civil Defence, Talib Hussain, said that currently seven teams are conducting the operation across various areas, including Kari Road, Chah Sultan, furniture factories, plastic utensil and chair manufacturing units in Pirodhai, warehouses along Chakri Road, Adiala Road, Dhok Syedan, Circular Road, Rawat, Naz Cinema Road furniture factories, and Bagh Sardaran.
Starting today (Wednesday) the operation's scope will extend to the tehsils of Gujar Khan, Kahuta, and Taxila, he added.
Hussain further said that any warehouse or building where a fire breaks out due to a short circuit or gas cylinder explosion and lacks proper or functional firefighting equipment will be sealed, heavily fined, and will remain closed until the necessary equipment is installed.
""Furthermore, cases have been initiated against those institutions, factories, and warehouses that have only installed firefighting equipment as a mere formality without ensuring their functionality.
Fire incidents tend to increase during the summer, and this ongoing operation aims to control and reduce such occurrences. This enforcement drive will continue until June 30.""

CM hikes traffic fines manifold,"US
Fathers of underage drivers to be held accountable for violation
Ordering an increase by up to 10 times in traffic fines to enhance public safety and bring discipline to the roads, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has announced that the father of any underage driver caught in the province will be held responsible for allowing him to drive.
Chairing a meeting to review a proposal to change the traffic police uniform, she said, ""A case will also be registered, and strict action will be taken against those driving with damaged or switched off headlights.""
She lamented, ""There is no improvement in the traffic system. Concrete and sustainable measures will have to be taken. I personally go out and review the traffic situation on different roads of the city. Effective measures taken before traffic accidents occur are the only success.""
The chief minister said, ""A vehicle will be stopped if a chain, etc. is hanging dangerously out of it.""
She added, ""A case will be registered against one-wheeling or dangerous driving.""
She agreed to a proposal to ban parking of loaded trolleys, on the sides of major roads, besides imposing heavy fine for using mobile phones while driving.
She directed the authorities concerned to remove obstacles in the flow of traffic on the Bedian and other city roads.
She also directed the officials concerned to attach the video and photo evidence with the traffic challans.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the department to create five categories of traffic police -- enforcement officer, traffic regulator, education, licensing and public service officer.
She approved a proposal to provide modern patrol vehicles and latest equipment to the traffic police. She said traffic wardens would issue challans on camera for ensuring transparency.
The chief minister also considered remodelling of 372 points in the province, including 77 in Lahore for traffic flow.
She also directed the authorities to install roadside digital screens for early detection of traffic jams.

Australia head coach Andrew McDonald on Tuesday admitted that the final playing XI has not yet been decided and he is facing challenges in selecting the team for the ICC World Test Championship final against South Africa, scheduled to begin on June 11 at Lord's.
As the defending champions eye back-to-back titles, the team management faces several key decisions, particularly regarding the top order and all-rounder roles.
While experienced opener Usman Khawaja is confirmed to take his place at the top, the identity of his partner remains uncertain.
Sam Konstas and Marnus Labuschagne have emerged as potential candidates to open the innings, but McDonald hinted that in-form all-rounder Cameron Green could also be a surprise option for the role.
Green has been in stellar form in England's County Championship Division 2, notching up three centuries for Gloucestershire over the past six weeks.
Although he is unavailable to bowl as he continues recovering from back surgery, McDonald is confident in the 25-year-old's adaptability with the bat.
""I think he can bat anywhere. He could be three, five, six, or even open. He's got the temperament and the skill set, especially the defensive game required higher up the order. He plays the short ball well and covers all bases."" McDonald said.
The uncertainty extends beyond the top order. Australia are also debating whether to include an all-rounder in the final XI. With Green ruled out of bowling duties, Beau Webster, who impressed during his Test outings against India and Sri Lanka earlier this year, is in contention. The 31-year-old could feature if conditions at Lord's warrant an all-rounder's inclusion.
""There's an XI on a board, but it has dashes with multiple names in different positions. We have tried to assemble a 15-man squad that gives us all the options. Whether or not we go with an all-rounder depends on the pitch and conditions, which will then influence how we shape the batting order,"" McDonald revealed.
The final decision will hinge on how much weight the selectors give to the need for a fifth bowling option. According to McDonald, clarity will be provided to players as the match draws nearer.
It is pertinent to mention that the ICC World Test Championship Final is set to take place on June 11, at the iconic Lord's Cricket Ground in London between South Africa and defending champions Australia.
South Africa currently leads the WTC 2023-25 standings, having won eight out of 12 Tests.
After a 1-1 drawn home series against India and a 2-0 defeat in New Zealand, they rebounded with series victories over the West Indies (1-0), Bangladesh (2-0), Sri Lanka (2-0), and Pakistan (2-0).
On the other hand, Australia stands second on the table, with 13 wins and four losses from 19 Tests.
Their journey included a 2-0 win against Sri Lanka, a 3-1 triumph over India, a 2-0 series win against New Zealand, and a 1-1 draw with the West Indies.
They also whitewashed Pakistan 3-0, while the Ashes series against England ended in a 2-2 draw.
Squads
Australia: Pat Cummins (captain), Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Sam Konstas, Matthew Kuhnemann, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, Beau Webster.
South Africa: Temba Bavuma (captain), Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Wiaan Mulder, Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj, Lungi Ngidi, Corbin Bosch, Kyle Verreynne, David Bedingham, Tristan Stubbs, Ryan Rickelton, Senuran Muthusamy, Dane Paterson.

Data breach,"US
.
A chilling reminder of Pakistan's vulnerability in the digital age has emerged with the latest advisory from the National Cyber Emergency Response Team (PKCERT).
Over 180 million login credentials and passwords of Pakistani internet users have been compromised in a massive global data breach, exposing sensitive personal and institutional data tied to global tech giants, government portals and critical services.
This is no small breach. The data - exposed in an unencrypted, publicly accessible file - includes usernames, passwords, emails and URLs linked to services such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and even platforms related to banking, healthcare and government functions.
That such a vast trove of information was not only stolen but left completely unprotected is a stark indictment of our collective failure to take cybersecurity seriously. The consequences of such a breach are not just limited to personal inconvenience or financial fraud.
At scale, they pose serious threats to national security, institutional integrity and the trust that underpins Pakistan's digital governance and commerce landscape. Pakistan's digital footprint has grown exponentially in recent years. Yet, our cybersecurity infrastructure has failed to keep pace with this growth.
PKCERT's advisory calls for immediate protective action, but one-off warnings are not enough. What Pakistan needs is a comprehensive, nationwide cybersecurity strategy that mandates rigorous standards for data protection and incident response.
Regulatory bodies must compel companies, especially those handling sensitive data, to implement robust encryption and security measures. Government systems must be fortified with intrusion detection systems and a trained cybersecurity workforce.
At the individual level, the public must be educated about the risks of weak passwords, the dangers of phishing attempts and the importance of installing antivirus and anti-malware protections. But again, this will requires heavy investment in digital technology.

Webb telescope captures deep view of ancient galaxies,"US
.
The James Webb space telescope's deepest view of a single target yet depicts spinning arcs of light that are galaxies from the universe's distant past, the European Space Agency said Tuesday.
The new image took the world's most powerful telescope more than 120 hours to capture, making it the longest Webb has ever focused on a single target.
It is also ""Webb's deepest gaze on a single target to date"", the European Space Agency (ESA) said in a statement, making the image one of the deepest ever captured of the cosmos.
At the bright centre of the image is a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell S1063, which is 4.5 billion light years from Earth.
But it is not the true target. Such huge celestial objects can bend the light of things behind them, creating a kind of magnifying glass called a gravitational lens.
Therefore the ""warped arcs"" spinning around the Abell S1063 are what really interest scientists, the ESA said in a statement.
Because looking into distant space also means looking back in time, scientists hope to learn how the first galaxies formed during a period known as the Cosmic Dawn, when the universe was only a few million years old.
The image includes nine separate shots of different near-infrared wavelengths of light, the ESA said.
Since coming online in 2022, the Webb telescope has ushered in a new era of scientific breakthroughs.
It has also revealed that galaxies in the early universe are far bigger than scientists expected, leading some to suspect there might be something wrong with our understanding of the cosmos.

"Shehbaz, Aliyev pledge to diversify strategic ties","US
PM thanks Azerbaijan for supporting Pakistan during Marka-e-Haq
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev reaffirmed on Tuesday the shared commitment to diversifying the bilateral strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues, said a news release issued from the Prime Minister's Office.
Shehbaz met with President Aliyev in the city of Lachin for talks on ""the full spectrum of bilateral relations"". During the meeting, both sides underscored the importance of coordinated efforts for regional stability and reiterated their principled positions on key international issues.
The talks on Azerbaijan's Independence Day and on the eve of a trilateral summit of Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye, added a symbolic dimension to the exchange between the two leaders. Shehbaz felicitated President Aliyev on this important national occasion.
The prime minister thanked Azerbaijan for its steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation and acknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan.
Shehbaz noted that the people of Azerbaijan celebrated the success of Pakistan in Maarka-e-Haq. He added that both the countries had stood by each other on every occasion and would continue to do so, the news release stated.
""The two leaders reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation between Pakistan and Azerbaijan,"" read the news release.

Palestinians storm US-backed aid centres,"US
Chaotic scenes as Israel implements new system
Thousands of Palestinians rushed into a new aid distribution centre run by a US-backed group in southern Gaza on Tuesday, AFP journalists reported, leading to chaotic scenes as Israel implemented a new distribution system.
The incident in Rafah came days after the partial easing of a total aid blockade on the territory that Israel imposed since March 2, leading to severe shortages of food and medicine.
According to the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) normal operations resumed following the incident.
""I was standing in the line at an aid distribution point in Rafah with hundreds of citizens, and suddenly a large number of people started pushing and entering randomly,"" Ayman Abu Zaid, a displaced Gazan, told AFP.
""It was because of the lack of aid and the delay in distribution, so they tried to get in to take whatever they could.""
At one point, ""the Israeli forces started shooting, and the sound was very frightening, and people began to scatter, but some still kept trying to take the aid despite the danger,"" he added.
The Israeli military later said its ""troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound"".
""Control over the situation was established, food distribution operations are expected to continue as planned, and the safety of IDF troops was not compromised,"" it said.
The GHF said in a statement that there was a point at which the ""volume of people at the SDS (distribution centre) was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely and dissipate"".
""Normal operations have resumed,"" it added.
AFP footage showed crowds of people streaming out of the area on Tuesday carrying supplies, including in boxes marked ""GHF"".
GHF also blamed ""blockades imposed by Hamas"" for creating delays of several hours at one of its centres.
In a statement of its own, Hamas's government media office said Israel's new efforts to distribute aid in Gaza had ""failed miserably"".

Alcaraz wins Roland Garros opener,"US
Swiatek makes strong start in women's event
Carlos Alcaraz powered into the French Open second round on Monday with a resounding win to start his title defence, while three-time defending women's champion Iga Swiatek also eased through at Roland Garros.
Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz struck 31 winners in a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Italian qualifier Giulio Zeppieri and will face Hungary's Fabian Marozsan in round two.
Alcaraz is now on an eight-match winning streak at the French Open and also took Olympic silver at Roland Garros last year, losing the final to Novak Djokovic.
""The first round is never easy, and coming here as a champion is even more difficult,"" said the Spaniard, who has won both the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open titles on clay this year.
""But I started well, found my rhythm, and I'm happy with my start.""
Alcaraz beat world number one Jannik Sinner in straight sets in the Rome final just over a week ago as the Italian returned from a three-month doping ban.
Two-time reigning Australian Open champion Sinner takes centre stage in the night session against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, who can expect to enjoy much of the support under the lights on Court Philippe Chatrier.
It is the first of two successive potential French opponents for Sinner, who could meet the retiring Richard Gasquet in the second round. Gasquet, 38, takes on another wild card, Terence Atmane, in his 22nd and final Roland Garros.
""It's definitely going to be different,"" Sinner said of the atmosphere that awaits him in Paris after he received a warm welcome back in front of home fans in Italy.
Taylor Fritz of the USA became the first high-profile casualty in the men's draw as the fourth seed lost 7-5, 3-6, 6-3, 6-1 to German Daniel Altmaier.
Norwegian seventh seed Casper Ruud, a two-time French Open runner-up, got his bid for a first Grand Slam title under way with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 win over veteran Spanish qualifier Albert Ramos-Vinolas.
Swiatek cruises through
Swiatek entered the tournament on a near year-long trophy drought but showed signs of form in a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Slovakia's Rebecca Sramkova.
Her struggles since the last of her four French Open titles have been well documented, but she broke her 42nd-ranked opponent four times in a strong display.
The five-time Grand Slam champion's remarkable win-loss record in the tournament now stands at 36-2.
""I knew I needed to stay proactive and try to use my weapons. I'm happy with my performance and it was a solid match,"" said Swiatek, who also beat Sramkova in the second round of this year's Australian Open.
Swiatek, who has dropped to fifth in the world rankings, will next face former US Open champion Emma Raducanu after the Briton defeated China's Wang Xinyu 7-5, 4-6, 6-3.
Raducanu is playing at the French Open for the first time since a second-round exit on her debut in 2022.
Four-time Grand Slam winner Naomi Osaka, who had a match point against Swiatek in the second round at Roland Garros a year ago, was knocked out by Spanish 10th seed Paula Badosa in a tense three-set battle.
Badosa, an Australian Open semi-finalist earlier this year, fought back from a set down to win 6-7 (1/7), 6-1, 6-4.
Osaka has still never got past the third round at Roland Garros.
Former Wimbledon winner Elena Rybakina battled past Argentinian qualifier Julia Riera 6-1, 4-6, 6-4, two days after lifting her first WTA title since April 2024 in Strasbourg.
American ninth seed Emma Navarro suffered an embarrassing 6-0, 6-1 loss to Spanish world number 68 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro in just 57 minutes, only winning a game when her opponent double-faulted to gift her a break when serving for a double-bagel victory.

The drowning Karachi coast,"US
.
Karachi is the largest city of Pakistan, an economic powerhouse and one of the busiest seaports in South Asia. It plays a crucial role in driving the country's trade and commerce, but an environmental crisis lies beneath the surface of this vital hub.
The waters surrounding the port, particularly in the harbour area, are heavily polluted with industrial waste, sewage and oil spills, posing a threat to the marine ecosystem and the livelihoods of numerous people who depend on the sea.
To address environmental challenges, Pakistan has implemented various rules and regulations. In line with these efforts, the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) established the Marine Pollution Control Department in 1996. However, even after such measures, there has been little to no impact on the pollution at Karachi port.
This insight examines the legal and environmental challenges of coastal pollution at Karachi Port and assesses the effectiveness of sewage treatment initiatives, such as the S-III plan.
The Harbour, which spans over 62 sq km, receives a diverse range of pollutants, including at least 411 million gallons per day (MGD) of liquid effluents, 122 MGD of municipal waste and 350 MGD of industrial waste. Moreover, operational waste from hundreds of fishing crafts at Karachi Fisheries and Karachi Port also contributes significantly to the pollutants.
This pollution harms marine life, damages fish habitats and mangroves, corrodes ships and negatively impacts the health of coastal residents and tourists. This escalating pollution crisis has become a national security threat - endangering marine ecosystems, the blue economy and trade operations.
This longstanding issue has continued despite various efforts. The Pakistan Environmental Protection Ordinance 1983, promulgated after Pakistan acceded to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, focused on penalising industries rather than helping them transition to eco-friendly processes.
Later, in 1997, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act came into force, under which owners of industrial units were responsible for treating industrial waste and disposing of wastewater properly. In addition to these national laws, Pakistan is a signatory to several international conventions.
These include the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and the London Convention and Protocol (1972), which regulate marine pollution by restricting waste disposal at sea; and the Basel Convention (1989), which aims to prevent harm from hazardous waste and its transboundary movement.
After the 18th constitutional amendment devolved environmental responsibilities to the provinces, inconsistencies between federal policies and provincial enforcement created gaps that weakened the effectiveness of international commitments.
To address the deteriorating pollution in Karachi's coastal waters, exacerbated by the poor enforcement of laws and industrial non-compliance, the government has launched several infrastructure projects. These include several sewerage plans, the first being S-I and the second being S-II, both of which focused on modernising Karachi Port to make it competitive in international trade.
Alongside these, the Greater Karachi Sewerage Plan (S-III) was introduced. Conceived in 2007 and launched in 2013, it is a major project designed to treat up to 460 MGD, which currently flows untreated into the Arabian Sea, endangering the environment and public health, and to rehabilitate and expand Karachi's sewage treatment capacity by ensuring that wastewater is managed correctly.
S-III includes the development of several key sewage treatment plants (STPs) strategically located across the city. TP-I is situated in Haroon Abad, while TP-II was proposed in the Korangi Industrial Area. TP-III is in Mauri Pur and TP-IV was planned for construction near Mahmood Abad.
While TP-I and TP-III remain central to the project's implementation, TP-II and TP-IV were eventually discontinued due to land disputes and logistic challenges, as the proposed sites faced issues such as limited space and difficulties in acquiring the necessary land for construction.
TP-I is designed to treat 100 MGD of sewage and is being implemented in phases, starting with an initial capacity of 35 MGD, increasing to 65 MGD, and ultimately reaching its full capacity. As of September 2024, civil works on TP-I are 58% complete, mechanical works are at 29%, while electrical installations are yet to begin. The estimated completion date for TP-I is June 2026.
TP-III, located in Mauri Pur, was partially operationalised in 2018 with a treatment capacity of 54 MGD. However, over time, this capacity has decreased to 35 MGD due to inadequate maintenance and infrastructure deterioration.
Plans are now in action to upgrade TP-III to treat 180 MGD, with an intended completion date of Dec 2026. Furthermore, trunk sewer systems are being developed to channel sewage from major basins, such as Lyari and Malir, to these treatment facilities. Particularly, a 33km sewer pipeline from Surjani Town to Mauri Pur has been partly completed to serve the Lyari basin.
Despite progress, S-III faced setbacks, with TP-I and TP-III delayed due to a federal-provincial dispute over cost increases, as well as a four-year construction halt from 2019 to 2023 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The project's cost has escalated to over Rs36 billion, from an initial estimate of Rs7.9 billion, due to delays, scope expansion and funding disputes.
The federal government initially provided funds but later withdrew its support, shifting the entire financial burden to the Sindh government. Moreover, delays in machinery acquisition, a lack of trained personnel and ineffective coordination among authorities have considerably slowed implementation efforts.
To help tackle the pollution crisis in Karachi, the World Bank has committed $240 million under the Second Karachi Water and Sewerage Services Improvement Project (KWSSIP-II) to support broader improvements in Karachi's water and sanitation infrastructure. However, this funding has been dispersed across multiple projects, including upgrading water supply systems, improving sewage treatment plants, expanding drainage networks and enhancing the institutional capacity of water utilities. So, its impact on the pollution issue has been diluted.
Rising costs and limited funding have delayed projects, such as S-III. The failure to fully implement these plans has already begun to be reflected in worsening coastal pollution and degradation of aquatic ecosystems.
In conclusion, the perpetual pollution crisis at Karachi Port serves as a stark reminder of Pakistan's long-standing environmental governance negligence and inefficiencies. Despite multiple legal frameworks, institutional efforts and infrastructure projects, the envisioned goals of sewage treatment and marine conservation remain largely unattainable.
S-III is now the sole responsibility of the Sindh government after the Federal government withdrew its support, even as project costs soared from Rs7.9 billion to over Rs36 billion, with some estimates reaching Rs54 billion. By urgent, unified action and time-bound goals, Pakistan can still reverse the environmental degradation of its coastal waters and protect the future of its blue economy.

Auto sector seeks long-term policy,"US
Opinions divided over import of used cars, reduction in duties and tariffs
Experts of the auto sector, in their budget proposals, have called on the government to draw up a long-term policy and provide relief to the industry and customers in the larger interest of the national economy.
Automobile sector consultant Shafiq Ahmed Shaikh said it augurs well that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows interest in the auto sector and now its issues will not only be highlighted, but solutions will also be provided for the long run.
The IMF's suggestion to remove restrictions on the import of used vehicles is very critical because used cars will compete for the same market where the existing industry is operating. Another suggestion for a gradual reduction in duties will also prove to be a game changer.
According to policymakers, this specific proposal will not only bring down trade barriers but will also simplify customs procedures, including the phased elimination of additional customs duty (ACD) and an 80% reduction in regulatory duty (RD). It will gradually reduce the weighted average tariff from 10.6% in FY25 to 7.4% by FY30.
These tariff cuts will reduce protection for the local auto industry, lower the cost of vehicles as well as increase exports and affordability.
""It is really a sensitive point, which must be discussed with the auto industry and other stakeholders for long-term and acceptable solutions,"" he said. ""As we know, electric vehicles (EVs) are the future, which will mainly come from China, so it is the right time that sustainable and long-term policies and incentives for EVs and their accessories are introduced for better investments and more jobs.""
Indus Motor CEO Ali Asghar Jamali called for revising the financing limit from Rs3 million to 70% of a vehicle's retail price and extending the financing tenure from three years to seven years. It is good to encourage overseas Pakistanis to purchase locally manufactured vehicles by offering tax and duty exemptions, provided payments are made through foreign currency accounts. This will help shift demand away from used car imports.
He stressed the need for offering tax and duty breaks to vehicle exporters to ensure competitive international pricing. Additionally, there is a need to sign free trade agreements and preferential trade agreements to enhance global competitiveness and market accessibility for Pakistani vehicles.
As far as used cars are concerned, the import of such cars should be restricted as it adversely impacts economic growth, fosters tax evasion and fuels the grey market. Pakistan has an annual manufacturing capacity of 500,000 passenger vehicles, of which 76% remains underutilised. There is an urgent need to keep a suitable tariff difference between completely knocked down (CKD) and completely built-up (CBU) units to incentivise local assembly, promote job creation and support economic growth.
The government should develop a consistent and stable policy framework for the automotive sector to ensure long-term growth and avoid frequent policy changes. This includes the formulation of a comprehensive policy to promote the establishment of local industries for essential raw material such as steel, resin, aluminium and copper, which are critical components for high-value goods. For instance, India's steel policy has enabled it to become a net exporter of steel.
Jamali pleaded for rationalising the tax structure for locally manufactured vehicles to create a level playing field with the imported used cars. He also called for adjusting the depreciation rate for the imported used cars from 1% to 0.5% to enhance tax revenue for the government.
Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam) Senior Vice Chairman and Jin Kwang JAZ Limited Executive Director Shehryar Qadir voiced deep concern over reports that the government was considering slashing peak customs duty on CBUs to 15% and CKD units to below that threshold by 2030 under the National Tariff Policy 2025-30.
Though it has been termed a structural reform aimed at promoting export-led growth and aligning with the IMF's liberalisation benchmarks, critics argue the proposal risks triggering de-industrialisation and could unravel decades of investment in Pakistan's automotive sector. Paapam has emerged as a leading voice against the proposed cut, warning that such a drastic step will render local parts manufacturers uncompetitive in their own market.
The association has submitted a comprehensive objection to the Engineering Development Board (EDB), asserting that the policy, if implemented, will jeopardise one million direct and indirect jobs and erode investor trust in Pakistan's industrial policy continuity.
The local parts makers face additional cost disadvantages compared to regional countries in the form of higher freight (on raw material as steel, plastic resin or rubber is not produced in Pakistan) and financing costs as well as smaller economies of scale. A recent study submitted by Paapam to the EDB shows that Pakistan's parts industry suffers from a 34% cost disadvantage relative to the regional peers.

Experts warn against public pool dips,"US
Skin diseases, bacterial infections spreading through shared water
As temperatures continue to rise across the region, medical experts have warned the public-especially youths-against health risks associated with swimming in pools and tube wells during the summer.
Muzaffargarh District Headquarters Hospital Deputy Medical Superintendent Dr Mustafa Zafar, several cases have recently been reported indicating health complications due to swimming in public pools and tube wells. He emphasized the urgent need for precautionary measures to avoid serious health risks.
""Swimming pools are a breeding ground for bacteria and infections,"" Dr Zafar said while speaking to media.
""Multiple people bathe in the same water, and with a shared drainage system, the risk of disease transmission increases significantly.""
He said that sudden exposure to cold water after being in the sun can pose a threat to the veins, increasing the chances of paralysis.
""Skin diseases are also a major concern. If an individual with a skin infection enters a pool, others using the same water are at risk of contracting the disease.""
Dr Zafar advised the public to stay indoors during peak heat hours and increase water intake to stay hydrated. He urged citizens to avoid swimming in uncontrolled and unhygienic water bodies during the heatwave.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has predicted a further rise in temperatures in the coming days.
With an expected increase in the number of people heading to pools and tube wells to beat the heat, authorities emphasise the importance of public awareness to prevent health emergencies.

Thousands of NGOs operate without oversight,"AU
Over 18,000 NGOs operate nationwide, but only about 1,000 were officially registered
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety was told on Tuesday that over 18,000 NGOs operate nationwide, but only about 1,000 were officially registered, with the vast majority flying under the radar.
The committee expressed grave concern over the presence of unregistered NGOs, terming them a potential threat to sensitive national matters, and recommended the formulation of a national framework to regulate the sector.
During the meeting, officials also briefed the committee on the progress of various welfare projects, particularly regarding the deadlines given for their completion.
The committee expressed serious concern over the delays in timely execution and demanded greater accountability.
Expressing displeasure over the incompletion of a pilot project that was supposed to be finalised in July, the committee summoned the Secretary Finance and the Secretary for Industries and Production to appear in the next session.
The committee also called on the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan and heads of private banks to appear before the panel in the upcoming meeting to review coordination issues linked with poverty reduction programmes.
Briefing the committee on the Prime Minister's Ramazan Relief Package, officials revealed that 2.7 million out of 3.5 million deserving families had been provided assistance through digital wallets.

GenAI in education: between promise and precaution,"DK
.
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping the landscape of education and research, demanding a thoughtful and urgent response from educators and policymakers. As a faculty member and a member of the Advanced Studies and Research Board at a public sector university,
I have witnessed both the excitement and the uncertainty that AI tools like ChatGPT have generated within academic circles. While the potential of GenAI to enhance learning and scholarly productivity is undeniable, its unregulated and unchecked use poses significant risks to the core principles of academic integrity, critical thinking and equitable access to knowledge.
As Pakistan embraces digital transformation and positions itself within the global digital economy, AI literacy has emerged as a foundational competency. In an earlier op-ed published in these columns on October 5, 2024 entitled 'AI Education Revolution', I emphasised that AI literacy is not just a technical skill, but a multidisciplinary competence involving ethical awareness, critical thinking and responsible engagement.
That argument is now even more relevant. With tools like ChatGPT and DALL•E becoming commonplace, students must be equipped to not only use them effectively but to understand their societal and epistemological implications.
GenAI offers immense opportunities. It enables personalised learning, streamlines research, provides real-time feedback and enhances access to complex knowledge. For students in under-resourced areas, it can bridge educational gaps.
For researchers, it reduces the cognitive burden of information overload. But with these capabilities comes the risk of over-reliance. The seamless generation of essays, analyses and even ideas without meaningful engagement undermines the very purpose of education — cultivating independent thought and inquiry.
One of the most pressing issues is the shift in how students perceive learning. Many now use AI tools as shortcuts, often without malintent, bypassing critical processes of reasoning and originality. This trend not only threatens academic rigour but fosters a culture of passive dependence — something that was forewarned in the context of AI misuse and unintentional plagiarism in academic settings. As discussed in the earlier op-ed, the absence of AI literacy can blur the lines between learning and copying, between thinking and prompting.
To address these risks, UNESCO's recent guidance on AI in education offers a valuable framework. Governments must legislate clear, enforceable policies around age-appropriate use, data protection and algorithmic transparency. Educational institutions must rigorously assess the pedagogical validity and ethical dimensions of AI tools before integrating them. But perhaps the most crucial intervention lies in embedding AI literacy directly into curricula across disciplines but as a horizontal skill akin to critical thinking or digital citizenship.
Hands-on engagement with GenAI is essential. Students must not only generate content but also critically evaluate it for bias, coherence and accuracy. To support this, assessments should evolve — emphasising oral presentations, collaborative projects and reflective analysis to promote authentic learning.
Educators, too, must adapt through targeted training that enables them to guide students responsibly. Institutions should support this shift with updated pedagogical strategies and professional development programmes that integrate AI while preserving academic integrity.
Given AI's borderless nature, international cooperation is vital. UNESCO must continue leading efforts to establish shared ethical frameworks and best practices. Pakistan should actively engage in this global dialogue while strengthening local capacity through curriculum reform, infrastructure investment and academic-policy collaboration to ensure GenAI serves as a responsible and equitable tool for learning.
GenAI is not a passing phase, it is a structural shift. Whether it becomes a tool for democratising knowledge or a force that erodes educational values depends on how we act today. The future of education will not be determined by machines alone, but by the wisdom with which we choose to engage with them.

Shehki believes romance is the key to good music,"RO
Singer looks back on his glory days
In an interview with Imran Ashraf, veteran musician Mohammed Ali Shehki shared that his approach to music involves romance, be it real or fantasy. And he believes that all artists should champion a similar mindset.
Confessing that he would picture his muse while performing, he said, ""An artist has to be in love all the time, whether it is with your wife, girlfriend, or someone who only exists in your fantasy.""
Tapping into his romantic side, the singer serenaded the audience with his hit love song, Pyar Kiya Mein Ne Dil Diya. Indulging nostalgia, he reflected on his past fame and the road that led him to stardom in the 1970s.
""There was a lot of craze in that era. But that doesn't exist now since there has been an influx of singers in the scene. Now, nobody is aware of who's who, but back then, there were only a few of us. Actually, just two,"" he said, nodding to his and Alamgir's names.
The Mae Bhi Pakistan Hoon singer then shared the origins of his journey. ""It used to be very difficult to get into the entertainment industry. A makeup artist, Lily Raza, carved the path inside for me,"" he said, adding that the two formed a connection due to having Irani roots.
Shehki, who is also recognised for his acting credits in films such as Dekh Tamasha and Choron Ka Badshah, mentioned that he used to perform at hotels before earning his big break.
""Ghazanfar Ali had come on television for the first time. He was doing a program with Tara Ghanshyam, who had a full show to herself. She would sing, dance, and introduce new artists in the show. So they took me as a new artist.""
He recalled that a song was created as a duet for the two of them, though Ghanshyam had taken ill before it could be performed. ""Either she was unable to sing it or she was down with a bellyache, so she left,"" he said. ""I thought that I'd lost that opportunity. But then Ghazanfar Ali sahab said, 'Hey, listen. You'll sing this song solo without any complaints.' So I sat there and the song was rewritten.""
That led to Shehki availing what became his second shot as a solo artist, though this one got him the recognition he was looking for. ""I was in the studio singing while the musicians recorded everything live, and the song was made,"" he said. ""Then as time passed, the song became a superhit.""

Cashless economy a necessity for fiscal resilience: FinMin,"US
Aurangzeb calls for leveraging tech to simplify financial access for individuals, businesses
Federal Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday chaired a high-level meeting at the Finance Division to discuss a host of measures for advancing Pakistan's transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy.
The meeting brought together senior representatives from Pakistan's financial sector, including commercial banks, development finance institutions, regulators and investment experts, who form the core of a committee set up by the minister for crafting recommendations to support Pakistan's transition towards the digital economy.
Participants engaged in comprehensive discussions on a series of key proposals aimed at fostering greater adoption of digital payments. They reached consensus on a range of measures intended to expand access to digital financial services, encourage the use of digital transactions and reduce reliance on cash in everyday economic activity.
Among the key areas of the agreement was the need to ensure that digital payment options were widely available and accessible across various sectors, including retail, services and public sector transactions. The participants supported steps that would encourage broad-based interoperability by particularly leveraging the Raast instant payment system, which would lead to improved consumer choice in using digital payment platforms.
It was agreed that creating a more level playing field between cash and digital transactions was essential and incentive structures should be rebalanced to make digital payments further attractive and cost-effective for both consumers and businesses. The importance of improving cost structures related to digital transaction infrastructure, including merchant acquisition and service provision, was highlighted as a priority to enable wider outreach, especially for small merchants and underserved communities.
The finance minister, while welcoming the committee's recommendations, emphasised that digitalisation was central to Pakistan's economic modernisation agenda. He noted that increasing the footprint of digital payments would significantly enhance financial transparency, promote inclusion and improve efficiency in both public and private sector operations.
Aurangzeb stressed that moving towards a cashless economy was not simply a policy aspiration, but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness and inclusive growth.
""Digitalisation is the foundation of a modern financial system. We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payment environment that is inclusive, interoperable and focused on the ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,"" he remarked. The minister underscored the importance of leveraging technology to simplify financial access for individuals and businesses while ensuring policy alignment across different stakeholders.
The meeting concluded with a directive to the committee to prepare a detailed and time-bound roadmap for implementation of the initiatives.
On Tuesday, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb also met with a delegation of the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers, led by Patron-in-Chief Abbas Akbar Ali.
The delegation highlighted the critical challenges facing the steel industry, including high energy costs, regulatory inconsistency and the need for a stable policy environment to ensure long-term investment and growth. They also outlined the impact of tax policies on formal businesses and sought the government's support for creating a level playing field.
The finance minister acknowledged the industry's concerns and reiterated the government's commitment to supporting the productive sectors of the economy. He noted that the steel sector was playing a pivotal role in infrastructure development and job creation and assured the delegation that their input would be considered in the ongoing budgetary meetings and policy discussions.
He emphasised that Pakistan's economic revival required collective responsibility. ""Every sector has to play its role in stabilising and growing the economy. We cannot allow the burden to fall solely on the formal sector and the salaried class,"" he stated. Aurangzeb elaborated that the government was pursuing a broad-based strategy to expand the tax base, reduce reliance on over-taxed segments and bring the undocumented economy into the fold.
In this regard, the prime minister is leading regular meetings aimed at strengthening economic governance and enforcing equity across sectors. The minister encouraged continued dialogue between the industry and the government to align reforms with the practical ground realities. He reaffirmed the commitment to ensuring that economic policy was transparent, inclusive and growth-oriented.

Pakistan focuses on sustainability in Osaka,"US
Commerce minister encourages investors to explore joint venture avenues
""The theme of Pakistan pavilion at Expo 2025, Osaka is inspired by unique natural treasure Pink Rock Salt, found only in the Salt Range of Pakistan,"" said Jam Kamal Khan, Federal Minister for Commerce, while talking to media at the exhibition on Tuesday. He outlined the vision of Pakistan's participation in the World Expo 2025, being held in Osaka, Japan, which encapsulates the country's goals for sustainable growth, cultural harmony and economic prospects.
The minister emphasised that Pakistan cannot remain absent from global platforms like the Expo 2025 Osaka, where the world comes together to exchange ideas and address challenges collectively. He stated that Pakistan has made its presence felt with a bold and unified theme that reflects the country's commitment to sustainability, creativity and exemplary craftsmanship.
He stressed that with the theme ""Universe in a Grain of Salt,"" Pakistan's pavilion presents a compelling narrative rooted in nature. Highlighting the pavilion's symbolic use of Pink Rock Salt, the minister explained, ""Salt, in its purity and strength, represents our timeless connection to the earth. Through it, we are sharing a vision of sustainability and nature-centric progress with the world.""
""The pavilion was built on 100% energy conservation and minimal carbon emissions, aligning perfectly with the broader theme of Expo 2025: 'Designing Future Societies for Our Lives,'"" he added. ""Our message is simple – future societies must be born from nature and must remain linked to it.""
The minister spoke about Pakistan's potential in sectors like textiles, food and agriculture, minerals, digital services and clean energy. He encouraged the international business community to explore investment and joint venture avenues while pointing to Pakistan's young workforce, strategic location and ongoing policy reforms.

Ronaldo says Al-Nassr chapter 'over',"US
The 40-year-old Portuguese forward joined the club in 2022
Questions swirled over Cristiano Ronaldo's future in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday, hours after the superstar indicated he might be leaving Al Nassr in a social media post, just hours following the end of the Saudi Pro League season.
The 40-year-old Portuguese forward joined Al Nassr in 2022 from Manchester United and his contract with the Saudi club ends this summer.
A special transfer window runs from June 1-10 to allow the 32 clubs involved in the Club World Cup to sign players.
Al-Nassr are not at the Club World Cup unlike fellow Saudi side Al Hilal.
FIFA president Gianni Infantino last week said ""there are discussions"" over the former United, Real Madrid, Juventus and Sporting Lisbon star playing at the enlarged tournament in the United States starting on June 14.
""This chapter is over,"" Ronaldo cryptically said on social media with a photo of him in an Al Nassr shirt.
""The story? Still being written. Grateful to all.""
Top scorer
Ronaldo's potential exit from Saudi Arabia will likely raise fresh questions about how the Saudi Pro League would fare in his absence, with rumours already circulating of other ageing football stars eyeing opportunities in the kingdom.
On Monday, Simone Inzaghi played down rumours he is set to leave Inter Milan after the Champions League final amid widespread reports of interest from Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal.
Ronaldo's announcement comes just months after Brazilian star Neymar ended his injury-plagued 18 month stay in the kingdom, where he played just seven times with Al Hilal after joining the club in August 2023 -- despite a reported salary of around $104 million a year.
The cryptic post from Ronaldo comes after Al Nassr lost in the semi-finals of the Asian Champions League last month to Japan's Kawasaki Frontale and finished third in the Saudi Pro League.
Ronaldo was the league's top goal scorer on 25.
Last year, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said he could end his career with Al Nassr.
Ronaldo's great rival Lionel Messi will play at the Club World Cup with Inter Miami.
During a recent interview with YouTuber and streamer IShowSpeed, Infantino said: ""And Ronaldo might play for one of the teams as well at the Club World Cup.
""There are discussions with some clubs, so if any club is watching and is interested in hiring Ronaldo for the Club World Cup... who knows, who knows.""
Saudi Arabia has shaken up football by spending heavily on stars from Europe, starting with Ronaldo's move in late 2022, and the desert nation will host the World Cup in 2034.
For nearly two years, Saudi football fans could watch the likes of Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, with six Ballons d'Or between them, on any given weekend during the football season in the kingdom.
However, the oil-fuelled Saudi football project has drawn comparisons with the Chinese Super League, which imported players on exorbitant salaries until team owners went bust as the Chinese economy fizzled.

Akram backs Younis as Pakistan Test coach,"US
A new coach can help change the mindset of the team, says Akram
Former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram has suggested that former captain Younis Khan could be the right choice to lead Pakistan's red-ball Test cricket team as head coach.
Speaking at an event in Karachi, Wasim shared his thoughts on the recently concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) Season 10 and offered his views on the future coaching setup of the national team.
""Younis Khan can be a good option as a batting coach for red-ball cricket. A new coach can help change the mindset of younger players,"" Akram said.
He added that a fresh approach from the new coach could benefit the team.
Wasim also praised some standout performances from the PSL, highlighting emerging players.
""Hasan Nawaz impressed during the PSL. Salman Mirza and Ali Raza also bowled well,"" he noted.
The former pacer emphasized the need for patience with players, especially when adjusting to the fast pace of T20 cricket.
""Players should be given time to settle in T20 cricket,"" he advised.
On the delicate topic of cricket relations between Pakistan and India, Wasim remained cautious.
""I cannot comment on what might change in Pakistan-India cricket,"" he said.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had earlier appointed Aaqib Javed as the red-ball coach after Australian Jason Gillespie stepped down. Aaqib acted as interim head coach across all formats until Pakistan's tour of New Zealand in April.
Recently, Aaqib was named Director of High Performance, while former New Zealand coach Mike Hesson took charge as Pakistan's white-ball head coach.Hesson's first assignment will be a three-match T20I series at home against Bangladesh, starting May 28. The Bangladesh team, led by Litton Das, has arrived in Pakistan and began training ahead of the series.
Pakistan will focus on their white-ball fixtures before preparing for their next red-ball challenge — the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) 2025-27 cycle.

Zardari seeks PPP revival in Punjab,"US
President tasks leaders with grassroots mobilisation, new Lahore leadership
President Asif Ali Zardari has intensified efforts to reorganise the PPP in Punjab, issuing detailed organisational directives during a series of high-level meetings with party leaders in Lahore.
During his visit to the provincial capital on Tuesday, Zardari, who also serves as the co-chairman of the PPP, instructed party officials to ramp up public outreach efforts across Punjab.
He stressed the importance of holding workers' conventions in each district and directed the party's leadership to urgently complete any pending organisational structures in consultation with the central leadership.
The president assured party members that the Lahore chapter of the PPP would be restructured and made fully operational, including the appointment of a new city president.
Zardari also tasked Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan and other senior figures with intensifying door-to-door campaigns to promote the party's manifesto and convey Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's message.
He stressed the need to engage the youth in party structures and called for a comprehensive performance report on the party's provincial status to be submitted within one month.
A day earlier, Zardari met with a PPP delegation from District Attock, led by Governor Haider, at the Governor's House.
During the meeting, the president underscored the importance of national security, citing the PPP's longstanding support for the armed forces during periods of heightened tensions with India.
He described the PPP as a party rooted in the working class, government employees and marginalised communities, and highlighted its historic contributions and sacrifices for democracy and national stability.
Zardari also accepted an invitation to visit Attock, extended by the district delegation.
In a separate meeting with Barrister Aamir Hassan, a senior party leader and member of the PPP Central Election Cell, Zardari reiterated the party's unwavering commitment to Pakistan's sovereignty and defence.
He credited slain former prime minister and founder of the PPP, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, with launching Pakistan's nuclear programme and his daughter, former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, with advancing the country's missile technology. He termed these achievements pivotal contributions to national security.
""Pakistan's defence remains in strong hands,"" Zardari said, adding that the vision of a unified India propagated by Hindutva ideologues would never come to fruition. ""Pakistan is united and indivisible. All federating units are firmly aligned under the national framework.""
He further emphasised the need for political stability and inter-party cooperation, noting the PPP's coordination with the PML-N in Punjab to address public issues.

"10,000 sq-ft national flag to fly high at Wagah on Youm-e-Takbeer","US
Park visitors were drawn to the unusual sight and were seen taking selfies
A massive 10,000 square foot Pakistani flag, specially prepared in Karachi for Youm-e-Takbeer, has been dispatched to Lahore, where it will be hoisted at the Wagah Border opposite the Indian Tricolour on a 110-foot-high pole. The flag surpasses the size of the previous national flag flown at the same location by 400 square feet.
The preparation of this monumental flag was part of celebrations marking the historic victory of Operation Bonyan al-Marsous and the national pride associated with May 28, Youm-e-Takbeer.
The intricate production process spanned two weeks at a factory in Karachi's Korangi area, where around 25 skilled workers worked day and night on stitching and assembly.
After initial processing at the factory, various materials were shifted to Hill Park (near Tariq Road), where the crescent and star were drawn, cut, and stitched onto the massive green canvas.
Park visitors were drawn to the unusual sight and were seen taking selfies with the enormous flag and engaging with the flag-making team to learn more about the process.
Speaking to Express News, Sheikh Nisar Parachamwala of VIP Flag Company said, ""With this flag, we are breaking our own record. The previous national flag hoisted at Wagah measured 9,600 square feet; this one is around 10,000 square feet."" He added that the most critical and technical phase in the process was cutting the crescent and star - a task that requires extreme precision and craftsmanship to ensure perfect curves and angles.

CII takes exception to child marriage bill,"US
CII takes exception to child marriage bill
The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) has rejected a bill that bans marriage under the age of 18 in Islamabad, describing it as un-Islamic. The council has also declared the Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2025, presented by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) government, in conflict with Shariah.
A meeting of the CII was held on Tuesday chaired by Dr Raghib Hussain Naeemi.
According to the statement issued after the meeting, the council discussed the bill presented by MNA Sharmila Faruqi of the PPP and passed by the National Assembly on May 17.
The bill was introduced with the object to curb, discourage and eventually eradicate the concept and phenomenon of child marriages. It said no Nikah registrar shall register a marriage where one or both the contracting parties are below the age of 18 years.
It stated that whoever contravened with or failed to comply with sub-section (1) and (2) of the bill shall be liable to be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which shall not be more than one year and with fine amounting to Rs100,000, or both, unless he proved that he had reason to believe that the marriage was not a child marriage.
The bill sought further punishment for male adults above 18 years of age marrying a child. ""Whoever, being a male above eighteen years of age, contracts a child marriage shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to three years but shall not be less than two years and shall be liable to fine,"" it said.
The CII noted that the clauses defining marriage under the age of 18 as sexual assault and prescribing punishments do not align with Islamic injunctions. The statement clarified that the bill to prohibit child marriage was not referred to the CII for review before legislation.
The council also found the Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2025 submitted by the K-P government to be in contradiction with Shariah.
The CII emphasized that thalassemia testing before marriage should be optional, not mandatory, adding that, according to Islamic teachings, marriage should be kept free from unnecessary complications.
The council also expressed concern over the irresponsible reporting of court decisions. It clarified that forcing the bride's family to provide dowry items is contrary to Islamic teachings.
The statement also said that women should have the right to choose whether to keep the domicile of their husband's area or that of their parents after marriage.
It ruled that after the completion of iddat — the mandatory waiting period — the husband is not financially responsible for the divorced wife. In Islamic Shariah, iddat is also observed in the event of the husband's death.
The CII also proposed amendments to Clause 7 of the Muslim Family Laws (Amendment) Bill 2025, which was referred to it by the Ministry of Religious Affairs, and formed a committee to draft a new version of the law.
The meeting also considered questions received from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), as well as issues related to mudarabah (Islamic finance), housing schemes, and investment matters.

The Marvel character David Tennant wanted to enact,"US
Actor laments on a lost opportunity
David Tennant was hoping to give the Marvel Cinematic Universe a shot. As per Variety, a fan asked the Doctor Who alum at MCM Comic Con if there was a superhero he'd liked to play. Tennant then shared that he was eyeing none other than one of the MCU's newest additions - Fantastic Four's leader, Reed Richards - but the role ended up going to Pedro Pascal.
""In terms of superheroes, I did slightly have my eye on Reed Richards,"" Tennant said. ""Unfortunately, it looks like they've gone in a different direction.""
He, however, holds no hard feelings and is hopeful about Pascal's take on the character. ""Although if it has to be someone, I'm very happy for it to be Pedro Pascal.""
Pascal stars as Mister Fantastic in The Fantastic Four: First Steps, which is slated for a July 25 release this year. Joining him are Vanessa Kirby (Susan Storm or Invisible Woman), Joseph Quinn (Johnny Storm or Human Torch), and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Ben Grimm or The Thing). The film is directed by Matt Shakman.
The trailer for the retro-futuristic film dropped in April, sparing us the origin story of the quartet, which has gone through multiple renditions in the past. In this utopian world, the heroes are past dealing with the physical and mental strain of their superhuman abilities, dedicating their efforts to helping society instead. That is, until the conflict arrives.
Prior to being introduced to the MCU, the superhero family was portrayed by Miles Teller, Michael B Jordan, Kate Mara, and Jamie Bell in the eponymous 2015 film, with Teller playing the shapeshifting leader.
Before that, Reed was portrayed by Ioan Gruffudd grouped with a star-studded cast of Jessica Alba, Chris Evans, and Michael Chiklis in the 2004 film and its sequel, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.
While Tennant might not have scored this opportunity into the MCU, he has been part of major franchises in the past. He shot to fame in 2005 for playing the Tenth Doctor in the long-running British sci-fi series, Doctor Who. The role earned him international renown and a dedicated fan-following in the 2010s, making him a household name.
Tennant is also recognised for his role as Barty Crouch Jr in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. And though not part of the MCU at the time, he was also seen in the Marvel show Jessica Jones as Kilgrave. Whether this signals his official entry into the superhero multiverse in the future remains to be seen.

SAI urges tax reforms in budget proposals,"US
Calls for separation of tax policy and administration, rollback of recent ordinance changes
The SITE Association of Industry (SAI) has submitted its budget proposals for 2025-26, urging the government to adopt structural tax reforms aimed at boosting industrial growth and improving export competitiveness.
SAI President Ahmed Azeem Alvi, who also heads the association's taxation committee, stressed that budget-making must evolve into a strategic economic exercise rather than remain a routine fiscal event.
A central proposal is the separation of tax policy formulation from tax administration to avoid conflicts of interest. Citing global best practices, SAI recommended assigning tax policy to the Ministry of Finance, entrusting revenue sharing to an independent finance commission, and regulating consumption taxes through a dedicated council.
SAI highlighted that Pakistan's narrow income tax base — just 9% to 10% of GDP — forces the formal industrial sector to shoulder an unfair tax burden. The association urged expansion of the tax net to include untaxed and under-taxed sectors and proposed capping the income tax rate on business income at 25% over the next three years.
The group also called for the abolition of the super tax, labelling it outdated and inequitable, and sought relief on inter-corporate and individual dividend taxation.
Expressing concern over recent changes to the Income Tax Ordinance via Ordinance IV of 2025, particularly to Sections 138(3A), 140(6A), and 175C, SAI argued these amendments give unchecked powers to tax officials and violate Articles 4, 18, and 77 of the Constitution. It warned the measures would deter compliance, promote informality, and hurt investor confidence.

Iqra Aziz's dandelion days,"GR
Actor shares wholesome holiday dump with family
Iqra Aziz is out of office, and straight into our hearts, with her Monday morning photo dump that screams fresh air, family time, and fashionably wholesome mom energy. The actor is vacationing somewhere in the dreamy northern areas of Pakistan, and if her Instagram carousel is anything to go by, she's soaking up the views, the stillness, and a whole lot of joy with husband Yasir Hussain and their toddler son, Kabir Hussain.
The dump kicks off with the actor looking up at the sky and then with a swoon-worthy couple shot, Iqra and Yasir pose against a backdrop of lush green hills, looking like a postcard you'd want to frame. Iqra, ever the cool mom, can be seen sporting a straight long bob that's effortlessly chic, paired with a grey Rastah hoodie that nods to streetwear done right, even while trekking.
One shot shows her mid-run with her son on a low-impact trek, both of them looking gleeful as they dash across the terrain. Another tender moment captures Yasir helping their little one blow a dandelion, tiny hands, soft smiles, and a whole lot of father-son bonding.
Iqra also slips in some solo moments: her standing at the edge of a valley, the mountains behind her; another where she is the view, gazing out into the wilderness, lost in thought.
Time and again, the star has not only exemplified raising a healthy family but spoken up for it. Earlier this month, Iqra made headlines for speaking out against a viral video showing a father slapping his child in public. Sharing the clip on her Instagram Story, she condemned corporal punishment and urged desi parents to break cycles of violence. ""He's younger than you, vulnerable and experiencing things differently,"" she wrote, a reminder that parenting with empathy matters, both online and off.

Shift cargo from roads to rail: railway official,"US
Divisional superintendent says rail freight 3 times more fuel efficient, can save Karachi roads, unlock regional trade
Divisional Superintendent of Pakistan Railways (PR), Mehmoodur Rehman Lakho, has said that 99% of Pakistan's cargo moves through Karachi, warning that unless freight is shifted from roads to rail, the city's road infrastructure will continue to deteriorate under the strain of heavy outbound vehicles.
Speaking at a meeting during his visit to the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Lakho said the purpose of his visit was to explore ways to revive and strengthen rail freight connectivity from Karachi to Pakistan's major industrial and commercial centres. ""Shifting to rail freight is not only economically beneficial but also environmentally responsible,"" he said. ""Rail transport is three times more fuel-efficient than road freight, helping reduce carbon emissions, conserve foreign exchange, and ease pressure on highways.""
He highlighted the strides Pakistan Railways has made in modernising its freight operations over the past decade. Between 2013 and 2015, the department added more than 1,400 hopper wagons, over 2,000 high-capacity flat wagons, and 55 modern locomotives. These upgrades increased payload capacity from an average of 20 tonnes to 60 tonnes per wagon, enabling each train to transport over 4,000 tonnes of cargo.
However, Lakho expressed concern over the delayed implementation of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), calling it critical to expanding the country's rail cargo network. Without ML-1, he said, Pakistan Railways remains limited in its capacity to deliver long-haul, high-speed cargo services across Karachi, Sukkur, Multan towards the northern regions. He also shared plans to revive international rail freight links from Karachi to Moscow via Iran, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan. This corridor, he said, could unlock new export markets, especially for textiles and industrial products.
Lakho said Pakistan Railways is exploring modern logistics solutions such as multimodal freight, dedicated industrial cargo trains for export sectors, and Roll-on/Roll-off (RoRo) wagons that can carry entire loaded trucks by trainbypassing congested highways and reducing costs. He expressed willingness to collaborate with KCCI to identify freight priorities and launch pilot routes connecting Karachi with Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Rawalpindi, and Peshawar.
Chairman of the Businessmen Group (BMG), Zubair Motiwala, welcomed the initiative, describing it as a long-overdue effort to rebuild the historic partnership between the business community and Pakistan Railways, which had been eroded by years of neglect and overreliance on road transport.

Ceramic tiles industry demands more protection
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan held a meeting with the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association, which was attended by representatives from 10 leading Pakistani manufacturers and four Chinese firms, who discussed opportunities for collaboration and growth.
Key issues that came up for discussion included tariff policy, customs duty, export and import regulations and the need for tariff protection, said a statement issued by the Ministry of Industries. While appreciating the vital role of the ceramic tiles industry in industrial development, Khan stressed that he was fully aware of the challenges faced by them and would advocate for their cause.
He told them to submit a detailed report outlining the specific reasons as to why heightened tariff protection was essential for the industry. The PM aide announced the formation of a joint committee comprising members of the tiles manufacturers association and officials of the Engineering Development Board. The committee will present a progress report by Thursday.
""The administration under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif remains committed to supporting and revitalising Pakistan's industrial sector. We are actively advocating for industries at the National Tariff Policy Board to ensure their concerns are addressed,"" he remarked.
He reiterated his vision to see Pakistani manufacturers become regionally competitive, adding that no industry would be allowed to shut down. ""Revival of industries is our vision and we are formulating long-term policies to ensure sustainable growth.""
In a separate meeting with Federal Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, a delegation of the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association, led by Orient Ceramica Executive Director Abdul Rehman Talat, shared that the current installed tiles manufacturing capacity in Pakistan stood at 560,000 square metres per day, backed by an investment of over Rs100 billion, of which nearly 60% came from China.

Cricket diplomacy: can a game heal India and Pakistan?,"US
.
In a small village near the outskirts of Karachi, an elderly shopkeeper once told me, ""When India and Pakistan play, even the birds stop to watch the game."" His words echo across the subcontinent with a reminder that cricket isn't just a sport here. It's a shared heartbeat.
Yet today, as soldiers glare across borders and politicians trade barbs, that heartbeat falters. The world witnessed the last bilateral cricket series between India and Pakistan in 2012. A generation of children has grown up watching their heroes clash only in ICC tournaments, their rivalry reduced to a spectacle mediated by neutral venues of the UAE and England. But what if we dared to let cricket reclaim its role as more than a game? What if, once again, it became a language of hope?
When the Bat Spoke Louder Than Politics
I'll never forget the 2004 Karachi Test. An Indian team toured Pakistan after 14 years. My maternal grandfather, a Karachiite who lost family members during Partition, nearly wept as he watched Pakistani fans gifting Indian players rose petals. ""They're not enemies,"" he said. ""They're guests."" For weeks, the air smelled of biryani and camaraderie. Auto-rickshaws in Lahore sported both nations' flags.
This wasn't magic — it was humanity. My decade-long research, analysing 397 news articles from Indian and Pakistani media, found that 75% of cricket diplomacy stories carried a positive tone, even during crises. When Prime Ministers Manmohan Singh and Yusuf Raza Gilani shared laughs in Mohali in 2011, Pakistani newspapers splashed headlines like ""A Match Made in Heaven"", while an Indian newspaper wrote, ""Cricket's Truce Outlasts Politics"".
But something shifted. After the 2008 Mumbai attacks, fear hardened into policy. Bilateral series froze. By 2019, when India's World Cup clash with Pakistan drew 273 million viewers, coverage turned toxic. Indian media framed the match as ""War Without Weapons"", while Pakistani outlets lamented ""Diplomacy's Last Over"". The birds still watched, but the players became soldiers and the fans recruits.
The Youngest Victims
In a Karachi school last year, I met 12-year-old Ayesha, who dreams of playing cricket for Pakistan — against India. Ayesha's generation has never seen an Indo-Pak bilateral series. They've only known hashtag wars and YouTube venom. Yet, in my research, 63% of articles from 2010-2018 linked cricket to peace-building, not conflict. Even today, when Virat Kohli praises Babar Azam's batting, or Shadab Khan thanks Indian fans for support, social media lights up with ""Why can't we just be like this?""
A Playbook for Peace
Cricket won't solve Kashmir or silence guns. But it can rebuild what politics erodes: trust. Here's how:
The 2023 Women's Asia Cup saw Indian and Pakistani players cooking biryani together in Bangladesh. Let's host a joint Peace Premier League for women cricketers, with matches in Amritsar and Lahore.
In 2022, Indian and Pakistani fans in Melbourne collectively donated  ₹1.5 million to flood-hit Pakistan. Build on this: create a ""Cricket for Climate"" fund, where both boards donate per boundary hit in ICC matches.
Pair Wasim Akram and Sourav Ganguly in the commentary booths. Let them joke about 90s rivalries and remind viewers: ""We fought hard, but we broke bread harder.""
Allow Pakistan's U-19 team to tour India. Let kids like Ayesha play exhibition matches in Jaipur or Peshawar. Childhood friendships can adulthood hostilities.
The Last Over
In 1987, Gen Zia surprised India by watching a match in Jaipur. In 2023, imagine Prime Ministers Sharif and Modi sharing jalebi in Ahmedabad during a bilateral game. Impossible? So was a Pakistani team touring India in 2004, until it happened.
As Mandela said, ""Sport can create hope where once there was only despair."" Today, 60% of South Asians are under 35. They deserve more than viral hatred and inherited grudges. They deserve a chance to rewrite our story — one cover drive, one handshake, at a time.
Let's not wait for diplomacy to permit cricket. Let cricket permit diplomacy.

K-P to unveil FY25-26 budget on June 13,"US
Sources say total outlay of K-P budget for next fiscal year is likely to be pegged at Rs2,000 billion
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government will table the FY 2025-26 budget on June 13.
Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur greenlighted the summary sent by the finance ministry and approved the date for budget presentation.
Instead of finance advisor Muzamil Aslam, Minister for Law Aftab Alam will unveil the budget as Aslam is not a member of the house. Alam had also presented the budget for the current financial year.
Sources said the total outlay of the K-P budget for the next fiscal year is likely to be pegged at Rs2,000 billion.
Around Rs450 to Rs500 billion are likely to be earmarked for development projects.
It is pertinent to mention that the total volume of the current fiscal year was fixed at Rs1751 billion, with Rs420 billion set aside for ADP. The K-P government is preparing for a Rs180 billion surplus budget for the next fiscal.
Interestingly, the K-P government had broken the parliamentary tradition last year and presented a surplus budget for FY 2024-25 in the provincial assembly, even before the announcement of the federal budget, a move unprecedented in the country's history.
Finance Minister Aftab Alam unveiled the Rs1,754 billion budget for fiscal 2024-25 [July-June], boasting a surplus of Rs100 billion.

Sadia reclaims top spot in ICC rankings,"AZ
She returns to the top as Ecclestone misses WI series
The International 1Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday announced the latest Women's T20I rankings, with Pakistan spinner Sadia Iqbal once again rising to the top spot among bowlers.
Iqbal, who played a pivotal role in Pakistan's campaign during the ICC Women's T20 World Cup last year, climbed one position to reclaim the No.1 ranking.
Her return to the top comes after England's premier spinner Sophie Ecclestone missed the recent T20I series against the West Indies, prompting a reshuffle in the rankings.
Ecclestone, who had been holding the top spot, dropped to fourth, allowing Iqbal to regain the position she briefly held during last year's World Cup.
Meanwhile, England pacer Lauren Bell made significant strides, surging 13 places to reach sixth overall after taking seven wickets in the series.
Other English bowlers also moved up, with Linsey Smith climbing 37 spots to 41st and Issy Wong jumping 32 places to joint-62nd.
On the batting front, West Indies captain Hayley Matthews delivered an outstanding performance in England, scoring 177 runs at an average of 88.50 across three matches.
Her efforts earned her the Player of the Series title and a two-place jump to second in the T20I batting rankings. She now closely trails Australia's Beth Mooney, who remains the No.1 ranked batter.
Tahlia McGrath of Australia slipped to third due to Matthews' impressive rise.
England batters also made notable progress. Nat Sciver-Brunt moved up five places to ninth, Heather Knight advanced seven spots to joint-17th, and Sophia Dunkley climbed eight positions to joint-29th following her consistent contributions with the bat.
Matthews further cemented her dominance in the T20I all-rounder rankings.
Along with her batting exploits, she also picked up three wickets during the series, strengthening her grip as the top-ranked all-rounder in the format.

LHC seeks arguments on disqualification plea,"US
.
The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Tuesday sought arguments by June 13 on a plea requesting the disqualification of Bilawal Bhutto Zardari as a member of the National Assembly (MNA) under Article 62 of the Constitution, read with Section 203(3) of the Elections Act, 2017.
Justice Khalid Ishaq was hearing the petition filed by Ashba Kamran, who urged the court to direct National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq to send a reference to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for Bilawal's disqualification over alleged dual membership in two separate political parties, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP).
The petitioner argued that the ECP, as the constitutional watchdog of the electoral process, had failed to enforce Section 203(3) and its pre-election instructions issued on June 13, 2024, to all Returning Officers, which barred candidates from holding dual party memberships.
She alleged that Bilawal has continuously held dual positions, as chairman of PPP and, simultaneously, as an elected MNA from PPPP, both in the 2018 and 2024 general elections.

Sit-in ends after pact on quadcopter incident,"RU
All entry and exit points of North Waziristan reopened
A weeklong protest sit-in against a deadly quadcopter strike in the Mir Ali area of North Waziristan tribal district of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa concluded on Tuesday evening following successful negotiations between protest leaders and government officials.
All entry and exit points that had been blocked by the demonstrators have now been reopened.
The drone attack occurred last week in the Hormuz area of Mir Ali, where a quadcopter dropped explosives on a residential house, killing four children from the same family and critically injuring their mother along with several other women.
The incident sparked widespread outrage, with local tribesmen and rights activists condemning it as a gross violation of human rights. The protest sit-in had persisted since the day of the strike.
According to protest leader Mufti Baitullah, the government and local tribal elders reached a consensus on key demands, which are expected to bring relief to the affected families and foster trust-building in the conflict-wracked region.
The agreement includes a compensation package for the deceased, an investigation into the Hormuz incident, immediate restoration of internet services, the release of a detained tribal elder and the replacement of a local security official.
Explaining the details of the agreement, Baitullah stated that a compensation package would be announced for the families of those martyred in the drone strike.
He further noted that law enforcement agencies would refrain from using drones, surveillance cameras, or mortar shells on the local population in the future.
Secondly, an impartial committee will be constituted to conduct a transparent inquiry into the Hormuz strike.
The local community has demanded representation on this committee to ensure the facts are accurately unearthed. Third, internet services in the region will be restored immediately to enable access to information and support educational and commercial activity.
Fourth, tribal jirgas will be convened to resolve the issues surrounding the release of tribal elder Malik Akbar Khan, the withdrawal of military personnel from Mir Ali Hospital, and the lifting of the curfew.
Fifth, a guarantee has been given that no drone attacks will be carried out under the current local security official's command. Protesters have warned that in case of any violation of these terms, they will shut down all operations of resource extraction companies operating in North Waziristan.
Local residents have described the outcome of the negotiations as a ""partial success,"" stressing that they expect concrete actions rather than verbal assurances.

Eight cattle markets approved for Pindi,"US
District admins ban roadside animal sale and purchase
Rawalpindi divisional administration has approved eight designated cattle markets across the district ahead of Eidul Azha, while imposing a strict ban on animal sales along roads and in unauthorized locations.
In a move to ensure hygiene and safety, only certified healthy animals will be allowed for sale.
The sale of sick or weak animals has been outlawed, and vendors found violating the directive will face legal action and confiscation of livestock.
Traders from South Punjab have complained about excessive entry fees being forcibly collected at the main Bhata Chowk market. According to traders, contractors are charging Rs7,000 per large animal instead of the official Rs3,000, and Rs6,000 per small animal instead of Rs2,000.
Despite the high transportation costs from 600 kilometres away, sellers say they are left with no option but to comply, pushing up the overall cost of sacrificial animals.
Contractor representatives responded by saying they are recovering the costs of winning a high-value contract.
Rawalpindi Commissioner Aamir Khattak has also ordered that all cattle markets must be equipped with disinfectants, regular spraying, and fire brigade presence for emergencies. Traffic police have been directed to implement traffic management plans around the markets.
According to official circulars, three cattle markets have been set up in Tehsil Rawalpindi: the main Bhata Chowk market in Rawalpindi Cantt, another near Koh-e-Noor Mill, and one in Mouza Ranyal near Fatima Jinnah University Campus on Chakri Road.
Additional markets will operate at Kallar Syedan Road, near Mankiala Bridge, Gulyana Road, near the slaughterhouse in Tehsil Gujar Khan, Sharif Hospital Stop, GT Road, and Timber Market Road in Tehsil Taxila, Mangal Bypass in Tehsil Kallar Syedan, and Chan Shah Jaliar, Tangi Road in Tehsil Kahuta.
Commissioner Khattak has instructed all concerned authorities to ensure proper sanitation, facilities, and traffic control in all markets.

Bangladesh top court acquits JI leader,"US

Bangladesh's top court on Tuesday overturned a conviction against a key leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, who had been on death row since being sentenced under the regime ousted last year.
ATM Azharul Islam and who has been in custody since 2012, was acquitted of crimes against humanity by the Supreme Court, which ordered his release.
Islam, who was born in 1952, was among six senior political leaders convicted during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year-long autocratic rule as prime minister ended in August 2024 when a student-led revolt forced her to flee.
Political parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami, are readying for hugely anticipated elections which the interim government has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.

'Judges' permanent transfer to sideline JCP',"US
A bench member also inquired about the basic principle and criteria behind such transfers.
During the hearing of the judges' transfer case, a judge raised the question as to whether the powers of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) can be rendered ineffective by permanent transfer of judges from one high court to another through executive orders.
A bench member also inquired about the basic principle and criteria behind such transfers.
A five-member constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court led by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar on Tuesday resumed hearing a slew of petitions filed against transfer of three provincial high court judges to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in February and the subsequent change in the judges' seniority list.
Resuming his argument in support of the transfer, Attorney-General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan maintained that no new appointments had been made and the transferred judges did not require a new oath. He said the Supreme Court has already ruled that seniority begins from the date of appointment.
Justice Shakeel Ahmed asked why the law secretary had clarified in the summary that the transferred judges did not need a new oath. The AGP said the clarification was intended to avoid ambiguity in the notification after the advisory approval.
He said that the then IHC chief justice Aamer Farooq had determined the seniority of the IHC judges.
""Justice Aamer Farooq was fully autonomous in determining seniority. Chief justices and registrars of four high courts also did not raise any objections to the transfers.""
He said Justice Farooq made the decision based on a representation filed by five IHC judges against the transfer of new changes to the court and changes in the seniority list. Justice Farooq had turned down the representation, prompting the judges to file an appeal in the Supreme Court.
Justice Mazhar noted that petitioners' counsels had not mentioned this representation or Justice Farooq's decision during their arguments.
