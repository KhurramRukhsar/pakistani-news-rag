Pakistan moves towards crypto regulation as SBP clarifies stance on virtual assets,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317060-pakistan-moves-towards-crypto-regulation-as-sbp-clarifies-stance-on-virtual-assets,"KARACHI: Top financial authorities are set to hold a meeting on June 2 to discuss a regulatory roadmap for digital assets, as the State Bank of Pakistan clarified on Friday that cryptocurrencies are not banned outright but remain outside the current legal framework.
The upcoming meeting of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), to be chaired by Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, will bring together key stakeholders including the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and senior officials from the law and IT ministries. The session aims to formalise plans for the Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA), a proposed body to oversee the digital finance and crypto ecosystem.
The move comes as the SBP issued a rare public clarification, where it said that it had advised its regulated entities, including banks, development finance institutions, microfinance banks, electronic money institutions, payment system operators, payment service providers and exchange companies, to refrain from engaging in virtual assets (VAs) owing to the lack of a legal and regulatory framework for such assets, not because they were illegal.
“This was done to protect regulated entities and their customers from the risks emanating from the lack of such a framework,” the SBP said, in response to recent comments made during a parliamentary finance committee session.
The government on Thursday had reiterated to the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance that cryptocurrency remains prohibited in Pakistan, with individuals engaged in crypto-related transactions liable to investigation by the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal acknowledged that digital assets currently lack formal legislative backing. He clarified that the Pakistan Crypto Council, chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, functions as a task force with an advisory mandate -- to propose legal and procedural frameworks for the regulation of virtual assets.
The central bank confirmed it is now working with the Finance Division and the Pakistan Crypto Council to develop a structured legal regime for virtual assets, aimed at enhancing investor protection and reducing regulatory uncertainty.
“We understand that the legal and regulatory framework would provide the requisite clarity and legal coverage about VAs, ensuring consumer and investor protection,” it added.
The Pakistan Crypto Council, established in March, is spearheaded by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib. Saqib, who also serves as CEO of the council, is expected to present a proposal for the creation of PVARA at the upcoming meeting.
The council’s broader agenda includes fostering innovation in blockchain, attracting investment to the crypto sector, and laying the groundwork for a future-ready financial infrastructure.
Earlier this month, Pakistan allocated 2,000 megawatts of electricity to power a planned national network of Bitcoin mining and AI data centres. At the Bitcoin 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Saqib also introduced Pakistan’s first government-backed strategic bitcoin reserve, while simultaneously highlighting a shift in the government’s approach to digital assets.

"ATC jails PTI MNA, ex-MPA, 9 others in May 9 case",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317061-atc-jails-pti-mna-ex-mpa-9-others-in-may-9-case,"ISLAMABAD: Anti-Terrorism Court Judge Tahir Abbas Supra on Friday sentenced 11 people including PTI MNA Abdul Latif and former MPA Wazirzada Kalashi in a case registered on May 9 by the Ramna Police Station. The police took into custody the four accused present in court 	 Muhammad Akram, Mira Khan, Shahzeb and Sohail Khan. The court issued arrest warrants for the absent accused. Delivering a reserved verdict, the court sentenced the accused to a total of 15 years and four months in prison and a fine, saying that the accused attacked the police station, opened fire, pelted stones and tried to kill policemen. The accused set motorcycles on fire for their own purposes.
As many as 24 witnesses recorded their testimonies against the accused. The identity parade of the accused was held before a magistrate. The court said if police stations in Islamabad were attacked, no place in the country would be habitable. The accused should be given death sentence for the murderous attack on police.
Meanwhile, the court granted bail to a social media program anchor, Shanze Sheikh, in two cases registered in 2019. During the hearing, the judge said: “You took the position in the application that you were given written questions, your fee is being used? Wasn’t the person who was giving the written questions capable of coming on the screen and asking the questions himself? Where is the journalism that someone writes a question and you speak it? Now social media has also come, they are 5 hands ahead, but they have no idea about journalism.”
The petitioner’s lawyer said all the other accused in these cases have been acquitted. The court confirmed Shanze’s bail against bonds of Rs 10,000 each. The cases had been registered against the woman in the Police Station Secretariat.
In another case, the court adjourned the hearing of two cases registered on March 14, 2023 against PTI leader Shah Mehmood Qureshi and his workers. The court had summoned the accused who appeared. Adjourning the hearing, the court said a letter has been written regarding the PTI founder. Due to unavailability of the PTI founder, the proceedings are not progressing. The two cases had been registered against the accused in the Khanna Police Station. In a separate case, the ATC indicted six more accused in a vandalism, arson and encirclement case. The six appeared in court during the hearing. The court charged them with offences, while the accused denied the charges. The court adjourned the hearing until July 3.  As many as 42 people have already been indicted in the case. The case had been registered against the PTI workers in the Shams Colony Police Station.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Friday denounced the sentences handed down to MNA Abdul Latif, former advisor for Minority Affairs Kailash Kumar and other PTI leaders in the May 9 case by an anti-terrorism court, terming the decision unlawful and a blatant violation of justice.
PTI Central Secretary Information Waqas Akram, in a statement, declared that the party would approach the Islamabad High Court and challenge this unjust verdict by the ATC. He announced that the PTI would approach the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) and other global forums against this unabated injustice and political victimisation of the PTI – the largest political party in Pakistan. He made it clear that the party would adopt a strong and powerful strategy in this regard and the parliamentarians are going to hold massive protests in all provinces to demand an end to this system of tyranny.
Meanwhile, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) is set to take up a disqualification reference against Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly and senior Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader Omar Ayub Khan on June 4 for initial hearing.
According to the cause list uploaded on its website, the Election Commission has mentioned that ‘a reference under Articles 62 and 63 for disqualification of Omar Ayub Khan, MNA, NA,18, forwarded by Speaker NA on the application of Babar Nawaz Khan’ has been fixed for first hearing on June 4 at 10:00am’. Accordingly, notices have been issued to both Omar Ayub and Babar Nawaz.
It was learnt that the Speaker NA, Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, forwarded the reference on Friday based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who belongs to PMLN and lost 2024 general elections from NA-18 (Haripur) to Omar Ayub with a huge margin of 82000 votes.

Pakistan to sell First Women Bank to UAE next month,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317062-pakistan-to-sell-first-women-bank-to-uae-next-month,"\ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will finalise the sale of its 82.64 percent stakes in First Women Bank Limited (FWBL) to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) next month under a government-to-government agreement, marking the fifth and finally successful attempt to privatise the institution, officials told a parliamentary panel.
The UAE formally expressed interest in acquiring the federal government	s shares earlier this year, and the cabinet approved the transaction on February 6, 2024, Secretary Privatization Usman Bajwa informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatization.
Established in 1989, FWBL currently operates 42 branches in 24 cities. Previous privatisation efforts in 1994, 1996, 2018, and 2021 failed to materialise. The Ministry of Finance holds the majority 82.64 percent stakes, while Habib Bank and MCB Bank each own 5.78 percent. Allied Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, and UBL hold smaller shares.
Bajwa also revealed that the privatisation of three major power companies  Hesco, Sepco, and Pesco  is moving forward. A Request for Proposal (RFP) for hiring financial advisers will be floated next month, developed in consultation with the Power Division and the World Bank.
The panel, led by MQM	s Farooq Sattar, lashed out at Pesco for incurring Rs143 billion in losses last fiscal year, calling for the utility	s closure as liabilities hit Rs620 billion and technical losses stood at 35 percent. Pesco CEO said losses would shrink by Rs20 billion this year, but member Zulfiqar Ali quipped, 	Not even Owais Leghari can fix Pesco  only a field marshal can.
Meanwhile, Hesco came under fire for prolonged outages, as its CEO blamed line losses. Lawmakers pushed back, saying even the 	minimum loadshedding is 10 hours.	 The CEO said he couldn	t comment on board members	 competence but noted 200 of 650 feeders are now loadshedding-free, with four more to be added in July.
Chairman Farooq Sattar demanded the finance secretary appear before the panel and directed the Finance Division to release Rs6 billion by September, with the remainder to follow next fiscal year. 	This is public trust  the Finance Ministry must return it, he said.

"ADC killed, govt offices, bank burnt in Surab militant attack",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317063-adc-killed-govt-offices-bank-burnt-in-surab-militant-attack,"QUETTA: Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Hidayatullah Buledi was killed in a militant attack on his residence in Surab, Balochistan, as dozens of armed men stormed the town, setting fire to government offices, a police station, and looting a bank.
Government Spokesman Shahid Rind confirmed that the senior administrative officer was martyred while resisting the attackers. “Mr Buledi was killed in an exchange of fire with armed militants at his home, where his family was also present during the assault,” Rind said.
The assailants, reportedly in large numbers, looted and torched a local bank and at least six government offices, including official residences. The Surab police station and levies post were also set ablaze, and four law enforcement vehicles were destroyed.
“This attack was carried out by proxies backed by India,” Shahid Rind alleged, adding that security forces had reached the area and launched a clearance operation. “The state will thwart all such conspiracies and uphold its authority,” he added. Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif issued a strong condemnation of the attack, describing it as a cowardly act of terrorism targeting innocent civilians, administrative officers, and public property.
In a statement, the prime minister paid tribute to the bravery of ADC Hidayatullah Buledi, calling his sacrifice a symbol of courage and resistance. He expressed deep sympathy with the family of the slain officer and prayed for their strength and patience.
“The terrorists deliberately targeted unarmed civilians, including women and children,” the prime minister noted, adding that such acts reflect a deep-seated hostility towards the people and progress of Balochistan.
Reaffirming the state’s commitment to combating terrorism, the prime minister vowed that the fight would continue until all such elements were eliminated. He emphasised that the armed forces are working tirelessly to dismantle terror networks operating under foreign patronage.
He further directed authorities to identify and bring the perpetrators to justice swiftly, ensuring that they face the full force of the law.

SC judges release dissenting notes against military courts verdict,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317064-sc-judges-release-dissenting-notes-against-military-courts-verdict,"ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan of the Supreme Court of Pakistan Friday ruled that the civilians’ trial in military courts was unconstitutional.
In their dissenting note on a petition challenging the apex court orders against the civilians’ trial in military courts, the two judges said civilians could not be court-martialed.
A seven-member larger bench — headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan — by 5 to 2 majority had set aside the apex court judgment declaring the trial of civilians in military courts as unconstitutional after accepting the Intra Court Appeals (ICAs) filed by federal government, Ministry of Defence etc and allowed the military courts to proceed with the trials of civilians accused of attacking the military installations during May 9 riots.
In a 36-page dissenting note, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail held that the persons not otherwise subject to the Pakistan Army Act, civilians, accused of offences under clause (d) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the said Act could not be tried by the courts martial in the context of Constitution and injunctions of Islam.
Endorsed by Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Justice Mandokhail held that the military officers presiding the courts martial might be good at disposing military related matters, but they had no judicial expertise and experience to deal with criminal cases, with severe punishments.
“Generally, a wrong perception has been created as if the civil courts have failed to tackle the menace of terrorism and the courts martial are the solution to the problem,” the judge held.
Justice Mandokhail noted that basically, courts martial were convened only to prosecute persons subject to PAA accused of military offences or general offences adding that they did not have jurisdiction to deal the cases of terrorism or other criminal matters.
In the year 2015, Justice Mandokhail recalled that there was a warlike situation in the country adding that in order to curb terrorism, the legislature decided to extend jurisdiction of the courts martial to try cases relating to terrorism; consequently, 21st Constitutional Amendment was introduced in the year 2015, pursuant thereto, the PAA was amended and courts martial jurisdiction was extended to try offences other than those mentioned in the Act, initially for two years, which period was extended for further two years, till 2019.
Thereafter, Justice Mandokhail said, the courts martial could not prosecute non-military persons but added that a question arose whether the desired result of eliminating terrorism was achieved after the twenty-first Constitutional Amendment.
“It is a fact that within the prescribed period of four years, courts martial tried hardcore criminals and terrorists, but unfortunately, the situation did not improve nor was the desired goal of eliminating terrorism achieved,” Justice Mandokhail held adding that naturally, because it was not the job of the army officer to prosecute these criminals.
Moreover, Justice Mandokhail noted that the criticism of criminal courts was unfounded. It had not been supported by any reliable data.
The judge noted that nowhere in the world, courts martial tried terrorism related cases adding that it was true that the conviction rate by the criminal courts was low, but it did not mean these courts did not have the will to do proper justice.
“We have observed that mostly acquittals are result of frivolous and politically motivated cases, flawed and unprofessional investigation, poor prosecution, and inadequate or lack of witnesses,” Justice Mandokhail held.
The judge noted that the present appeals had been filed by the federal government, the Government of Punjab and Government of Balochistan.
Unfortunately, it seems they have lost trust and confidence in the criminal courts and we are sorry to say that these elected governments instead of addressing the politically motivated and frivolous cases, improving the system of investigation, establishing a mechanism of collecting truthful witnesses and protecting them, providing workable atmosphere, protection to the judges and improving the judicial system, showed a no-confidence upon criminal courts and opted to burden the courts martial with such a huge responsibility,” Justice Mandokhail held.
Justice Mandokhail held that courts martial could not be considered on a par with the judicial officers, who were not only law graduates but also had the only function to deliver justice, with vast judicial experience to their credit. He further observed that they were independent, impartial and without the influence, command and control of the executive.
Justice Mandokhail further held that the federal and provincial governments instead of attending the causes for terrorism and taking preventive measures before it happened, were trying to achieve its goal through the courts martial, which was not a correct approach.
The judge further noted that expecting the ordinary criminal courts to convict persons without evidence and material, and connecting them with the offence, would amount to violating the principle of natural justice, fair trial and due process.
“We are unable to understand that when the prosecution lacks evidence and there is no possibility of conviction of the accused, how can he be convicted by the courts martial,” Justice Mandokhail held adding that they were confident that if the cases were properly investigated with solid proof, there was no reason, why the criminals will go scot-free.
Justice Mandokhail recalled that through the order dated 25.03.2024, they had permitted the courts martial to proceed with the trial, subject to the outcome of these appeals.
Consequently, a number of accused were convicted and sentenced for different terms. Some of them have completed and undergone their sentences or some might have been acquitted of the charge.
“As we have concluded that the courts martial have no jurisdiction to try civilians, therefore, the convictions and sentences awarded by the courts martial to persons allegedly responsible for the occurrence of 9th May, 2023 are declared to be without jurisdiction, hence, the same are set aside,” Justice Mandokhail held
The judge further held that the Holy Quran and the Prophet (PBUH) stressed the need for unbiased and impartial judiciary as a vital principle of rule of law adding that to serve the common people with fair justice, the great Caliph, Hazrat Umar (R.A.) separated the judiciary from the executive and declared it a sovereign and independent organ of the state, in order to proceed without any bias, fear, favour, pressure or influence of State or from any outsider.
Hazrat Ali (R.A.) is known for his wisdom and justice and he emphasized that the system of disbelief (kufr) can work but system of injustice cannot work. He urged that nothing can cause nations to flourish like justice.
“The Muslim jurists described that the obligation of an independent, impartial and a righteous judge is a worship of the highest rank, after the belief in Allah and this proves that Islam recognizes the administration of justice as one of the most important duties of the judges,” Justice Mandokhail held.

PPPP also files written arguments in reserved seats case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317065-pppp-also-files-written-arguments-in-reserved-seats-case,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) has requested Supreme Court (SC) to set aside the judgment of July 12, 2024 by declaring that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was not entitled to reserved seats for non-compliance with constitutional requirements.
The PPPP filed written arguments in the Supreme Court in its review petition against 12 July, 2024 judgment and with reasons dated August 13, 2024.
The PPPP filed the written arguments through its counsel Farooq H Naek, praying to review the impugned judgment and then set aside it by declaring that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was not entitled to reserved seats for non-compliance with constitutional requirements/statutory requirements.
It further prayed to the court to restore the ECP’s order dated January, 3, 2024 allocating seats to compliant political parties.
It is pertinent to mention here that an 11-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan is hearing live broadcast of the review petitions of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan People’s Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) against July 12, 2024 judgment on reserved seats for women and minorities in National and Provincial Assemblies. Other members of the bench included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Musarat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakarh, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi. The bench the other day had adjourned the hearing until June 16 while counsel for Sunni Itehad Council (SIC) is currently arguing before the court in rebuttal.
Earlier, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) as well as Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) had also filed their written arguments in their review petitions in reserved seats case, praying to set aside the July 12, 2024 as well as detailed verdict in the reserved seats case.
In its written arguments, Pakistan People’s Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) has submitted that the power of review is not a something novel or alien to constitution and law. It submitted that Article 188 of the Constitution and the words couched thereof clearly shows that this is a meaningful dictate rather an unmeaningful casual para.
The PPPP further submitted that this vourt has unlimited jurisdiction to reopen, revisit or review, and for such purpose examine any judgment earlier pronounced by it to set the law correct, to cure injustice, save it from becoming an abuse of the process of law and a judicial system.

Pak-US talks on reciprocal tariffs begin,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317066-pak-us-talks-on-reciprocal-tariffs-begin,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and the United States Friday kick-started formal negotiations on reciprocal tariffs imposed by the Trump administration with the understanding that technical-level detailed discussions would follow in the coming few weeks.
In an official announcement, the Ministry of Finance Friday confirmed that Pakistan’s formal negotiations on US reciprocal tariffs had kick-started between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer through a telephonic/conference call on Friday, May 30.
“The two sides exchanged their viewpoints through a constructive engagement with the understanding that technical-level detailed discussions would follow in the coming few weeks,” the official statement added.
Both sides expressed confidence in advancing these negotiations for a successful conclusion at the earliest.
Talking to The News, top official sources said the 39% tariff imposed by the US on imports from Pakistan could impact Pakistan’s exports.
With the US being an important trading partner, particularly in textiles and apparel, even modest tariff increases have the potential to adversely impact export revenues.
It can be estimated that the impact on export revenues if the price increases by a certain percentage, as if the price elasticity of demand is -0.4, then a 10% increase in export price, assuming all the burden of the increased price is transferred to the consumer. It will reduce export revenues by 4%. If the manufacturer absorbs some of the increase in export prices and passes a fraction of the increased prices to Pakistan’s exports to the US in three sectors from 2003 to 2023.
The price elasticity of demand is -0.4. Hence, a tariff of 39% may lead to a 15.6% fall in exports to the US, assuming that the entire burden of the tariff is passed on to the US consumer. This is equivalent to a fall of $0.8 and an aggregate fall of $4.22 billion from 2024-2028, as estimated by economist Azam Chaudhry.

US-based group fails to secure meeting with Imran or top officials,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317067-us-based-group-fails-to-secure-meeting-with-imran-or-top-officials,"ISLAMABAD: A group of US-based Pakistani doctors and businessmen, currently visiting Pakistan in a renewed bid to meet PTI founder Imran Khan and key officials, has returned to Lahore after spending four days in Islamabad without any breakthrough, reliable sources confirmed on Friday.
The delegation, which arrived in Pakistan last week, had hoped to secure a meeting with the jailed former prime minister at Adiala Jail and engage in quiet diplomacy aimed at exploring potential relief for Khan amid his ongoing legal and political troubles. However, their efforts have so far met with no success.
According to sources, the group was initially scheduled to return to the United States on Saturday (today), but is likely to extend its stay in Pakistan in a last-ditch attempt to secure the much-anticipated meetings.
The group believes that Imran Khan is aware of their presence and may be willing to meet them, although no official communication has confirmed the possibility. They are trying to meet Khan but without any success so far.
This delegation has a history of behind-the-scenes engagement with both Khan and senior government figures during a previous trip a few months ago. At that time, they held what were described as trouble-free meetings with Khan and a top official in Islamabad. The contrast during the current visit has been stark, as the group has not been able to connect with any key figures in the capital.
Sources suggest that the delegation is in contact with some PTI leaders including PTI’s Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, and Aleema Khan.
The group’s attempts at facilitating reconciliation between Khan and the establishment bear no fruits due to the prevailing political atmosphere and unending tensions between PTI and the country’s establishment.
The military leadership, which has reiterated its position of not engaging directly with political parties, is seen as unimpressed with PTI’s continued confrontational stance. Persistent criticism of the military establishment, aggressive online campaigns, and international lobbying - particularly by PTI’s overseas chapters in the US and UK - have further complicated matters.
The sources said that the visiting businessmen and doctors even believe that the party’s hardline approach have reduced space for constructive engagement.
With no meeting scheduled and no indication of progress, the delegation’s visit shows the widening gulf between PTI and the establishment. Their extended stay in Pakistan suggests continued hope for reconciliation, but for now, the impasse persists.

Govt plans to end tax holiday in ex-Fata,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317068-govt-plans-to-end-tax-holiday-in-ex-fata,"ISLAMABAD: In a major policy shift, the government is mulling to withdraw the sales tax exemption for goods manufactured in the former tribal areas, aiming to raise over Rs45 billion in revenue during the next fiscal year, official sources told The News.
The 18 percent sales tax —set to be imposed through the 2025-26 federal budget — will also apply to electricity supplied to the ex-Fata and Pata regions. The move marks the end of a years-long tax holiday granted after the merger of the tribal areas into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The FBR is also weighing a proposal to introduce a withholding tax on imports into the region — another measure that would mark a sharp departure from post-merger fiscal leniency.
Officials say the revenue gains could rise further if income tax concessions are also rescinded. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) is currently finalising the necessary legal amendments to compliance with court rulings and existing tax statutes.
Last year’s Finance Act had extended exemptions on the import and supply of goods and electricity for the former tribal areas until June 30, 2025. However, under revised rules, importers must now submit a pay order — rather than a post-dated cheque — to avail the exemption, which will only be granted upon production of verified consumption or installation certificates from the relevant Commissioner within six months.
The government’s decision reflects growing fiscal pressures and a push to broaden the tax base amid commitments to international lenders, especially IMF. However, the move is likely to spark criticism from stakeholders in the tribal belt, where development remains slow and economic recovery fragile.
Analysts warn that sudden withdrawal of tax incentives without a parallel uplift package could deepen local discontent and stall industrial activity in these already struggling regions.

"SC verdict causes unrest in FIA, other institutions",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317069-sc-verdict-causes-unrest-in-fia-other-institutions,"KARACHI: Seven months ago, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court issued a 19-page judgment that the decision of a cabinet sub-committee in the past to regularize officers of grade 16 and above, who were recruited on contract without participating in the Federal Public Service Commission examination, was illegal and unconstitutional.
The decision states that either such employees should be dismissed from their jobs or referred to the Federal Public Service Commission. The decision has caused great concern an d anxiety among federal institutions, especially the FIA, as it is mandatory to implement the decision, which has led to fears of a severe crisis and a reduction in manpower in the institution. In 2019, a similar decision by a three-member bench of the Supreme Court had resulted in the dismissal of dozens of FIA officers, ranging from assistant directors to deputy directors, whose jobs spanned 25 to 30 years. According to the documents, the Supreme Court of Pakistan issued a verdict seven months ago regarding employees of grade 16 and above of the Bureau of Immigrants and Overseas Employment, which will apply to all federal institutions, including the FIA.
Some officers, on condition of anonymity, gave different opinions. One said that a review petition has been filed. “The FIA has sent the list of officers to the FPSC as the Director General can send the names of only officers up to grade 16; the Home Secretary is authorized to send names above grade 16. The FPSC is not authorized to conduct interviews; it can only conduct examinations and interviews of new contract employees,” an officer said.
In 2011, the Establishment Division had issued a notification regarding regularization, although the summary was sent to the Prime Minister, no one knows what decision was taken on it. Even if the Prime Minister had taken the decision at that time, the 2024 decision of a three-member bench of the Supreme Court has set it aside. Another officer said that if officers failed in the FPSC and were dismissed from their jobs like in the past, it would create a huge crisis because the tenure of officers is 20 to 25 years and the Law Ministry is consulting in this regard.
In April 2021, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by the then Chief Justice, had sent home 53 officers recruited in 1989 during the PPP era for the same reasons. However, by then the officers had completed thirty years of service. According to FIA sources, if the Supreme Court’s decision is implemented, about 30 to 40 percent of FIA officers will be dismissed from their jobs.

Indian army chief under fire over visit to ashram in uniform,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317070-indian-army-chief-under-fire-over-visit-to-ashram-in-uniform,"KARACHI: As Indian PM Modi’s government doubles down on a muscular security doctrine, a separate controversy is brewing within India’s military establishment, with Indian Army Chief General Upendra Dwivedi under fire for visiting an ashram in uniform to meet spiritual leader Jagadguru Rambhadracharya on Wednesday. The visit has drawn criticism for potentially breaching the apolitical character of the armed forces.
As reported by Indian media, after the meeting Rambhadracharya stated that when the question arose about what ‘dakshina’ or offering the army chief could give, he responded by requesting ‘Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK)’ [Azad Kashmir], and the army chief agreed to his request.
“The Indian army chief came to me. He received initiation from me in the Ram Mantra – the same mantra that Hanuman ji received from Sita ji and achieved victory over Lanka”, the Hindu cleric said.
“Afterwards, when the matter of ‘dakshina’ came up, I said I would ask for a ‘dakshina’ that no teacher has ever asked for before. I said, ‘I want PoK [Azad Kashmir], this is my dakshina. He accepted my request. We are ready to give Pakistan an appropriate response.”
Indian journalist Sushant Singh wrote on X (formerly Twitter): “Civil-military relations are strained when military leaders align with partisan religious agendas, undermining the apolitical ethos of India’s secular armed forces. Politically, this aligns with the ruling BJP’s Hindutva narrative, eroding institutional neutrality of the armed forces. Socially, Gen Dwivedi’s act risks alienating minority communities, exacerbating perceptions of majoritarianism in India’s institutions... Legally, while no code on military uniform on army law explicitly bars such interactions by the COAS, Gen Dwivedi’s actions conflict with Army Regulations prohibiting overt religious symbolism during official duties. For India, this is a dangerous path to tread on.”
Singh also criticised Dwivedi for missing a major defence event in Delhi that included the defence minister, defence secretary and other service chiefs, calling it “a travesty”.
Last year, the Indian army issued directives reminding military officials to follow the code of conduct prohibiting the display of religious symbols while in uniform.
Meanwhile, continuing his war-mongering rhetoric, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday once again directly targeted Pakistan during a high-profile address in Kanpur, where he outlined India’s new three-pronged approach to tackling terrorism.
Speaking at a public rally after inaugurating development projects worth INR47,600 crore, Modi declared that India would respond decisively to any act of terrorism. “India will not be scared of hollow threats of an atom bomb and won’t take decisions based on such threats”, said Modi. “We will treat both the terrorists and their sponsors in the same way.”
The Indian prime minister introduced a three-rule framework that will guide India’s future response to terrorism: Every terror attack will be answered. The armed forces will decide the nature and timing of the response. India will not be scared of hollow atom bomb threats. India will treat masters of terror and the government that patronises terrorists similarly.
The address by the Indian PM was marked by fiery nationalist rhetoric and direct threats aimed at Pakistan. “Wherever the enemy is, they will be hit”, Modi said to applause.
He also referenced India’s use of the BrahMos missile during a previous military confrontation with Pakistan. “The world witnessed the power of Make in India and its weapon through Operation Sindoor. Our Indian weapons (systems), including the BrahMos missile, entered the enemy territory and caused havoc”.
Modi contrasted the current state of military self-reliance with the past, saying: “There was a time when India depended on other countries for its safety. We have tried to change these circumstances.”

Child marriages in Islamabad a criminal act now,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317071-child-marriages-in-islamabad-a-criminal-act-now,"ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari Friday signed “The Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025” into a law criminalising child marriages in the federal capital despite opposition from a Council of Islamic Ideology (CII).
The National Assembly and the Senate passed the bill separately last week. It was moved by Sharmila Farooqui in the National Assembly and Senator Sherry Rehman in the Senate.
However, after its passage by the two Houses of Parliament, the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) rejected the bill, which fixes the minimum age of 18 for marriage, terming the legislation against Islam.
Meanwhile, Vice President Pakistan People’s Party and Parliamentary leader of the PPP in the Senate, Senator Sherry Rehman, lauded the signing into law of the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025, as a landmark moment in Pakistan’s legislative history.
“This is a milestone in Pakistan’s long and difficult journey toward protecting the rights of children, especially girls,” said Senator Rehman. “Despite resistance from various quarters, President Zardari signed this important bill into law. His action speaks volumes about the political will to drive real reform,” she said while lauding the signing it into law.
Senator Sherry Rehman emphasised that this was not just a piece of legislation but a party-led commitment long championed by the PPP. “This has been a PPP bill, one that we have been pursuing for a long time. I especially want to thank President Asif Ali Zardari for his unwavering leadership, Chairman PPP Bilawal Bhutto Zardari for his consistent support for progressive reforms, and Senator Sehar Kamran, who was the first to introduce this bill in the Senate. I also commend MNA Sharmila Faruqi for tabling it in the National Assembly and carrying it forward with determination,” she said. “This bill is against the atrocities committed against young girls,” Senator Rehman declared. “Girls under the age of 18, when married off, often die during childbirth. We cannot ignore these silent funerals anymore.”
Citing the UNFPA Annual Report 2024, she underscored that “Every 50 minutes, a woman in Pakistan dies from complications related to pregnancy or childbirth. Much of this is directly attributable to underage marriage, where girls have no agency over their nutrition, their health, or even the fate of the children they bear,” she added.
She issued a strong statement: “A person under the age of 18 is not even granted a driving licence, how is it possible to allow them to get married?” “In Pakistan, “juvenile crime” refers to offences committed by individuals under the age of 18. The Juvenile Justice System Act (JJSA) 2018 defines a “juvenile” as a child who has not attained the age of 18 and can be dealt with differently than an adult for an offence. Then how can an individual under 18 be considered a mature person who can get married?”
She further added, “Pakistan has the second-highest infant mortality rate in Asia, with 50.10 deaths per 1,000 live births (World Bank). Over 40% of children under five are stunted due to malnutrition, often a result of young mothers lacking education and health access.” “This is a statistic of shame. We cannot allow inaction to stand in the way of justice for our girls.”

"Exporters enlighten NA panel on issues, policy chaos",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317072-exporters-enlighten-na-panel-on-issues-policy-chaos,"ISLAMABAD: National Assembly’s trade committee faced a barrage of complaints Friday from exporters of rice, fruit, gold and juice, who warned that policy flip-flops and regulatory bottlenecks are choking the country’s fragile export growth.
“Rice exporters have written to the Prime Minister,” MNA Sharmila Faruqi told the panel, citing repeated cargo delays and damage from excessive inspections.
“They’re opening containers and tampering with the packaging. We need a competent Director General at the Department of Plant Protection (DPP),” she demanded.
Chairing the session, MNA Jawed Hanif Khan echoed concerns over rice export disruptions and directed the DPP to improve container inspection procedures to prevent further losses. DPP DG Tahir Abbas informed lawmakers that the agency had banned harmful pesticides — some imported from India since 2022 — but Faruqi urged a complete halt to such imports, blaming them for damaging Pakistan’s export credibility.
The committee also expressed alarm over the sudden ban on gold and jewelry exports and imports, imposed by the federal government on May 5 following concerns raised by the State Bank of Pakistan. Commerce Secretary Javed Paul said a special committee is now reviewing the issue and suggested digitising the trade under a single-window system. However, he noted that final decisions will be taken by the federal cabinet.
Juice manufacturers told the committee that their exports to 26 countries could double from the current $15 million if given tax rebates. “The rebate must come through the FBR under the Export Facilitation Scheme,” the Commerce Secretary explained, while TDAP CEO Faizullah mentioned a Haroon Akhtar-led committee has proposed a 5 percent rebate for high-performing exporters. Kinnow and mango exporters also voiced frustration with the DPP. “Complaints keep piling up because you’re not engaging with the exporters,” Chairman Hanif warned the DPP DG, instructing him to meet stakeholders directly.

Nukes sole guarantor of regional peace: NCA Adviser,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317073-nukes-sole-guarantor-of-regional-peace-nca-adviser,"ISLAMABAD: Adviser to National Command Authority (NCA) has vowed that Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme remains the “sole guarantor of peace and stability in South Asia.”
Lieutenant General (R) Khalid Ahmed Kidwai was speaking here Friday in a seminar hosted by the Center for International Strategic Studies (CISS) regarding celebrations of 27th anniversary of Pakistan’s nuclear tests, commemorated as Youm-e-Takbeer.
The general dilated upon subject second time in three days. He reminded that the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) decisive performance, leveraging advanced Chinese-technology and using integrated multi-domain tactics, has established Pakistan as the dominant air power in South Asia.
This shift validates Pakistan’s conventional deterrence as an effective complement to its robust nuclear arsenal. He reminded that Pakistan’s battle-tested conventional deterrent, especially PAF has assumed a leading role in regional deterrence; Pakistan’s credible nuclear deterrence will continue to constrain and limit India’s political and operational choices, thereby maintaining strategic stability; any Indian aggression will be met with a ‘notch-up response’ as Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has promised, a ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus’, as Pakistan’s retaliation will always be a calibrated and escalated response; India’s pattern of seeking ceasefires following Pakistan’s intense retaliation has become an established norm; and international diplomatic interventions will persist managing crises to prevent escalation beyond defined limits.
The retired general who was the first chief of Strategic Plans Division (SPD), that had the management of missile-nuclear systems, warned that Pakistan reserves the right to reciprocate any terror attack with conventional responses against pre-determined adversaries, reflecting a reciprocal logic to India’s declared doctrines. Over the last six years, India’s Hindutva-driven BJP government had twice tested nuclear-armed Pakistan’s political will, strategic resolve, and military capability first by striking mainland Pakistan in February 2019, and again in Azad Kashmir in May 2025.
On both occasions, India had to bite the dust. The confrontations reaffirmed the credibility of Pakistan’s deterrent posture both conventional and nuclear and demonstrated that any Indian aggression would be met with a stronger-than-proportional response. He made it emphatically clear that Pakistan has steadfast resolve to safeguard its sovereignty and regional peace in an environment shaped by emerging threats and technological advancements, marking a strategic shift that firmly favors Pakistan’s security interests in South Asia.
Interestingly this year’s observance assumed added significance in the aftermath of heightened tensions between Pakistan and India following the false flag action in Pahalgam. Indian military actions, including so-called Operation Sindoor, were widely criticised by speakers at the event as reckless provocations designed to test Pakistan’s thresholds in a nuclearised environment. Pakistan responded with a series of precise retaliatory measures under Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, part of the broader Mark-e-Haq campaign.
Experts at the seminar said the response reasserted deterrence, restored strategic balance, and marked what they described as a “decisive paradigm shift” in the regional balance. “It showcased Pakistan’s credible nuclear capability and reaffirmed that this deterrent —operationalised through Full Spectrum Deterrence (FSD) — serves as the cornerstone of peace and strategic stability in South Asia,” said one speaker, adding that the mini-war underscored the deterrent’s enduring role in preserving peace.
The seminar featured senior officials and strategic thinkers, including Ambassador Sohail Mahmood, Director General of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI); Muhammad Naeem, former chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC); Dr Adil Sultan, Dean of Air University; and Brig (R) Dr Zahir ul Haider Kazmi, Adviser on Arms Control at the Strategic Plans Division (SPD).
Speakers observed a pattern in India’s behavior — using false flag operations as a casus belli to justify limited strikes against Pakistan while disregarding the prevailing nuclear environment. They warned that such actions risk dangerous miscalculations.
They emphasised that Pakistan’s nuclear capability is a strategic necessity that has effectively deterred full-scale war, even as threats have evolved in complexity and domain.
The panel stressed that Pakistan now possesses a comprehensive toolkit of both kinetic and non-kinetic options to respond to any future Indian provocations, and that its response will follow a Quid Pro Quo Plus (QPQ+) approach — swift, proportionate, and precise — designed to neutralise aggression and compel de-escalation. “If India persists in its reckless behavior, it must recognise that Pakistan’s resolve must not be underestimated,” one speaker said, noting that the Pakistan Air Force remains fully prepared to assert dominance in South Asian airspace. “India would be wise to acknowledge the limits of its power and act accordingly.”
Speakers also paid tribute to the scientists, engineers, and planners who made the 1998 nuclear tests possible. Despite international embargoes, financial constraints, and geopolitical isolation, they built a robust and self-reliant nuclear infrastructure. The tests, they said, were not just a technical triumph but a symbol of national resilience and technological sovereignty.
The participants emphasised that Youm-e-Takbeer reflects more than a technological milestone. It symbolises Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to peace through credible minimum deterrence — a commitment, they said, that has once again proven decisive in shaping the regional strategic landscape.

"No Tobacco Day: WHO calls for global ban on flavoured tobacco, nicotine products",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317049-no-tobacco-day-who-calls-for-global-ban-on-flavoured-tobacco-nicotine-products,"ISLAMABAD: As Pakistan battles rising youth nicotine addiction and 164,000 annual tobacco-related deaths, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has called on all governments—including Islamabad—to urgently ban flavoured tobacco and nicotine products that continue to lure new users through deceptive marketing and candy-like appeal.
Marking World No Tobacco Day 2025, the WHO has launched a global call to action urging governments to ban all flavoured tobacco and nicotine products—including cigarettes, hookahs, pouches, and e-cigarettes—to protect young people from addiction and serious health risks.
In a new publication titled “Flavour accessories in tobacco products enhance attractiveness and appeal”, the WHO exposed how flavours like menthol, cotton candy, and bubble gum—often paired with flashy packaging and click-on capsules—are being used by the tobacco industry to mask the harshness of nicotine and hook young users under the guise of innovation.
“Flavours are fuelling a new wave of addiction and should be banned,” said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. “They undermine decades of progress in tobacco control. Without bold action, the global tobacco epidemic, already killing around 8 million people each year, will continue to be driven by addiction dressed up with appealing flavours.”
Pakistan faces its own urgent challenges. According to WHO data, tobacco use kills an estimated 164,000 people annually in the country and inflicts an economic burden exceeding Rs700 billion. Flavoured products such as nicotine pouches, vapes, and menthol cigarettes are gaining popularity among youth, often promoted through social media and misleading marketing that downplays their harm.
Dr Rüdiger Krech, WHO Director of Health Promotion, warned: “We are watching a generation get hooked on nicotine through gummy bear-flavoured pouches and rainbow-coloured vapes. This isn’t innovation, it’s manipulation—and we must stop it.”
The WHO report highlights how flavour accessories—like capsule filters and add-on drops—are slipping through regulatory loopholes even in countries that have banned flavoured tobacco. While more than 50 countries have outlawed flavoured tobacco and over 40 have banned e-cigarettes or their flavours, flavour accessories remain largely unregulated.
Countries like Belgium, Denmark, and Lithuania have begun cracking down on such products. The WHO now calls on other nations to urgently follow suit, particularly those with high youth tobacco initiation rates.
In Pakistan, public health experts and civil society groups have long demanded regulation of emerging nicotine products, especially e-cigarettes and disposable vapes, which remain readily available in urban markets despite health warnings. A 2024 survey found that 68 per cent of student users had experimented with e-cigarettes—most citing flavours as their reason for starting.
The 2025 World No Tobacco Day campaign honours the efforts of governments, youth advocates, and civil society leaders resisting industry tactics and pushing for stronger tobacco control laws.
WHO reiterated that all tobacco products—including heated tobacco—should be strictly regulated as they expose users to cancer-causing chemicals.

"Rain, storms in Pakistan kill 32 in a week",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317050-rain-storms-in-pakistan-kill-32-in-a-week,"KARACHI: At least 32 people have been killed and more than 150 injured in Pakistan in a week of storms that followed a heatwave, with officials reporting on Friday five more deaths.
Five people including a child were killed on Thursday in different districts of northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during heavy rains and strong winds, the province´s disaster management authority said.
Stormy weather is expected to continue in northern and central parts of Pakistan until Saturday, according to the national meteorological office.
Heavy windstorms killed 10 people on Tuesday and 14 on Saturday in different parts of the country, one of the most vulnerable to climate change and grappling with increasingly frequent extreme weather events.
Three children were killed on Wednesday in Hyderabad in Sindh province, a senior official said.
While the majority of the deaths were caused by collapsing walls and roofs, at least two people died after being hit by solar panels dislodged by the whipping gusts.
People are killed every year in Pakistan by intense storms, which were unusually frequent this month.
Heatwaves in May followed an unusually warm April and a very dry winter.
Temperatures were up to six degrees Celsius above normal in May, peaking at above 48 degrees Celsius (118 degrees Fahrenheit).

"Pakistan, Turkmenistan set to bolster ties, explore new avenues: Gilani",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317051-pakistan-turkmenistan-set-to-bolster-ties-explore-new-avenues-gilani,"ISLAMABAD: Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani has arrived in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, for an official visit, where he was warmly welcomed by G. Rozye, Deputy Chairman of the Mejlis of Turkmenistan, and Annamuhammet Sarvjayev, Chairman of the Friendship Parliamentary Group, marking a significant milestone in bilateral diplomatic relations, said the Senate Secretariat in a statement.
The dignified reception accorded to Chairman Gilani underscores the strong bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Turkmenistan. The Pakistani delegation was also greeted by the Chargé d’Affaires Adnan Zahoor and Defence Attaché Colonel Taimor Mehmood, highlighting the commitment of both nations to fostering bilateral relations.
Gilani is scheduled to engage in high-level meetings with Turkmen officials, including the leadership of the Mejlis and other key stakeholders. The talks are expected to focus on strengthening bilateral cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, energy, and cultural exchange.
The visit provides an excellent opportunity for both nations to explore new avenues for collaboration and deepen existing ties. Pakistan and Turkmenistan share a rich history of cultural and economic cooperation, and this visit would further cement these bonds.
A key objective is to identify and capitalise on new opportunities for bilateral trade and investment, seeking to expand and diversify their economic partnership.

"Senate panel rebukes Nespak, NTDC over tendering process",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317052-senate-panel-rebukes-nespak-ntdc-over-tendering-process,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs on Friday expressed strong displeasure over the role of National Engineering Services Pakistan (Pvt) Limited (Nespak) and the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) over tendering process.
The meeting was held at the Parliament House under the chairmanship of Senator Saifullah Abro, and attended by Senators Kamran Murtaza, Rahat Jamali, Falak Naz, Kamil Ali Agha and senior management from the ministry/relevant departments.
Committee chairman Senator Abro remarked that it was a matter of great embarrassment that Nespak, a national institution responsible for technical evaluations, failed to prevent such a decision. It was Nespak’s responsibility to ensure proper verification, he stated. Senator Abro highlighted that if the contract was awarded to the deserving bidder, the country could have saved Rs500 million. He noted that the company to which the project was awarded -- Newage, Lahore -- lacked the relevant experience. Expressing serious concern in this regard, he said this kind of negligence cannot be ignored.
Senator Abro said the matter will be pursued through the relevant forums like the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Public Accounts Committee (PAC), and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to ensure that the public funds were recovered. He also recommended that strict action should be taken against the involved officers. Referring to legal inconsistencies, he questioned, if PPRA laws were not applicable, how can a letter from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) be considered valid. He recalled that during the previous meeting, three letters were presented by M. Ali, the caretaker minister, which further raised serious questions regarding the transparency of the process.
When the committee sought further details, it was informed that all relevant data from the Engineering Development Board (EDB) had been destroyed in a fire, and only one verified letter was presented before the committee. Senator Kamal Ali Agha inquired whether an inquiry was conducted following the fire incident. The department stated that no inquiry was carried out. To which, the committee chairman recommended that a formal inquiry be conducted into the fire incident and that strict action be taken against those found responsible, including officers from the Power Division.
The chairman asked whether any recovery of the misused funds had been made, to which the department responded that a letter had been written to NTDC. The chairman recommended that all the involved companies be blacklisted, the misappropriated funds be recovered, and that the officers be terminated,
The committee also inquired about the report and minutes of the 282nd NTDC Board meeting. It was required to submit its report within 15 days, however, the board submitted it after six months. The chairman recommended that strict action be taken against the board and that the amount be recovered within two weeks.
During the briefing on the Sindh Solar Energy Project (SSEP), the committee discussed the issue of encroached lands and expressed astonishment over the revelation that local residents were being paid to vacate the encroached government land.
The committee was told that the project was being funded through loans from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank. It was informed that solar panels were available in the local market at approximately Rs27,000, while the department was procuring them at Rs60,000.
Senator Abro noted this as a serious violation and recommended that the matter be referred to the PAC to examine discrepancies between the market rates and procurement costs.

"Retired professor continues as medical varsity’s Pro-VC in  violation of law, SC ruling",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317053-retired-professor-continues-as-medical-varsity-s-pro-vc-in-violation-of-law-sc-ruling,"KARACHI: A retired professor is continuing to serve as the Pro-Vice Chancellor (Pro-VC) of the Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS), Jamshoro, despite clear legal restrictions and a Supreme Court ruling barring such appointments.According to official documents, Professor Dr Seema Naz, who retired on April 17, 2025, remains in office as Pro-VC of LUMHS. She was initially appointed to the position on August 30, 2024, for a four-year term. However, under the Sindh Universities and Institutes Laws and a 2013 Supreme Court decision, she was supposed to have relinquished the position upon her retirement.
As per the Sindh Universities Laws (Amendment) Act 2013, Section 13, only serving university professors are eligible to be appointed as Pro-VCs. The Act states: “The Pro-Vice Chancellor shall be an eminent academic and a distinguished medical professional appointed by the Chief Minister from amongst the university professors.”
In addition, the Supreme Court’s verdict in original petitions No. 89/2011 and 175/2011, and civil review petition No. 193/2013, categorically prohibits the rehiring or continued service of retired officials in any department. The apex court’s ruling led to the removal of nearly 2,000 such officials across various departments in Sindh, including 69 university staff members ranging from professors to lower-grade officers.
In compliance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and the Sindh Universities Laws (Amendment) Act 2013, several retired Pro-VCs in Sindh had previously been removed. For instance, in May 2022, Professor Dr Ghulam Sarwar Gachal was removed from his post as Pro-VC of the Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Sindh University campus upon reaching the age of retirement.
Similarly, in January 2020, eight retired professors were relieved of their Pro-VC duties at various institutions across the province on the directives of Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah. These removals were in line with both the amended university laws and the Supreme Court ruling.
The list included Dr Muneer Ahmed Junejo of LUMHS, Jamshoro; Dr Aslam Parvez Memon of Sindh University, Naushero-Feroze campus; Dr Khawar Jamali of Dow University of Health Sciences; Dr Zaarnaz Wahid of Dow University, Karachi; Dr Kartar Dewani of Dow University, Karachi; Dr Shamsdin Shiekh of People’s University, Shaheed Benazirabad; Dr Lubna Ansari of Jinnah Sindh Medical University, Karachi and Dr Roshan din Rashidi of Dawood Engineering University, Karachi.
Senior educationist Prof Yaqoob Chandio has described Prof Naz’s continued tenure as illegal and in direct defiance of the apex court ruling.
“If the Supreme Court has explicitly ruled that no retired official may be rehired or continue in office, then any such continuation—particularly in high offices such as Pro-VC—is not only a violation of the law but also sets a dangerous precedent,” Chandio said.
Despite these legal constraints and precedents, no notification has been issued for the formal retirement or removal of Prof Naz from her Pro-VC position. She currently remains the only retired professor in Sindh continuing to serve in such a role.
When contacted, Vice-Chancellor of the LUMHS, Jamshoro Dr Ikram Ujan briefly told The News that as per his opinion Prof Naz’s continuation as Pro-VC was legal and as per laws. “The position of Pro-VC is a tenure post which cannot be affected by retirement,” he added.
Prof Dr Seema Naz also defended her posting while commenting on the issue. She believed as per her Pro-vice-chancellorship notification she must continue for four years and her retirement from job has nothing to do with her current posting. Dr Naz claimed that there were many precedents of the continuation of service as Pro-VC despite retirement of the professors.
Spokesman of the Chief Minister Sindh Abdul Rasheed Channa told The News that the issue of continuation of Dr Naz’s job as Pro-VC would be checked in the light of the relevant Act and apex court’s verdict and action would be taken as per law.
Channa said the Sindh government and the chief minister strictly believed in transparency and rule of law and no person would be allowed to hold any position in contradiction of law.

Fresh protest drive for Imran’s release being launched: Saif,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317057-fresh-protest-drive-for-imran-s-release-being-launched-saif,"PESHAWAR: Advisor to the Chief Minister on Information, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, said on Friday that a new protest campaign was being launched to secure the release of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan.
“Yes, the KP chief minister has been instructed by Imran Khan accordingly,” he said in response to a question during his visit to the Peshawar Press Club, where he presented a cheque for Rs 50 million on behalf of the provincial government as financial assistance to the club and later talked to the media.
Responding to another question, Saif said the party had made sincere efforts for political dialogue.
“At one point, a formal negotiation committee was established, which engaged in talks with the government, but the process stalled and the committee was eventually dissolved,” he explained.
The adviser asserted that the PTI continued its efforts on political, constitutional, and legal fronts to secure the release of Imran Khan.
Saif emphasized that the only way to achieve stability was to ensure swift judicial decisions on what he described as baseless, politically motivated cases filed against Imran Khan and PTI leaders, and to release innocent political prisoners so they could rejoin the mainstream political process.
He said Imran Khan had been in prison for two years but had neither sought pardon nor relief and had borne all hardships with patience.
“Anyone who believes that keeping Imran Khan behind bars will change the political landscape is delusional. The interest of the state, the nation, and the government lies in finding a peaceful resolution to this mockery,” he added.
He described the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)’s anti-corruption protest as the height of political hypocrisy and mockery.
“The world knows that if any party is most associated with corruption, it is the PPP,” he said.
Commenting on the use of force against the PPP’s recent protest, Saif said, “If you unlawfully enter the Red Zone and damage public property, the law will respond.
The police used only legal and reasonable force—no bullets were fired, and no extrajudicial actions were taken.”
Regarding relations with Afghanistan, Saif revealed that the KP government had repeatedly submitted formal and informal requests to the federal government for permission to send a delegation to the neighboring country to engage directly with Afghan authorities on matters affecting KP.
Saif accused the federal government of political incompetence and diplomatic inaction, claiming it was hampering provincial efforts and preventing meaningful engagement with Afghanistan.
Criticizing the federal Foreign Ministry, he stated: ""The foreign minister traveled the world but failed to visit Afghanistan—our neighboring country—which is a major foreign policy failure.""
In response to a question about the expulsion of Afghan nationals, Saif made it clear that the KP government disagreed with
the federal policy on the matter.
He stated that Afghan refugees were seen as brothers, and treating them with compassion and fraternity was both a humanitarian and religious obligation.
“The chief minister has repeatedly stated that the provincial government does not endorse the federal government’s approach toward the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
We believe Afghans share our language, culture, religion, and faith,” he said. Saif dispelled the impression that Afghan citizens were responsible for the province’s problems, calling such claims unfair and disconnected from reality.
He stated that the KP government was taking concrete steps to support the welfare of journalistic institutions.
“Public resources are being utilized transparently, fairly, and effectively to enhance the professional capacity, training, and institutional development of the journalistic community,” he added.

NA panel forms subcommittee to look into Cambridge exam paper leaks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317004-na-panel-forms-subcommittee-to-look-into-cambridge-exam-paper-leaks,"The issue of Cambridge exam papers being leaked has been taken up by the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Education and a sub-committee has been formed on the matter.
In a meeting chaired by Standing Committee Chairman Dr Azimuddin Zahid on Friday, Faisalabad Member of National Assembly Muhammad Ali Sarfraz presented evidence of four recently leaked Cambridge papers to the participants and also showed a video.
He said some students took advantage of the paper leaks and the majority were left out. Cambridge averages such papers or gives marks based on school results. The meeting suggested that the leaked paper exams be re-conducted in July or the threshold be reduced so that all students could benefit.
In the meeting of the Standing Committee, Zeb Jaffer, Dr Haleem and other members criticised Cambridge’s performance and several critical questions were asked of Cambridge’s Country Director Uzma Yousaf.
Uzma Yousaf said the information about Cambridge paper leaks is not true; it is just rumors. We conduct examinations in 160 countries, but we will complete the investigation into the paper leaks by June 16.
On this occasion, Federal Secretary of the Ministry of Education Nadeem Mehboob said Cambridge and other foreign boards deal with the IBCC and Cambridge is accountable to them.
IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Mallah said Cambridge does not take us into confidence in most matters. He said that as long as the British Council used to take examination papers, the papers did not leak, but when schools were allowed to conduct independent and direct examinations, the process of paper leaks started.
He said that during the tenure of former secretary Mohiuddin Wani, Beacon House was allowed to conduct independent examinations in its schools, while in the case of independent examinations, Cambridge was supposed to reduce the fees, but the fees were not reduced. On this occasion, the participants of the meeting criticized Cambridge and said Cambridge earns billions of rupees from Pakistan in the form of examinations.
Cambridge Pakistani Director Uzma Yousaf criticized the performance of government education boards and said that students turn to Cambridge due to the poor performance of government boards, to which Chairman Higher Education Commission Dr Mukhtar said that this is wrong. The Federal Education Board and a few other boards are good and their performance is exemplary.
On this occasion, a subcommittee was formed under the chairmanship of Member of Assembly Sabin to review the performance of Cambridge and the issues of paper leakage. The subcommittee will include Zeb Jaffer, Muhammad Ali Sarfraz, Dr Aleem, Executive Director IBCC and other members. This committee will also call Cambridge Pakistani Director Uzma Yousaf in the meeting, which will be held after June 16.

Livestock trader robbed at gunpoint,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317005-livestock-trader-robbed-at-gunpoint,"In an incident near Ayesha Manzil, four armed assailants riding two motorcycles robbed a livestock trader at gunpoint, fleeing with his rickshaw, three sacrificial goats, and a mobile phone.
The victim, Rashid Saleem, a resident of FC Area Liaquatabad and a barber by profession, was working temporarily as a livestock trader ahead of Eid-Ul-Adha. After trying to sell his animals near Café Piyala, he was returning home when the robbery occurred.
As he approached the Jamaat Khana, the robbers intercepted his rickshaw, held him at gunpoint, forced him off the vehicle, and made off with the goats, mobile phone, and rickshaw. The visibly distraught trader was later seen sitting on the sidewalk in tears, saying the animals had been purchased with his entire year’s savings for the festive occasion.
The incident had sparked serious concern among local residents, who claimed such crimes had become alarmingly frequent in the area. Many criticised the police for their inaction against criminals.
A case had been registered at the Azizabad police station. The police said CCTV footage from the scene had been collected and added that increased patrols—both in mobile vans and on motorcycles—had been deployed in the area ahead of the Eid season.

Police recover infant abducted from Ibrahim Hyderi,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317008-police-recover-infant-abducted-from-ibrahim-hyderi,"The Ibrahim Hyderi police on Friday recovered an eight-month-old baby who had been abducted from her home in the Juma Goth area.
The incident was reported immediately by the child’s parents. The police launched a comprehensive search operation, employing modern technology and technical methods to track down the missing infant. Within a few hours, the baby was found alive and safe, rescued from a nearby drainage line.
During the investigation, the arrested suspects—identified as Shaukat, Allah Dino, and Kamran — confessed to abducting the child in order to steal her gold earrings. They admitted that the motive behind the abduction was purely to snatch the jewellery.
The suspects also revealed the involvement of a fourth accomplice, and raids were currently underway to ensure his arrest. Legal proceedings had been initiated against the arrested individuals, and further investigations were ongoing, according to a spokesperson for the Malir Police.

SHC vacates suspension order against appointment of KWSC CEO and COO,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317009-shc-vacates-suspension-order-against-appointment-of-kwsc-ceo-and-coo,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday vacated its interim order with regard to suspension of the appointment of the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief operating officer (COO) of the Karachi Water & Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), and observed that a permanent chief executive officer be appointed within two months in accordance with the law.
The direction came on a petition against the appointment of the KWSC CEO and COO. The petitioner, Rashid Siddiqui, had argued that both the COO and CEO did not qualify to hold the post as one officer was already a retired officer and the other officer did not have the requisite grade.
A division bench of the high court headed by Justice Omar Sial observed that the KWSC controlled the provision of potable water and sewage disposal in Karachi although its efficiency was debatable as residents of a large part of city continued to be deprived of potable water and proper sewage system, and compelled to buy water at exorbitant rates.
The high court observed that it believed that improving the workings of the KWSC was a matter best left to the executive to do so. However, at same time the efforts taken by the KWSC should also not be brushed under the carpet.
The bench observed that Karachi was a vast city and stopping senior officials from work could potentially cause irreparable loss and damage to the residents of the provincial capital. The SHC observed that working and functioning of the government must not be hindered and if that was done, the already chaotic city would further suffer.
The high court observed that the concern of the petitioner for betterment was appreciated but at the same time, the high court could not interfere in executive matters unless a clear breach of the law was demonstrated and the petitioner was unsuccessful to show this at this stage.
The bench also took exception to non-serious conduct of the government and KWSC in the present proceedings and observed that no law officer from the government and KWSC took the proceedings seriously, due to which the court had to pass an interim order with regard to appointment of the KWSC’s managing director and COO.
The SHC asked the law minister and provincial government to ensure effective and knowledgeable legal representation of the province. The high court observed that prima facie, the appointments of the KE CEO and COO did not breach the law in the field as the law did not bar a retired person from getting appointed on these posts nor the law stipulated that only an officer of a particular grade could hold such a post.
The SHC observed that it was not appropriate for senior offices of the KWSC to be filled with temporary postings. The high court observed that an additional advocate general informed it that the KWSC had already initiated the process for the appointment of a permanent CEO.
The bench expressed the hope that a suitable candidate who complied with all the criteria laid down by the applicable law, rules and regulations would be appointed within two months while the status of the KWSC employees as to whether or not 0they were civil servants may be argued by the parties at length when the main petition would be argued.

"CM lauds ICAP for safeguarding profession’s independence, maintaining highest standards",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317010-cm-lauds-icap-for-safeguarding-profession-s-independence-maintaining-highest-standards,"The chartered accountants qualification instills discipline, ethics, leadership qualities, transforming professionals into trusted advisors, said Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday while addressing the members’ convocation ceremony for the Winter Batch 2024 of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Pakistan (ICAP).
The event, held at a local hotel, celebrated the achievements of the newly qualified chartered accountants and highlighted their vital role in the country’s economic and professional landscape.
Addressing the gathering, the CM said it was his honour and privilege to stand among Pakistan’s brightest young minds. He described the convocation as more than a formal event – a joyous celebration of talent, perseverance, and the promising future these professionals represent for Pakistan.
He emphasised the prestige of ICAP, calling it a national institution with a stellar reputation both domestically and internationally. He noted that ICAP has consistently produced exceptional professionals who have become finance leaders, auditors, CEOs, advisors, and entrepreneurs, contributing significantly to economic growth and stability.
Highlighting the rigorous journey to becoming chartered accountants, the CM acknowledged that the qualification instils discipline, ethics, and leadership qualities that transform these professionals into trusted advisors and visionary leaders beyond mere number crunchers.
Shah praised the elected governing council of ICAP for safeguarding the profession’s independence, championing innovation, and maintaining the highest standards to keep the institute aligned with global best practices. This, he said, prepares members to compete and lead on the world stage.
To the newly qualified chartered accountants, Shah conveyed a powerful message: their success is not just about passing exams but about demonstrating dedication, consistency, and self-belief to achieve extraordinary milestones. He reminded them that their journey is just the beginning and that their prestigious title carries worldwide respect and great responsibility.
He called on these professionals to lead with integrity, sound judgment, and courage, whether in boardrooms, public service, or entrepreneurship. He underscored Pakistan’s need for honest and capable leaders who set trends and drive meaningful change, especially in the public sector.
He also lauded ICAP’s commitment to merit, innovation, and professional excellence, recognising its crucial role in nurturing ethical and future-ready professionals. Acknowledging the families present, the CM appreciated their sacrifices and support, stating that this achievement belongs to them as much as to the graduates.
In conclusion, he urged the new chartered accountants to take pride in their accomplishments and to look forward with purpose and determination. “Your real impact begins now,” he said. “You have the power to contribute meaningfully to our country’s development, and rest assured, Pakistan believes in you.”
The ceremony concluded with warm congratulations to the graduates, marking a significant milestone in their professional lives and a hopeful step forward for Pakistan’s future.

Malir SSP ordered to take action to halt desecration of graves at Gadap graveyard,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317011-malir-ssp-ordered-to-take-action-to-halt-desecration-of-graves-at-gadap-graveyard,"A sessions court on Friday ordered Malir’s senior superintendent of police (SSP) to take immediate and effective action to halt the desecration and destruction of graves at a graveyard in Gadap Town.
The order came on an application filed by Ahmed Bux Morio under Section 22-A of the Criminal Procedure Code seeking legal action against seven proposed accused for allegedly desecrating Pir-e-Had Graveyard.
After hearing arguments, Additional Sessions Judge (Malir) Liaqat Ali Khoso ordered the SSP to ensure the protection, preservation, and restoration of the sanctity of the graveyard. He directed the Gadap City SHO to record the statement of the applicant under Section 154 of the CrPC and lodge an FIR in the exact words of the complainant if a cognizable offence was made out.
In his written order, the judge observed: ""Under Islamic principles, the sanctity and dignity of a human being are to be respected both in life and in death."" ""The Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) explicitly prohibits even sitting on graves, let alone damaging or demolishing them for commercial convenience. Any act of trampling upon or degrading graves by making pathways for heavy vehicles is not only reprehensible but also a matter of religious, moral, and legal concern,"" he added.
The applicant alleged that the proposed accused were willfully desecrating and damaging the Pir-e-Had graveyard situated in Gadap Town, Malir, Karachi, where approximately 1,500 to 2,000 deceased persons are buried.
He said that they had unlawfully created a thoroughfare through the graveyard to facilitate movement of heavy vehicles, such as dumpers and loaders, despite having no legal or designated access.
The applicant claimed that despite repeated entreaties by him and local residents, the proposed accused had not ceased their actions and continued to desecrate the graves. Instead, he added, they had issued him threats of serious consequences.

IPP expresses solidarity with Pakistan armed forces,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316945-ipp-expresses-solidarity-with-pakistan-armed-forces,"LAHORE:To express solidarity with the Pakistan armed forces and to pay tribute to the army, navy, and air force personnel on their remarkable victory in the recent Pakistan-India conflict, the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party organised a ‘Marqa-e-Haq Convention’ in Khushab.
The event was graced by the President of the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party and Federal Minister for Communications, Abdul Aleem Khan, as the chief guest. In his address, he stated that Allah Almighty granted Pakistan a decisive victory against enemy that has never accepted the country’s existence. He highlighted that India targeted children under the cover of night, and tragically, the first martyr of the conflict was the younger son of a Pakistani soldier. Aleem Khan said that Pakistan’s military leadership, under the command of Field Marshal Asim Munir, led the way by offering the Fajr prayer and raising the battle cry of ‘Allahu Akbar’ before delivering a resounding response to Indian Prime Minister Modi—one that, he said, would be remembered for generations. He added that India’s administration has now been forced to apologise before the world, and its arrogance has been thoroughly shattered.
Aleem Khan extended heartfelt congratulations to Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf for making the entire nation proud. He revealed that the Pakistan Air Force downed six enemy aircraft within an hour and a half, inside enemy territory. He praised the armed forces for their collective bravery, stating that the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Air Force risked everything for the nation. He emphasised that the people of Pakistan stand united with their military and will defend the country together against any threat. He remarked that Pakistan's show of strength has had such a significant impact that even the market price of Rafale jets declined. He expressed gratitude to friendly nations including China, Türkiye, and Azerbaijan for their unwavering support during the conflict.
Concluding his remarks, he stated that Pakistan’s military commander is not just a leader for Pakistan but for the entire Islamic world. He added, ‘We have sent a message to Israel as well — we are not Palestine; we are Pakistan.’
The event also featured addresses by IPP MNA and Parliamentary Secretary Engineer Gul Asghar Baghore, IPP Khushab President and ticket-holder Ameer Haider Singha, IPP Secretary General Khalid Mehmood, MPA Shoaib Siddiqui, Ghazanfar Abbas Cheena, Punjab President Rana Nazir Ahmed, Vice President Mian Junaid Zulfiqar, ex-Interior Minister Malik Habib Khan, South Punjab President Syed Rafaqat Ali Gillani, Khuram Hameed Rokhari, Haroon Imran Gill, Ms Qudrat Niazi and other party leaders. During the event, various political and social figures from NA-88 Khushab announced their joining IPP.

She said that with the help of artificial intelligence, India showed the destruction of many Pakistani cities and Sikh shrines by spreading false news. She said that Pakistan has badly exposed the Indian media in front of the whole world.
Mushaal Malik was addressing the third ‘International Media and Communication Conference’ at Punjab University here on Friday. The conference was attended by Provincial Minister for Minority Affairs Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora, Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Muhammad Ali, Head of PU School of Communication Studies Prof Dr Abida Ashraf, faculty members and students from the country and abroad.
Addressing the ceremony, Mushaal Malik said that the Kashmir issue was once again being highlighted all over the world and Indian diplomacy was failing. She said that China's role in the region is very important; China can control the water of Brahmaputra. She said that the media will have to make more efforts to highlight the Kashmir issue.
She said that all Hurriyat leaders are in jail, and the movements of freedom fighters are being monitored by drone cameras. She said that Hurriyat leader Yasin Malik should be released and included in every matter.
She said that if the Kashmir issue is resolved, the entire terror system of India will be destroyed. Provincial Minister for Minorities Ramesh Singh Arora said that the intersection of media and artificial intelligence is the need of the hour.
Prof Dr Muhammad Ali said that steps were being taken to introduce the subject of artificial intelligence in every department at PU. He said that Kashmir will always be in the heart of every Pakistani and we will continue to fight India not for our waters or for ourselves but for Kashmiris.
He said that we will continue to raise our voice at every level for the freedom of Kashmiri leaders. He said that the role of media and social science along with technology has been very important in this war.

"Moot highlights significance of safer, regulated milk",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316952-moot-highlights-significance-of-safer-regulated-milk,"LAHORE: Commemorating World Milk Day, Pakistan Dairy Association (PDA) hosted a high-level national seminar under the theme ‘Safe Milk, Safe Nation: Affordable Dairy for a Healthier Nation’ in the provincial capital on Friday.
The event brought together senior government officials, industry leaders, and dairy experts in an interactive session.
At the event, dairy sector stakeholders have advocated for a national shift toward safer and regulated milk with a view to exploring the strategic role of the formal dairy sector in enhancing public health, food security and sustainable economic development.
The seminar featured in-depth discussions on regulatory reforms, standardisation, certification, and enforcement mechanisms necessary to ensure the safety of milk. Key officials, Jahan Ara Wattoo, Vice Chairperson, Punjab Social Protection Authority, Dr Talat Naseer Pasha – DG PAFDA, Amina Rafique, ADG Technical, Punjab Food Authority, and Saqib Ali Ateel, Secretary for Livestock & Dairy Development, shared institutional strategies for quality assurance and public awareness. The role of the private sector in driving innovation and ensuring a consistent supply of safe milk was also a central theme.
Pakistan Dairy Association Chief Executive Officer Dr Shehzad Amin opened the seminar by highlighting the central role of dairy in public health and national development. He said, “World Milk Day is not just a celebration, it is a global moment to acknowledge nature’s most complete superfood and its profound impact on nutrition, food security, livelihoods, and economic growth. At PDA, our mission is firmly rooted in ensuring that safe, nutritious, and affordable dairy is accessible to every citizen. We believe – and advocate – that safe milk is not a choice, but a fundamental right of every Pakistani.”
Adding to this perspective, Director Corporate Affairs Noor Aftab highlighted the importance of innovation in dairy processing and packaging. “Milk is more than daily nutrition – it’s a cornerstone of public health, food resilience, and economic progress. Through advanced technologies and collaborative efforts, we are committed to making safe, affordable dairy accessible to every household in Pakistan,” he noted.
Punjab Minister for Minorities & Human Rights Ramesh Singh Arora emphasised that access to safe milk should be considered a right, not a privilege. “Every citizen deserves access to clean, safe, and nutritious milk. Unfortunately, loose milk often contains harmful adulterants like urea, posing serious health risks. Packaged milk, on the other hand, maintains strict quality standards and offers a reliable alternative. The Punjab govt is acutely aware of the province’s malnutrition challenges and is committed to ensuring safe milk reaches every household. We also recognise the negative impact of the current taxation on packaged milk and are working to address this as part of our broader health and nutrition agenda.” Minister of State & Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Romina Khurshid Alam emphasised the essential role of milk in ensuring nutritional well-being. “When we talk about health and nutrition, milk stands out as the one element that completes the nutrition cycle.

Workshop on food systems education held,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316966-workshop-on-food-systems-education-held,"Islamabad: The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), in collaboration with leading academic institutions, a two-day capacity building workshop on food systems courses for university faculty concluded on May 30, at a hotel, says a press release.
The workshop brought together over 40 faculty members from 10 universities across Lahore and Faisalabad, demonstrating a shared commitment to advancing food systems education and strengthening nutrition-sensitive policy development in Pakistan.
The primary aim of the training was to equip university faculty with the knowledge, methodologies, and pedagogical tools needed to integrate food systems thinking into academic curricula. The initiative supports both national and global efforts to tackle the triple burden of malnutrition while fostering sustainable, resilient, and equitable food environments.
In her opening remarks, Farah Naz, country director of GAIN Pakistan, emphasised the essential role of faculty members in shaping a future-ready food workforce and reaffirmed GAIN’s dedication to supporting transformative change within the education sector.
Faiz Rasool, head of policy and advocacy at GAIN Pakistan, highlighted the pressing issue of malnutrition in the country, particularly as it relates to food insecurity and the growing impact of climate change. He emphasised the importance of equipping youth with relevant food systems knowledge and using that foundation to inform future policy and program development. He further underlined the need to build faculty capacity as a critical enabler of systems transformation—an area this GAIN initiative specifically targets.
During the workshop, participants explored curriculum design for food systems education, effective assessment and evaluation strategies, experiential and participatory learning methods, and the integration of digital tools in classroom instruction. These sessions were designed not only to strengthen pedagogical approaches but also to encourage institutional collaboration, curriculum innovation, and active engagement with local policy contexts. This workshop marks a pivotal step toward institutionalising food systems education within Pakistan’s higher education sector.

Technicians training programme launched,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316969-technicians-training-programme-launched,"Islamabad: The Ministerial Standing Committee on Scientific and Technological Cooperation (COMSTECH) of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Hunan University of Chinese Medicine (HUCM), China, have decided to launch of the Second Joint Technicians Training Programme, to be held from June 8 to 17, in Changsha, China.
Following the resounding success of the inaugural program, this year’s edition will once again convene a diverse group of technicians and technologists from OIC member states and other countries. Participants, drawn from across Science, Technology, Engineering, and Medicine (STEM) disciplines, will receive practical, hands-on training in cutting-edge laboratory techniques and instrumentation within HUCM’s advanced research facilities
The program responds to the pressing need to strengthen technical expertise in the OIC region, where shared challenges such as poverty, public health crises, food insecurity, and climate change continue to hinder sustainable development. Despite the immense potential across the 57-member states of the OIC, a critical shortage of trained technical personnel and researchers remains a major obstacle to scientific and technological progress.
Recognizing this gap, COMSTECH and HUCM have collaborated to develop a targeted training initiative aimed at enhancing laboratory and instrumentation skills essential for research and innovation. Nineteen selected participants will receive intensive instruction in high-end analytical and diagnostic techniques, including LCMS, GCMS, FTIR, MS, and NMR, among others.
The program is tailored for laboratory technologists, technicians, and early-career researchers affiliated with universities, hospitals, and R&D institutions. Candidates with educational backgrounds in engineering technology, laboratory sciences, or postgraduate STEM education are eligible, with special preference given to women and applicants from Least Developed Countries (LDCs) within the OIC.
This joint initiative underscores the value of international academic cooperation in driving capacity building and fostering resilience in science and technology sectors across the Global South.

PTI camp burning case: Pre-arrest interim bail granted to PPP leader,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316982-pti-camp-burning-case-pre-arrest-interim-bail-granted-to-ppp-leader,"PESHAWAR: A court on Friday approved the pre-arrest interim bail plea of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Central Secretary General, Humayun Khan.
A case was registered against him for staging a protest at the Assembly Chowk and allegedly setting fire to a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) camp.Additional District and Sessions Judge Peshawar, Ismatullah Wazir, heard the bail plea.
The petitioner was represented in court by advocates Gohar Rehman Khattak, Lajbar Khan, Owais, and Shakeel Ahmad Gilani during the hearing.The lawyers informed the court that their client was a senior politician and the central secretary general of the PPP, who was leading a peaceful protest on Monday.
However, they added, during the demonstration, the police, allegedly acting on the instructions of the provincial government, resorted to a baton charge against the party workers.They argued that peaceful protest was a constitutional right of every citizen, but in an attempt to sabotage the protest, the police resorted to unjustified use of force.
The lawyers said several workers and party members were affected by tear gas and had to be hospitalized.Later, they learned that a case had been registered against Humayun Khan at the Sharqi [East ] Police Station in Cantt. The counsel emphasized that the petitioner was a respectable citizen and a political leader, and therefore requested the court to approve his pre-arrest bail.
The court summoned the relevant police record by June 14 after approving the interim pre-arrest bail.It is worth mentioning that other PPP leaders, including Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, Ziaullah Afridi, and Shah Zulqarnain, have already obtained interim pre-arrest bail in the same case.

Massive irregularities in Punjab’s first Ramazan package exposed: Saif,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316987-massive-irregularities-in-punjab-s-first-ramazan-package-exposed-saif,"PESHAWAR: Advisor to the Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations Barrister Dr Muhammad Ali Saif has stated that the audit report has unmasked serious irregularities in Punjab’s first Ramazan package under the leadership of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
Dr Saif said that Maryam Nawaz attempted to replicate the Ramazan package introduced by Ali Amin Gandapur, but in doing so, billions of rupees from the national treasury were squandered.
Referring to the findings of the audit report, Barrister Saif revealed grave financial mismanagement in the 2024 Punjab Ramazan Nigehbaan Package. According to the report, a total of 9,300 ineligible government employees misappropriated ration worth Rs34.6 million, while ration packets worth Rs 1.63 billion failed to reach 441,000 deserving recipients in cities including Lahore, Rahim Yar Khan, Faisalabad, and Rawalpindi.
He further noted that due to incorrect data, the national exchequer suffered a loss of Rs1.81 billion. “Around 500,000 ration packets were delivered to incorrect addresses. The critical question now is: if the addresses were incorrect, where did those half a million ration packets go?” Dr Saif questioned.
The report also highlighted negligence by the Punjab Food Authority in ensuring quality standards, and blamed the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) and deputy commissioners for failing to verify recipient addresses. Additionally, disorganization in transportation and failure of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to update the list of eligible recipients further aggravated the situation.

"Case of 67,000 Haj aspirants: JI leader blasts govt over payment delay",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316989-case-of-67-000-haj-aspirants-ji-leader-blasts-govt-over-payment-delay,"PESHAWAR: Jamaat-e-Islami Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Central) president Abdul Wasi has criticised the federal government and its Ministry of Religious Affairs for the negligence due to which the Haj aspirations of more than 67,000 pilgrims have been dashed as they failed to make timely payments to the Saudi authorities.
The intending pilgrims were supposed to offer the major religious obligation through private tour operators, he said in a statement issued here on Friday.He said that despite repeated efforts over the past two months by private tour operators, who approached government offices, political leaders and parliamentarians, the authorities failed to resolve the issue with the Saudi government.
“These pilgrims deposited over 70 billion rupees months ago,” Abdul Wasi said, “but due to the traditional inefficiency of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, the payments were not made to Saudi authorities in time.” As a result, the quota allocated to private Pakistani tour operators has been canceled, effectively ending all hopes for over 67,000 pilgrims to perform Hajj this year, he maintained.
The JI leader further said that this failure has not only deprived thousands of the opportunity to perform Haj, but also severely impacted the livelihoods of thousands employed in the Haj and Umrah travel sector.He demanded the government to immediately refund the full amount collected from the affected pilgrims and initiate legal action against those officials and staff responsible for the delay.

EU ‘fully invested’ in Trump trade talks after US court ruling,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316896-eu-fully-invested-in-trump-trade-talks-after-us-court-ruling,"BRUSSELS: The EU is “fully invested” in reaching a deal with the United States to avoid sweeping tariffs, the bloc’s trade chief said on Friday, after US judges ruled the controversial measures were unconstitutional.
“Delivering forward-looking solutions remains a top EU priority. Staying in permanent contact,” EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic said on X after a call Thursday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
Sefcovic could meet his US trade counterparts in Paris next week on the sidelines of a ministerial meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, an EU official said.
Sefcovic, however, did not make any comment on the court drama across the Atlantic.In a ruling Wednesday, the US Court of International Trade had barred most of the tariffs announced since President Donald Trump took office, but an appeals court the next day preserved his sweeping import duties on China and other trading partners.
The short-term relief will now allow the appeals process to proceed.Sefcovic has previously said he had calls with his US trade counterparts on Friday, Saturday and Monday as the two sides intensify talks after last week’s tensions.
Trump threatened last Friday, but then postponed, to hit EU goods with a huge tariff, voicing frustration that talks with the EU were “going nowhere”.The US president had already hit the bloc with multiple waves of tariffs, including 25-per cent duties on cars, steel and aluminium.The European Commission has been leading negotiations on behalf of the 27-country bloc in search of a mutually beneficial deal with the United States.

"Attock Cement Pakistan is said to draw Cherat, Bestway Interest",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316897-attock-cement-pakistan-is-said-to-draw-cherat-bestway-interest,"Pharaon Investment Group Ltd’s potential sale of Attock Cement Pakistan Ltd is attracting initial interest from rivals including Cherat Cement Co and Bestway Group, people with knowledge of the matter said, according to Bloomberg.
Cherat and Bestway are among suitors considering bids for the business, the people said, asking not to be identified because the information is private. Kot Addu Power Co has also been evaluating Attock and may explore a joint offer with a local building materials producer like Fauji Cement, the people said.
In a stock exchange filing sent by Attock on Thursday, Pharaon said it has received interest for its stake in the cement producer. Certain prospective investors have indicated an intention to submit binding offers following the completion of a due diligence exercise, Pharaon said, without naming them.
Deliberations are ongoing and there’s no certainty the potential bidders will proceed with offers, the people said. None of the companies responded to requests for comment.Demand for cement in Pakistan has weakened as economic growth slowed to 2.5 per cent last year and forecast to be about 2.7 per cent this fiscal year through June.
Lebanon-based Pharaon said in December it was reassessing strategic options, including a potential sale of Attock Cement Pakistan. The company hired Standard Chartered Plc as a financial adviser.
With a presence in the Middle East, Europe and Africa, Pharaon is also involved in sectors such as health-care, home appliances and insurance, its website shows. The group’s Pakistan investments include Attock Petroleum Ltd, Attock Refinery Ltd and Pakistan Oilfields Ltd.

Uzbek delegation seeks stronger trade ties with Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316898-uzbek-delegation-seeks-stronger-trade-ties-with-pakistan,"LAHORE: Deputy Chairperson of the Uzbekistan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Tokhtaev Akobirjon has expressed keen interest in deepening trade and investment ties between Uzbekistan and Pakistan. Speaking during a visit to the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), where he led a high-level delegation, Akobirjon emphasised the Uzbek business community’s intent to strengthen mutual economic cooperation.
He pledged to make all-out efforts to enhance collaboration and explore untapped opportunities in trade and investment, noting that the visit marked an important step towards establishing long-term institutional linkages between the business communities of both countries.
LCCI President Mian Abuzar Shad welcomed the delegation and described Uzbekistan as a key trading hub in Central Asia. He said that this visit, following another high-level Uzbek delegation’s visit to the LCCI just four months ago, demonstrated continued engagement and growing interest in reinforcing bilateral relations. He added that Pakistan viewed Uzbekistan as a pivotal economy under the  government of Pakistan’s
‘Vision Central Asia’ policy, which prioritises political engagement, trade and investment, energy cooperation, defence collaboration, and people-to-people linkages.Shad noted with concern that the current volume of bilateral trade does not reflect the true potential between the two nations. In 2023-24, bilateral trade reached $106 million, of which Pakistan’s exports accounted for $78 million, he said stressing the need to explore new avenues for collaboration, particularly in sectors such as agriculture, pharmaceuticals, textiles, leather, chemicals, renewable energy and information technology.
Highlighting the composition of the Uzbek delegation, Shad said its members were mainly from the textile and leather footwear industries and were actively seeking joint ventures and partnerships with Pakistani companies. He expressed confidence that the delegation would find reliable business partners in Lahore and hoped the visit would prove to be a milestone in strengthening commercial ties between Pakistan and Uzbekistan.

He highlighted the profitability and growth potential of the Pakistani market, noting that over 80 US multinational companies have successfully operated in Pakistan for decades. “Their continued presence reflects not only strong returns but also Pakistan’s potential as a regional trade hub,” he said.
Touching upon the recent tensions with India, the ambassador reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to peace. “While there is a sense of national pride over the success in thwarting aggression, we don’t want to do it again. We are a peace-loving country. At the very time this escalation took place, we were in the midst of a positive economic trajectory,” he said.
On US-Pakistan economic relations, Sheikh noted that the trade deficit between the two countries was modest. “Pakistan ranks 33rd in terms of trade deficit with the United States -- a manageable gap of around $3.1-3.4 billion,” he explained.
“This can be narrowed through increased imports such as US cotton and soybeans.”He pointed out that Pakistan is already among the largest importers of American cotton, a vital input for the country’s thriving textile sector.
Discussions with US agricultural councils, including the US Soybean Export Council and Cotton Council, are ongoing to further deepen agricultural trade ties, he added. The ambassador also emphasised Pakistan’s cost advantage in IT services, saying that the country offers a 70 per cent cost benefit compared to the US and a 20-30 per cent advantage over other global competitors. “We are not only cost-effective but also quality-competitive,” he said, citing Pakistan’s capabilities in high-stakes technological environments, including recent high-tech aerial defence operations in early May.
Turning to investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector, Sheikh cited recent ventures by US-based mining company Barrick Gold in the country’s copper reserves and growing US investor interest.
“Pakistan could become the next Saudi Arabia of copper,” he said, adding that efforts are underway to digitise and tokenise mineral assets, opening new opportunities for US FinTech collaboration.
He also highlighted the role of the nearly one million-strong Pakistani-American diaspora in strengthening bilateral ties. “Our diaspora has done exceptionally well and can serve as a powerful force multiplier in amplifying and facilitating US-Pakistan economic engagement,” he said.
Inviting US corporations, state governments and business stakeholders to explore Pakistan’s market of 250 million people, the ambassador encouraged them to take advantage of the significant economic opportunities the country offers.

"Petroleum minister calls for holistic energy policy, vows action on circular debt",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316900-petroleum-minister-calls-for-holistic-energy-policy-vows-action-on-circular-debt,"KARACHI: Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik on Friday emphasised the need for adopting a holistic energy policy to address Pakistan’s growing energy challenges.
Speaking to the media during a visit to the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) head office, the minister outlined the broader energy landscape in the context of economic constraints.“The energy sector is like oxygen for the economy,” he said. “We are taking steps to align supply and tariffs with international market trends. Early signs of recovery are emerging in key sectors, but it is essential to maintain momentum and ensure stability moving forward.”
Malik said the PM had instructed all ministries to take decisions that serve the country’s long-term interests. “We are creating awareness and moving forward with a clear and focused strategy,” he added.
He noted that both downstream and upstream sector issues are being addressed by the PM and the petroleum ministry. “Concrete steps are being taken to provide relief to people in the upcoming budget,” he said.
Commenting on the circular debt issue in the energy sector, the minister acknowledged the challenge but said the government remained committed to resolving it, despite constraints imposed by the IMF.
“There are two main objectives in tackling circular debt in the gas sector,” he explained. “One is to stop its further accumulation, and the other is to improve recoveries and reduce expenditures.”
Petroleum sector matters were also discussed in detail during the visit, in addition to the gas industry.SSGC Acting Managing Director Amin Rajput, responding to media queries related to the company’s services, said that the standard response time for resolving customer complaints is 48 hours -- except where road-cutting permissions are required.
Addressing concerns over PUG (prohibited unaccounted-for gas) charges in gas bills, Rajput said these were linked to slow metres and were calculated under a framework approved by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
He also highlighted the scale of SSGC’s infrastructure, noting that the company’s pipeline network spans over 55,000 kilometres. A large portion of this network has aged, leading to operational issues. “Previously, the company rehabilitated around 150km of pipeline annually. That number has now increased to 2,500km per year, resulting in significant improvements in gas supply and a reduction in line losses,” he said.

KSE-100 index up 720 points on hopes for positive budget announcements,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316901-kse-100-index-up-720-points-on-hopes-for-positive-budget-announcements,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed higher on Friday amid strong investor sentiment for declining inflation and expectations of positive announcements in the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 719.69 points, or 0.6 per cent, to 119,691.09 points, up from 118,971.41 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 119,913.88 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 118,771.84 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Ltd said, “Stocks closed bullish led by blue chip scrips in the oil, banking and fertiliser sectors amid hopes for positive federal budget announcements.”He said that budgetary relief for oil refineries, real estate and the agriculture sector; the proposed levy of 1.5 per cent tax on imports to support industrials; and rupee stability played a catalytic role in the bullish close at the PSX.
The KSE-30 index increased by 249.55 points or 0.69 per cent to 36,454.15 points from 36,204.6 points. Traded shares dropped by 161 million shares to 580.318 million shares from 741.654 million shares. The trading value decreased to Rs22.743 billion from Rs23.911 billion. Market capital expanded to Rs14.503 trillion against Rs14.426 trillion. Of the 474 companies active in the session, 259 closed in green, 161 in red and 54 remained unchanged.
Nabeel Haroon, an analyst at Topline Securities, said continuing its previous day momentum, the KSE-100 index largely traded in the positive zone during the trading session to close at 119,691 level (up by +0.6 per cent)
Top positive contributions to the index came from FFC, MEBL, HUBC, PKGP, ENGROH and MCB, as they cumulatively contributed +668 points to the index.Traded value-wise; ATRL (Rs1.66 billion), DGKC (Rs878 million), HUBC (Rs807 million), FFC (Rs708 million), MEBL (Rs661 million) and MARI (Rs607 million) dominated the trading activity.
The highest increase was recorded in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which rose by Rs2,670.41 to Rs29,374.54 per share, followed by Khyber Textile Mills Limited, which increased by Rs253.70 to Rs2,790.71 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs147.42 to Rs9,960.91 per share, Sapphire Fibres Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs61.74 to Rs1,011.89 per share.
Muhammad Hasan Ather, an analyst at JS Global, said the rally was driven by strong investor sentiment amid declining inflation, a current account surplus, and Fitch’s upgrade of Pakistan’s credit rating to ‘B-’. Robust activity in the banking, energy and cement sectors further buoyed gains. “With over 1,358 points added in two sessions, momentum suggests continued upside, contingent on sustained macroeconomic stability and clarity on political and external financial developments. Investors remain cautiously optimistic.”
WorldCall Telecom remained the volume leader with 79.666 million shares, which closed lower by 6 paisas to Rs1.37 per share. K-Electric Ltd, with 47.700 million shares, followed it, which closed lower by 20 paisas to Rs5.32 per share.

Rupee gains for second day,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316902-rupee-gains-for-second-day,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee ended marginally higher on Friday, extending gains to a second straight session, supported by improved supplies.
The rupee closed at 282.02 per dollar in the interbank market, compared with the previous close of 282.07.In the open market, the rupee edged lower, trading at 284.4 against the dollar, compared with 284.39 on Thursday.
Dealers reported a slight appreciation of the local currency, attributed to improved dollar availability, facilitated by remittances from Pakistanis working abroad ahead of Eidul Azha.  In a positive development, Pakistan’s central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $70 million to $11.516 billion as of May 23. However, the total liquid foreign reserves held by the country dropped by $12 million to $16.637 billion. Similarly, the reserves of commercial banks fell by $81 million to $5.121 billion.
The SBP managed to increase its reserves despite external debt repayments, thanks to a current account surplus. Inflows from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and rollovers from friendly nations played a crucial role in bolstering forex reserves.
The SBP received the second tranche of $1.023 billion from the IMF under a $7 billion loan programme on May 13.The SBP purchased $5.9 billion from the interbank market between June 2024 and February 2025 to boost its reserves and meet external debt repayments. In February, the SBP bought $223 million worth of foreign currency from the market, up from $154 million in the previous month.

"Maritime minister, PBC address sectoral reforms, PPPs",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316903-maritime-minister-pbc-address-sectoral-reforms-ppps,"KARACHI: Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry attended a high-level meeting with the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) at the Dawood Centre, Karachi.
The minister emphasised that the maritime sector is capital-intensive and requires technical expertise to become a driver of economic development in Pakistan. He stressed that continuous cooperation among key stakeholders -- including the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Ministry of Communications, provincial governments, and the business community -- was essential to harness both expertise and capital, particularly through public-private partnership models.
He noted that infrastructure connecting to the Karachi Port must be developed with sound business models. While the federal government could play a facilitative role, it must be matched by committed engagement from the relevant business sectors. He also proposed the formation of task forces to fast-track pending proposals and projects.
Ehsan Malik, CEO of the Pakistan Business Council, said the PBC is tasked with advocating for business advancement on a national level. While not sector-specific, the maritime ministry’s cross-sectoral relevance makes it an ideal area for strategic collaboration with the PBC.
Representatives from the PBC also highlighted challenges in the cement industry. The meeting included several notable cement exporters, along with officials from the Karachi Port Trust and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.
The PBC called on the minister to approve a coordinated framework involving the maritime ministry, Karachi Port authorities, and export representatives from various sectors. They urged the government to accelerate the development of a practical and structured mechanism to improve both the ease and cost of doing business -- supported by financial and policy-based assistance from the federal government.
The PBC commended the federal government and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs for their responsiveness and proactive approach in supporting PBC stakeholders and businesses more broadly.Chaudhry welcomed the proposals and encouraged the PBC to formalise a working agreement with the ministry to operationalise the suggestions discussed during the meeting.

"OICCI, petroleum minister discuss energy reforms, investment opportunities",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316904-oicci-petroleum-minister-discuss-energy-reforms-investment-opportunities,"KARACHI: The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) on Friday held a detailed interactive session with Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik to discuss Pakistan’s energy priorities and the path to long-term economic stability.
According to a statement, the minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to structural reforms, faster policy implementation and greater industry engagement. He cited the recent resolution of challenges in the refinery sector as a positive example of collaborative progress.
Malik outlined key investment opportunities in upstream exploration, pipeline development and downstream processing, in line with the global shift towards cleaner energy. He also highlighted recent foreign direct investment (FDI) successes in the mining sector, aimed at unlocking Pakistan’s untapped natural resources and boosting future exports and industrial diversification.
President of OICCI and CEO of Faysal Bank Yousaf Hussain stressed the importance of policy consistency, technocratic execution, and a collaborative roadmap to ensure deep-rooted economic stability and sustainable growth.
He emphasised that closer engagement between the government, OICCI, and broader industry -- in both policy design and implementation -- would be critical to achieving tangible results and reinforcing investor confidence.

"UK, Sindh officials discuss climate action, coastal challenges",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316905-uk-sindh-officials-discuss-climate-action-coastal-challenges,"KARACHI: Secretary of Environment, Climate Change and Coastal Development Sindh Agha Shahnawaz Khan met with a delegation from the British High Commission to discuss climate change impacts, coastal vulnerabilities and disaster preparedness in Sindh.
The delegation included Second Secretary Noam Rosenbaum and Head of the Humanitarian Aid Team Namra Zaheer. Director-General of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) Waqar Hussain Phulpoto was also present.
Khan highlighted that Sindh is increasingly exposed to natural disasters such as floods and cyclones, yet preventive strategies like early warning systems and disaster preparedness often lack focus. He stressed the need for area-specific planning in vulnerable districts including Karachi, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal and Tharparkar.
He also mentioned two major climate-related projects proposed in 2016 that were stalled due to the 2022 floods and funding constraints. However, progress is underway with the establishment of a carbon registry directorate and plans to engage private sector experts to align with international environmental standards.
Phulpoto noted that Sindh is the only province with a formal fisheries policy and highlighted advancements in solar and wind energy, supported by Chinese partnerships. He described Sindh as environmentally diverse and vulnerable, with extreme temperatures and varied landscapes.
Khan shared that a climate change working group has been set up under his leadership to coordinate interdepartmental data collection and introduce modern systems for community resilience and environmental awareness.
The British High Commission delegation commended the Sindh government for its proactive climate efforts and reaffirmed continued support in climate financing, early warning systems and policy development. They praised Sindh’s cooperation and commitment to addressing environmental challenges despite limited resources.

"PCDMA chief warns of EFS misuse, urges swift government action",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316906-pcdma-chief-warns-of-efs-misuse-urges-swift-government-action,"KARACHI: Chairman of the Pakistan Chemicals and Dyes Merchants Association (PCDMA) Salim Valimuhammad has raised serious concerns over the widespread misuse of the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS), warning that existing loopholes could lead to the collapse of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and result in significant revenue losses for the national exchequer.
In a statement issued on Friday, the PCDMA chairman called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chairperson of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to take immediate corrective measures.
He emphasised that raw materials imported duty-free under the scheme were being illegally diverted to the domestic market instead of being utilised for their intended export-oriented industrial purposes.
Valimuhammad explained that the EFS was designed to allow export-oriented industries to import raw materials without sales tax, enabling the production of value-added goods for export. However, he noted that the scheme is being systematically abused. “The current auditing process is inadequate. Why can’t we verify these transactions in real time?” he questioned.
He proposed a series of measures to curb misuse of the scheme, including linking raw material imports to verified export letters of credit (LCs) and establishing fixed percentage limits for duty-free imports. He warned that goods with high tariff and tax escalation rates are particularly vulnerable to exploitation under the EFS. To prevent further revenue leakage, he recommended a downward revision of the duty structure, cautioning that inaction would only exacerbate illicit trade.
“The ongoing abuse of the EFS is creating a dual crisis -- it is not only draining government revenues but also distorting the industrial ecosystem,” Valimuhammad said. “If immediate corrective actions are not taken, the scheme should be abolished altogether, as it is threatening legitimate businesses while failing to fulfil its intended objectives.”
“With proper regulation, the EFS could serve as an excellent tool for boosting exports. However, in its current flawed form, it is doing more harm than good to the national economy,” he added.

Microcredit alone cannot end poverty,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316907-microcredit-alone-cannot-end-poverty,"LAHORE: Addressing poverty through microcredit alone will not yield the desired results unless poor communities are mobilised to address the underlying factors that perpetuate deprivation.
Providing small microfinance loans may partially alleviate hunger-related poverty but will have little impact on other dimensions of human suffering associated with the condition. Amid persistently high prices, even income generated through microfinance is often insufficient to bridge the resource gap created by food inflation.
Planners must allocate more resources to skills training in order to enhance income-generating potential among the poor. Poverty is a socio-economic curse that deprives individuals of food, shelter, education, healthcare, sanitation, clean drinking water and dignity. Food is not the only need; health issues, which require ongoing treatment, are often a greater burden for the poor.
Philanthropists have attempted to help by providing regular dialysis for kidney patients, but demand far exceeds capacity, and free dialysis facilities remain limited. The government lacks the resources to fully support expensive treatments such as dialysis, open-heart surgery and cancer care, which remain out of reach for most impoverished families.
Microfinance penetration in Pakistan is significantly lower than in Bangladesh or India, and is largely concentrated in major cities. The recent peak in food inflation has eroded the capacity of many microcredit recipients to service their loans. While inflation has since eased, food prices continue to rise, albeit more slowly.
Planners must recognise that poverty reduction strategies should enable people to live without shame. Emphasis must be placed on dignity, respect, and freedom from humiliation. The poor require empowerment that gives them the ability to pursue goals they value and have reason to value.
A comprehensive approach should ensure physical safety -- both protection of person and property -- and address the perception of insecurity, which disproportionately affects the poor.“Microfinance is the most widely recommended poverty alleviation tool in Pakistan. But microcredit is more effective in urban centres or in rural areas where basic civic amenities exist,” he said. “The ability of the poor to earn a decent living is severely constrained in localities lacking essentials such as proper sanitation, clean drinking water and passable streets. Many rural areas continue to face these challenges, making it nearly impossible to establish health and education facilities in such environments.”
The Benazir Income Support Programme may provide temporary relief -- perhaps a week’s worth of food -- but does not address the family’s needs for the remainder of the month. What people need are jobs -- yet employment opportunities in the country are diminishing.There is an urgent need to create jobs in low-investment, high-employment sectors such as the apparel industry.

Fair taxation urged for ride-hailing sector in Budget FY26,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316910-fair-taxation-urged-for-ride-hailing-sector-in-budget-fy26,"KARACHI: Calls are growing for the government to introduce a fair and progressive taxation framework for the ride-hailing sector in the upcoming fiscal budget. Amid the country’s growing urban population, a lack of adequate public transport, rising fuel costs, traffic congestion and parking challenges, ride-hailing services have seen substantial growth in recent years.
Despite this progress, industry experts argue that the current uniform service tax is hindering further expansion. “It’s concerning that platforms charging drivers commissions as low as 10 per cent are subjected to the same service tax rates as those taking up to 25 per cent,” said Head of Public Policy and Regulatory Affairs for inDrive in the Asia-Pacific region Anton Ambrose.Ambrose proposed a tiered taxation model in the upcoming budget. “Platforms that charge less than 11 per cent commission should be completely exempt from service tax,” he recommended. “Those with commission rates between 11 per cent and 15 per cent could be taxed at 5.0 per cent, while platforms exceeding 15 per cent commission should fall into the 15 per cent or higher tax bracket.”
He emphasised that this structure would promote fairness for drivers and affordability for users. “Such revisions will not only make things fairer for drivers but will also lower costs for passengers, particularly low-income groups, ultimately driving up demand,” he explained. “That increased demand could, in turn, result in higher tax revenues for the government.”
Ambrose also urged the government to exempt ride-hailing services from general sales tax (GST), arguing they are essential rather than luxury services. “In a country like Pakistan, where public transport is limited and concerns around safety and convenience are widespread, ride-hailing has become a necessity, not a privilege,” he added.

"Rooted in the earth, India’s traditional mud wrestling thrives",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316927-rooted-in-the-earth-india-s-traditional-mud-wrestling-thrives,"KOLHAPUR, India: Crowds cheer as muscular men in tight loincloths slap sacred scented soil on their bulging thighs and arms for a mud wrestling bout in India.
“When we fight, we sweat,” said 33-year-old Mauli Jamdade, a wrestling star in Maharashtra state, rubbing red-brown earth onto his body for each clash. “The mud gives us grip and helps us grapple better.”
Unlike conventional wrestling matches played on mats with regulated draws, India´s mud wrestling is more raw -- but has been the training ground for Olympic success. This style of wrestling, known as “kushti” or “dangal”, has millennia-old roots but emerged during the period of India´s Mughal rulers in the 16th century, blending traditional hand-to-hand combat with Persian martial arts. There are no blows or kicking, but plenty of throws to the ground, and it remains hugely popular.
It took Jamdade over 15 minutes to defeat his rival, starting with a slow circling dance then twisting, turning and locking arms, before he pinned him down. The bout ends when one wrestler pins his opponent´s back to the mud, irrespective of how long it takes.
Both men and women Indian wrestlers have won medals at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games in the more regulated form of the sport. But it is the mud, not mat, version that is popular in swathes of rural areas -- with supporters saying it is not just a spectacle but a tradition that many want to uphold.
Bank cashier Anil Harale ended his wrestling career after injuring his leg, but after work still slips out of his office clothes for a dirty wrestle. “I miss it,” said the 46-year-old, who hopes his “unfulfilled dream” will be realised by his teenage son, an aspiring wrestler.
Wrestler KD Jadhav, who took bronze at the 1952 Olympics -- the first Indian to win an individual Olympic medal -- began his sporting career as a mud wrestler in Kolhapur, a city in Maharashtra.
“It is from mud that wrestlers reach the Olympics,” said excited fan Sachin Mote, among hundreds cheering the wrestlers at a bout. Kolhapur is a core base of the sport with its centuries-old residential gymnasiums known as talims.
Jamdade joined the Gangavesh talim aged 14. A picture of the Hindu monkey god Hanuman -- a deity worshipped by wrestlers for his strength and devotion -- gazes over waist-deep pits where the soil is dug.
The earth is mixed with turmeric, yoghurt and milk, as well as neem tree leaves and oil, before it is ploughed and smoothened across the ring. For the wrestlers, the soil is sacred. “It is everything,” said Jamdade. “There is nothing without it.”
More than a hundred wrestlers -- some as young as 10 -- train at the talim. It is an austere life. The rigorous training includes waking up before dawn, running, hundreds of push-ups, rope climbing and grappling.

Milan turn to old boy Allegri as managerial musical chairs begins,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316928-milan-turn-to-old-boy-allegri-as-managerial-musical-chairs-begins,"MILAN: Massimiliano Allegri returned to AC Milan on Friday as the ailing seven-time European champions try once again to rebuild following an awful season, on a busy day for managerial moves in Serie A. Milan have turned to serial winner Allegri in their hour of need following the expected sacking of Sergio Conceicao, who leaves the San Siro club after five miserable months in charge.
Milan did not reveal details of the deal but Italian media widely report that Allegri has signed a two-year contract worth five million euros a season, with the option to extend for a further two years. Allegri has become the fourth coach in a year for Milan, who finished this past Serie A season in eighth place and missed out on European football for next term.
The 57-year-old led Milan to the 2011 Scudetto in his first stint in charge, between 2010 and 2014, and he was their coach for one of the most infamous episodes in recent Serie A history. Milan were beating Juventus, rivals for the 2012 league title, 1-0 in February that year when a Sulley Muntari goal was not given despite the ball clearly crossing the line.
Juve went on to draw that game 1-1 and then win their first title in nine years -- finishing the campaign unbeaten -- and two years later hired Allegri who then won Serie A five more times in his two spells with the Turin giants.
Allegri had been on hiatus since being sacked by Juve in May last year, his final act there being a post-match rampage after winning the Italian Cup in which he railed at officials and sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli.
Conceicao, a former Inter Milan and Lazio player, was hired in late December in place of his countryman Paulo Fonseca on a contract until next year. The 50-year-old began in positive fashion at Milan by winning the Italian Super Cup in January, but he failed to claim a Champions League spot for a talented but inconsistent team that also lost the Italian Cup final to Bologna earlier this month.
Conceciao, 50, won 16 of 31 games in charge at Milan, including 11 victories, seven losses and three draws in the league and also had to deal with vociferous protests from supporters against the club´s American owners RedBird.
Fans demonstrated in large numbers outside Milan´s headquarters ahead of their team´s final match of the season, a dead-rubber against relegated Monza last weekend. That protest was a culmination of months of visible anger from supporters who have watched Milan slide down the league after Stefano Pioli took them to second place in 2023/24.
For months matches have been punctuated by loud calls for owner Gerry Cardinale, the founder of investment fund RedBird, to sell the club as fans watched Inter battle for the Serie A title and arrive at this weekend´s Champions League final.
Also looking for a new coach are Roma after Claudio Ranieri retired for the second time in the space of a year, with Gian Piero Gasperini reported to be the capital club´s prime target. Meanwhile even Simone Inzaghi had to play down reports of a mega-money move to Al-Hilal in Saudi Arabia, rumours which arrived out of the blue ahead of Inter Milan´s Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain.

Returning Hazlewood ‘in good place’ ahead of critical fortnight,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316929-returning-hazlewood-in-good-place-ahead-of-critical-fortnight,"CHANDIGARH: Australia´s Josh Hazlewood said it was perfect preparation for the World Test Championship final after delivering a match-winning performance on his return to the IPL.
The fast bowler finished with figures of 3-21 as Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed their place in the IPL decider with an eight-wicket thrashing of Punjab Kings on Thursday. The 34-year-old only recently rejoined Bengaluru after returning home due to a shoulder injury and following the stoppage in the league caused by the conflict between India and Pakistan.
He struck two key blows at Mullanpur including skipper Shreyas Iyer for two as Bengaluru bundled out Punjab for 101. Hazlewood wrapped up the Punjab batting with his third strike in 14.1 overs.
With the WTC final at Lord´s between Australia and South Africa starting on June 11, it was a perfect reminder of his prowess. “I´ve got to be bowling. You know, wherever I am in the world I´ve got to be bowling, getting ready for that game anyway,” Hazlewood said.
“There´s no better place than I think out in the middle. Obviously you´ve got to bowl more hours of training from time to time to build up for a Test, but to get that intensity right up, there´s no better place than the IPL.”
He added: “I don´t bowl too much differently in Test match cricket than tonight, so it´s still that hard length, so I feel in a good place.” The restart of the IPL after a week-long stoppage and its revised schedule put it on a collision course with the international calendar.
Some foreign stars including Australia´s Mitchell Starc did not return. Others are missing from the playoffs, including Gujarat Titans´ Jos Buttler, because of commitments with their countries.

"Visiting Sabrina all praise for Pak citizens, hospitality",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316931-visiting-sabrina-all-praise-for-pak-citizens-hospitality,"ISLAMABAD: Former World Judo medalist and European champion Sabrina Filzmose termed Pakistan as the nicest country in the world where every citizen always gets ready to help you no matter how busy they are.
Sabrina, who is in the capital on her second trip to Pakistan in a two years’ time, said that all these years her effort had been to let the world know that the country has a lot to offer to visitors from foreign countries.
Unlike her 2023 cycle trip to Pakistan where she rode to K-2 Base Camp from Islamabad, this year she started her journey from Sea View Karachi and has reached Islamabad the other day. She would be on her way to K-2 Enroute Babu Sar Pass starting today (Saturday). “I would be riding through new route and confront more challenges and to enjoy different beauty this time.”
Sabrina rode through Hyderabad, Sukkur, RYK, Multan, Sahiwal, Lahore, and Jhelum reaching Islamabad on 29th May. Throughout her route, she received a warm welcome from local Judo clubs and national sports bodies across Sindh and Punjab. Notably, she completed an inspiring 330 km leg from Hyderabad to Sukkur in a single day under extreme temperatures exceeding 50°C, exemplifying resilience,  When she was here in 2023, Sabrina stressed on the Pakistan women to take up judo as a sport.
“I am happy to see a girl (Malika) from Lakki Marwat taking up an international trip. It is just a start and I am hopeful that more girls will follow judo. My mission is judo for peace,” Sabrina said.
Accompanied by Pakistan Judo Federation President Col (r) Junaid Alam during press talk Friday, the former Olympian judokas said she would feel happy to help Pakistan’s young athletes make a name for themselves and for the country in the game.
“It is just a matter of starting your efforts to attain perfection in martial arts. You need hard work and consistency and required coaching to become a world-level athlete. I would suggest Pakistan women, youth to make the best of their talent and opportunities coming their way.”
Sabrina was a 2005 and 2010 World bronze medalist, and 2008 and 2011 European Champion in her weight category. She is the winner of the Super World Cup Tournoi de Paris 2006 and 2008 and winner of the Grand Slam in Paris twice. Bronze medalist at the Grand Prix in Cancun in 2017. In 2019 she took bronze at the Grand Prix in Budapest and participated in Tokyo 2020, her fourth Olympics.
Earlier Friday morning, Sabrina met Secretary IPC Mohyuddin Wani who offered every assistance for judo and even promised to help extend national judo coach tenure. The European champion has also established the world’s highest Judo Club named Everest Club in Nepal which was supported by the International Judo Federation.
“Pakistan Judo Federation is grateful that Sabrina chose our beautiful country for this peace mission. She has consented to hold talent hunt and training sessions before the expedition, during the expedition as well after the expedition,” the PJF president said.

‘Hasan Ali’s situation is very frustrating’: Warwickshire CEO Stuart Cain,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316932-hasan-ali-s-situation-is-very-frustrating-warwickshire-ceo-stuart-cain,"BIRMINGHAM: Hasan Ali’s surprise inclusion in Pakistan’s squad for the upcoming T20I series against Bangladesh has left Warwickshire County Cricket Club (CCC) frustrated.
The fast bowler was expected to return to Warwickshire at the end of this month, just in time for the T20 Blast campaign. Hasan’s outstanding performance in the recently concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) season for Karachi Kings earned him a spot in Pakistan’s T20 squad for the three-match series against Bangladesh.
This development means he will miss the opening matches of Warwickshire’s T20 Blast season. Consequently, Hasan will now join Warwickshire’s T20 squad only before June 8, and his availability for the season will be limited compared to earlier expectations.
Expressing his disappointment, Warwickshire CCC Chief Executive Stuart Cain said, “The Hasan Ali’s situation is very frustrating. We believed we had assurances he would not be involved with the Pakistan side this summer. But a change of management at the PCB has meant he’s been given a central contract and won’t be able to support us throughout the season as expected.”
Cain also highlighted the financial incentives offered by T20 leagues worldwide and extended international commitments as key challenges in securing quality international players for the entire county season.
“It’s very hard to find players that will both improve the squad and be available for the majority of the summer. In years gone by, it was much easier to get quality overseas players for an entire season, and for season after season,” he said.
The 30-year-old pacer was one of the standout performers in the latest PSL edition, taking 17 wickets in 10 matches for Karachi Kings. In a recent interview with Geo News, Warwickshire Head Coach Ian Westwood expressed hope that Hasan’s excellent form with the ball would continue into the Blast season.
“He’s a bear, he loves it here, and he’s a quality performer in all formats. He did well in the Championship previously, and we know his quality in T20s, both with the new ball and at the death and we’re looking forward to him joining us again,” Ian said.
Hasan was first signed by Warwickshire in 2023, making an immediate impact by taking 24 wickets in the County Championship’s first half. Though he was injured just before the start of the T20 Blast, he recovered in time to play a few matches before his contract ended.
In 2024, Hasan returned to Edgbaston but was quickly recalled to Pakistan’s white-ball squad for the series against England after only a couple of Blast games. Despite taking 10 wickets in five T20 Blast matches, an elbow injury ruled him out for the rest of the season.
Like the previous two seasons, Hasan’s availability has been hampered by injuries and international commitments, a situation that has left Westwood disappointed. “Last year was really frustrating. He arrived, then had to go to a camp, and ended up carrying drinks in Ireland. By the time he came back, he got injured,” Westwood recalled.
It is also understood that Hasan will miss Warwickshire’s County Championship match against Somerset at Edgbaston starting June 22, as well as the following week’s fixture against Sussex.
However, he is expected to return for five Blast games between July 4 and 13 before linking up with Pakistan for the T20I and ODI series against the West Indies, scheduled in the USA and Caribbean from July 31 to August 12.
Meanwhile, Warwickshire CCC is awaiting confirmation from the PCB regarding Hasan Ali’s availability for the Blast quarter-finals and Finals Day, should the Bears progress to the knockout stages.

Imad Wasim opens up on Mike Hesson’s appointment as Pakistan head coach,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316933-imad-wasim-opens-up-on-mike-hesson-s-appointment-as-pakistan-head-coach,"KARACHI: Former all-rounder Imad Wasim has welcomed the appointment of Mike Hesson as Pakistan’s new head coach, describing it as a positive step for the team.
He expressed optimism that the New Zealander’s arrival will bring much-needed consistency and stability to Pakistan’s white-ball cricket. Speaking during a recent interview on a local sports platform, Imad highlighted his hope that Hesson’s tenure will lead to a significant improvement in Pakistan’s approach to limited-overs cricket.
However, he also stressed the importance of having a clear strategy to succeed in the modern game.
“There is a difference between reckless, stupidity and fearlessness. There is fine line among these and you cannot cross it. You cannot go crazy, even England has a criterion on how they go about especially with T20 Cricket,” Imad said.
“Mike Hesson understands the game really well. I have spoken to him about cricket and he looks to be a very good coach and let’s see what happens,” he added. The 36-year-old believes Hesson’s biggest challenge will be managing the internal drama often associated with Pakistan cricket.
“I still believe that if you give them time like four to six months or three four series then it could work. I want to see Pakistan playing good cricket and we will see how it goes,” he concluded.
It is pertinent to mention that Pakistan has started well under Hesson’s leadership in the ongoing three-match T20I series, winning the opening game by 37 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Wednesday.

Aminul Islam replaces Faruque Ahmed as BCB president,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316934-aminul-islam-replaces-faruque-ahmed-as-bcb-president,"DHAKA: Former Bangladesh captain Aminul Islam has been appointed the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president, succeeding Faruque Ahmed, who was removed from the position, Bangladeshi media reported on Friday.
According to media reports, Islam’s appointment was agreed upon during the board’s emergency meeting, held at its headquarters here. The meeting also saw board directors Nazmul Abedeen Fahim and Fahim Sinha becoming vice presidents.
Reports further suggested that the National Sports Council (NSC) had also nominated Aminul Islam as a Councillor Thursday night, paving the way for his appointment as the BCB president.
The leadership change comes after the NSC terminated Faruque Ahmed’s membership, effectively ending his tenure as BCB president. The decision followed a no-confidence letter signed by eight of the nine BCB directors earlier in the day. Despite the mounting pressure, Faruque initially resisted calls to step down. “I’m not thinking about stepping down for the time being. Nobody has given me a valid reason to do so,” Faruque said.
“Why should I leave when others continue in their positions? First, I need to know the actual reason. Second, I didn’t take this role on my own, I was selected. Since I was brought here, I deserve to know what my crime is and why I should resign,” he added.
Later in the evening, the Ministry of Youth and Sports officially confirmed the withdrawal of Faruque’s nomination as the NSC’s representative on the BCB board. The ministry cited the no-confidence letter and the findings of a fact-finding committee investigating issues related to the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL).
“In light of the no-confidence letter sent by eight BCB directors against Faruque Ahmed, and the report presented by the fact-finding committee about the BPL, his nomination as the representative of the National Sports Council (sports ministry) has been cancelled,” the statement from Bangladesh’s sports ministry said.

PSL 10 leading run-scorer Farhan replaces Fakhar in Pakistan lineup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316935-psl-10-leading-run-scorer-farhan-replaces-fakhar-in-pakistan-lineup,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s experienced left-handed opener Fakhar Zaman was left out of their lineup for the ongoing second T20I of the three-match series here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday.
Fakhar, who opened the innings for the hosts alongside fellow left-handed opener Saim Ayub in the series opener, could only score one in Pakistan’s 37-run victory.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old was not named in Pakistan’s playing XI and was replaced by Sahibzada Farhan, whose exclusion from the preceding fixture triggered an outburst on social media as he was the leading run-scorer of the recently concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha, at the toss, explained that Fakhar Zaman’s absence was due to him being not 100 per cent as he has a niggle. Agha further stated that the hosts wanted to put the opposition under pressure by piling runs on the board and thus chose to bat first in the second T20I as well. “We want to post a good total and then put the opposition under pressure.”

"Arshad, Yasir qualify for final round",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316936-arshad-yasir-qualify-for-final-round,"ISLAMABAD: Arshad Nadeem dominated the qualifying round of the javelin throw event in the Asian Athletics Championship Friday at Gumi Stadium in Korea.
The Olympic record-holder threw the javelin to a distance of 86.34 meters to take pole position. He was followed by Sri Lankan Rumesh Tharanga with the throw of 83.71 meters. Indian Neeraj Chopra failed to turn up for the Asian Championship. Two other Indians and Pakistan’s Mohammad Yasir also qualified for the final round to be held today (Saturday) afternoon. Yasir threw the javelin to 76.07 meters for ninth position. A total of 12 athletes qualified for the final round to be held on Saturday.

Shahid’s four-wicket haul puts Sahir Associates in command,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316938-shahid-s-four-wicket-haul-puts-sahir-associates-in-command,"LAHORE:  A brilliant four-wicket haul by Shahid Ali helped Sahir Associates take a commanding lead in the President’s Trophy Grade-II final against MIT Solutions at Abbottabad Cricket Stadium. At stumps on Day 2, Sahir Associates stood at 52/0 in seven overs, extending their lead to 189 runs.
The day’s proceedings saw only 49 overs bowled due to a delayed start caused by rain, with MIT Solutions resuming their first innings at 46/1. However, they struggled against Sahir Associates’ pace attack, getting dismissed for 135 in 41.5 overs.
M Tayyab was MIT Solutions’ top scorer with 36 not out, while Zain Ishaq (26) and Muhammad Bilal (21) provided brief resistance. Shahid Ali with 4-60 in 12.5 overs dismantled MIT Solutions’ middle order while Mohsin Khan, M Bilawal and Khan Zeb got two wickets apiece, ensuring total control. With a healthy lead, Sahir Associates will aim to solidify their dominance on Saturday, while MIT Solutions must strike back quickly to stay in contention.

Litton Das achieves major milestone in T20I cricket,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316940-litton-das-achieves-major-milestone-in-t20i-cricket,"LAHORE: Bangladesh captain Litton Das reached a significant milestone in T20 International cricket during the second T20I against Pakistan at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday.
Das became only the fourth Bangladeshi cricketer to feature in 100 T20I matches, joining the elite company of Shakib Al Hasan, Mahmudullah and Mushfiqur Rahim. Among them, veteran all-rounder Mahmudullah holds the record for the most T20I appearances for Bangladesh, with 141 matches.
Most appearances for Bangladesh players in T20I cricket: Mahmadullah Riyad 141 matches; Shakib Al Hasan 129 matches; Mushfiqur Rahim 102 matches; Litton Das 100* matches. In addition to this achievement, Litton Das also continues to shine with the bat. The right-handed wicketkeeper-batter is currently Bangladesh’s third-highest run-scorer in T20Is, having amassed 2,133 runs.
He trails Mahmudullah by 311 runs and Shakib by 418 runs on the list of Bangladesh’s all-time leading T20I run-scorers. The ongoing series marks Das’ second assignment as Bangladesh’s T20I captain. His first stint came during the recently concluded three-match series against the UAE, which Bangladesh lost 2-1.

"UK’s muddy saltmarshes vital carbon ‘sink’, say researchers",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317019-uk-s-muddy-saltmarshes-vital-carbon-sink-say-researchers,"LONDON: Muddy saltmarshes are major stores of greenhouse gases and should be protected to help Britain in the battle against climate change, a new report said on Friday.
“Mud matters,” said Tom Brook, ocean conservation specialist at WWF which produced the report. “Saltmarshes are powerful natural allies in the fight against climate change -- storing carbon, protecting our coasts and supporting rich biodiversity,” he added.
Saltmarshes occur where the land meets the sea, and help absorb wave energy and the impact of storms, acting as natural flood barriers. They also “are highly efficient at capturing and storing carbon, playing a vital role in mitigating climate change,” the report said.
Britain has lost some 85 percent of its saltmarshes since 1860, much of it being drained to convert into farmland, or degraded by pollution and rising sea levels. The remaining 45,000 hectares play a key role in protecting coastal areas.
They also provide habitats for migratory birds in estuaries such as around the Thames in the southern UK, as well as the Severn which flows through England and Wales, the northeastern Humber and the western Solway Firth.

Musk says to remain ‘friend and adviser’ to Trump,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317020-musk-says-to-remain-friend-and-adviser-to-trump,"WASHINGTON: Billionaire Elon Musk said on Friday he would remain a “friend and adviser” to Donald Trump, as the US president hosted an Oval Office farewell for the man who led his turbulent cost-cutting drive.
“I look forward to continuing to be a friend and adviser to the president,” Musk told reporters after Trump handed a golden key as a gift to the departing leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Musk, clad in a black T-shirt and jacket and wearing a baseball cap as he stood next to the seated Trump, said he would keep supporting the team that is “relentlessly pursuing a trillion dollars in waste” in reductions that will “benefit the American taxpayer.”

"SC allows Trump to revoke legal status for 500,000 migrants",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317021-sc-allows-trump-to-revoke-legal-status-for-500-000-migrants,"WASHINGTON: The US Supreme Court on Friday gave the Trump administration the green light to revoke -- for now -- the legal status of hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
The decision puts some 532,000 people who came to the United States under a “parole” program launched by former president Joe Biden at risk of deportation. The parole programme allowed entry into the United States for two years for up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries, which have grim human rights records.
But as President Donald Trump takes a hard line on immigration, his administration has moved to overturn those protections in legal battles that reached all the way to the Supreme Court earlier this month. The government had asked the Supreme Court to lift a lower court order barring them from ending the humanitarian protections.
The conservative-dominated court -- whose order was unsigned and provided no reasoning -- granted the administration a stay on that order, while legal battles continue. Justices Ketanji Brown Jackon and Sonia Sotomayor dissented, warning of the “devastating consequences” of upending the “lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending,” according to the document.
“The Court has plainly botched this assessment today,” they wrote. The migrants “now face two unbearable options. On the one hand, they could elect to leave the United States and, thereby, confront ´dangers in their native countries,´ experience destructive ´family separation,´” and possibly forfeit any chance of remedy based on their claims, they wrote.
“On the other, they could remain in the United States ... and risk imminent removal at the hands of Government agents, along with its serious attendant consequences.” Lower courts which barred the administration from revoking the migrants´ status had argued that it was acting on a flawed interpretation of immigration law.
Trump campaigned for the White House on a pledge to deport millions of undocumented migrants. Among other measures, he invoked an obscure wartime law to fly hundreds of alleged Venezuelan gang members to a prison in El Salvador.

"Riyadh urged rapid progress on US-Iran nuclear talks, sources say",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317022-riyadh-urged-rapid-progress-on-us-iran-nuclear-talks-sources-say,"DUBAI: Saudi Arabia’s defence minister delivered a blunt message to Iranian officials in Tehran last month: take President Donald Trump’s offer to negotiate a nuclear agreement seriously because it presents a way to avoid the risk of war.
Alarmed at the prospect of further instability in the region, Saudi Arabia’s 89-year-old King Salman bin Abdulaziz dispatched his son, Prince Khalid bin Salman, with the warning destined for Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to two Gulf sources close to government circles and two Iranian officials.
Present at the closed-door meeting in Tehran, which took place on April 17 in the presidential compound, were Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, armed forces Chief of Staff Mohammad Bagheri and Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, the sources said.
While media covered the 37-year-old prince’s visit, the content of the King Salman’s covert message has not been previously reported.Prince Khalid, who was Saudi ambassador to Washington during Trump’s first term, warned Iranian officials that the US leader has little patience for drawn-out negotiations, according to the four sources.
Trump had unexpectedly announced just over a week earlier that direct talks were taking place with Tehran, aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

Russia tells UN West must stop arming Ukraine during any ceasefire,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317023-russia-tells-un-west-must-stop-arming-ukraine-during-any-ceasefire,"UNITED NATIONS: Russia is prepared to consider a ceasefire in Ukraine to pave the way for a lasting settlement, but during any truce Moscow wants Western states to stop arming Kyiv and for Ukraine to stop mobilising troops, Russia’s UN ambassador said on Friday.
However, Vassily Nebenzia told the UN Security Council that a simple ceasefire was not enough to end Moscow’s more than three-year war in Ukraine. “To achieve a sustainable and lasting settlement of the Ukrainian crisis, we need to address its root causes,” Nebenzia said. “What we’re proposing is a second round of talks in Istanbul this coming on Monday ... where we can exchange memoranda about both parties’ approaches to the negotiations process.”
The United States wants Russia to agree to a comprehensive 30-day land, air, sea and critical infrastructure ceasefire. A first round of direct talks between Russia and Ukraine on May 16 failed to yield a truce deal.
A US diplomat told the Security Council on Friday: “We share the concern expressed by other members of this council that Russia could be uninterested in peace and instead bent on achieving a military victory.”
Moscow initially said its combat mission was to “disarm” Ukraine so it could not be a threat to Russia, and “denazify” it by rooting out leaders it characterized as nationalists. Western countries believe Russia’s true initial aims were to defeat Ukraine’s military and overthrow its pro-Western government.

Half world faced an extra month of extreme heat due to climate change,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317024-half-world-faced-an-extra-month-of-extreme-heat-due-to-climate-change,"WASHINGTON: Half the global population endured an additional month of extreme heat over the past year because of manmade climate change, a new study found Friday.
The findings underscore how the continued burning of fossil fuels is harming health and well-being on every continent, with the effects especially under-recognised in developing countries, the authors said.
“With every barrel of oil burned, every tonne of carbon dioxide released, and every fraction of a degree of warming, heat waves will affect more people,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and co-author of the report.
The analysis -- conducted by scientists at World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre -- was released ahead of global Heat Action Day on June 2, which this year spotlights the dangers of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. To assess the influence of global warming, researchers analyzed the period from May 1, 2024 to May 1, 2025.

"No permit, no Haj: S Arabia intensifies crackdown after heat deaths",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317025-no-permit-no-haj-s-arabia-intensifies-crackdown-after-heat-deaths,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia: Saudi Arabia is ramping up a crackdown on unregistered worshippers at next week´s Haj pilgrimage, a year after hundreds perished in scorching conditions.
Regular raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts are aimed at rooting out unauthorised visitors hoping to mingle among the crowds in and around the holy city of Makkah.
The simple message, “No Haj without a permit”, is being blared out in a relentless campaign promoted nationwide at shopping centres, on billboards and across media platforms. Last year, 1,301 pilgrims, most of them unregistered and lacking access to air-conditioned tents and buses, died as temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius (125.2 degrees Fahrenheit).
“Since the end of last season, we realised the biggest challenge is preventing unauthorised pilgrims from undermining the success of the Haj season,” said one official helping organise the Haj, requesting anonymity.
Saudi officials said 83 percent of those who died last year did not have official Haj permits. Temperatures of up to 44C (111F) are forecast next week. To seek out unregistered pilgrims, Saudi authorities have rolled out a new fleet of drones to monitor entrances into Mecca. Security forces have also raided hundreds of apartments in search of people hiding out in the area.
An Egyptian engineer living in Makkah, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said his building was raided multiple times in recent weeks. “Police officers in uniform came to my home twice and asked to see my and my wife´s residency permits,” he told AFP.
“Almost everywhere, we´re being asked to show residency or work permits in Makkah. The security presence is unprecedented.” The problem of illicit pilgrims has become acute since Saudi Arabia loosened visa restrictions in line with economic reforms, trying to attract more tourism and business.
Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have used family and tourist visas, instead of the designated Haj visa, to enter the country each year. Saudi Arabia is now trying to cut off the problem at source, restricting multiple-entry visas for citizens of several countries since January.
Family and tourist visas were also barred to nationals of more than 10 countries, including Egypt, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Jordan. Umar Karim, an expert on Saudi affairs at the University of Birmingham, said officials previously focused on “deterring people but not stopping them” from coming before Haj.
“Saudi authorities have seen that once these people are inside the kingdom, stopping them from physically entering Makkah is a difficult task even if a huge number of security officials are deployed,” he added.
For the past month, entry into Makkah has been restricted to individuals with work and residency permits. Many people in Makkah have been forced to send their wives and children, who lack the proper visas, out of the city.
Pilgrims coming for umrah -- similar rites that can be performed year-round -- have also been required to leave. Meanwhile, fines for an illicit Haj have doubled to 20,000 Saudi riyals ($5,333), with violators facing a 10-year ban from the country.
Those found to be harbouring and helping unauthorised pilgrims can be fined up to 100,000 riyals ($26,666). “All of this is aimed at ensuring that Mecca is reserved exclusively for authorised pilgrims during the Haj season,” the official added.
Residents of Makkah told AFP that the crowds there have noticeably thinned compared to previous years. However, officials said on Tuesday that more than a million pilgrims had already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the hajj.
Last year´s Haj deaths were a high-profile example of the havoc wrought by heat in 2024, which the Copernicus Climate Change Service said was the hottest year ever recorded.
While the pilgrimage, which follows a lunar calendar, will eventually shift to the cooler winter season, relief will be temporary. A 2019 study published by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change and the timing of the Haj, heat stress for pilgrims will exceed the “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052, and 2079 to 2086.

"Macron urges Asia, Europe to unite to resist ‘spheres of coercion’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317026-macron-urges-asia-europe-to-unite-to-resist-spheres-of-coercion,"SINGAPORE: French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday urged Europe and Asia to build a new alliance to hold off big powers seeking to build “spheres of coercion”, in a swipe at China and Russia.
Macron was speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, Asia´s major annual defence and security conference, as Russia defies diplomatic pressure for a ceasefire in Ukraine and capitals fret about Beijing´s growing assertiveness on Taiwan and the South China Sea.
Macron urged the international community to unite in the face of countries seeking to grab territory and resources. “We have a challenge of revisionist countries that want to impose -- under the name of spheres of influence -- spheres of coercion,” Macron said.
“Countries that want to control areas from the fringes of Europe to the archipelagos in the South China Sea... that want to appropriate resources, whether fishing or mineral and crowd out others for their benefit.”
Defence chiefs and officials from around the world are attending the annual forum that has in recent years become a barometer of US-China relations. US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth will address the conference on Saturday after President Donald Trump fired a fresh salvo in his tariff battle with Beijing, which has roiled global money markets. But unusually, China has not sent its defence minister to Shangri-La, and will instead be represented by a senior officer from its People´s Liberation Army´s National Defence University.
Since 2019 Beijing has regularly sent its defence minister to the Shangri-La meet, occasions that offered rare opportunities to hold face-to-face talks with US counterparts. Macron´s speech came at the end of a tour of Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, which he used to present France as a reliable alternative for a region caught between Washington and Beijing. Asian countries have found themselves torn between Washington´s tariff threats on one hand and Beijing, a major trading partner that has become increasingly forthright in territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have ramped up since Trump returned to office in January, off the back of an escalating trade standoff, intensified technological rivalry, and strategic military posturing. Macron urged leaders at the conference to “build a positive new alliance between Europe and Asia, based on our common norms, on our common principles”.
“Our shared responsibility is to ensure with others that our countries are not collateral victims of the imbalances linked to the choices made by the superpowers,” he said. Macron urged China to stop its ally North Korea from sending forces to help Russia´s war in Ukraine if Beijing “doesn´t want NATO being involved in Southeast Asia or in Asia”.
He warned Asian leaders against seeing the war in Ukraine as a distant problem with no relevance to them. “If we consider that Russia could be allowed to take a part of the territory of Ukraine without any restriction, without any constraint, without any reaction of the global order, how would you phrase what could happen in Taiwan?” he said.

"Russell Brand pleads not guilty to rape, sexual assault charges",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317027-russell-brand-pleads-not-guilty-to-rape-sexual-assault-charges,"LONDON: British comedian and actor Russell Brand pleaded not guilty on Friday at a London criminal court to five charges of sexual offences including rape and sexual assault.
The media personality turned anti-establishment influencer faces one count of rape, one of oral rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault between 1999 and 2005, involving four women.
Crowds were waiting as Brand, 49, arrived at Southwark Crown Court in an open-buttoned shirt and dark blazer for the plea hearing, after being granted conditional bail at a previous hearing.
He gained international recognition as the husband of pop star Katy Perry, but is better known in the UK for his hyper-sexualised and often lewd comedy routines and TV and radio appearances in the early 2000s.
Now living partly in the US, Brand appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court in central London earlier this month, where he showed no emotion as a prosecutor read out allegations against him.
On Friday Brand appeared in the dock flanked by two officers, where he stood stock-still and looked straight ahead as he delivered his pleas. He is now due to stand trial next year, on June 3, 2026. Prosecutors charged Brand following a police probe into allegations aired in a 2003 Channel 4 documentary.
He is accused of raping one woman in a hotel room following an event in the southern Bournemouth area in 1999. Another charge relates to the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in central London.

Belgium says 52 babies born from sperm donor with cancer-linked gene,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317028-belgium-says-52-babies-born-from-sperm-donor-with-cancer-linked-gene,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: A Danish sperm donor with a potentially cancer-causing gene fathered 52 children in Belgium between 2008 and 2017, the country´s health ministry revealed on Friday, in a case potentially involving several other children across Europe.
According to a recent investigation by The Guardian, at least 10 cases of cancer have been identified among the 67 children born from his donations between 2008 and 2017. The man was reportedly in good health with no known family history of cancer and had been tested in line with regulations in place at the time of the donations.
But he was later found to carry a mutation of the TP53 gene that causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare hereditary disorder that significantly increases cancer risks, including for breast cancer or leukaemia.
An alert was issued in 2023 after cancers were identified in some children conceived from his donations at a clinic in Denmark, and Belgium´s Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products was notified that year.
But Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke has said he learned about the case on Monday, and the government has declined to say how many Belgian cases involve confirmed cancer diagnoses. The scandal has exposed apparent breaches of Belgian law, which since 2007 has limited a single donor´s sperm to no more than six women.
“That rule was exceeded nationally and within individual centres,” the health ministry said. An internal review has identified 37 affected families in Belgium, leading to 52 births. Authorities noted that not all children necessarily reside in Belgium. The donor´s sperm was also reportedly used in at least nine other countries -- Bulgaria, Cyprus, Germany, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, Greece, the Netherlands and Poland.

Sri Lanka seizes largest cocaine haul at main airport,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317029-sri-lanka-seizes-largest-cocaine-haul-at-main-airport,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka´s customs authorities arrested on Friday a woman and seized the largest haul of cocaine ever detected at the country´s main international airport, an official said.
The unnamed 38-year-old Thai woman was carrying nearly 10 kilogrammes of cocaine stuffed into three soft toys, Customs Additional Director-General Seevali Arukgoda said. “This is the biggest attempt at cocaine smuggling stopped by Sri Lanka Customs at the airport,” Arukgoda said in a statement. Customs officials at Bandaranaike International Airport posed for photos with the cocaine, which had been neatly stuffed into just over 500 plastic capsules, with an estimated street value of $1.72 million.
The seizure follows three other hauls this month totalling nearly 60 kilogrammes of synthetic cannabis. Three foreign nationals -- from Britain, India, and Thailand -- were arrested in separate cases.

Turkiye frees 14 youths held over Erdogan insult,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317030-turkiye-frees-14-youths-held-over-erdogan-insult,"ISTANBUL: A Turkish court on Friday ordered the release of 14 youths jailed since March for allegedly insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during protests backing Istanbul´s imprisoned opposition mayor, according to the court decision seen by AFP.
All were arrested during demonstrations in support of Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, an opponent of Erdogan whose arrest on March 19 had sparked an unprecedented wave of protest in Turkiye since 2013.
The judiciary has not dropped the charges against the 14 youths, many of whom are under the age of 20. According to Turkiye´s main opposition party, more than 300 young people were placed in pre-trial detention during the wave of protests, many accused of participating in illegal gatherings.
The judiciary released most of them in April, taking into account, among other factors, that many of the defendants were students and that their imprisonment risked harming their studies.
Imamoglu, who has denied the corruption charges, was widely seen as the biggest political rival to Erdogan. His jailing is likely to prevent him from running in Turkiye´s 2028 presidential election.
