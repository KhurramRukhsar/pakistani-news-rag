Suspect who killed teen TikToker over ‘rejection’ held in Faisalabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318339-suspect-who-killed-teen-tiktoker-over-rejection-held-in-faisalabad,"ISLAMABAD: In a quick breakthrough, the police have arrested the suspected killer of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousuf within 20 hours of the tragic incident that sent shockwaves across the country.
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, announced the arrest during a press conference at Rescue 15 on Tuesday. He was joined by senior officials, including DIG Islamabad Muhammad Jawad Tariq, SSP (Investigations), SSP (Operations) and DSP CIA.
Islamabad IGP detailed the intensive investigation that followed brutal murder of the teenager in her house. Under the supervision of DIG, seven specialised teams were formed to lead the probe. These teams employed advanced techniques, combed through over 300 phone records, scrutinised social media activity and analysed surveillance footage from Safe City Islamabad and private security cameras.
The accused, identified as 22-year-old Umar Hayat, was apprehended from Faisalabad.
According to police, Umar, who is currently unemployed, had made persistent attempts to contact Sana. After repeated rejections, he allegedly carried out the fatal attack in a fit of rage.
Investigators recovered both the murder weapon and the victim’s mobile phone from his possession. It is believed he took the phone in an attempt to destroy evidence.
“The brutal murder of a young girl was not only tragic but posed a significant investigative challenge”, said IGP Rizvi. “Our teams worked tirelessly to ensure justice was served. The case sparked widespread concern, and we were under immense pressure to deliver results swiftly and effectively”, he told media. Rizvi emphasised police remain committed to delivering justice and will build a strong case backed by solid evidence to ensure the accused faces the full weight of the law.
The incident has ignited conversations on digital safety and the growing vulnerabilities faced by young influencers. Authorities have urged citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity.
Ali Nasir Rizvi said Umar Hayat is a matriculate and his father is a retired government employee of Grade-16. Umar is a resident of Faisalabad.
The Islamabad IG said Sana Yousaf’s murder is a tragic incident. “The brutal killing of any daughter is a challenge for the police”, he said. Islamabad police handled the case with a very professional approach, he added. On June 2, at 5pm. the accused shot the girl five times inside her house. Rizvi said 11 raids, including three in Islamabad, two in Faisalabad and one in Jaranwala, were conducted to arrest the accused. “Identifying and finding the accused was extremely important”, he remarked.
Meanwhile, according to initial investigations the victim and the suspect had been reportedly in contact over social media for nearly six months. Umar Hayat had traveled to Islamabad on May 29 -- Sana Yousaf’s birthday -- but failed to meet her after waiting for five hours. He then returned on June 2 and waited near her residence for over 14 hours before fatally shooting her after she declined to meet again.Police reports indicate that the suspect rented a Toyota Fortuner upon arriving in Islamabad and parked it in a street adjacent to the victim’s house. On the afternoon of June 2, Umar gained access to the home through an unlocked entrance -- reportedly left open by a downstairs tenant family. At the time, Sana’s mother was at the market, her father was away, and her younger brother was in Chitral. Only her aunt was home with her.
According to the aunt’s preliminary statement, she overheard Sana pleading with the intruder. However, the suspect fired two bullets into her chest, killing her on the spot. He then took the victim’s mobile phone, fled the house, rode a motorbike to where the rented vehicle was parked, and drove to Chungi No. 26 before boarding a bus to Faisalabad. He was eventually traced to his home in Jaranwala, where he was arrested.
AFP adds: Sana had more than 800,000 followers on TikTok, where she posted lip-sync videos, skincare tips, and promotional content for beauty products. The last video posted on her account was hours before her murder, in which she was seen cutting a cake for her birthday. Some comments under social media posts sharing the news of Sana’s murder suggested it was justified because of her social media career, in a society where honour codes restrict how women should behave. “You reap what you sow,” said one comment.
Women’s rights activist Nighat Dad such reactions embolden abusers to “silence women who dare to be visible”. “The vile comments under news of Sana´s murder aren´t just hateful noise, they´re part of a mindset that normalizes violence against women in Pakistan,” she posted online.

Imran to spearhead protest movement: Gohar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318340-imran-to-spearhead-protest-movement-gohar,"ISLAMABAD: PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan Tuesday announced that Imran Khan had been made the party’s patron-in-chief and he will spearhead the proposed countrywide protest movement.
Talking to the media outside the Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, he noted that Imran will be represented by the senior party leader Omar Ayub and Secretary General Salman Akram Raja during the proposed nationwide protest.
He pointed out that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur will focus on the governance issues in the province during the protest.
“I have been tasked with liaising with the diplomatic community as the party chairman. I will take the party’s cases to the High Court,” he maintained.
Gohar said the party founder had made it clear that all political and legal doors had been closed for him, so now there was no option left for them except launching a protest movement.
According to Gohar, Imran said he will lead the protest movement himself and give Omar Ayub the necessary instructions.
However, he contended that the PTI founder had not given any timeframe for the start of the protest at present, but clarified that he will be the party’s patron-in-chief from now on and will make all the party’s decisions.
Gohar said the protest movement leadership was not being entrusted to Ali Amin Gandapur. He strongly condemned what he alleged rigging in the Sambrial by-election.
Gohar clarified that he will continue to discharge his responsibilities as chairman, but the decision-making authority will rest with the PTI founder.

IMF being persuaded to drop demand for hike in duty on fertiliser,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318341-imf-being-persuaded-to-drop-demand-for-hike-in-duty-on-fertiliser,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s budget makers are heading towards convincing the IMF to drop demand for jacking up the Federal Excise Duty (FED) on fertiliser from 5 to 10 percent in the coming budget.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his economic team, led by Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, have played an important role in pursuing and convincing the IMF of this expected relief on the farm input.
If the IMF agrees in writing, then the FED on fertiliser will remain at the existing rate of 5 percent in the upcoming budget for 2025-26. The proposal of the imposition of a 5 percent FED on pesticides is also likely to be dropped in the next budget after the intervention made by the PM Office.
The Prime Minister also instructed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to evaluate the proposed tariff rationalisation plan at the import stage and come up with accurate calculations that how much it might increase the import bill.
The FBR had already expressed its apprehensions that the reduced import tariff might cause mis-declaration of goods to avoid other taxes, such as withholding taxes and GST at the import stage.
However, the IMF has so far refused to allow the tax exemption for erstwhile FATA/PATA, and General Sales Tax (GST) is going to be imposed in the coming budget. But the political pressures still continue for the continuation of tax exemption.
“We expect that the GST at a reduced rate might be imposed in FATA/PATA in the upcoming budget,” said the official and added that the GST rate of 12 percent might be slapped in the Finance Bill 2025-26.
It was really hard for the budget makers to convince the IMF on a point which was already agreed and incorporated in the last report, whereby the IMF clearly stated that the FED on fertiliser will be increased from 5 to 10 percent in the FY26 Budget. It was also agreed to impose 5 percent FED on pesticides.
PM Shehbaz and the economic team convinced the IMF that the Agriculture Income Tax (AIT) was amended by all four provinces, and its collection would kick-start from the next budget.
At this point, when the agriculture sector was facing difficulties owing to low growth, the imposition of AIT and increased tax rate on farm inputs such as fertiliser and pesticides simultaneously would definitely further aggravate the farm productivity and efficiency in the country.
It seems that the Pakistani side has been able to convince the IMF to avoid an increase in the FED on fertiliser and the imposition of a tax on pesticides. The IMF did not agree to the continuation of tax exemption for FATA/PATA anymore from the next budget. This proposal for the imposition of GST was dropped on the eve of the last budget in 2024-25 when one federal minister sternly opposed it in the federal cabinet meeting on the date of approval of the budget and announcement in Parliament, thus managing for exemption for another fiscal year. But now the IMF does not seem in the mood to grant any further extension for exemption in FATA/PATA.

From Adiala to Times Square: PTI frustrates all peace efforts with establishment,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318342-from-adiala-to-times-square-pti-frustrates-all-peace-efforts-with-establishment,"ISLAMABAD: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur is making fresh efforts to break the deadlock between Imran Khan and the establishment but have failed to yield any positive results as yet.
Despite engaging in discussions with an important figure regarding PTI’s role during recent Pak-India recent war, Gandapur though receive appreciation for the PTI for standing with Pakistan and its defence forces against India, neither assurances of political relief nor a softening of stance toward Imran Khan is secured.
Sources say that while Gandapur attempted to use PTI’s patriotic credentials during Pak-India war as a bridge, the move didn’t work due to persistent attacks against top military command from Imran Khan, party’s social media and its supporters abroad. The irony, insiders note, is so obvious. While certain PTI figures like Gandapur and overseas intermediaries work behind the scenes to get a political opening for the party, its founder Imran Khan and the social media apparatus remain on the offensive. In a recent post on X (formerly Twitter), Imran Khan launched a direct attack on Field Marshal Asim Munir. Simultaneously, PTI supporters in the United States have escalated their international campaign, financing massive digital billboards in New York’s Times Square, criticising Pakistan’s military and current rulers at a time when India is actively lobbying against Pakistan on the global stage. These actions are undermining efforts of quiet diplomacy including that of Gandapur as well as the US-based Pakistan doctors and businessmen. Now even a gossip within the PTI has started against Pakistani-American businessman Tanweer Ahmed, who visited Khan several times in Adiala Jail in the past in hopes of bridging gap between the PTI and the establishment for the good of Pakistan.
Tanweer, speaking to Geo News’ Murtaza Ali Shah recently, recounted how he candidly told Imran Khan about the toxic political atmosphere his rhetoric had contributed to. He urged the former premier to help tone down polarisation for the sake of Pakistan’s unity. “Imran Khan was concerned,” said Tanweer, adding Khan even seemed unaware of the extent of division and the false narratives being built outside. He said there was an agreement that reconciliation and national cohesion were critical.
However, in a bitter twist, Tanweer’s outreach has been discredited within Khan’s inner circle. According to sources, the jailed PTI leader has been misinformed that Tanweer spoke against him on television, portraying the businessman’s genuine concerns as betrayal. This perception, it is believed, would not only sour Khan’s view of a key sympathiser, but it will also discouraged other mediators, including US-based Pakistani doctors who alongwith Tanweer ate making effort to lower the temperature between Khan and establishment. With Imran Khan unwilling to stop and the party’s global chapters vilification campaign against the Field Marshal, there is little space left for backchannel efforts. A source familiar with recent developments put it: “When even sincere efforts are twisted into betrayal, and the party leadership is not interested in restraint, what room is left for dialogue?”
Barrister Saif Ali Khan, when contacted, told The News that he is not in knowledge of any recent interaction of KP CM with the establishment. He, however, said that the chief minister, some other PTI leaders and he himself are making efforts for dialogue with the establishment to bring an end the differences between the two and pave way for an amicable political solution.

PM office clarifies court proceedings report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318343-pm-office-clarifies-court-proceedings-report,"ISLAMABAD: The Prime Minister’s Office has clarified a news item published in The News titled ‘PTI counsel grills PM in hearing of defamation plea against Imran’ on June 3, 2025, saying that facts were misrepresented and the story contained information which was contrary to proceedings of the court.
In a statement the PM office said: “The story misquotes Muhammad Hussain Chotia, the lawyer representing the defendant, Imran Khan as PTI’s counsel whereby he represented as the legal counsel of Mr Khan. The story also tries to establish in its headline that in the proceedings, prime minister was grilled whereby those who witnessed the proceeding in the court state the contrary. The prime minister was confident and answered all the queries put by the defendant’s counsel and supported his response with evidence. The prime minister also refuted the allegations levelled by the defendant’s counsel about the affidavit submitted by him and reiterated that the affidavit was submitted by fulfilling all the legal requirements.
“The defendant’s counsel kept his focus on wasting the precious time of the court by levelling baseless allegations regarding the fulfillment of the legalities regarding the document and kept beating around the bush rather than focusing on the case being heard and its legitimacy. Trying to avoid the facts of the case regarding which the defendant has been employing delaying tactics by taking adjournments and changing his lawyers many times, the defendant’s counsel took the same path and tried to keep the court busy in technicalities. The plaintiff, Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif had thorough clarity of the case and held his ground with confidence.
“The prime minister’s clarity about the case and fulfillment of all the legal formalities pertaining to submission of the affidavit by the prime minister took the defendant’s counsel by surprise who started to browse files in bewilderment and desperation. The prime minister asked the defendant’s counsel whether he is unable to find more questions or has run out them, at which the court echoed with laughter.  “The story tried to create an impression that the prime minister was grilled, which is not only factually incorrect, but also the exact opposite happened in the proceeding rather the session ended with the defendant’s counsel making him a laughing stock,” the statement read.

Rahul slams ‘Narendra’s surrender’ as Amit Shah plays anti-Muslim politics,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318344-rahul-slams-narendra-s-surrender-as-amit-shah-plays-anti-muslim-politics,"KARACHI: India’s Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi launched a scathing attack on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, accusing him of “ surrendering” under pressure from US President Donald Trump during India’s Operation Sindoor.
Gandhi made these remarks during the Congress party’s organisational revitalisation campaign in Bhopal, mocking Modi’s response to international pressure during the operation, implying that a mere phone call from Trump had led to India backing off. “Trump gave just a signal, picked up the phone and said, ‘Modi ji, what are you doing? Narendra, surrender.’ Saying ‘Yes, sir’, Narendra Modi obeyed Trump’s signal”, he said, contrasting the current leadership’s response with that of former Indian prime minister Indira Gandhi during the 1971 war. “That’s character”, he said. “Gandhi ji, Nehru, Sardar Patel — they stood up to superpowers. These people just fold.”
Gandhi also took aim at dysfunction within his own party, warning against “lame horses” and urging for unity and clarity of purpose. Highlighting the BJP’s recent decision to conduct a caste census as an example of bowing to pressure, Gandhi accused the government of lacking conviction and giving in too easily to both internal and external forces.
The opposition’s offensive has come amid growing criticism of Operation Sindoor, which — shrouded in secrecy and marked by conflicting reports — has become a political flashpoint.
In West Bengal, Home Minister Amit Shah escalated tensions further by accusing Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of opposing the operation for political gain. At a BJP state meeting in Kolkata over the past weekend, Shah alleged that Banerjee’s objections were rooted in appeasement politics.
“To appease the Muslim vote bank, Mamata didi opposed Operation Sindoor. She has insulted the mothers and sisters of this country”, Shah said.
Shah went on to claim that Banerjee’s administration had supported terrorism and lawlessness, calling the recent Murshidabad violence “state-sponsored”. He alleged that the TMC government ignored repeated Union Home Ministry requests to deploy the Border Security Force (BSF) to control the unrest.
“These elections are not just about Bengal,” Shah declared, pointing to the 2026 state polls. “They are about national security. Mamata has opened the borders for infiltrators to protect her nephew’s future in power.”
Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress hit back forcefully. Senior TMC leader Chandrima Bhattacharya labelled Shah’s remarks as diversionary and hypocritical. “Who guards the international border? The BSF, which falls under Shah’s Home Ministry. If infiltration has increased, that’s a failure of the Centre, not the state”, she said. TMC MP Sagarika Ghose echoed this, condemning Shah’s “cheap language” and calling his rhetoric irresponsible at a time when national unity is crucial. The Congress party has also waded in to defend Banerjee, senior leader Rashid Alvi saying that national borders are the central government’s domain. “If people are entering illegally, it is Modi’s government that has failed”, Alvi said. On the government’s claim of deporting 2,000 Bangladeshis after Operation Sindoor, he said the number was too small to demonstrate effective action.
Alvi also defended Rahul Gandhi’s demand for transparency regarding reported aircraft losses during the operation, referencing remarks by army and air force officials. “The public deserves to know what really happened. Why is the government hiding it?” he said.
Meanwhile, India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan attempted to shift the narrative back to military success. Speaking at a lecture in Pune on Tuesday, General Chauhan downplayed the importance of Indian losses during Operation Sindoor. “When I was asked about losses, I said these are not important. The results and how you act are”, Chauhan said, likening the operation to a Test cricket victory by an innings. A few days back, Chauhan had spoken with Bloomberg and confirmed that Indian Air Force jets had been downed early in the operation but had not given the exact number and had also emphasised that tactical mistakes had been corrected within days. “Based on technical parameters, we will soon share data on what was destroyed on the Pakistani side -- how many aircraft, radars, etc”, Chauhan added.

ADB okays $800m package for Pak fiscal reforms,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318345-adb-okays-800m-package-for-pak-fiscal-reforms,"KARACHI: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved an $800 million financing package to support Pakistan’s push for fiscal sustainability and stronger public financial management, amid mounting debt and reform pressures.
The package includes a $300 million policy-based loan and ADB’s first-ever policy-based guarantee of up to $500 million, aimed at mobilising as much as $1 billion from commercial lenders, the Philippines-based lender said on Tuesday.
The funding comes under the Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Program, Subprogram 2, which supports wide-ranging fiscal and governance reforms. These include overhauls in tax policy and administration, public expenditure management and digital governance — all part of Islamabad’s efforts to contain the fiscal deficit and reduce public debt.
“Pakistan has made significant progress in improving macroeconomic conditions,” said ADB Country Director Emma Fan. “This programme backs the government’s commitment to further policy and institutional reforms that will strengthen public finances and promote sustainable growth.”
The programme also seeks to improve private sector participation by facilitating investment and modernising regulatory frameworks. It is backed by technical assistance and close collaboration with other development partners to enhance long-term fiscal resilience.
The country faces persistent structural imbalances, with tax revenue among the lowest in emerging markets and public debt nearing 75% of GDP.

Sweeping policy changes planned in auto sector,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318347-sweeping-policy-changes-planned-in-auto-sector,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is poised to make sweeping changes to its automobile policy in its FY2025-26 budget, including allowing used vehicle imports up to five years old, hiking taxes on luxury and mid-range cars, and scrapping tax relief for locally assembled vehicles—all under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) reform agenda aimed at deepening market competition and widening the tax base, officials familiar with the matter told The News.
The most important shift would extend the import age limit for used vehicles—currently capped at three years for cars—to five years across the board. The proposal, now under review at the Ministry of Finance, could dramatically alter consumer choices and pressure local assemblers. At the same time, Islamabad is set to raise the general sales tax (GST) on locally produced vehicles above 850cc to the standard 18 per cent rate from the current 12.5 per cent. The hike, targeting popular models from Japanese and Chinese brands, is expected to squeeze the middle-income market while eroding the price advantage of domestic assembly. Adding another layer, the government will sharply increase withholding taxes on vehicles starting from 1300cc, with top-tier models above 3000cc facing a jump from 12pc to 16pc. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) hopes the progressive tax scale will help plug fiscal gaps without directly impacting lower-income buyers.
“This is a triad strategy—allow more car imports, remove concessions, and increase tax on expensive vehicles. It follows IMF guidelines and is focused on raising more revenue,” said a senior government official involved in budget deliberations. However, independent economists warn that the move could push up the country’s import bill, which is already a major concern. To soften the blow to strategic partners like Japan, Pakistan will continue offering reduced sales tax rates for hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) through June 2026—8.5pc for engines up to 1800cc and 12.75pc for those up to 2500cc—preserving a foothold for hybrid tech amid global electric vehicle shifts.
While the policy resets may generate short-term fiscal gains, industry players warn they could destabilize local manufacturing, widen the trade deficit, and dampen investor sentiment. “We’re being asked to compete on unequal footing while facing higher taxes and shrinking demand,” said an executive at a top local assembler.

"Country’s own, not foreign, capabilities used against India: CJCSC",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318348-country-s-own-not-foreign-capabilities-used-against-india-cjcsc,"ISLAMABAD: Dismissing wild propaganda that Pakistan received foreign assistance — including satellite intelligence from China — during its 96-hour standoff with India, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza Tuesday made it abundantly clear that the country relied entirely on its own resources without receiving or seeking support from any other country.
In an interview with BBC, Gen Sahir said the equipment used by Pakistan during the conflict was similar to the one possessed by India.
He also made it clear that though Pakistan had purchased some equipment from other countries, during the conflict, it relied solely on its internal capabilities.
“The equipment used was either developed domestically or acquired beforehand and in real-time it was Pakistan’s own capability which was employed,” Sahir maintained while responding to a question.
In today’s context, it takes very little time for a conflict to escalate into a full-scale war, he said and warned that if a future conflict arises, it will not remain confined to specific areas but will impact all of India and all of Pakistan.
The CJCSC also observed that there was no effective or organised mechanism in place to resolve Pak-India conflicts.
He noted that while the US and other countries did intervene this time, such windows of opportunity were now becoming increasingly limited.
“Dealing with extremist mindsets, the international community has very limited time to intervene,” he said.
He also mentioned that emergency communications depend solely on the hotline between the Directors General of Military Operations (DGMOs).

India can talk to Pakistan if it takes significant action against terrorism: Tharoor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318349-india-can-talk-to-pakistan-if-it-takes-significant-action-against-terrorism-tharoor,"KARACHI: The problem with holding talks with Pakistan is not the language, but finding a common vision for decency and peace, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said on Tuesday, stressing that New Delhi can engage in dialogue with Islamabad if it takes significant action against the “infrastructure of terrorism that is visible everywhere” in the country.
Tharoor, who was leading an all-party parliamentary delegation to Brazil, also said his team successfully conveyed India’s message against terrorism to the Latin American countries, including to those who may have had some misunderstandings.
“This is what we keep telling our interlocutors. If Pakistan is as innocent as they claim to be, why do they give safe haven to wanted terrorists? Why are they able to live peacefully, to conduct training camps and radicalise further people, to equip arms and get people to practice their arms and Kalashnikovs...,” he said.
“You crack down on this infrastructure of terrorism that is visible everywhere in your country. Then, of course, we can talk,” Tharoor said. “We can talk to them in Hindustani. We can talk to them in Punjabi. We can talk to them in English. There is no problem in finding common ground with Pakistan. The problem is finding a common vision for decency, for peace. We want to be left in peace, to grow and develop. They don’t want to leave us alone. They want to harass us. They want to undermine us,” he alleged.
On another question whether India hopes that Brazil, which is hosting the 11th BRICS Parliamentary Forum, may issue a statement on terrorism against Indian citizens, Tharoor said, “I think, honestly, BRICS has a different agenda. I’m not saying that they may not want to express solidarity. I mean, that’s really not my brief. I don’t know, and I don’t even know if it’s in the draft that they’re working on already.” According to another report, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Monday that recent record aircraft orders from the country’s airlines are just the beginning for the world’s fastest-growing domestic aviation market.
“Indian carriers have placed orders for more than 2,000 new jets and that’s just a start,” Modi said while addressing hundreds of global aviation leaders at an airline industry summit.

Russia says no quick breakthrough in ‘complex’ Ukraine talks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318350-russia-says-no-quick-breakthrough-in-complex-ukraine-talks,"Moscow: Russia on Tuesday said it was wrong to expect a quick breakthrough in Ukraine talks, a day after Moscow rejected Kyiv’s call for an unconditional ceasefire at negotiations in Istanbul.
The sides agreed on a large-scale swap of captured soldiers and exchanged their roadmaps to peace, or so-called “memorandums”, at the discussions, which lasted under two hours.
More than three years into Russia’s offensive -- which has killed tens of thousands on both sides and forced millions from their homes in eastern Ukraine -- the two sides appear as irreconcilable as ever.
“The settlement issue is extremely complex and involves a large number of nuances,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Tuesday.
“It would be wrong to expect immediate solutions and breakthroughs,” he added.
Moscow demanded Ukraine pull its troops out of four eastern and southern regions that Moscow claims to have annexed as a precondition to pausing its offensive, according to the document handed to the Ukrainians that was published by Russian state media.
Kyiv had pressed for a full and unconditional ceasefire. Russia instead offered a partial truce of two to three days in some areas of the frontline, its top negotiator said after the talks.
Peskov also dismissed the idea of a summit between the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and the United States.
“In the near future, it is unlikely,” Peskov told reporters when asked about the chances of the leaders meeting, adding that such a summit could only happen after Russian and Ukrainian negotiators reach an “agreement”.
The White House had said on Monday US President Donald Trump was “open” to the idea, which is also backed by Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky and Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Zelensky on Tuesday accused Russia of “deliberately” targeting civilians in a rocket attack on the city of Sumy, some 30 kilometres (18 miles) from the Russian border, that killed four people.
Russian troops have accelerated their advance, seeking to establish what Putin called a “buffer zone” inside Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region. Zelensky posted a video from the emergency services showing destroyed cars and the body of one victim lying on the road.
The attack “says everything one needs to know about Russia’s so-called ‘desire’ to end this war”, he added, calling for “decisive actions” from the United States and Europe to push Russia into a ceasefire.
“Every day, Russia gives new reasons for tougher sanctions and stronger support for our defence,” he said.
A seven-year-old girl was among 20 wounded, with doctors “fighting for her life,” Sumy’s Acting Mayor Artem Kobzar said.
Three people were also killed in a rocket attack in the northeastern Kharkiv region.
Moscow’s army said it had captured the village of Andriivka in the Sumy region, located around five kilometres from the Russian border.
Zelensky said last week that Russia was massing some 50,000 soldiers for an offensive on the region.
Meanwhile Ukraine’s SBU security service claimed it had hit a pillar of the Crimean bridge linking the annexed peninsula to Russia with an underwater explosive device.

"Heatwaves are now a public health emergency, warn experts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318351-heatwaves-are-now-a-public-health-emergency-warn-experts,"LAHORE: For the second consecutive year, April in Pakistan arrived not with a bloom, but with blistering heat. Across large swathes of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan, temperatures soared past 40 degrees Celsius, weeks before the official onset of summer.
“In the last two years, Pakistan has not been experiencing spring”, Muhammad Irfan Virk, the deputy director at the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) in Islamabad, told The News. “April is becoming increasingly warmer and hotter. This is concerning.”
The PMD issued five heat advisories across April and May this year, most of them in April, typically considered a transitional month. The hottest day was recorded on April 17, in Sindh’s Shaheed Benazirabad district, where the mercury hit 49 C.
According to the PMD’s monthly climate summary, April 2025 was the second warmest April in the past 65 years – the highest was in 2022. And in both May 2024 and 2025, temperatures surged 4 to 6 C above long-term averages in several areas, the state-run National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) reported.
“This marks a worrying trend, indicating that future heatwaves may become even more intense due to continued climate shifts and anthropogenic factors”, the NDMA wrote in its 2024 annual publication.
The extreme heat wasn’t confined to Pakistan. A report by ClimaMeter, an international platform that tracks extreme weather events, found that both Pakistan and India experienced an “unusual early arrival of the heatwave.”
“The heatwave in both countries is disproportionately impacting vulnerable sectors of the population and is severely testing overall human limits, pushing the thresholds for survivability”, the report stated.
The report singled out Islamabad as one of the most affected cities, with average temperatures up to +3 C higher than in previous years.
This trend aligns with findings from a three-decade analysis by World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Pakistan, which links rapid urbanisation in Pakistan’s capital city to rising land surface temperatures.
“In Islamabad rapid urban growth has replaced cropland, grasslands and forests – making it one of Pakistan’s fastest-expanding cities”, noted the WWF report. “Islamabad built-up area skyrocketed by nearly 585 per cent while tree cover took a 10 per cent hit between 1990 and 2020.”
Similar urban expansion and loss of vegetation have been documented in Lahore and Karachi.
The government-run NDMA had similar findings. A spokesperson for the NDMA told The News that while southern districts of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan remain climate hotspots, urban centres are heating up faster. “Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad are warming at a higher rate due to the urban heat island effect”, she said.
David Faranda, a senior climate scientist with the French National Centre for Scientific Research and co-author of the ClimaMeter report, believes the disappearance of spring indicates a deeper climate shift in South Asia.
“The loss of a ‘buffer’ season like spring reflects how extreme weather patterns are replacing gradual seasonal changes, especially in vulnerable regions like South Asia”, he said. “Heatwaves must be treated not just as weather events but as public health emergencies.” But Pakistan’s current systems are far from equipped to do that.
In May, the minister for climate change told the National Assembly that 568 people died across Pakistan during a six-day heatwave between June 20 and 26 last year. Of these, 427 were from Karachi alone.
However, when The News contacted the Federal Ministry of Climate Change, the PMD and the NDMA, none of the organisations could provide updated figures for heat-related deaths or illnesses. The number presented in parliament, officials admitted privately, came from non-profit organisations, adding that at present there was no mechanism in place to collect such figures.
A government official, who asked not to be named, acknowledged the gap. “Such data needs to be collected. People need to be sensitized to how serious this [heatwaves] issue is”, he added.
Pakistan contributes less than one percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet remains among the top ten most vulnerable countries to climate change. Floods, droughts, Glacial Lake Outburst Flooding, and now increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves threaten food and water security and millions of livelihoods.
And the changes aren’t limited to rising heat. In April, Islamabad was battered by a sudden and violent hailstorm -- described by residents as a ‘freak’ event -- that damaged cars, homes and public infrastructure.
While the causes are global, domestic planning decisions are also exacerbating local impacts, said Hammad Naqi Khan, CEO of WWF Pakistan.
“We are creating heat islands in our urban areas. We are removing vegetation and tree cover from Lahore to Islamabad to Karachi, to Murre”, he said. “Yes, Pakistan’s contribution to emissions is very low, but it also needs to put its own house in order.”
Khan urged the federal and provincial governments to draw up city-specific heat-action plans and empower local governments to implement them.
Faranda agrees. He noted that some cities, like Ahmedabad in India and Seville in Spain, are now naming heatwaves to raise public awareness and frame them as serious threats.
In 2022, Seville named the world’s first heatwave: Zoe.
Faranda also suggested appointing dedicated “heat officers” to ensure coordination across government agencies during extreme weather events.
He further called for climate diplomacy between arch-rivals India and Pakistan to save lives.
“Heatwaves do not recognise borders. Regional cooperation on data sharing, forecasting, public health strategies, and urban resilience could save thousands of lives”, Faranda said. “In a fragmented world, the climate crisis could become a bridge for pragmatic, humanitarian collaboration.”

Fafen report on PP-52 by-polls: Isolated procedural irregularities found,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318323-fafen-report-on-pp-52-by-polls-isolated-procedural-irregularities-found,"ISLAMABAD: The by-election in PP-52 Sialkot-IX was marked by a slight decrease in voter turnout and a reduction in the number of invalid votes compared to the General Elections (GE) 2024 amidst isolated procedural irregularities, including disruption of counting process by police officials at a polling station.
According to Fafen observation report on by-election in PP-52 Sialkot-IX, despite a decline in turnout – from 50pc percent to 45pc – the margin of victory (i.e., the difference in votes between the winning and runner-up candidates) increased significantly, from 8,535 votes in GE-2024 to 39,684 in the by-election.
The Provisional Consolidated Statement of the Results of Count (Form-47) was finalised at approximately 1:15am, well within the legal deadline of 2:00 am.
Although the general environment around polling stations remained largely peaceful on polling day, Fafen observers documented persistent instances of illegal campaigning near polling stations, as well as isolated violations of voter identification, ballot processing and counting procedures.
While voter turnout in the by-election was lower than in GE-2024, it was slightly higher than the turnout recorded in the recent NA-213 Umerkot by-election held in April 2025.
Female voter turnout dropped from 47pc in GE-2024 to 39pc, while male turnout decreased from 53pc to 50pc in the by-election. According to Form-47, the PMLN’s vote share rose from 41pc in GE-2024 to 59pc in the by-election.
The runner-up independent candidate, backed by PTI, saw his vote share decline from 35pc to 29pc.
Fafen deployed ten trained observers, including seven men and three women, who observed voting and counting processes at 39 of the 185 polling stations established in the constituency.

PTI’s Gill booked under Peca on cop’s complaint,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318325-pti-s-gill-booked-under-peca-on-cop-s-complaint,"LAHORE: The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency has registered a case against Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Dr Shahbaz Gill under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), following a formal complaint lodged by a former police officer, Inspector Mazhar Iqbal.
According to the first information report (FIR), the case stems from a series of allegedly defamatory and insulting posts shared by Dr Gill on his social media accounts.
The posts reportedly targeted Inspector Iqbal and contained language that was “insulting, defamatory, and baseless”, aiming to question the former officer’s character and conduct. Iqbal claimed that the content disseminated by Gill was not only deeply personal and damaging to his professional reputation but also cast aspersions on his family.
He said the posts were part of a deliberate effort to malign his integrity and influence public perception against him.

"Rabbani criticises crypto move without national debate, stakeholders input",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318329-rabbani-criticises-crypto-move-without-national-debate-stakeholders-input,"ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani condemned the introduction of cryptocurrencies without a national debate or without taking Parliament and relevant stakeholders into confidence.
He added that there is massive confusion within the federal government regarding the provision of a regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets, as the finance ministry signals its intent to bring the crypto economic system under formal oversight.
“The introduction of crypto currencies, controversial, even intentionally, without a national debate or Parliament or the relevant stakeholders being taken into confidence, is condemned,” he said in a statement on Tuesday.
Rabbani urged government to take notice of the “solo flight” by the finance ministry before this becomes a mega scandal. Last Friday, he said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issued a clarification, saying that crypto currencies were not banned outright, but remained outside the existing legal framework.
The ex-Senate chairman said the SBP advised banks, DFIs, micro-finance banks, electronic money institutions, and payment service providers to avoid engaging with virtual assets due to the absence of legal and regulatory framework.
Rabbani said the government told the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance that crypto currencies remained banned and illegal in Pakistan.
He said the Standing Committee of the Senate on Information Technology and Telecommunication also raised similar concerns, but the government was unable to provide any satisfactory answer.

The committee, chaired by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, convened at Parliament House to discuss issues such as the five-year passport blockage, registration of FIRs against deportees from Saudi Arabia and other Western countries, and the rising incidents of deportations from Gulf nations due to beggary and fake documents.
DG Passport and Immigration Mustafa Jamal Kazi highlighted the issue of overstaying, particularly by pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq. He reported that 34,000 Pakistanis were deported from Iran and 50,000 from Iraq last year.
Kazi also noted a rising trend of Pakistanis seeking asylum in Europe, with 125,000 applications filed in the past year. The committee requested a report on 24,000 speaking orders issued in the last three months to assist deportees.
Senator Zamir Hussain Ghumro questioned the ministry’s measures to curb beggary and other crimes tarnishing Pakistan’s image. Officials responded that the ministry had initiated the cancellation of passports for all deportees to deter the increasing trend of beggary by Pakistani nationals in Gulf countries.
However, Senator Shahadat Awan argued that passports cannot be cancelled for crimes committed abroad, as they fall outside Pakistan’s territorial jurisdiction.
The committee also sought details on action taken against Overseas Employment Promoters (OEPs) involved in sending deportees abroad. Officials stated that show-cause notices had been issued to those implicated.
The panel recommended criminal proceedings against the accused OEPs and demanded a list of promoters who sent the highest number of Pakistanis involved in beggary and criminal activities, damaging Pakistan’s reputation and relations with Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar, Iran, Iraq and Oman.
Additionally, the committee sought segregated data on 5,000 deportees who traveled abroad on work permits or visit visas to assess the OEPs’ role.
The committee was also briefed on economic diplomacy efforts to boost skilled labour migration. The MD OEC stated that 10.3 million Pakistani skilled workers are employed abroad, with 18 MoUs signed and 15 under consideration. The OEC focuses on enhancing skilled migration to benefit both host economies and Pakistan through remittances.
The committee applauded the OEC’s efforts and decided to visit its laboratories in the next meeting.

"Senate body calls for steps for safe, drug-free schools",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318335-senate-body-calls-for-steps-for-safe-drug-free-schools,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights has called for stronger child protection measures to ensure safe, drug-free schools and guarantee every child has access to a secure educational environment.
The meeting of Senate committee was presided over by its acting Chairman Senator Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, in the absence of Chairperson Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who could not attend the meeting due to health reasons.
The committee deliberated on the growing threats to children in educational institutions, particularly the alarming rise in narcotics use, abuse, and the absence of mental health and rights-based education in school curricula.
Senator Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui expressed serious concern over the availability of drugs in educational institutions, especially within the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), and called for immediate steps to deal with the menace.
He highlighted the lack of cooperation from provinces in similar initiatives, emphasising the need to first address the situation within the federal jurisdiction.
He questioned the effectiveness of current awareness initiatives in schools, noting that existing textbooks and curricula fail to convey the severity of drug-related dangers.
He urged the inclusion of a dedicated chapter on drug awareness at every grade level and called for the use of realistic examples to ensure the message is effectively communicated to students.
Moreover, highlighting deficiencies in teacher training and curriculum development, Senator Siddiqui stated, “No curriculum can succeed without capable teachers. Training programmes for educators remain weak, and this must be addressed immediately.”
The meeting agreed to establish a committee recommending that the Ministry of Interior designate a focal unit for ICT, including representatives from the Ministry of Education, ICT administration, Islamabad Police, Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF), and the Human Rights Division.
This unit will oversee zone-wise implementation, develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for educational institutions, and create a reporting mechanism to track drug-related activities.
Senator Siddiqui emphasised the need for a pilot model in Islamabad that could serve as a framework for other regions. “We must create a role model initiative in Islamabad and streamline the process. “This problem cannot be solved overnight, but a structured and targeted approach will lead us in the right direction,” he said.
The committee concluded by agreeing on a three-month period for the concerned departments to establish the proposed unit, implement reporting mechanisms, and present a progress report to the committee.
Senator Siddiqui reiterated the Committee’s resolve to ensure every child has access to a safe and drug-free educational environment.
Among those present were Senators Jam Saifullah Khan, Raja Nisar Abbas, Poonjo Bheel, Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, Khalil Tahir, Aimal Wali Khan, the Minister for Human Rights, Secretaries of the Ministries of Human Rights and Interior, the Chairperson of the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC), and senior officials from the concerned departments.

"CPNE calls for unity, dialogue to fight censorship",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318336-cpne-calls-for-unity-dialogue-to-fight-censorship,"KARACHI: At least seven journalists were killed in different circumstances in 2024 in Pakistan, an annual report on media freedom by Council of Pakistan Newspapers Editors (CPNE) said on Tuesday.
“The Pakistan Media Freedom Report” for 2024-25 detailed challenges faced by journalists and media professionals across the country last year. It covered incidents ranging from journalists killings, arrests and abductions to legal pressures and forced exiles.
The report said press freedom remained under duress during the previous year. With ongoing challenges posed by both state and non-state actors, journalists operated under increasing pressure with a democratic framework, the CPNE characterised as authoritarian in practice.
The report documented death of seven journalists in connection with their professional work. The report highlighted the past killings of journalists, including those of Arshad Sharif, Ghulam Asghar Khund and Jan Muhammad Mehr, remained unresolved.
The report criticised state inaction and the impacts of laws, such as Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2025 (Peca) and Punjab’s Defamation Law 2024, which the CPNE said continued to erode press freedom.
The CPNE report reiterated its demand to repeal Peca 2025 and Punjab Defamation Law 2024, urging inclusive consultation in such future legislative processes.
Ali Kazam Waheed, president CPNE, expressed deep concern over deteriorating state of media freedom in Pakistan. “There is a surge in censorship, violence and harassment against journalists”, he said.
Addressing the report launch, media elders called for unity, dialogue within and outside, a peaceful movement to fight media and social media censorship, which they considered was on the rise. Talking about media freedom situation of the day, Mazhar Abbas said, “These are tough times”.
The media experts have asked for joint editorials, and forming a joint action committee for a peaceful struggle for press freedom and against censorship. They declared new Peca a draconian law.
The experts urged legislation through dialogue and inclusive approach. Wusatullah Khan, senior journalist, said semi-war like situation with India showed Pakistan’s media was responsible and the state elders also admitted this responsibility, and now they should pose confidence in the media.
Celebrating Pakistan victory over India in the recent conflict, senior journalist Hamid Mir said there was a need to improve governance, judicial, governance and media freedom and corruption index as compared to India.
The media elders observed Pakistani media lacked independence. They viewed there was direct and indirect censorship on media and cyber laws were being misused, weaponised against media persons, and individuals criticising the governance models and to silent online criticism.
They called for constitutional supremacy and an informed struggle through constructive grand dialogue and unity of civil society.
Senior journalists, writers, anchorpersons including, Najam Sethi, Absar Alam, Ayaz Amir, President Lahore Press Club and PFUJ leader Arshad Ansari, Chairman Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) Harris Khalique also expressed their views.
Representative of Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors (AEMEND) Rihan Ahmed read message of Azhar Abbas, president of the association. The representatives of International Federation of Journalists and Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists participated in the launch report.

Iran envoy proposes turning border into trade corridor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318337-iran-envoy-proposes-turning-border-into-trade-corridor,"QUETTA: Iran’s Consul General in Quetta, Ali Reza Raajahi, has said that Tehran is eager to transform the Pakistan-Iran border, traditionally viewed through a security lens, into a corridor of trade and cooperation—especially between Pakistan’s Balochistan and Iran’s Sistan-Balochistan provinces.
Addressing a meeting at the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI), Raajahi noted that concerns raised by Balochistan’s business community have already been conveyed to Iran’s governors of Sistan-Balochistan and Khorasan, as well as to Iran’s national councils on security, economy, and culture.
“We are working to build a dedicated business room inside the Iranian Consulate in Quetta to address trade barriers and resolve issues faced by traders,” he said, adding that Iran is also ready to establish manufacturing units for Zamiyad vehicles and Iranian motorcycles in Pakistan.
Earlier in the session, QCCI President Haji Muhammad Ayub Mariani and other office-bearers called for expanding bilateral trade volume to $10 billion. They urged both governments to simplify trade procedures and facilitate easier movement of goods and people.
The business leaders proposed several measures including: visa facilitation for Pakistani traders, activation of border markets, establishment of a Pak-Iran Expo Centre at Taftan, removal of unnecessary import restrictions and annual quota systems on Pakistani rice and sesame in Iran, and the formulation of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA). They also objected to the $1 per kilometer fee imposed on Pakistani cargo vehicles in Iran.
In response, Raajahi expressed support but stressed the need for practical solutions rather than just committees. “We recommend forming a trade syndicate for swift and sustainable problem-solving,” he said, emphasizing shared economic interests and the need to shield bilateral ties from third-party interference.
He added that video interviews could be arranged for those unable to visit the consulate for visa processing and reiterated Iran’s commitment to regional peace, citing Tehran’s efforts to mediate between Pakistan and India.
The meeting concluded with the presentation of a commemorative shield to the Iranian Consul General by QCCI representatives.

50 kids admitted as rehab centre for disabled children opened,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318261-50-kids-admitted-as-rehab-centre-for-disabled-children-opened,"Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday inaugurated the Centre for Rehabilitation of Children with Physical & Neurodevelopmental Disabilities, a joint effort of the Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre (MALC) and the Sindh government’s Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPD).
Talking to the media after inaugurating the facility, Shah said that this centre stands as a beacon of hope, and a testament to collective commitment to support children facing physical and neurodevelopmental challenges, including conditions such as autism and Down syndrome.
He pointed out that their vision is clear: to provide these children with the care, therapies and opportunities they need to thrive and lead fulfilling lives. He said that under one roof, this centre offers a comprehensive and fully integrated range of services delivered by a dedicated multidisciplinary team of professionals.
These services include physiotherapy (a customised programme designed to enhance mobility and physical development), speech therapy interventions aimed at improving communication and language skills, remedial therapy (specialised educational support to foster cognitive and academic growth), and behavioural therapy (positive behavioural interventions to promote adaptive functioning).
They also include occupational therapy focusing on daily living skills and sensory integration; a sensory room, where a therapeutic environment is designed for sensory regulation and exploration; and paediatrician services (medical assessments and ongoing developmental care to monitor and support children’s health).
A special play area, which is an inclusive play space equipped with adaptive equipment and supervised by experts, and audiometry services meant for early detection and management of hearing impairments to ensure timely intervention are also included.
“This centre will provide treatment for both mental and physical health conditions. CRPD centres are effectively supporting DEPD initiatives by the Sindh government,” said Shah, adding that on the very first day, 50 children had already been admitted to the centre.
He praised MALC’s efforts in combating leprosy, and highlighted that the newly established major rehabilitation centre along Shahrah-e-Bhutto is capable of treating thousands of children simultaneously.
He said rehabilitation centres have been set up in Karachi, Gambat, Larkana, Tando Muhammad Khan and Nawabshah. He announced plans to establish similar rehabilitation centres for special children in various cities across the province.
Inclusive City
The CM said that 100 acres of reclaimed land near the Malir Expressway in Karachi has been allocated to establish Inclusive City, which is dedicated to persons with disabilities.
“This Inclusive City will provide a comprehensive environment with inclusive schools, rehabilitation complexes, vocational training centres, a general hospital, a neuropsychiatry ward, and residential facilities for persons with disabilities who need care and support.”
Included in this project is a 20-acre park designed for children with special needs to play joyfully and safely, as well as a large building to house welfare organisations. “This city will be a model of accessibility, dignity and opportunity, enabling persons with disabilities to live independently and contribute fully to society.”
He said the Inclusive City reflects his government’s unwavering commitment to creating an inclusive society where every individual, regardless of their physical or developmental challenges, has access to education, health care, rehabilitation and vocational opportunities, all within a supportive and enabling environment.
The success of these initiatives is a shining example of what can be achieved through collaboration, bringing together the expertise, resources and dedication of MALC, DEPD and the Government of Sindh, he added.
Recalling the services of Dr Ruth KM Pfau, he said: “She established MALC in 1962, and her contributions to the fight against leprosy are highly commendable.”  Responding to a question, the CM said the provincial budget would be presented on June 13. “Agriculture will be a key focus in the upcoming budget.”
He also emphasised that there must be representation from Sindh in the management of K-Electric and other power distribution entities in the province. “This is essential for ensuring that the consumers within the province benefit directly. While electricity distribution is constitutionally a provincial responsibility, it has always been managed by the federal government.”
Speaking on future plans, he said: “We want to run Hesco and Sepco through public-private partnership. We’re aware that technically sound firms are needed to operate such services effectively.”
He added that his government is currently discussing the matter with the federal government. “Although our work is ongoing, it will take time for the results to be visible.”  He also voiced his concerns over poor decision-making by power distribution companies. “Such decisions can lead to law and order issues, for which the provincial government is held accountable.”

"Sindh, NHMP join hands to curb overloading",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318262-sindh-nhmp-join-hands-to-curb-overloading,"Inspector General National Highways and Motorway Police (NHMP) BA Nasir, along with officers from the National Highways and Motorways Police’s South region, held a meeting with Sindh Chief Secretary Syed Asif Hyder Shah on Tuesday.
The meeting focused on enforcing the Axle Load Control Regime, enhancing the vehicle inspection and certification process, and addressing safety and operational challenges on national highways and motorways, particularly in Sindh.
One of the major issues raised was the illegal use of escape routes by transporters to avoid weighing at stations. The NHMP shared that such routes, once identified, are reported to regional authorities to block these loopholes. To counter resistance and ensure smooth enforcement, it was stressed that the deployment of district and local police at weigh stations was essential.
In response, the chief secretary said the government is establishing 32 new weigh stations on various routes in Sindh. The meeting also reviewed the registration and follow-up of FIRs under NHSO-2000 and PPC sections 279 and 431 against vehicles violating axle load limits. Strict and consistent legal action was deemed essential to create deterrence and promote long-term compliance.
The modernization of vehicle fitness certification also came under discussion. Provincial transport authorities have been advised to adopt the VICS (Vehicle Inspection and Certification System) model. Key points included mandatory physical inspection prior to certification, pasting of visible fitness stickers with QR codes and expiry dates on windscreens, and restricting old or mechanically unfit vehicles from entering highways.
Another point of concern was road blockades caused by political or social groups. The chief secretary highlighted the economic and safety threats posed by such disruptions and directed the local administration to act swiftly in preventing or removing such obstacles. The NHMP also raised concerns about vandalism and theft of protective fencing installed along motorways. These fences are critical to preventing accidents by stopping stray animals and unauthorized access to carriageways. The need for stronger local police cooperation was emphasized, including the registration of FIRs and recovery of stolen materials.
During the meeting, the transport secretary said the department has formally initiated the process of vehicle inspections to ensure roadworthiness of transport vehicles across the province.
The chief secretary vowed full support and directed the relevant departments to coordinate closely with the NHMP and NHA. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to road safety, legal enforcement, and the protection of public assets.

Suspect killed in action against smuggling of hazardous waste,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318263-suspect-killed-in-action-against-smuggling-of-hazardous-waste,"The Anti-Smuggling Organisation (ASO) of the Pakistan Customs Enforcement Karachi intercepted a suspicious vehicle during an operation based on a tip-off in the early hours of Monday.
Customs spokesman Syed Irfan Ali said the operation was carried out at around 3:40am near Boat Basin. The occupants of the vehicle resisted arrest, resulting in a violent clash. A constable of the ASO team got into a scuffle with a suspect. In view of the immediate danger, the constable opened fire, resulting in a suspect being severely wounded. He was taken to the hospital. He appeared to be around 30 years old.
According to initial reports, the suspects hail from Balochistan and may be associated with an organised smuggling network. The wounded suspect’s companions tried to chase and attack the Customs officials.
The crowd present at the spot also caused an uproar, turning an already tense situation worse, causing difficulties in the Customs officials’ search of the suspects’ vehicle. The vehicle was then shifted to the Customs House, where its detailed inspection yielded some 80 sacks of smuggled hazardous waste, with each sack weighing 10kg to 12kg.
The spokesman said the traffic flow that had been disrupted at the Native Jetty Bridge was restored. He said the injured died at the hospital, adding that his body was handed over to his family, who have taken it to their native village in the Mastung district. The Customs expressed sorrow over the loss of life, and offered condolences to the family.

"Businessman, guard held for assaulting motorcyclist in DHA remanded in police custody",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318264-businessman-guard-held-for-assaulting-motorcyclist-in-dha-remanded-in-police-custody,"A judicial magistrate on Tuesday remanded two suspects, including a businessman, in police custody in a case pertaining to an assault on a motorcyclist in Defence Housing Authority.
Salman Farooqi, said to be the executive officer of a private company, and his guard Owais Hashmi were arrested after a video went viral on social media showing Farooqi assaulting a motorcyclist, who was accompanied by his sister.
The incident, which occurred after a minor road accident on Khayaban-e-Ittehad, sparked widespread outrage on social media with calls for strict legal action against the man. On Tuesday, the police escorted the held suspects to the city courts with their faces covered with a piece of cloth. The investigating officer produced them before Judicial Magistrate (South) Muzzamil Ali Soomro and requested their physical remand in police custody for investigation.
Suspect Salman Farooqi through his lawyer Naeem Qureshi filed an application seeking post-arrest bail in the case. Qureshi argued that the sections invoked against the suspect were bailable and requested the magistrate to free him on bail.
However, the magistrate handed over both the suspects to the police with a direction to the IO to produce them on completion of their remand. The court returned the bail application to the counsel to file it before the relevant forum since the charges involved were triable by a sessions court.
As the suspects were being escorted out of the courtroom, they faced an angry reception from a group of lawyers. Chants of “Maaro maaro” (beat them) echoed through the premises. A video showed a lawyer slapping Salman Farooqi as the cops whisked the suspects away to avoid any untoward incident.
An FIR has been lodged at the Gizri police station on the complaint of an eyewitness, Mohammad Saleem, under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 342 (wrongful confinement), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506-B (threat to cause death or grievous hurt) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code.

Chawla inaugurates Motor Registration Wing’s executive centre in Clifton,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318265-chawla-inaugurates-motor-registration-wing-s-executive-centre-in-clifton,"Sindh Minister for Excise, Taxation and Narcotics Control Mukesh Kumar Chawla inaugurated the Executive Center Motor Registration Wing in Clifton on Monday.
The establishment of the Executive Center Motor Registration Wing will facilitate motor registration for the people of Clifton and adjoining areas, and motor registration facilitation centers will be opened in all divisions of Sindh, including Karachi, he said while talking to media representatives after the inauguration of the wing.
Secretary Excise Muhammad Saleem Rajput, DG Excise and Taxation Muhammad Iqbal Leghari, directors and a large number of media representatives were present on this occasion.
Chawla said more motor registration facilitation centres are being established for public convenience and accessibility, and after Muharram, such centres will be inaugurated in all divisions across Sindh, including other districts of Karachi.
He said the public used to have a lot of difficulty in reaching the Civic Centre, so today this Executive Facilitation Centre has been established in Clifton so that the residents of Defence and Clifton and the surrounding areas can get convenience.
The minister further said that initially it will work from 9am to 5pm and after Muharram this centre will be activated 24 hours. He said all kinds of facilities will be provided to the public here and this system is connected to the online Civic Centre.
He said that we have passed the bill and will go ahead and build more centres under public-private partnerships, and we will build two centres each in Hyderabad, Sukkur, Larkana and then we will go to the district level.
On a question regarding anti-drug operations, Minister Chawla complained to the media that breaking news is being made on half a gram, but the media does not report on the drugs seized in large quantities properly, and an effective crackdown is being carried out indiscriminately regarding drugs.
He said that in the recent cabinet meeting, the issue was raised that the court grants bail and drug dealers become active again after being released from jail. In this regard, special courts are being formed where the sentencing process will be expedited and efforts will be made to ensure that drug dealers are not given bail, he added.
Chawla said we will ask the special court to collect the case property as a sample and destroy the remaining drugs immediately. He said that if drug dealers do not get bail soon, it will have positive results.
He requested the media to point out that the government will take action. The government has decided to take strict action in this regard, while operations are also underway against drug dealers in the interior of Sindh.

LRN Chief Executive Dr. Muhammad Zohaib Tariq said that the qualifications are designed to equip learners with an understanding of AI concepts, applications, and ethical considerations. They are equivalent in academic weight to traditional subjects such as Mathematics or Physics, and are available internationally.
He said that this is Britain taking the lead in AI education. By launching the world’s first full school qualification in Artificial Intelligence, we’re setting a global standard — and giving students everywhere the chance to build strong academic foundations for the AI-powered future.

Approval of child protection policy lauded,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318239-approval-of-child-protection-policy-lauded,"LAHORE: Civil society organisations and child rights advocates across Punjab have warmly welcomed the approval of the province’s first-ever Child Protection Policy by the Punjab Cabinet.
This landmark decision has been hailed as a crucial step toward protection and well-being of children in the province. Chairperson of CPWB Sarah Ahmad expressed thanks to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for her steadfast dedication and leadership in championing the cause of children. The approval of this policy by the Punjab Cabinet is not just a policy decision—it is a beacon of hope and a historic milestone for the protection and empowerment of our children, said Sarah Ahmad.
‘This policy embodies the Punjab government’s deep resolve to protect children’s rights and uphold their dignity, she said, adding it marks a transformative step toward ending violence, abuse, exploitation, and neglect against children in our communities.
This policy is the culmination of dedicated efforts that began over two years ago with the submission to the Home Department. Punjab proudly becomes the first province in Pakistan to institutionalise a formal Child Protection Policy, setting a precedent and inspiring other regions to follow suit in prioritising children’s rights and protection, she concluded.
Iftikhar Mubarik, Executive Director of Search for Justice, emphasised the importance of backing the policy with adequate budgetary allocations to ensure its implementation in true letter and spirit. He stressed the need for an action plan under the policy that defines clear roles and responsibilities for various administrative departments, including the School Education Dept, Special Education Dept, Prosecution Dept, Planning & Development Dept, Police, Health Dept, Social Welfare & Bait-ul-Maal Dept, PSPA, the legal community, civil society organisations, INGOs, and UN agencies. Coordinated interventions must be streamlined to achieve the goals, he added.

The event aimed to enhance interdepartmental coordination and raise awareness at the community level regarding TIP and SOM challenges in Pakistan. MPA Uzma Kardar emphasised the government’s commitment to eradicating human trafficking and migrant smuggling, underscoring that existing laws and policies must be effectively implemented with the support of civil society, media, academia, and the public. “The government has a zero-tolerance policy toward exploitation. We must build the capacity of parliamentarians and law enforcement agencies while also educating the public,” she said.
Adviser to the Punjab Charities Commission, Mudassar Butt, stressed that awareness alone is insufficient. He called for enhanced law enforcement capabilities, improved inter-agency coordination, and comprehensive rehabilitation services for survivors.
Parliamentary Secretary Kanwal Liaqat warned against irregular migration, noting that agents involved in illegal schemes often exploit innocent citizens. “Youth seeking to migrate must use legal and regular pathways,” she stated.
MPA Adnan Afzal Chattha highlighted the Chief Minister’s focus on skill development as a solution to youth unemployment and unsafe migration. “Our skill development program is opening doors for thousands of young people across Punjab.
Executive Director of SSDO, Syed Kausar Abbas, outlined the national legal framework and National Action Plan against TIP and SOM. He urged young people to acquire marketable skills and consider entrepreneurship as a means of securing their futures.

FAPUASA condemns attack on ASA rights,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318251-fapuasa-condemns-attack-on-asa-rights,"Islamabad:Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) has strongly condemned the administration of the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology (FUUAST) for issuing an unlawful explanation notice to Dr Orangzaib of the Physics Department.
The notice issued earlier this week accuses Dr Orangzaib of ‘misconduct’ for facilitating the election process for a democratic Academic Staff Association (ASA) without ‘prior approval’ and threatens disciplinary action under administrative rules.
FAPUASA considers this move a direct attack on constitutionally protected rights, academic freedom and faculty welfare. The organisation points out that demanding prior approval to form an association is a clear violation of Article 17(1) of the Constitution of Pakistan which explicitly guarantees every citizen the right to form associations or unions.
According to FAPUASA, the attempt to punish Dr Orangzaib for exercising this right under the guise of disciplinary procedure represents an unacceptable abuse of authority and a misuse of the Efficiency and Discipline (E&D) Rules.
Moreover, FAPUASA highlighted that the suppression of faculty efforts to form an ASA undermines institutional governance and the fundamental principles of academic freedom. Academic Staff Associations are globally recognised as legitimate and essential platforms for faculty representation and safeguarding academic standards. Any attempt to prevent their formation or intimidate those involved is not only regressive but also damaging to the university’s reputation and academic integrity.
FAPUASA demanded the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of the explanation notice issued to Dr Orangzaib. The organization further called on the FUUAST administration to publicly assure the faculty that no punitive action will be taken against any member exercising their constitutional right to association. Additionally, FAPUASA insisted on a formal commitment from the university to recognise and engage with the democratically elected ASA without obstruction or delay.

"Water shortage in Quaid-e-Azam Colony, Ahmadabad",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318253-water-shortage-in-quaid-e-azam-colony-ahmadabad,"Rawalpindi:Acute water shortage has gripped the areas of Ahmadabad and Quaid-e-Azam Colony in Rawalpindi Cantonment, as rising temperatures has worsen the situation.
Despite the presence of relevant authorities, residents remain at the mercy of the tanker mafia, forced to buy water at exorbitant rates, says a press release.Local citizens report that water supply across Cantonment areas is now available on alternate days, whereas in Ward 5 - particularly Ahmadabad residents receive water only one or two times a month. Citizens alleged that an independently elected member  of the Cantonment Board is hindering in water supply and other developmental projects for political gain.
When local delegations approached him with complaints, he redirected them to officials without resolving the issues.A particularly troubling concern is the alleged illegal water connection to a marriage hall located on Chakri Road. According to residents, the water used in the hall comes from the community's share, and no utility bills are reportedly paid for years. Despite repeated complaints, authorities have failed to take action.Residents demand immediate steps from Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz to address these longstanding grievances and call for an inquiry into the water connection to the marriage hall. Efforts to contact the board member for his comments remained unsuccessful.
Citizens have appealed to the Director General of Cantonment Boards, the Chief Executive Officer, and the Chief Minister of Punjab to intervene and ensure adequate water supply to the affected areas.Sources indicate that if the large under-construction water tank in Ghaziabad is completed, it could resolve the shortage not only in Ghaziabad but also in Ahmadabad and Quaid-e-Azam Colony. The tank's construction, which includes concrete and steel reinforcement work, is reportedly near completion. However, a legal stay order allegedly obtained on malicious grounds is delaying the project.

PHC issues notices over poor sanitation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318297-phc-issues-notices-over-poor-sanitation,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday issued notices to the provincial government, Secretary of Local Government, CEO of Water and Sanitation Services Peshawar (WSSP), Town Municipal Officer (TMO) Town-III, and the deputy commissioner Peshawar in response to a petition highlighting the deteriorating sanitation conditions in Sabz Ali Town on Warsak Road.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Naeem Anwar and Justice Farah Jamshed heard the writ petition filed by Advocate Muhammad Riaz. During the proceedings, the petitioner’s counsel, Advocate Umar Farooq, informed the court that his client was a resident of Sabz Ali Town, where sanitation has reached an alarming state.
He further pointed out that due to ongoing work involving the replacement of water and gas pipelines, excavation debris had been left unattended, creating hazardous living conditions for residents. This neglect, he argued, was posing serious health risks to the local community.
The counsel emphasized that it was the responsibility of the relevant authorities to ensure a clean and healthy environment for citizens. He also informed the court that residents had repeatedly submitted complaints to the concerned departments, but their grievances had been ignored, leaving them with no option but to approach the court.
He urged the court to direct all relevant institutions to immediately address the sanitation issues in the area and ensure a hygienic and livable environment, as the unsanitary conditions pose a threat of disease outbreaks.

Hearing on petition against filming interviews of prisoners adjourned,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318298-hearing-on-petition-against-filming-interviews-of-prisoners-adjourned,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Tuesday adjourned until July 3 the hearing of a petition challenging the recording and dissemination of interviews of accused held in jails and police custody.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Wiqar Ahmad heard the case.
During the proceedings, Justice Arshad Ali observed that such interviews can influence ongoing cases, while Justice Wiqar Ahmad remarked that police officials often positioned the accused persons in front of cameras.
The petition was being pursued by Advocate Jabar Khan with Advocate Ziaur Rehman Tajik representing him in court. Advocate Shumail Ahmad Butt appeared as an amicus curiae.Advocate Tajik informed the bench that detainees were being interviewed inside prisons and lockups often in the presence of police officials. These interviews are then widely circulated on social media platforms, he added.
He argued that these recordings were not made by mainstream media professionals but by YouTubers and individuals who created social media accounts, which raised serious legal and ethical concerns.
He added that in the current digital era, anyone can walk in with a microphone and start recording statements of inmates, which constitutes a breach of privacy and legal protocol.Amicus curiae Advocate Butt told the court that he had only just been appointed to assist in the case and had not yet reviewed the details, but described it as a significant and interesting legal matter. He expressed concern that such interviews were even being submitted as evidence in courts.
Justice Arshad Ali reiterated that these practices can impact the fairness of the legal process, while Justice Wiqar Ahmad noted that police themselves were sometimes complicit in facilitating these recordings.

Delay in road project flayed,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318299-delay-in-road-project-flayed,"CHITRAL:  Former tehsil nazim Sartaj Ahmad Khan has expressed deep concern over the extraordinary 15-year delay in the construction of the Booni-Bozund Road in Upper Chitral.

He stressed that timely action would provide much-needed relief to the area’s residents and accelerate development in various sectors.

MTI Tribunal suspends specialist registrar appointment at HMC,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318300-mti-tribunal-suspends-specialist-registrar-appointment-at-hmc,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) Tribunal has suspended the final appointment for the specialist registrar in Endocrinology at the Hayatabad Medical Complex) HMC) and sought a response from the hospital administration in this regard.
The three-member tribunal, consisting of MTI Tribunal Chairman Justice (Retd) Abdul Shakoor, and members Mansoor Tariq and Abdul Ghafoor Qureshi, heard the petition of Dr Sana.
During the hearing, her lawyer, Barrister Huzaifa, informed the court that his client had an exemplary medical career, having secured a distinguished position in the Peshawar Board’s 2007 examination. She later joined Khyber Medical College and obtained her FCPS degree in Medicine in 2021 and in Endocrinology in 2024.
The barrister told the tribunal that in 2024, HMC administration advertised the position of specialist registrar in Endocrinology. Dr Sana applied for the position, but her application was not processed, despite her being the most suitable candidate.
He said that Dr Sana had scored the highest marks in the interview, but a person who was not a specialist in diabetes, but rather a general physician, was placed on the interview panel.This, according to the lawyer, was a deliberate move to appoint favoured individuals to the position.
The counsel emphasized that while efforts were being made to ensure the provision of the best facilities in hospitals, the appointment of doctors without merit undermines their ability to perform at their best.
In Dr Sana’s case, despite being the most qualified candidate, she was intentionally overlooked so that she could not be appointed, even though she had specialized in diabetes and was an FCPS-qualified specialist. He added that this situation raised serious questions about merit in the hospital administration.

"QWP leader blasts PTI govt for misgovernance, corruption",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318301-qwp-leader-blasts-pti-govt-for-misgovernance-corruption,"CHARSADDA: Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) provincial head Sikandar Sherpao on Tuesday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had failed to deliver during its 13-year rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Addressing party workers in the Qadirabad area of Charsadda, Sikandar Sherpao said PTI was the only political party to have formed the provincial government three times in a row, but has not completed a single major development project.
He said the PTI came to power on the slogan of fighting corruption but ended up setting new records for misgovernance and financial scandals. “New corruption scandal is emerging every day. Jobs are being sold openly, there is no merit system, and the law and order situation is deteriorating rapidly,” he went on to allege.
Citing a specific case, he mentioned the reported Rs40 billion corruption scandal in Kohistan district as a glaring example of financial mismanagement. “Today, there is no sign of governance in the province. The provincial government has lost its writ, and even the Chief Minister himself no longer feels safe,” he added.
Sikandar Sherpao also criticised PTI for relying heavily on social media to address public issues while the people of the province are drowning in real-life problems. He claimed that many development projects currently being inaugurated by PTI lawmakers were originally approved during the QWP’s tenure. “They are putting their nameplates on our projects,” he added.
Reaffirming his commitment to public service, Sikandar Sherpao said the QWP was ready to re-enter the political arena with renewed energy and would work to build the party into a strong political force.

Traders oppose plan to revive Food Street,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318305-traders-oppose-plan-to-revive-food-street,"PESHAWAR: Office-bearers of Anjuman-e-Tajiran of Chowk Fawwara, in Peshawar Cantt, have expressed concerns over reports of a possible revival of the Food Street in the area, warning of legal action and protests if their demands are not addressed.
Speaking at a press conference at the Peshawar Press Club, President Javed Khan and other trader leaders said that in 2018, when the Food Street project was first introduced, a four-member delegation of local traders met the Cantonment Executive Officer (CEO) and highlighted the negative impact it would have on their businesses.
They said the CEO had assured them that all food cart vendors would operate within prescribed limits and that the Food Street would be shut down if complaints persisted.“Despite the promises, vendors began violating the conditions, and repeated complaints and negotiations failed to resolve the issues,” said the trader leader.
The trader said they wrote a formal letter to the Director General of the Cantonment Board Rawalpindi, Major General Irfan Ahmed Malik, who ordered removal of all stalls and cabins in April 2025 which the traders termed a “great relief” for both businesses and residents.
However, the traders noted that although the Food Street had ended, roadblocks remained in place, legal parking spaces were eliminated, and illegal food carts continued to occupy the area.
He added that reports of plans to revive the Food Street were again causing unrest among local traders.The trader leaders warned that the business community will launch a protest and pursue legal action if the Peshawar Cantonment Board fails to reopen all blocked roads, remove obstacles, eliminate illegal carts, and halts any plans to restart the Food Street.

Journalists union concerned at rising street crimes,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318306-journalists-union-concerned-at-rising-street-crimes,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Union of Journalists (KhUJ) has expressed deep concern over the rising incidents of street crimes, including mobile phone snatching, theft of cars and motorcycles, and other acts of robbery targeting journalists in Peshawar.
The union stated that despite multiple incidents involving journalists falling victim to such crimes this year, police have yet to show any tangible progress. In a joint statement issued by KhUJ President Kashifuddin Syed, General Secretary Irshad Ali, and other office-bearers, the union highlighted the increasing frequency of mobile phone and cash snatching as well as vehicle theft involving journalists in Peshawar. They criticized the police for failing to make any arrests or recover the stolen property, which has led to growing concern within the journalist community. The union leadership revealed that yet another incident occurred on Tuesday when robbers snatched a mobile phone from Nasir Naeem, General Secretary of the Video Journalists Association, and fled the scene.
The KhUJ president said that journalists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially in Peshawar, are increasingly being targeted by both criminals and influential elements. He termed the rise in such incidents a serious question mark on the performance of law enforcement agencies.
The statement mentioned that a few days ago, during a protest by the Pakistan People’s Party, a video journalist’s motorcycle was stolen. Additionally, two journalists had their cars stolen this year, while several others were robbed at gunpoint of cash and valuable belongings. Yet, there has been no trace of the culprits so far.
The KhUJ called on the Inspector General of Police, Capital City Police Officer, and the SSP Operations to take immediate action, arrest the culprits involved in these incidents and ensure the recovery of stolen items and vehicles.

The training, aimed at treating children born with congenital foot deformities (clubfoot), was held at the seminar hall of the centre’s main campus, College of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (CPMR).
A press release said the objective of the specialised training programme was to provide advanced know-how in the Ponseti method, which is globally recognised as the most effective and low-cost treatment for clubfoot.
“This non-surgical technique gradually corrects foot deformities through specific casting and bracing methods,” the communique said, adding active parental involvement and consistent follow-up are vital components of the treatment process.
The two-day session was attended by orthopedic surgeons, physiotherapists and clubfoot clinic specialists from across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as well as from Islamabad and Muzaffarabad. Training was conducted by Paraplegic Centre’s experts Dr Fahad Jamil, Dr Ijaz Ahmad and Dr Khukla Imtiaz, under the overall supervision of director Rehabilitation and Programme Coordinator Dr Amir Zaib. The trainers provided hands-on training and emphasised effective patient communication, parental counseling and modern follow-up protocols.
Addressing the closing ceremony, Chief Executive of Paraplegic Centre, Dr Syed Muhammad Ilyas stated that the facility was committed to eradicating the painful yet treatable condition of clubfoot. “Our mission is to ensure that not only in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but throughout the country, no child is left without timely and quality treatment,” he said. Dr Ilyas announced that, in addition to existing active clinics, the programme was being expanded to other provinces and cities, with new clubfoot clinics being established in Gilgit and Bannu to provide accessible treatment for children in remote areas.He reiterated that reaching all affected children and their families, offering guidance and ensuring complete treatment remains the Center’s top priority.

Balambat Rehabilitation Centre serves as beacon of hope,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318309-balambat-rehabilitation-centre-serves-as-beacon-of-hope,"TIMERGARA: The Balambat Rehabilitation Centre is a beacon of hope for the young people, who are struggling to get rid of the addiction.
The number of young people, who are struggling to stop using drugs, is increasing alarmingly in the Lower Dir district. The addicts mostly belong to poor families.According to locals, the trend was worrying as ice, heroin, hashish and other substances were easily available in the district headquarters and its suburban areas contributing to the rise in addiction among young people.
The Balambat Rehabilitation Centre was established by the Social Welfare Special Education and Women Empowerment Department Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in a rented building.
Talking to this scribe, Rehabilitation Officer Muhammad Nisar told this scribe that since its inception the centre had treated more than 800 addicts all belonging to Lower Dir district. “Currently 30 addicts from various areas of the district are under treatment at the centre,” Muhammad Nisar said.
He added that the center was spending Rs200,000 per head on the three-month treatment program which was provided by the provincial government, Secretariat Social Welfare and the district administration.
A medical officer, psychologist, psychiatrist, religious scholar and rehabilitation officer provided counseling to the addicts on a regular basis, he said.“We have established on our own a vocational centre for addicts where they learn different skills including tailoring, electrician and cooking to make the addicts useful citizens,” Muhammad Nisar said.
The official said the rehabilitation centre needed a proper building and an ambulance for transporting the addicts from one place to another, establishing a proper gym inside the centre, installation of solar panels and provision of sports equipment. He added that the centre had six vacant positions which needed to be filled.

OCAC seeks Rs10 per litre OMC margin,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318183-ocac-seeks-rs10-litre-omc-margin,"KARACHI: The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) has recommended that a formula for determining the oil marketing company (OMC) margin be jointly developed by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division), and the oil industry. It has also called for an upward revision of the OMC margin to Rs10 per litre for petroleum products.
In a letter addressed to the chairperson of Ogra, the OCAC sought immediate support for what it described as a long-overdue revision of OMC margins. “During a meeting held with the Minister for Petroleum on May 29, 2025, we were informed that the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) has advised Ogra to develop a proposal for the revision of OMC margins,” the OCAC said. It added that the industry continues to face significant challenges, including smuggling, a high turnover tax, insufficient margins and rising cost pressures.
“Given these challenges, it is imperative that the OMC margin be aligned with actual costs, as proposed by the OCAC and discussed extensively with OGRA and the Petroleum Division,” the council said, reiterating its proposal for a Rs10 per litre margin.
The OCAC noted that the proposed margin is based on Pakistan State Oil’s (PSO) cost structure, as approved by the ECC in September 2023. All cost components included in the proposed margin are already part of the current margin. It explained that maintaining a 20-day stock cover is a licensing requirement, but doing so ties up capital and leads to financing costs. These costs have been incorporated into the margin, calculated using the average one-month Kibor rate (21.91 per cent) from July 2023 to June 2024.
Handling losses during storage and movement of motor fuels are already recovered through the margin. Operating expenses, a core element of the cost structure, have also been factored in to ensure fair cost recovery.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 23.41 per cent in the July 2023-June 2024 period. As a result, a profit margin of 23 per cent has been included in the proposed calculation.
The OCAC has recommended that a formal formula for calculating the OMC margin be jointly developed by Ogra, the Petroleum Division, and the oil industry, and that future revisions should be carried out annually in July based on this formula.

CCP fines fertiliser sector Rs375m for price-fixing,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318184-ccp-fines-fertiliser-sector-rs375m-for-price-fixing,"KARACHI: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has imposed fines totalling Rs375 million on six major fertiliser producers and an industry association after finding evidence of collusive pricing that artificially raised urea prices across the country, undermining market competition and harming farmers.
In a ruling announced on Monday, the competition regulator said its investigation concluded that the companies, in coordination with a trade body, engaged in anti-competitive conduct by jointly fixing the retail price of urea. Each firm was fined Rs50 million, while the association was fined Rs75 million.
The case stems from a suo motu inquiry launched by the commission, which found that under the guise of a public awareness campaign, the manufacturers had “effectively fixed the price of urea across the country”. The commission said the move went beyond legal coordination and entered the realm of unlawful collusion in violation of Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2010.
Despite maintaining that they acted independently, the companies were unable to justify their nearly identical pricing structures. The commission’s findings highlighted that such coordinated conduct distorted the market, curtailed consumer choice, and placed undue financial strain on farmers, particularly during key agricultural seasons.
The firms’ defence, that they were acting in line with government instructions, was dismissed by the CCP. The bench held that no formal state directive existed to compel such coordinated pricing. Instead, a government call for greater price transparency was “misused as a platform to align prices in a manner that eroded competitive discipline”.
Of particular concern was the uniformity of pricing -- Rs1,768 per urea bag -- despite marked differences in production costs, energy inputs and market share across the firms. The commission said this could not be attributed to coincidence or healthy competition, but rather to deliberate, concerted action. Previous warnings issued by the CCP in 2010, 2012 and 2014 had failed to change behaviour.
The CCP’s ruling also criticised the role of trade associations in facilitating price coordination, reiterating that such bodies should not serve as forums for sharing sensitive pricing information. It warned other industries against similar practices, noting that collusion undermines consumer welfare and damages the integrity of markets.

"In Pakistan, corruption seen as enabler not deterrent for FDI: report",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318185-in-pakistan-corruption-seen-as-enabler-not-deterrent-for-fdi-report,"KARACHI: Foreign direct investment is pouring into Pakistan despite (or perhaps because of) systemic corruption, according to a new study that exposes the structural flaws driving capital into fragile sectors.
A policy brief from the Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) finds that foreign investors continue to deploy capital in Pakistan even as the country languishes near the bottom of global transparency rankings.
With a CPI score of 27 out of 100, Pakistan is widely seen as one of the most corrupt investment destinations in South Asia. Yet, FDI inflows remain concentrated in energy, food and financial services -- all sectors highly exposed to rent-seeking and informal payments.
“Corruption in Pakistan does not just coexist with FDI -- it facilitates it,” said the report, adding that the country maintains “a transactional environment where regulatory bottlenecks are navigated not through reform, but through bribery.”
Using time-series and panel regression models covering 1995 to 2024, the study found that FDI inflows increase as corruption rises -- a finding that holds even for capital originating in low-corruption countries like Germany, Japan and Canada. Investors, it appears, are less deterred by governance risks when returns are attractive, particularly in Pakistan’s energy sector, where deals can be fast-tracked with “speed money”.
The report highlights Pakistan’s energy sector as a textbook case. While billions in FDI have boosted installed capacity under initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), systemic corruption has neutralised those gains. The sector is now burdened with a circular debt topping Rs2.6 trillion. Projects such as rental power plants and independent power producers (IPPs), initially lauded as solutions to energy shortages, have become cautionary tales of mismanagement and opacity.
Similarly, foreign investment in banking and food services has failed to produce productivity gains. The financial sector is heavily tilted towards government lending, and the food sector remains import-dependent, aggravating Pakistan’s external account stress.
The study situates Pakistan’s experience within a broader South Asian pattern. Neighbouring countries with similarly low CPI scores -- including India (38), Bangladesh (23) and Sri Lanka (32) -- also receive and send substantial FDI. In some cases, firms “may prefer to invest in countries where they are familiar with the challenges of navigating such an environment”.
To break the cycle, the report urges Pakistan to go beyond symbolic anti-corruption rhetoric. It recommends digitising FDI transactions, enforcing performance-linked contracts and deploying AI tools to flag anomalies. Streamlined licensing and inter-agency coordination are also critical.
“FDI should be a tool for development, not a subsidy for dysfunction,” the report concludes. “Without structural reforms, foreign capital will continue to reward and reinforce the very systems that hold Pakistan back.”

"KSE-100 gains 1,573 points, surges to all-time high",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318186-kse-100-gains-1-573-points-surges-to-all-time-high,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a bullish momentum throughout the day. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by 1,573 points to an all-time high on Tuesday, as the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved $800 million loan for Pakistan. Besides, relief is expected in some sectors in the upcoming federal budget next week.
The KSE-100 surged by 1,573.07 points, or 1.32 per cent, to 120,450.87 points, up from 118,877.81 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 120,693.83 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 119,129.52 points.
“Stocks closed at an all-time high, driven by broad-based gains across the board,” said Ahsan Mehanti, analyst at Arif Habib Corp. “Investor sentiment was buoyed by the ADB’s approval of an $800 million financing package; the government’s FY26 growth target of 4.2 per cent; and the approval of a Rs880 billion public sector development programme ahead of next week’s federal budget announcements.”
He said that budgetary relief expected for oil refineries, real estate and the agriculture sector and rupee gains played a catalytic role in the bullish close at the PSX.
The KSE-30 index increased by 439.42 points or 1.22 per cent to 36,584.01 points from 36,144.59 points.
Traded shares rose by 81 million shares to 587.163 million shares from 497.94 million shares. The trading value increased to Rs26.827 billion from Rs23.45 billion. Market capital expanded to Rs14.593 trillion against Rs14.444 trillion. Of the 467 companies active in the session, 232 closed in green, 187 in red and 48 remained unchanged.
A market report of Topline Securities said that bulls maintained a firm grip on the market, propelling the KSE-100 index to a record close at 120,450, supported by renewed investor confidence and an improving macroeconomic outlook.
The index surged to an intraday high of 1,816 points, as the momentum picked up sharply after news broke that the ADB approved an $800 million loan under Pakistan’s public finance programme, a major vote of confidence in the country’s economic reform trajectory. Adding further fuel to the rally, the IMF gave its nod to Pakistan’s budget proposals, reinforcing hopes of continued fiscal discipline and policy continuity.
Driving the day’s rally were key index movers; FFC, HBL, EFERT, LUCK, and BAHL, which collectively added 691 points to the benchmark.
The highest increase was recorded in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which rose by Rs3,231.20 to Rs35,543.19 per share, followed by Khyber Textile Mills Limited, which increased by Rs306.98 to Rs3,376.76 per share. A significant decline was noted in Sapphire Fibres Limited, which fell by Rs57.89 to Rs1,055.19 per share; Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs35.12 to Rs9,883.9 per share.
Mubashir Anis Naviwala, an analyst at JS Global, said the benchmark index surged throughout the day, reaching a historic all-time high. “With the index at its all-time high, a breakout could lead to fresh momentum and attract further institutional participation. We recommend investors capitalise on this and invest in fundamentally strong stocks in the fertilizer, cement, and banking sectors on any intraday pullbacks,” he advised.
K-Electric Ltd remained the volume leader with 144.646 million shares, which closed higher by 23 paisas to Rs5.32 per share. Faysal Bank, with 26.656 million shares, followed it, which closed higher by Rs4.89 to Rs53.77 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included Invest Bank, Fauji Foods Ltd, Kohinoor Spinning, WorldCall Telecom, PTCL, Dewan Cement, Maple Leaf and Hub Power Co.
In the futures market, 314 companies recorded trading, 224 of which increased, 86 decreased and 4 remained unchanged.

Cement sales dip 1.94% in 11 months despite strong export growth,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318187-cement-sales-dip-1-94pc-in-11-months-despite-strong-export-growth,"LAHORE: Domestic cement sales declined by 1.94 per cent during the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, according to data released by the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA).
Local consumption fell from 35.1 million tonnes between July 2023 and May 2024 to 34.4 million tonnes during the same period of the current fiscal year. However, a 25.73 per cent surge in exports helped the sector post a marginal overall growth of 2.46 per cent during this period.
In May 2025 alone, total cement dispatches rose by 8.57 per cent year-on-year to 4.651 million tonnes, up from 4.284 million tonnes in May 2024. Local dispatches reached 3.662 million tonnes, an increase of 8.93 per cent compared to 3.362 million tonnes in the same month last year. Export volumes also rose by 7.27 per cent to 0.989 million tonnes, up from 0.922 million tonnes.
Cement mills in the northern region dispatched 3.261 million tonnes in May 2025, up 11.87 per cent from 2.915 million tonnes a year earlier. Mills in the southern region dispatched 1.39 million tonnes, reflecting a modest 1.54 per cent increase compared to 1.379 million tonnes in May 2024.
In terms of local dispatches, northern mills supplied 3.02 million tonnes to the domestic market, a 9.71 per cent year-on-year increase from 2.753 million tonnes. Southern mills dispatched 641,894 tonnes locally in May 2025, marking a 5.37 per cent increase over 609,174 tonnes in May 2024.
Northern region exports grew by 48.27 per cent, rising from 162,929 tonnes in May 2024 to 241,578 tonnes in May 2025. In contrast, exports from the southern region declined by 1.53 per cent to 747,856 tonnes, compared to 759,456 tonnes in the same month last year.
Cumulatively, total cement dispatches (local and exports) for July 2024 to May 2025 reached 42.764 million tonnes -- 2.46 per cent higher than 41.739 million tonnes recorded in the same period last year. Domestic dispatches stood at 34.419 million tonnes, down from 35.102 million tonnes last year, while exports rose sharply to 8.345 million tonnes from 6.637 million tonnes.
In the northern region, domestic dispatches during the eleven-month period fell by 1.53 per cent to 28.489 million tonnes from 28.931 million tonnes. Exports rose by 9.47 per cent to 1.476 million tonnes, compared to 1.348 million tonnes last year. Total dispatches from the north dipped by 1.04 per cent to 29.965 million tonnes from 30.279 million tonnes.
In the southern region, domestic sales dropped by 3.9 per cent to 5.93 million tonnes from 6.171 million tonnes. Exports, however, surged by 29.88 per cent to 6.868 million tonnes, up from 5.288 million tonnes. Total dispatches from the south rose by 11.69 per cent to 12.799 million tonnes compared to 11.459 million tonnes in the previous fiscal year.
A spokesperson for the APCMA said the 1.94 per cent decline in domestic cement consumption during the review period was concerning and warranted close attention. “Domestic demand is vital for utilising the industry’s idle capacity and for broader economic development,” he said, adding that the cement sector supports several allied industries including steel, paint and electrical goods.
He expressed hope that the government would address the industry’s concerns in the upcoming federal budget and introduce measures to reduce duties and taxes on cement, thereby making it more affordable for consumers.

Rupee erases gains,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318188-rupee-erases-gains,"KARACHI: The rupee erased its gains from the prior three sessions against the dollar and experienced a modest depreciation on Tuesday due to increased dollar demand from importers.
The rupee closed at 282.11 to the dollar in the interbank market, compared with its previous close of 281.97.In the open market, the rupee remained stable for a third straight session, trading at 284.4 against the dollar.
Dealers said that the local currency faced pressure as importers stepped into the market to buy dollars to meet their obligations ahead of the Eid holidays. The financial markets will be closed from June 6-9 for the Eidul Azha holidays.
Commercial banks have reportedly been delaying import payments because of a shortage of foreign currency. The major foreign loan repayments that are due before the end of June and the requirement to satisfy the reserve requirements set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are the main causes of this shortage.
With just two trading sessions left before the federal budget announcement and the extended Eid holidays, analysts predicted that the rupee will probably stay range-bound.According to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, negotiations with the IMF over the next federal budget have been fruitful, paving the way for a new phase of economic growth.

"APTMA demands level playing field, removal of GST on local inputs",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318189-aptma-demands-level-playing-field-removal-of-gst-on-local-inputs,"KARACHI: Key stakeholders in Pakistan’s textile sector have jointly urged the government to immediately abolish the 18 per cent general sales tax (GST) on locally produced cotton, yarn and fabric, or else impose it equally on imported yarn and fabric, warning that the current policy is severely damaging the domestic industry.
Addressing a joint press conference at the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) House in Karachi on Tuesday, Central Chairperson APTMA Kamran Arshad was joined by Chairperson of the Karachi Cotton Association (KCA) Khuwaja Zubair; Mahesh Kumar, a representative of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA); Convenor of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Cotton Committee Sham Lal; and other industry leaders including former APTMA central chairperson Asif Inam and Yain Siddik.
The speakers condemned the policy of applying 18 per cent GST on local supplies while maintaining zero-rating on imported inputs, calling it “an anti-Pakistan policy that is bleeding the economy from within”.
While the sales tax on local cotton and yarn is technically refundable, the group pointed out that refund processing is riddled with delays, underpayments, and bureaucratic inefficiencies. “Only 60-70 per cent of refunds are processed, and the rest have been stuck in manual systems for 4-5 years,” they claimed. Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), in particular, face significant disadvantages due to these delays.
The textile industry leaders insisted that they are not opposed to exports but are demanding a level playing field. They argued that the EFS, intended to boost exports, has instead led to an increase in imports of cotton and yarn. “Exporters are now overwhelmingly preferring imported inputs, sidelining local suppliers,” they said.
Providing data to support their claims, the speakers noted that imports of cotton, yarn, and greige fabric surged by $1.5 billion -- from $2.19 billion in FY24 to $3.64 billion in FY25 -- while textile export growth during the same period stood at only $1.4 billion. As a result, net textile exports are expected to fall from $14 billion to $13.6 billion.
The speakers also sounded the alarm on the broader impact of the policy on Pakistan’s textile ecosystem. They reported that more than 120 spinning mills and 800 ginning factories have already shut down, with loom closures triggering protests by workers on the streets of Faisalabad. “This is not just about factories -- it is about livelihoods,” they stressed.
They highlighted that the cotton economy supports between $2 billion and $3 billion in rural incomes, particularly for women involved in cotton picking. The imposition of 18 per cent GST on cottonseed and cottonseed cake -- which they said is unheard of anywhere else in the world -- is pushing farmers’ incomes below sustainability levels and disproportionately affecting the poorest.
The group further claimed that the current policy framework is costing Pakistan as much as $1.5-2 billion in potential net foreign exchange earnings. “Instead of generating local value, we are borrowing expensive loans to pay for avoidable imports,” they warned.
With cotton being Pakistan’s primary import from the US, the speakers noted that Washington has indicated a willingness to export up to 1.5 million bales to Pakistan. US President Donald Trump has also extended an invitation to a Pakistani trade delegation, proposing to double or even triple cotton exports to the country. “But to absorb such volumes, Pakistan needs a viable and operational spinning industry,” they cautioned.
The group urged the government to restore the EFS to its June 2024 status, reinstating zero-rating for local supplies. “We have held meetings with the finance minister, FBR leadership, and even IMF representatives. However, the IMF has so far refused to support the restoration of zero-rating,” they said.

Eurozone inflation slows sharply in May,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318190-eurozone-inflation-slows-sharply-in-may,"BRUSSELS: Inflation in the eurozone eased in May to its lowest level in eight months, back below the European Central Bank’s two-per cent target, further raising expectations for another interest rate cut this week.
Year-on-year consumer price increases in the single currency area slowed more than predicted by analysts for FactSet to 1.9 per cent, down from 2.2 per cent in April, the EU’s official statistics agency said.
Core inflation -- which strips out volatile energy, food, alcohol and tobacco prices and is a key indicator for the ECB -- also eased more than expected to 2.3 per cent in May, down from 2.7 per cent a month earlier.
The ECB is expected to deliver its seventh-straight interest rate cut Thursday as the United States’ volatile trade policies hang over the sluggish eurozone economy.
“This won’t have much of a bearing on Thursday’s ECB decision, which already looked almost certain to be a 25 basis point cut,” said Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at UK-based investment research group Capital Economics.
“But May’s inflation data strengthen the case for another cut at the following meeting in July,” he said.Eurozone inflation is at its lowest point since September last year, when it stood at 1.7 per cent.
The slowdown in inflation was thanks to prices for services easing to 3.2 per cent from 4.0 per cent in April, Eurostat said.The ECB closely monitors the sector as it is highly correlated to wage growth. The ECB fears that a vicious cycle between rising wages and prices would make it more difficult to tackle inflation.
In energy, the rate was negative 3.6 per cent, unchanged from the month before. Food-price inflation accelerated, however, to 3.3 per cent last month from 3.0 per cent in April.
Further drops
Inflation has sharply dropped from the record peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2022 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent energy prices sky-high.Capital Economics’ Allen-Reynolds said he expected inflation to fall further in the months ahead, “leaving the headline rate comfortably below two percent in the second half of the year”.
“Subdued oil prices and a stronger euro will drag down energy inflation and lead to cheaper production inputs and imports. Decelerating wage growth will bring the long-awaited cooling in the sticky services category,” said Riccardo Marcelli Fabiani, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
Consumer price rises in Europe’s two economic powerhouses, Germany and France, slowed in May to 2.1 per cent and 0.6 per cent, respectively.
While the eurozone economy expanded by 0.3 per cent over the January-March period from the previous quarter, US President Donald Trump’s erratic trade policy, including the potential for steep tariffs, has hurt the region’s economic outlook.
Trump has put a 50-per cent duty on EU goods on ice until July 9 as the two sides chase an agreement but a 10-per cent levy remains, alongside 25-per cent tariffs on steel, aluminium and auto imports.Trump now plans to raise duties on steel and aluminium to 50 per cent.

"Microsoft cuts hundreds more jobs after firing 6,000 last month",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318191-microsoft-cuts-hundreds-more-jobs-after-firing-6-000-last-month,"Microsoft Corp cut hundreds more jobs just weeks after its largest layoff in years, underscoring the tech industry’s efforts to trim costs even as it plows billions of dollars into artificial intelligence, reports Bloomberg.
More than 300 employees were told their positions had been eliminated on Monday, according to a Washington state notice reviewed by Bloomberg. A Microsoft spokesperson said the latest headcount reduction is in addition to the 6,000 job cuts announced last month. “We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.
The artificial intelligence boom has roiled the tech labour market because companies are prioritizing AI-focused jobs and harnessing the technology to save money. Microsoft and peers including Meta Platforms Inc. have touted the effectiveness of AI-assisted coding tools in speeding up the software development process. Last week, Salesforce Inc. said the internal use of AI has allowed it to hire fewer workers.
Microsoft’s previous layoffs fell hardest on software engineers. It couldn’t be determined what kind of jobs were affected Monday. As of June 2024, the company had about 228,000 full-time employees, 55 per cent of whom were employed in the US.

[9:08 PM, 6/3/2025] Aiman Business: The German share price index DAX graph is pictured at the stock exchange in Frankfurt, Germany, on Tuesday. European shares dropped on Tuesday, weighed down by economically-sensitive bank and mining stocks as investors awaited updates on the trade war clouding global growth. The pan-European STOXX 600 reversed early gains to fall 0.5 per cent by 0830 GMT, extending Monday’s losses, as banks dropped 1.4 per cent and miners slumped 2.3 per cent. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation (OECD) and Development trimmed its global growth outlook and said the trade war was taking a bigger toll on the US economy than before. “The OECD forecasts is going to cause a great deal of concern.... a lot of people were thinking maybe inflation is behind us, but big concern now is about what happens next,” said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. The news comes ahead of a flash estimate of euro zone inflation numbers and the European Central Bank’s monetary policy meeting this week.

Pakistan aims to expand tobacco exports to Indonesia via trade webinar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318193-pakistan-aims-to-expand-tobacco-exports-to-indonesia-via-trade-webinar,"KARACHI: Pakistan is looking to strengthen its tobacco exports to Indonesia as part of a broader push to deepen trade ties with Southeast Asia, officials said following a government-led webinar that connected exporters and policymakers from both countries.
The online session, hosted by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) in collaboration with Pakistan’s trade mission in Indonesia, focused on identifying market opportunities, easing regulatory hurdles and promoting Pakistan’s tobacco products in the Indonesian market.
The webinar was jointly chaired by Deputy Director at TDAP Ayaz Muhammad and Minister for Trade and Investment at Pakistan’s Mission in Indonesia Muhammad Naseem Rashid. It brought together key industry representatives, including leading Pakistani exporters and officials from the Pakistan Tobacco Board.
Indonesia, one of the largest consumers of tobacco in Asia, was described as a gateway for regional trade. Speakers noted that Pakistan, with its mature tobacco cultivation base and established processing capacity, is well-positioned to cater to rising demand.
Participants discussed market dynamics, regulatory frameworks, and the potential for bilateral collaboration. The session also addressed existing trade barriers and explored ways to streamline access for Pakistani tobacco products in the Indonesian market.
TDAP said the session concluded with agreement on concrete follow-up steps, including a dedicated business-to-business (B2B) engagement involving the Pakistan Tobacco Board and exporters. The initiative is part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to diversify exports and boost value-added agricultural trade with high-growth economies.

"After Madrid penalty furore, football’s lawmakers rule for retakes",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318216-after-madrid-penalty-furore-football-s-lawmakers-rule-for-retakes,"PARIS: If Julian Alvarez slips while taking a spot kick for Atletico Madrid at the Club World Cup this month, he will get the second chance he was denied in the Champions League in March, after international football´s rule-making body on Tuesday clarified the double-touch rule.
Football´s rule-making International Football Association Board (IFAB) announced that if players unintentionally touch the ball twice while taking a spot kick and still find the net, they should be allowed a retake.
Alvarez slipped as he netted his penalty kick in a shooutout to decide a Champions League Madrid derby. Video review (VAR) detected that he touched the ball twice and the referee ruled the shot a miss under Law 14, which deals with the penalty kick. Real went on to win 4-2.
After the match, European governing body UEFA said that “under the current rule, the VAR had to call the referee signalling that the goal should be disallowed”. UEFA said it would hold talks with world football´s governing body FIFA and and the rule-making International Football Association Board (IFAB).
On Tuesday, IFAB issued its ruling. It was to come into force on July 1, but FIFA at once announced the change would apply to the Club World Cup, which kicks off in the United States on June 15 with both Madrid clubs among the 32 teams.
“The situation where the penalty taker accidentally kicks the ball with both feet simultaneously or when the ball touches the penalty taker´s non-kicking foot or leg immediately after they have taken the kick... is rare,” wrote Lukas Brud, IFAB´s secretary in a circular.
“As it is not directly covered in Law 14, referees have understandably tended to penalise the kicker for having touched the ball again,” he wrote. However, he added, the law “is primarily intended for situations where the penalty taker deliberately touches the ball a second time before it has touched another player”.
“This is very different from the penalty taker accidentally kicking the ball with both feet simultaneously or touching the ball with their non-kicking foot or leg immediately after they have taken the kick, which usually occurs because they have slipped.” Brud pointed out that even an accidental second touch could be unfair to a goalkeeper because it changes the ball´s trajectory.
Therefore, he wrote, IFAB had decided that “if the kick is successful, it is retaken”. If a kick during the game is unsuccessful, the result is an indirect free kick, as it would be for a deliberate second touch, unless the referee decides to play an advantage for the defending team. In a shootout it remains a miss.

"PCB reschedules PSL-11, PSL-12 to adjust international series",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318217-pcb-reschedules-psl-11-psl-12-to-adjust-international-series,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reportedly finalized the playing windows for PSL 11 and PSL 12, marking a strategic shift in scheduling to accommodate international cricket commitments and enhance the tournament’s global appeal.
According to sources, PSL 11 will take place from December 2025 to January 2026, while PSL 12 is scheduled for January–February 2027. This adjustment deviates from the traditional February–March timeframe, making PSL-11 the first edition of the league to be played entirely across December and January.
The move to an earlier window is aimed at avoiding clashes with Pakistan’s packed international FTP, which includes ICC events, bilateral series, and domestic competitions over the next two years.
The PCB intends to maintain player availability, attract overseas talent, and maximize commercial value by restructuring its flagship T20 tournament. For PSL-12, the January–February slot repositions the tournament closer to its pre-COVID traditional window, while accounting for ICC events and FTP commitments that could influence player participation. International fixtures. Players will be split into three groups, but Babar, Rizwan, and Shaheen will attend all sessions, reinforcing their leadership role within the squad.

"Van Rooyen, Leishman earn spots at Oakmont in final US Open qualifiying",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318218-van-rooyen-leishman-earn-spots-at-oakmont-in-final-us-open-qualifiying,"Oakmont, United States: South African Erik van Rooyen and Australian Marc Leishman were among those who earned berths at Oakmont next week from US Open final 36-hole qualifiers on Monday.
Van Rooyen fired rounds of 64 and 67 to finish first on 13-under 131 at Kinsale Golf Club in Columbus, Ohio, with Americans Bud Cauley, Justin Lower and Lanto Griffin sharing second on 137 and countryman Harrison Ott on 138.
That left a five-man playoff for the final available US Open berth, a fight that included US PGA Tour players Max Homa, Rickie Fowler, Eric Cole and Cameron Young plus compatriot Chase Johnson.
Young won the spot with a birdie on the first playoff hole. Homa was notable as the only player carrying his own bag through the all-day affair. Van Rooyen, 35, missed the cut in his last three US Open starts over the past four years after making his best finish, a share of 23rd, in 2020.
He is a two-time PGA Tour winner, most recently at Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in 2023, and was a runner-up at last month´s CJ Cup Byron Nelson tournament. At Woodmont in suburban Washington, Americans Ryan McCormack and Trevor Cone took the lead, claiming two US Open spots.
That left a three-way playoff for two final US Open spots between Australian Marc Leishman, Colombian Sebastian Munoz from LIV Golf and American Bryan Lee. Leishman, who won his first LIV Golf title in April at Miami, and Lee parred the first two extra holes and booked their berths at Oakmont when Munoz lipped out a par putt to make bogey on the second playoff hole.
At Lambton in York, Canada, it was American Kevin Velo setting the pace -- but six others joined him including Danes Niklas Norgaard and Thorbjorn Olesen, England´s Matt Wallace, Argentina´s Emiliano Grillo, American Mark Hubbard and France´s Victor Perez.
Americans James Nicholas and Chris Gotterup led four qualifiers at Canoe Brook in Summit, New Jersey, with Mexico´s Roberto Diaz and US amateur Ben James taking the last spots. American Zach Bauchou led qualifiers at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, with Mexicans Alvaro Ortiz and Emilio Gonzalez and American Alistair Docherty one stroke back to also qualify.

Brentford sign goalkeeper Kelleher from Liverpool,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318220-brentford-sign-goalkeeper-kelleher-from-liverpool,"LONDON: Brentford have completed the signing of Irish international goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher from Liverpool for a reported fee of up to Â£18 million ($24 million).
The Bees´ previous number one Mark Flekken joined Bayer Leverkusen earlier on Tuesday in a deal worth around 10 million euros (Â£8.5 million, $11.5 million). Kelleher played an important role in Liverpool´s Premier League triumph, making 10 appearances during the absence of Alisson Becker due to injury.
However, the 26-year-old was keen for more first-team action and could have fallen further down the pecking order at Anfield with the arrival of Giorgi Mamardashvili from Valencia.

Lois Boisson: from unknown to great home hope at Roland Garros,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318221-lois-boisson-from-unknown-to-great-home-hope-at-roland-garros,"PARIS: French Open quarter-finalist Lois Boisson has captured the hearts and minds of her compatriots as her remarkable run in Paris has dragged the French world number 361 from obscurity to stardom.
Handed a wildcard to enter the tournament, the 22-year-old hit the headlines in France on Monday when she kept home hopes alive by battling past third seed Jessica Pegula to reach the last eight.
That come-from-behind 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 win in the fourth round meant the previously unheralded Boisson had become the first French player, male or female, to attain the quarter-final stage at Roland Garros since 2017.
She is the lowest-ranked woman to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final since former top-20 player Kaia Kanepi did so at the 2017 US Open, and is the first to do so on debut at a major since Carla Suarez Navarro at Roland Garros in 2008.
Boisson´s underdog story was hailed as a “fairytale at Roland Garros” by French daily Le Monde, while Le Figaro basked in her “incredible adventure”. Already the sole French representative left in the last 16 on either side of the draw, few gave the Dijon-native much chance of keeping the tricolore flying in Paris before her match against US world number three Pegula.
Stepping onto Court Philippe Chatrier for the first time to play a match, Boisson showed no signs of nerves as her ferocious forehand and the backing of the showpiece stadium´s partisan crowd got her over the line against her much-fancied opponent.
“When I came on the court to do the warm-up, was, like, incredible for me. You know, I watch the stadium, and I told to myself ´Okay, I will play matches on this court, but it´s okay. It´s a court like every court´,” said Boisson.
Although not quite at capacity at the start of the match, Boisson´s fightback soon captured the Parisian spectators´ attention. “In the beginning, even though there weren´t many, you can still hear them on centre court,” she recounted. “But for the third set, it was full. It was incredible. As soon as a point was tight, it (the support) would be really incredible.”
Despite this new-found fame, Boisson is adamant she won´t let it go to her head as she stays focussed on her “dream” Roland Garros. “During the tournament, I´m trying to stay in my bubble and not to see what´s happening around me,” she said. “No, things are not going to change for me. They´re going to continue in the same way.
“It´s just that my ranking will enable me to play larger, more important tournaments. That´s the only thing that´s going to change.” If mainstream notoriety is new to her, it is not the first time Boisson has had her name on the lips of the tennis world.
Last April, British player Harriet Dart generated a mini-social media storm when she was overheard asking the chair umpire to request Boisson apply deodorant during their match at a 250 event in Rouen.
Boisson laughed off the incident at the time, responding with a pithy request for a collaboration with a toiletries company, but now it´s her playing that has people talking. The daughter of a former professional basketballer, Boisson first picked up a racquet at the age of eight.
In early 2021, at the age of 17, she made her debut on the main circuit at the WTA 250 tournament in Lyon. Eliminated in the qualifying rounds of the French Open in 2021, 2022 and 2023.

Ex-England boss Lancaster named Connacht head coach,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318222-ex-england-boss-lancaster-named-connacht-head-coach,"LONDON: Former England boss Stuart Lancaster was Tuesday announced as the new head coach of Irish province Connacht.
The 55-year-old has signed a two-year contract and will oversee pre-season training in July. Lancaster was appointed England head coach in 2011 before leaving following a dismal home World Cup in 2015. He was most recently head coach of French club Racing 92, having worked as a senior coach at Irish province Leinster between 2016 and 2023.
“Connacht is a club with a proud identity, a passionate supporter base, and enormous potential both on and off the field, so I´m honoured and humbled to be given the opportunity to lead the professional men´s team programme,” Lancaster said.

Swiatek and Sabalenka set up French Open clash,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318224-swiatek-and-sabalenka-set-up-french-open-clash,"PARIS: Three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek set up a blockbuster French Open semi-final clash with world number one Aryna Sabalenka on Tuesday, with men´s holder Carlos Alcaraz also chasing a last-four berth.
Swiatek, the fifth seed, got past 13th-seeded Ukrainian Elina Svitolina 6-1, 7-5 in Paris after top women´s seed Sabalenka won a nervy quarter-final against Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen, 7-6 (7/3), 6-3.
“(Aryna) has been having a great season so I´m not going to lie, it is going to be a tough match. But I´m happy for the challenge,” said Swiatek after reeling off her 26th win in a row at the French Open.
Both players have shared the number one ranking between them since April 2022. Sabalenka ended Swiatek´s 11-month reign as world number one last October but the Pole leads 8-4 in their previous meetings.
World number five Swiatek has been struggling for her best form and has not reached a final since winning the French Open title last year. But she gave Svitolina little opportunity on her favoured clay surface, breaking in the fourth game to ease through the first set.
The pair exchanged consecutive breaks of serve early in the second set, before Swiatek forced the breakthrough at 5-5 with a powerful forehand down the line. She then sealed the win with back-to-back aces.
Swiatek is aiming to become the first woman to win four straight Roland Garros crowns since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.
Earlier, reigning US Open champion Sabalenka defied the windy conditions and Zheng to avenge her recent loss to the Chinese star in Rome. “The last tournament I was pretty exhausted,” said Sabalenka.
“Today I was more fresh I was ready to battle.” Sabalenka once again got the upper hand on Zheng, who had been on a winning streak of 10 matches on the Paris clay after her run to Olympic gold last year.
Zheng broke and led 4-2 in the first set. But numerous unforced errors -- 31 in total -- allowed the Belarusian to come back. The second set was also tight before Sabalenka broke back to lead 4-3, taking advantage of her opponent´s errors.
“I gave her the chance, so easy,” said Zheng, who has lost seven times in eight meetings to Sabalenka, including in last year´s Australian Open final. Madrid Open champion Sabalenka feels she is ready to go all the way in Paris, where her previous best performance was reaching the semi-finals two years ago.
“It´s high-level matches. I´m super excited to go out there and to fight and to do everything I need to get the win,” said Sabalenka of her tie against Swiatek.  Spaniard Alcaraz, the men´s second seed, will go head to head with American Tommy Paul in Tuesday´s night session on Court Philippe Chatrier.
Alcaraz is through to the last eight for the fourth year running and aims to become the third man this century to defend his title, after Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal. The 22-year-old has dropped a set in each of the past three rounds but holds a 4-2 career record against Paul, the US 12th seed who Alcaraz beat in the quarter-finals of the Paris Olympics on the way to a silver medal last August.
“I remember that every match that I´ve played against him he was really tough,” said Alcaraz. “His level is really high right now. He has a lot of confidence.” If Alcaraz gets past Paul he will meet the winner of Tuesday´s other men´s quarter-final between in-form Italian Lorenzo Musetti and Frances Tiafoe.
Musetti has been one of the form players on clay this season, reaching at least the last four in all three of the principal warm-up events ahead of the French Open. Both Musetti and US 15th seed Tiafoe are appearing at this stage of Roland Garros for the first time.
Tiafoe, twice a US Open semi-finalist, has yet to drop a set in Paris and is confident he can go even further. Both Paul and Tiafoe are the first US men´s quarter-finalists at the event since Andre Agassi in 2003.

Contenders eye ‘big titles’ as Nations League final four kicks off,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318225-contenders-eye-big-titles-as-nations-league-final-four-kicks-off,"Munich, Germany: The Nations League semi-finals start on Wednesday with Germany, Spain, France and Portugal seeking to fine tune their sides with the World Cup just one year away.
Tournament hosts Germany face Portugal in Munich on Wednesday and title holders Spain face France in Stuttgart a day later. The winners will face off in the Bavarian capital on Sunday.
Created in 2018, the Nations League lacks the history and esteem of football´s major international tournaments and has been criticised for adding to an already crowded calendar. But as Spain and France have shown in recent years, the competition can be a perfect launchpad to reach greater heights.
France´s Nations League triumph in 2021 came just over a year before their run to the World Cup final in Qatar, where they lost on penalties to a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina. Spain, runners-up against France in 2021, beat Croatia on penalties to win the 2023 Nations League; a year later, the Spanish were crowned Euro 2024 champions.
While some of the larger nations have fielded experimental line-ups, recent winners have used the tournament to develop and improve. - The ´big titles´ - Of the final four, only Germany are yet to win a Nations League title, with Portugal´s success coming in the opening tournament in 2019.
Germany captain Joshua Kimmich will be handed his 100th international cap on Wednesday. The Bayern Munich midfielder is the 14th Germany player to reach the milestone, but will become the only member of the 100 club not to have won a World Cup.
Kimmich said Monday he “had a couple more chances” to correct the stat and said the Nations League would show how much progress Germany had made, after a disappointing decade.
“If it´s enough for the really big titles, we don´t know, it depends on a lot of factors.” World Cup winners in 2014, Germany crashed out of the following two World Cups at the group stage.
Their best result since a Euros semi-final in 2016 was going out in the quarters to eventual champions Spain at Euro 2024. “We want to go into the (World Cup) well prepared. We´ve said a few times that the preparation doesn´t start two weeks before, rather it´s already started,” Kimmich said.
“When we now compete in two internationals successfully, we can show we´re still on a good path.” Kimmich´s sentiment was echoed by coach Julian Nagelsmann on Friday, who said “we would love to win titles and keep feeding our self-confidence.
“Even if it´s only a small title, for us as a group it´s very important... Confidence and trust are fragile elements that require constant nourishment.” Coming at the end of a long club season, each of the final four are nursing injuries.

Govt launches sports initiative for FG schools’ students,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318227-govt-launches-sports-initiative-for-fg-schools-students,"ISLAMABAD: In a bold and visionary move to foster a culture of athleticism, health, and discipline among the youth, the Federal government Tuesday launched a major initiative aimed at transforming the sporting landscape of public education.
In a high-profile ceremony held at the prestigious Hamidi Hall of the Islamabad Sports Complex, the government officially handed over the first batch of 25,000 tracksuits and a wide range of sports equipment to the students from federal govt (FG) public schools in Islamabad.
The event was graced by Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah, who served as the chief guest and passionately reaffirmed the government’s unwavering commitment to youth development through sports.
In his address, the minister highlighted the far-reaching benefits of this initiative, calling it “a milestone in empowering the next generation with the tools and opportunities to thrive -- physically, mentally, and socially.”
As part of this transformative plan, the Islamabad Sports Complex -- a premier facility typically reserved for elite athletes -- will now be open free of charge to public school students. This unprecedented access to world-class sports infrastructure includes not only modern facilities but also the availability of certified professional trainers, who will coach and mentor students across various sports disciplines. The objective is to discover and nurture raw talent from a young age and propel students to national and even international sporting excellence.
“This is more than just the distribution of uniforms and equipment,” said Sanaullah. “This is an investment in our future Olympians, champions, and sports leaders. We are building a generation that is not only educated but also strong, disciplined, and driven.”
The ceremony was marked by vibrant displays of students’ enthusiasm, energetic response, and heartfelt gratitude from teachers. This groundbreaking move is part of a larger federal vision to integrate sports and physical wellness into the academic curriculum, instilling lifelong habits of health and fitness while fostering teamwork, perseverance, and national pride.
With the momentum generated by Tuesday’s event, the government is optimistic about rolling out similar initiatives across other regions of the country by using provincial governments’ platform.
As the applause echoed through the Hamidi Hall of the Islamabad Sports Complex, one thing was clear: Pakistan is ready to run, jump, and play its way to a brighter, healthier future. The event was attended by Farah Naz, Parliamentary Secretary for Education, and other dignitaries.
The Ministry for IPC is also planning to launch a sports summer camp, where FDE students will participate, further encouraging sports development. Secretary IPC Mohyuddin Wani also spoke on the occasion, highlighting the importance of keeping youth healthy and spotting the talent at early stage. The DG Pakistan Sports Board offered all kinds of assistance to school-going children to pick a sport of their choice and excel in it using Board facilities and technical support.

Former finalist Kyrgios out of Wimbledon with injury,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318228-former-finalist-kyrgios-out-of-wimbledon-with-injury,"SYDNEY: The 2022 Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios said Tuesday that he will miss this year´s tournament and the grass-court season after “a small setback” on his latest injury return.
The 30-year-old Australian has played very little tennis over the last two years because of various injuries, notably a wrist problem that required surgery. In March at the Miami Open he won his first singles match since 2022 but he pulled out of the ongoing French Open, where he had been down to play men´s doubles, with a knee injury. “I´ve hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won´t make it back for grass season this year,” he wrote on Instagram.
“I know how much you´ve all been looking forward to seeing me out there and I´m genuinely sorry to disappoint.”
Kyrgios, whose undoubted talent has often been overshadowed by his fragile temperament, added: “This is just a bump in the road though and I´m already working hard to get back stronger than ever.” Kyrgios reached the final at Wimbledon three years ago before going down in four sets to Novak Djokovic. The third Grand Slam of the year starts on June 30.

FIFA’s inaugural Club World Cup set to kick off in the US amid challenges,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318230-fifa-s-inaugural-club-world-cup-set-to-kick-off-in-the-us-amid-challenges,"LONDON: FIFA’s billion-dollar gamble to revolutionise club football begins a week on Sunday with plenty of cash up for grabs but questionable enthusiasm as 32 teams prepare to contest the expanded Club World Cup in 12 stadiums across the United States.
The tournament – designed as a glittering curtain-raiser for the 2026 World Cup – has had to contend with the prospect of empty seats along with controversial qualification rules and player welfare concerns after an exhausting European season.
Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami face Egypt’s Al Ahly in the opening fixture on June 14 in Miami, with tickets still widely available, while FIFA’s website shows seats can still be bought for the July 13 final at New Jersey’s MetLife Stadium.
FIFA said it was normal policy not to reveal details of ticket sales ahead of a tournament but pointed to the fact that tickets have been sold to fans in more than 130 countries as evidence of the CWC’s broad appeal.
Inter Miami controversially gained their slot by topping Major League Soccer’s regular season standings, despite then losing in the first round of the playoffs, in a decision critics say showed FIFA’s desperation to have the Argentina great at the showpiece.
Inter Miami were thus included as the host nation representative - instead of MLS champions LA Galaxy - with Los Angeles FC and Seattle Sounders making it three U.S. teams after qualifying through their Concacaf performances.
As well as the winners of each confederation’s premier club competition, teams qualified according to a ranking based on their performances over a four-year period. In another twist that went all the way to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Club Leon, the 2023 CONCACAF Champions Cup winners, were eventually excluded from the tournament due to having shared ownership with another qualifier.
Nailing down a last-gasp $1 billion TV rights deal with sports streaming platform DAZN six months before the tournament means a total of $2 billion in expected revenues. That led FIFA to announce a total prize pot of $1 billion, with the winning club to receive up to $125 million.
FIFA said there is also an unprecedented solidarity investment programme with a target of an extra $250 million provided to club football across the world and that all revenues from the tournament will be distributed to club football.
That prize pot might look mouth-watering for club owners but for many players it will feel like a step too far after a long season and the European arm of players’ union FIFPro and the European Leagues took legal action against FIFA over the issue.
In response, FIFA said it has “dozens of testimonies from players and coaches positively discussing the tournament” and said it was unfair to blame the CWC for calendar congestion. “It is a competitive tournament that takes place once every four years with a maximum of seven matches only for the two teams who reach the final,” a FIFA spokesman said.
FIFA has also given assurances that NFL stadiums hosting matches will meet their specifications, confirming all venues will feature natural grass and adhere to standard regulation dimensions following sub-par pitches at last season’s Copa America.
Divided into eight groups of four teams, top contenders include Real Madrid, winners of six of the last 12 Champions League titles, plus German champions Bayern Munich and 2023 Premier League and Champions League winners Manchester City.
European champions Paris St Germain are the in-form team heading into the tournament after their historic 5-0 thrashing of Inter Milan in the Champions League final on Saturday. But they must survive a tough Group B featuring South American and Brazilian champions Botafogo and 2024 CONCACAF winners Seattle Sounders plus Spanish giants Atletico Madrid.
Whether you call it soccer or football, for FIFA the tournament represents a dress rehearsal and a referendum on America’s appetite for the sport and on the world governing body’s vision for its commercial future ahead of the 2026 World Cup being co-hosted by the U.S., Mexico and Canada.
“It will usher in a new era for club football worldwide,” FIFA said in a statement. “It will be the greatest, most inclusive and merit-based global club competition in history, bringing together the most successful club sides from every continent to decide the true world champion at club level.”

Smoke from Canadian fires reaches Europe: EU climate monitor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318270-smoke-from-canadian-fires-reaches-europe-eu-climate-monitor,"PARIS: Heavy smoke from intense wildfires in Canada has reached northwestern Europe, the European Union´s climate monitoring service said on Tuesday.
The huge plumes are at very high altitude and do not pose an immediate health risk, it said in a statement. “Smoke originating from the wildfires in the Canadian provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan has been transported across the Atlantic,” the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) said.
Satellites tracked the smoke in mid-May, with some plumes reaching as far east as Greece and the eastern Mediterranean. “A second, much larger, smoke plume crossed the Atlantic during the last week of May, reaching northwestern parts of Europe on June 1,” CAMS said. Additional plumes are expected to shade the continent in the coming days. Wildfire smoke is comprised of gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide, along with water vapor and particle pollution, which can be particularly hazardous to health.

Dutch museum rolls out 200-year-old condom,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318271-dutch-museum-rolls-out-200-year-old-condom,"THE HAGUE: The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam on Tuesday placed on display a rare condom from around 1830, featuring an erotic print of a nun and three clergymen in provocative poses.
The ancient contraceptive is probably made from a sheep´s appendix and may be a souvenir from a brothel -- of which only two known copies exist, the museum said in a statement. “It shows that printmaking had many applications and offers insight into sexuality and prostitution in the 19th century,” according to the museum. The museum said it would display the sheath as part of an exhibit on 19th century prostitution and sexuality. The print on the condom shows a nun lifting up her skirt and pointing her finger at three clergymen, who also have their genitals on full display.

Saudi Arabia readies for ‘worst case scenario’ in sweltering Haj,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318272-saudi-arabia-readies-for-worst-case-scenario-in-sweltering-haj,"MINA, Saudi Arabia: Near a sprawling tent city outside Makkah, Saudi hospital staff are preparing for a flood of heat-related cases as Muslim pilgrims begin Haj this week in sweltering summer temperatures.
The Mina Emergency Hospital is one of 15 such facilities operating just a few weeks a year around the annual pilgrimage to Islam´s holiest sites, which in 2024 saw more than 1,300 people die in the desert heat.
Saudi authorities hope to head off a fatal repeat of last year´s pilgrimage, when temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 Fahrenheit). Temperatures this year are forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world´s largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, officially commences on Wednesday.
So far, authorities have recorded 44 cases of heat exhaustion. Abdullah Asiri, Saudi Arabia´s deputy minister for population health, told AFP at the Mina hospital that “the focus is on heat-related conditions because the Haj coincides with extreme heat”.
Brimming with staff but no patients just yet, the hospital is part of the kingdom´s efforts to prepare for “the worst case scenario” after pilgrims descend on Mina, Asiri said. Defying the scorching heat, pilgrims have already started to flock to Makkah.
As of Sunday, more than 1.4 million pilgrims had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the multi-day pilgrimage, according to officials. Makkah´s Grand Mosque is serviced by the largest cooling system in the world, according to Saudi state television, with enormous fans and cooled pavements dotting the massive complex.
But outside, hiding from the heat can prove challenging. Some pilgrims wear caps or carry umbrellas, but others walk on foot without any protection from the sun, like Palestinian Rabah Mansour, 70, who said that after a lifetime of working outside as a farmer, “heat doesn´t bother me”.
“I have been working in the fields since I was a child,” he said, as sweat trickled down his face. While many pilgrims may be overcome with religious fervour, Asiri warned devotees against unnecessarily exposing themselves to harsh conditions.
Badr Shreiteh, another Palestinian pilgrim, told AFP that he believed such hardships on the Haj trail would increase the blessings he reaps. “As you can see, we´re dripping with sweat,” he said, adding: “The more hardship we endure, the more reward we gain.”
According to Asiri, of the health ministry, a total of 50,000 healthcare workers and administrative staff have been mobilised for the Haj, far exceeding previous years´ numbers. More than 700 hospital beds are ready, equipped with fans to treat severe cases of heat illnesses.
“Capacity this year has been expanded by more than 60 percent compared to last year,” Asiri said, expecting greater numbers of patients. “That´s why we are doing all of these measures,” he said.
Last year, medical staff treated 2,764 pilgrims for heat exhaustion and other heat-related conditions, according to the health ministry. To prevent people from needing hospitalisation in the first place, 71 emergency medical points have been set up around Makkah´s holy sites with a focus on “treating patients on the ground before their case deteriorates”, said Asiri.

Dutch government falls as far-right leader Wilders quits coalition,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318273-dutch-government-falls-as-far-right-leader-wilders-quits-coalition,"THE HAGUE: Far-right leader Geert Wilders brought down the Dutch government on Tuesday by pulling out of a shaky coalition in a row over immigration, sparking a political crisis and likely heralding fresh elections.
The withdrawal came just weeks before a Nato summit in the Netherlands, and ushered in a period of uncertainty for the European Union´s fifth-largest economy and major exporter. After a stormy last-ditch meeting aimed at salvaging the four-party coalition, Wilders emerged to say he had no choice but to pull his ministers out of the cabinet.
“I signed up for the strictest asylum policy, not for the downfall of the Netherlands,” said Wilders, 61, whose far-right Freedom Party (PVV) handily won elections in November 2023. Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the decision as “unnecessary and irresponsible” and said he would offer the resignation of the PVV ministers to King Willem-Alexander.
“I will continue as a caretaker... until a new cabinet is in place. Because life in the Netherlands and abroad does go on,” he told reporters. Wilders had agreed with coalition partners to push through what he called the “strictest-ever immigration policy”, but he has since said the pace of its introduction had been too slow.
Eighteen months after that surprise election victory sent shockwaves through Europe, polls suggest his PVV is still the strongest party. However, the gap to his nearest rivals has narrowed, with the Green/Left party of former European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans following close behind. The liberal VVD party, a traditional powerhouse in Dutch politics, is also running near the top two, meaning any election would likely be closely fought.

Trump seeks to reshape judiciary as first nominees face Senate,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318274-trump-seeks-to-reshape-judiciary-as-first-nominees-face-senate,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s first batch of judicial nominees since returning to the White House is set to go before a US Senate panel as the Republican looks to further reshape a judiciary whose members have stymied parts of his agenda.
Five of the 11 judicial nominees Trump has announced so far are slated to appear on Wednesday before the Republican-led US Senate Judiciary Committee, which will weigh whether to recommend them for the full Senate’s consideration.
Those nominees all have conservative bona fides that their supporters say will help Trump shift the ideological balance of the judiciary further to the right after making 234 appointments in his first term, which was a near-record for a president’s first four years in office.
Trump’s first-term appointees included three members of the US Supreme Court, which since gaining a 6-3 conservative majority has curtailed abortion rights, rejected affirmative action policies on university campuses and limited the power of administrative agencies.
White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement that Trump was committed to “restoring integrity to the judicial system, which begins with appointing America First judges, not unelected politicians in robes.”

New Jersey mayor sues Trump officials over arrest at immigration centre,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318275-new-jersey-mayor-sues-trump-officials-over-arrest-at-immigration-centre,"WASHINGTON: The mayor of Newark, New Jersey sued two US law enforcement officials on Tuesday, alleging he was wrongly arrested and prosecuted as part of a politically motivated move by President Donald Trump’s administration.
The lawsuit from Democrat Ras Baraka, who is also running for New Jersey governor, alleges he was arrested for trespassing without cause and maliciously prosecuted following a tense confrontation last month at a privately run immigration detention centre in Newark.
The encounter drew widespread attention at a time of growing clashes between the Trump administration and Democrats over Trump’s hardline approach to immigration. The complaint names as defendants Alina Habba, the acting US attorney in New Jersey who brought the case and is a former personal lawyer to Trump, and Ricky Patel, a Department of Homeland Security official in Newark, who allegedly ordered the arrest.
In a post on X following reports that Baraka planned to sue, Habba said Baraka should “join me in prioritizing violent crime and public safety.” “Far better use of time for the great citizens of New Jersey,” she wrote.
Spokespeople for Habba’s office and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return requests for comment on Tuesday. Prosecutors dropped the case against Baraka 10 days after his arrest. Habba said the decision was made “for the sake of moving forward” but offered no further explanation. Her office then charged Democratic US Representative LaMonica McIver with assaulting and resisting officers who were trying to arrest Baraka.

"DR Congo, Colombia, Latvia among new UNSC members",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318276-dr-congo-colombia-latvia-among-new-unsc-members,"UNITED NATIONS, United States: The UN General Assembly on Tuesday elected five countries -- Bahrain, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Latvia and Liberia -- to serve as non-permanent Security Council members for the 2026-2027 term.
The Security Council, the international peace and security body of the United Nations, is comprised of 15 countries: permanent members Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, which each hold veto power; and 10 nations elected for staggered two-year terms.
Countries are elected by secret ballot, with seats allocated by regional groupings. The five nations elected Tuesday ran unopposed.

UN sees ‘alarming’ surge in Afghan families deported from Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318277-un-sees-alarming-surge-in-afghan-families-deported-from-iran,"KABUL: The UN on Tuesday voiced concern over a surge in Afghan families deported from Iran, recording a more than two-fold increase in May from the previous month, as the rise in returnees squeeze´s Afghanistan´s resources.
Afghanistan´s border points with Iran regularly see a steady stream of Afghans returning forcibly or voluntarily after crossing into the neighbouring country, often seeking work. But in May, there was “sharp rise in the forced return of Afghan nationals” from Iran, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a statement.
“Particularly alarming is a significant surge in the number of families being deported -- a new and concerning trend, as returnees deported in previous months were predominantly single young men,” it added.
The IOM said 15,675 Afghan families had crossed the border from Iran in May compared to 6,879 in April. The number of Afghan families without legal documentation in Iran returning to Afghanistan last month was three times higher than in May last year, it added.
According to the IOM, Iranian officials issued a public statement in late May ordering Afghans without documentation to remain in Iran to leave by July 6, “potentially affecting up to 4 million people”.

Over half of Europe and Mediterranean basin hit by drought in mid-May,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318280-over-half-of-europe-and-mediterranean-basin-hit-by-drought-in-mid-may,"PARIS: More than half, or 53 percent of land in Europe and the Mediterranean basin were hit by drought in mid-May, according to an AFP analysis of data from the European Drought Observatory (EDO) from May 11-20, 2025.
It was the highest level recorded for that period of time in the year since monitoring began in 2012, and more than 20 points higher than the average between 2012-2024. The EU´s Copernicus Climate Change Service, based on satellite imagery, takes into account three benchmarks: precipitations, or rainfall, soil moisture and the state of vegetation.
Between May 11-20, 42 percent of Europe´s soil and the Mediterranean basin were lacking in moisture, at a warning level, and five percent at alert level, signalling that vegetation was developping abnormally.

Obama says Republicans are putting millions of Americans’ healthcare at risk,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318281-obama-says-republicans-are-putting-millions-of-americans-healthcare-at-risk,"WASHINGTON: Barack Obama has warned that Congress is putting millions of Americans at risk of losing healthcare coverage, in a rare intervention from the former president as the Republican party advances legislation that would gut major provisions of the Affordable Care Act.
“Congressional Republicans are trying to weaken the Affordable Care Act and put millions of people at risk of losing their health care,” Obama posted on social media. “Call your Senators and tell them we can’t let that happen.”
The Republican bill, passed by the House last month and now in the Senate, would strip healthcare coverage from 10.7 million Americans over the next decade – the biggest reduction since the party’s failed attempt to repeal Obamacare in 2017.
