Guarding ideas,"US
.
In Pakistan's push toward a knowledge economy, universities must evolve from nurturing raw talent to safeguarding innovation. As a faculty member at a public-sector university where I have been teaching advanced courses for the last couple of decades, I've seen the urgent need to equip our brightest minds not only with scientific expertise but also with a solid grasp of Intellectual Property (IP) principles. In today's interconnected, competitive world, IP is an essential toolkit for every innovator, entrepreneur and researcher.
At its core, IP refers to the legal rights that protect creations born of human ingenuity. From the blueprint of a novel solar cell to the software that analyses medical-imaging data, IP rights ensure that inventors and creators maintain ownership of their work. These rights fall into several broad categories: copyrights, which safeguard literary and artistic expressions; trademarks, which distinguish brands through names and logos; design rights, which preserve the unique appearance of products; patents, which grant exclusive commercialisation of novel inventions; and trade secrets, which shield proprietary processes and know-how. In an era when ideas can traverse global supply chains overnight, an understanding of these protections is vital for researchers who hope to translate their breakthroughs into real-world impact.
Universities in developing nations often focus their curricula on technical competencies (i.e. mathematical models, experimental design, data analysis, etc) yet too frequently overlook the legal and business acumen needed to shepherd innovations from the lab bench to the marketplace. Without this knowledge, students risk seeing their hard-won discoveries appropriated by better-resourced organisations, or they may fail to navigate the complex pathways of patent filing, licensing negotiations and technology transfer. Worse still, a lack of IP awareness can breed academic misconduct, from inadvertent plagiarism to unethical appropriation of colleagues' work.
By embedding a dedicated IP course into the core curriculum for science, engineering, business and law students, we can cultivate a generation of scholars who are as fluent in patent strategy as they are in differential equations. Such a course should blend theory with hands-on experience: analysing landmark IP disputes, drafting mock patent applications and collaborating with industry partners on real-life licensing scenarios.
The benefits of IP literacy extend far beyond individual career advancement. When students understand how to secure and manage their intellectual assets, universities - and by extension, our nation — reap substantial rewards. Effective IP management attracts investment from venture capitalists and multinational companies, keen to back projects with clear legal foundations. It paves the way for spin-off companies, generating employment and fostering an entrepreneurial ecosystem. Moreover, by respecting copyright and trademark laws, academic institutions reinforce a culture of integrity and fair collaboration, both within Pakistan and on the international stage.
Of course, integrating IP education is not without challenges. Many universities lack faculty with specialised background in IP law, and devising an interdisciplinary syllabus that addresses the needs of engineers, scientists and business students can be daunting. Yet these hurdles are surmountable through collaboration: partnering with law schools, engaging government agencies such as the Intellectual Property Organisation of Pakistan and leveraging online modules developed by global bodies like World Intellectual Property Organization. Such alliances can deliver robust, context-relevant training without overburdening existing faculty.
In today's knowledge economy, students must not only develop but also protect and commercialise innovations. IP education should stand alongside core scientific and technical disciplines as a foundational course, empowering innovators to turn ideas into progress and drive sustainable growth.

Dar-led body to oversee funding strategies for dams,"US
PM wants recommendations within 72 hours
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday termed India's unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) as ""a blatant violation and act of water aggression"" and warned that Pakistan will give a befitting response under the decisions taken in the April 24 National Security Committee (NSC) meeting.
Chairing a high-level meeting on water resources at the Prime Minister's House, he vowed that, just as Pakistan achieved victory in the recent war, it would also triumph on the water front.
Emphasising the urgency of enhancing water storage, PM Shehbaz Sharif ordered the establishment of a high-powered committee under Deputy PM Ishaq Dar to oversee funding strategies for new dam projects.
The committee will include all provincial chief ministers, the Prime Minister of AJK, and relevant federal ministers, and is directed to submit its recommendations within 72 hours.
""We will prioritize the construction of non-controversial reservoirs. Wherever there is unanimity, we must act without delay. These dams are not political - they are a national necessity,"" the Prime Minister said.
He made it clear that any project with cross-provincial consensus will be fast-tracked and completed on a priority basis.
A detailed briefing was given during the meeting on Pakistan's water infrastructure. Officials informed the participants that the construction of the Diamer-Bhasha dam is underway and expected to be completed by 2032, while the Mohmand dam is likely to be completed by 2027.
Currently, Pakistan has 11 dams with a total storage capacity of 15.318 million acre-feet. Under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), 32 small and large dams are under construction, while 79 projects are underway under annual development programs.
""This is a battle of justice, and like every battle we have fought with unity, we will defeat India's water aggression with resolve and wisdom,"" said the prime minister.
He emphasised that living nations confront challenges head-on and make strategic, lasting decisions to protect their future generations.
PM Shehbaz Sharif said that the Indian threats to weaponise water by attempting to violate the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty are increasing each day. He highlighted that the treaty, a binding international agreement, does not allow any party to unilaterally withdraw, and India's claims are politically and legally hollow.
All provincial chief ministers, along with the leadership of AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan, strongly condemned India's water threats and unanimously reaffirmed their support for the federal government's position.
The Prime Minister lauded this united stance, calling it ""a reflection of our collective national resolve to protect Pakistan's water security"".
PM Shehbaz also pointed to the serious problem of silting in existing reservoirs like Tarbela and Mangla, which has drastically reduced their water retention capacities. He said bold decisions must be taken now, or history will judge today's leadership harshly.
""We owe it to our 240 million people to act decisively. This is not about politics — it's about survival. The future generations must remember this leadership with respect for the choices we make today,"" he declared.
PM Shehbaz congratulated the Finance Minister, Economic Affairs Minister, and relevant secretaries for successfully securing loans from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank despite strong Indian lobbying. ""India tried to sabotage our projects at the ADB for three days, but failed. Our diplomatic victory is a testament to Pakistan's principled stand and growing credibility,"" he noted.
Concluding the meeting, the Prime Minister reaffirmed his unwavering belief in the collective strength of Pakistan's national, provincial, and military leadership. ""Just as our brave armed forces stood firm in the battlefield, we must now stand united in securing every drop of water for our people,"" he said.
The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Field Marshal COAS General Asim Munir, Defense Minister Khawaja Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Power Minister Owais Leghari, Water Resources Minister Muneeb Wattoo, and other key federal cabinet members. Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, AJK PM Anwarul Haq, and GB Chief Minister Gulbar Khan were also present, along with senior civil and military officials.

Karachi tremors,"DE
.
Karachi continues to tremble under a series of light to moderate earthquakes, with 27 tremors recorded across Malir, DHA, Quaidabad, Korangi and Gadap neighbourhoods for four days in a row since Sunday. Officials attribute this surge in seismic activity to the reactivation of the Landhi fault line — a dormant structure that now appears to be stirring.
While the National Tsunami Center has described the gradual release of underground energy as a ""natural process"" that may reduce the risk of a major quake, the reactions among experts and residents suggest a deeper uncertainty. The confusion is real and growing. Some scientists insist this is not unusual — that Karachi, though not a seismic hotspot, does occasionally experience such activity.
Others argue that the frequency and intensity of these tremors are unprecedented for the city. Meanwhile, social media is rife with speculation and conflicting information. Amid all this noise, one cannot ignore that Karachi's preparedness is dangerously inadequate. Despite being home to over 20 million people, the city has no cohesive earthquake response strategy.
Construction in many areas remains unregulated, and buildings are not designed with seismic resilience in mind. If these tremors are, in fact, part of a larger seismic shift, Karachi and its people are not ready.
Regardless of whether this recent activity is a harmless discharge of tectonic pressure or a warning sign of worse to come, the city's response cannot be shaped by guesswork. Authorities must act on the side of caution. A full geological assessment, updated seismic risk maps, mandatory building inspections and emergency preparedness drills must become immediate priorities. Karachi may or may not be entering a new seismic chapter, but the complacency we've seen so far must end.

Stitching costs surge ahead of Eid,"US
Customers express frustration over rising charges and closed bookings at tailor shops
With Eidul Azha fast approaching, tailors across the country are facing criticism for overcharging customers and refusing new orders amid a surge in demand for festive clothing.
Reports suggest that many tailors have significantly increased their stitching ratessome by as much as Rs200 to 500 per suit — citing overwhelming workloads and seasonal pressure. Several shops have even stopped accepting new orders altogether, posting signs declaring ""Booking Closed"" outside their premises.
Tanzeela, a frustrated customer, shared her experience: ""I've visited several tailor shops, but none are accepting orders. It feels like they're picking and choosing their customers."" She added that the situation has become increasingly stressful for many families, especially those with limited means.
Another customer, Sundas, echoed the sentiment, saying, ""I had to pay Rs500 extra for a simple shalwar kameez just because it's Eid season. As the sole breadwinner for my family, stitching clothes for four children and myself is a major financial burden.""
Tailors, however, defend the price hikes. ""Our workload doubles during the Eid season,"" said Ahmed, a local tailor. ""We're not trying to fleece anyone. We're working round the clock, and if we don't charge a bit more, we can't maintain the quality or meet deadlines.""
Despite the justification, many customers are calling on authorities to regulate tailoring rates during peak seasons to prevent exploitation and ensure affordability for all.

FX dips by $7m as SBP plans Rs4.35tr auction,"US
Reserves decrease to $11.5b while gold jumps Rs4,300, silver hits 13-year high
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported a marginal decline in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending May 30, 2025, with holdings falling by $7 million to $11.5 billion. Total liquid foreign reserves stood at $16.6 billion, including $5.1 billion held by commercial banks.
The slight dip comes as Pakistan continues to navigate external debt repayments and manage its current account as the country relies on inflows from multilateral institutions and overseas remittances to strengthen its external sector.
As part of its liquidity management, the SBP also released its auction calendar for government securities from June to August 2025, targeting Rs4.35 trillion in borrowing. This includes auctions for Market Treasury Bills (MTBs), fixed-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), and floating-rate PIBs.
The total maturing amount for MTBs during this period is Rs3.063 trillion, while the SBP has set a slightly lower auction target of Rs2.85 trillion. The issuance is spread across tenors: Rs750 billion each for 1-month and 3-month papers, Rs625 billion for 6-month, and Rs725 billion for 12-month instruments.
For longer-term financing, the SBP plans to raise Rs900 billion via fixed-rate PIBs — Rs300 billion for 2-year bonds and Rs150 billion each for 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year tenors. An additional Rs600 billion will be raised through 10-year floating-rate PIBs. The grand total of all planned auctions stands at Rs4.35 trillion, reflecting the government's financing requirements and the SBP's liquidity management strategy.
Meanwhile, domestic bullion prices surged on Thursday, tracking international market gains driven by safe-haven demand. However, gains in gold were later pared after news of a phone conversation between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Donald Trump signalled a possible thaw in trade tensions.
The price of 24-karat gold rose by Rs4,300 per tola to Rs358,400, according to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association. Ten-gram gold rose by Rs3,687 to Rs307,270. The metal had remained flat a day earlier at Rs354,100 per tola.
Silver also gained strongly, hitting a 13-year global high as it crossed $35 per ounce. In the local market, silver prices rose by Rs159 to Rs3,745 per tola.
Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, said gold traded between $3,360 and $3,403 globally. ""Tomorrow's US non-farm payroll data will be key in setting gold's direction,"" he noted, adding that ""The Xi-Trump call has sparked speculation about easing trade tensions. Trump is expected to hold a press conference in the next few hours. If there's any positive announcement, gold could ease further.""
The rupee also posted a mild gain, appreciating by 0.02% to close at 282.17 against the US dollar, up five paisas from the previous day.

Brilliant boxer Waseem's world title celebrated,"US
Japanese CG holds reception to honour boxer for Quetta feat
""I am very proud of Waseem, I am not a big fan of sports but I am very impressed with Waseem's achievements,"" The Consulate General of Japan in Karachi Hattori Masaru was brimming with joy and delight as he hosted the recently crowned World Boxing Association bantamweight champion Muhammad Waseem at the reception on June 3 at his residence.
The meeting and dinner were held to celebrate the Pakistani ace boxer's feat, which he achieved on May 10 in Quetta, where he defeated Venezuela's Wiston Orono with a knockout in the ninth round.
Waseem had fulfilled his lifelong dream to win a world title in his hometown of Quetta, and he managed to bring several international boxers and officials from around the world to his city despite the aerial war that was taking place between India and Pakistan at the time.
Mr. Hattori was honouring Waseem on Tuesday, emphasising the role the 37-year-old pugilist is playing in bridging the gap between Japan and Pakistan. Waseem has spent years training in Japan since 2015 onwards.
The training in Japan gave him the foundation as he switched to professional boxing from amateur in 2015.
Waseem's reception by the Japanese Consulate General was a mix of tribute to both Japan and Waseem's deep-rooted connection to Karachi, which had been his home and grooming ground after his home Quetta.
""It is my honour to welcome the champion,"" Hattori told this correspondent. ""He knows Japan so well and he is also a world champion, as a Jqapanse I am very much happy that he got the champion belt.""
At the dinner, Mr. Hattori was also accompanied by Mr Nakagawa Yasushi and Kumagae Takahiro. Waseem also invited his friend Farid Khan and this correspondent to attend the reception.
Nakagawa, who is also a friend of Waseem's added that he insisted that the former two-time World Boxing Council Silver Flyweight champion bring his friends along at the intimate meeting which was followed by a traditional Kaiseki menu.
Waseem is also in the middle of planning his next bout and he will aim to consolidate his world championship titles, where he would want to not only retain his WBA belt, which he had brought in a silver briefcase to show Mr. Hattori and his friends at the dinner, but he would want the WBC, World Boxing Oraganisation and the International Boxing Federation titles too.
He is hoping to fight with Japan's multi-weight world champion Junto Nakatani.
Mr Hattori shared his experience of Karachi and Pakistan since he was appointed a year and a half ago.
""Karachi is a very cosmopolitan city, and every night and weekend there are events. But when it comes to sports here in Pakistan, I watched the softball event that I enjoyed very much. It was held by the Pakistan Softball Federation,"" said Hattori, who is a baseball fan himself.
""Pakistan is totally different from Japanese customs and culture,"" he said when asked about how he would describe Pakistan to the world. ""It is also the home to Indus Valley Civilisation, Japanese people know it well and we teach our children about it in junior high school, so people know about it well.
When it comes to having cultural exchange through sports Mr Hattori added: ""There are so many Japanese-oriented sports that are taken up by Pakistanis like Jiu-jitsu and Karate, so Pakistani people know about Japanese culture and that helps.""
Meanwhile, Waseem added that he wanted to thank the consulate officials.
""The Japanese always respect the sportspersons and especially boxing, I have always been welcomed and respected by Mye Nakagawa, who is a great friend of mine, and by the Japanese Consulate, they have always supported me.
""I am also looking for a fight, hopefully with Nakatani, but nothing is confirmed yet, I might know about it by next week or so,"" said Waseem.
Waseem, also known as Falcon, will be flying out to the United Kingdom for further training by the end of this month.
Meanwhile, Nakagawa concluded with encouraging words, ""I'm greatly honored to have such a great athlete and a pride of Pakistan as a friend. I wish all him best and more success. And go on further, go Falcon, go.""

Anger as US blocks Gaza ceasefire resolution,"US
Pak envoy terms failed resolution moral stain
UN Security Council members criticised the United States Wednesday after it vetoed a resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza, which Washington said undermined ongoing diplomacy.
It was the 15-member body's first vote on the situation since November, when the United States -- a key Israeli ally -- also blocked a text calling for an end to fighting.
""Today, the United States sent a strong message by vetoing a counterproductive UN Security Council resolution on Gaza targeting Israel,"" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement after Wednesday's 14 to 1 vote.
He said Washington would not support any text that ""draws a false equivalence between Israel and Hamas, or disregards Israel's right to defend itself.
""The United States will continue to stand with Israel at the UN.""
The draft resolution had demanded ""an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza respected by all parties.""
It also called for the ""immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all hostages held by Hamas and other groups,"" and demanded the lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Hamas, whose unprecedented attack inside Israel on October 7, 2023 sparked the war, condemned the ""disgraceful"" US veto, reiterating accusations of ""genocide"" in Gaza, something Israel vehemently rejects.
The veto ""marks a new stain on the ethical record of the United States of America,"" the group said in a statement, accusing Washington of ""legitimizing genocide, supporting aggression, and rationalizing starvation, destruction, and mass killings.""
Pakistan's ambassador to the UN Asim Ahmad meanwhile said the failed resolution would ""remain not only a moral stain on the conscience of this council, but a fateful moment of political application that will reverberate for generations"".
China's ambassador to the UN Fu Cong said: ""today's vote result once again exposes that the root cause of the council's inability to quell the conflict in Gaza is the repeated obstruction by the US.""
The veto marks Washington's first such action since US President Donald Trump took office in January. Israel has faced mounting international pressure to end its war in Gaza.
That scrutiny has increased over flailing aid distribution in Gaza, which Israel blocked for more than two months before allowing a small number of UN vehicles to enter in mid-May.
The United Nations, which warned last month the entire population in the besieged Palestinian territory was at risk of famine, said trickle was far from enough to meet the humanitarian needs.

Rawalpindi goes full 'bakra mode',"US
Soaring prices, traffic jams and overcrowding mark start of peak buying season
A record number of citizens headed to cattle markets to purchase sacrificial animals of their choice on Thursday.
A large number of animals have already arrived for sale at all 23 small and large cattle markets across the city and district. The markets will remain open from 8am to 2am late at night.
As Eidul Azha draws closer, despite official restrictions, the sale of small and large sacrificial animals has started in marketplaces, street corners and vacant plots across the city effectively turning the entire city into a livestock market.
In Rawalpindi, animals are being sold on major roads, intersections and within densely populated residential areas. Due to the central cattle market at Bhatta Chowk being located 20 to 25 kilometres from the city and the resulting high transportation costs, many citizens are now preferring to buy animals from local neighbourhoods and nearby areas.
After the district administration's announcement, the District Council has also declared six official cattle market sites within its jurisdiction, leading to a heavy influx of animals in these areas as well.
Currently, cattle markets are active across Rawalpindi city and its outskirts including Ghazni Road, Bagh Sardaran, Pirwadhai, IJP Road, New Katarian, Dhok Hassu, Dhok Dalal, Khayaban-e-Sir Syed, Railway Road Bakery Chowk, the area behind the High Court, Swan Camp, Rawat, GT Road, Adiala Road, Chakri Road, Chohar Chowk, Chungi No. 22, Bakra Mandi, Dhok Syedan Road, Chaklala, Dhok Lalyal, Bhatta Mandi, Rahimabad Bridge, Tarnol Phatak, Peshawar Road Pirwadhai, Dhok Chohdrian Car Chowk, and in the tehsils of Chhani Pul, Gujar Khan, Kahuta, Kallar Syedan, Kotli Sattian and Taxila.
Traffic jams are widespread around market areas and adjacent roads. The large number of loader vehicles, rickshaws and Qingqi rickshaws has made it difficult for people to move and even ambulances are getting stuck in traffic. Due to the constant arrival and departure of animals, the roads inside and around the cattle markets are littered with animal waste. Although traffic wardens have been deployed, the situation has spiralled out of control due to the overwhelming rush.
Meanwhile, animal prices are skyrocketing. Bulls and cows are being sold for between Rs300,000 to Rs1.5 million, goats and sheep range from Rs150,000 to Rs500,000, while camels are priced between Rs500,000 and Rs1.5 million.
Markets choked with Eid rush
Our Correspondent
RAWALPINDI: Due to the heavy Eidul Azha shopping rush, traffic came to a standstill across all commercial centres, markets, and plazas in Rawalpindi. With today being both Friday and Chand Raat (the night before Eid), additional security arrangements have been made in the markets.
All major shopping areas will remain open until 2am tonight. Saddar bazaars have been made one-way to manage the flow. Severe congestion was reported in Commercial Market, Murree Road, Saddar, Tench Bhatta, Bara Market, Raja Bazaar, and Moti Bazaar — the latter being a popular shopping spot for women. Pedestrian movement became extremely difficult due to overcrowding.
Incidents of purse snatching in Moti Bazaar have increased, prompting the deployment of female police officers in the area. On Thursday as well, markets remained packed with shoppers, with widespread encroachments and traffic jams. Despite the presence of traffic wardens, they were rendered ineffective due to the chaos. Illegal parking further worsened the situation.
High demand pushes up slaughter charges
Our Correspondent
RAWALPINDI: With just one day left before Eidul Azha, butchers in Rawalpindi have significantly hiked their charges for slaughtering sacrificial animals, setting new records in rates.
Due to high demand, bookings for the first day of Eid have already been closed. Butchers have introduced separate pricing for each of the three days of Eid, with further distinctions for morning and post-Maghrib (evening) slaughter.
Temporary butchers from nearby areasparticularly from Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's adjoining districts such as Haripur, Abbottabad, and Havelianhave also entered the market to earn during Eid. Many have shared their phone numbers and services on social media.
According to current rates, slaughter and meat preparation of a cow or bull will cost Rs22,000 (in morning) and Rs20,000 (in evening), and for a goat or sheep Rs6,000 on first day of Eid.
Butchers will charge Rs20,000 for cow/bull (in morning) and Rs18,000 (in evening), and Rs4,500 to Rs5,000 for goat/sheep. For the third day of Eid: rates for cow/bull will be Rs15,00016,000, and goat/sheep Rs4,000.

Brazil's funk star's arrest sparks censorship debate,"US
MC Poze de Rodo was arrested for glorifying crime
The arrest of a popular funk singer in Brazil on suspicion of glorifying a powerful crime gang has revived a long-standing debate over the criminalisation of a genre born in Rio de Janeiro's gritty favelas, or slums.
Unlike its US namesake, which was popularised by James Brown, Rio funk borrows more from hip-hop, blended with samba and other Brazilian rhythms.
The lyrics, seen by many as celebrating favela drug lords, have repeatedly led to calls for songs to be censored.
Last week, MC Poze do Rodo, one of the genre's best-known artists with 16 million followers on Instagram, was arrested on charges of glorifying crime and having links to Comando Vermelho (CV), one of Brazil's biggest gangs.
The police argue that Poze's music ""clearly condones"" drug trafficking and illegal use of firearms and point to concerts held ""exclusively in areas dominated by CV, with a notable presence of traffickers armed with high-calibre weapons.""
After five days in preventive custody, the 26-year-old singer was released on Tuesday to a rapturous welcome from waiting fans, who swarmed his car in a column of motorbikes.
Speaking afterwards, the singer claimed he was the victim of police discrimination.
""Rio de Janeiro police don't like me... because I'm black? Because I'm from a favela?""
Marlon Brendon Coelho Couto was born in the favela of Rodo, one of the biggest in western Rio. He has admitted to selling drugs in his youth but says that he abandoned crime to devote himself to music.
Police footage of his arrest at his current home in the upmarket Recreio dos Bandeirantes district, cuffed and shirtless, surrounded by heavily armed officers, caused an outcry among his fans.
Fellow musicians took part in a campaign for his release, organised by his wife, influencer Viviane Noronha, on the grounds that ""funk singers are not criminals.""
The debate surrounding funk's role in crime mirrors long-standing discussions in the United States over the links between rap and violence in Black communities.
Danilo Cymrot, a doctor in criminology at the University of Sao Paulo, pointed to a ""grey area"" in the definition of glorification of violence, relating to artistic content.
""The artist doesn't necessarily agree with his lyrics,"" Cymrot, author of a book about Rio funk, said.
He added that ""oftentimes, the police and the judiciary have a hard time understanding funk as a work of art.""
As a result, he said, the artist's origins are often used to determine whether he condones violence.
""It's less the message itself and more who is singing it.""

NEPRA approves Rs50b write-off for KE,"US
Regulator clears part of KE's Rs76b claim for FY2017-23 amid investor concerns, operational challenges
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) approved on Thursday a write-off amount of Rs50.013 billion for K-Electric (KE) under the Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) period of FY2017 to FY2023. While still an acknowledgment, it is much less than what KE had asked for despite meeting NEPRA's strict guidelines on what constitutes prudent cost recovery.
The approved amount is part of the broader claim of Rs76 billion submitted by KE, for which NEPRA hearings were held in December 2024 and April 2025. Ensuring the write-off amount pertaining to unrecovered dues comprised an extensive process of meeting stringent conditions, including verification of essential documents, multiple recovery efforts, disconnections, and KE's Board certifying that all reasonable and best possible recovery efforts were undertaken.
The approved write-offs are strictly based on criteria laid out in KE's NEPRA-approved write-off policy and have undergone rigorous internal and external audits, including physical surveys and consumer-level documentation checks.
During the hearings, KE officials had stressed that these unrecovered amounts were not a result of inefficiency but a reflection of ground realities, such as the presence of unplanned settlementsslumsleading to operational challenges in areas where recoveries are no longer possible due to demolition, migration, or theft. Hearing discussions also included matters like the circular debt, which KE highlighted it had no contribution to.
Interveners and commenters shared their statements and opinions regarding KE's write-off claims. Sheikh M Tehseen, President of the Federal B Area Association of Trade & Industry (FBATI), mentioned that KE's financial sustainability and investment plans were dependent on write-off claims, while emphasising that under the current tariff framework, any such claims should be resolved fairly, recognising that 100% recovery in a city like Karachi is unrealistic.
Similarly, the President of the SITE Association of Industry, in his letter, had expressed support for a timely resolution of KE's write-off claims, emphasising the need to maintain KE's operational stability while protecting industrial stakeholders from additional financial burden, and urging NEPRA to ensure a balanced decision that supported uninterrupted industrial operations and served the greater public interest.
The Secretary General of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce & Industry (OICCI) highlighted KE's investments since privatisation and wrote about its performance as a benchmark for future investors, mentioning that NEPRA's decision would set the mood for the privatisation of DISCOs. He stated that a fair evaluation and subsequent decision would support foreign direct investment (FDI) and restore investor confidence in the energy sector.
The last few days have witnessed approvals and decisions by NEPRA for KE's critical matters, including the determination of its transmission, distribution, and supply tariffs, with the write-off decision being the latest in this series.

"Stricter waste regulations at coasts, ports urged","PK
Minister outlines $1b investment plans, need for reduction of freight charges, local capacity expansion
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has issued a clarion call for urgent, coordinated action to combat plastic pollution and modernise Pakistan's maritime infrastructure. In a statement released on World Environment Day, the minister urged alignment of maritime policies with global climate goals to safeguard the country's over 1,000-km coastline and marine biodiversity.
Highlighting the 2025 World Environment Day theme, ""Beat Plastic Pollution,"" Chaudhry outlined the transition from a wasteful ""take-make-dispose"" economic model to a circular one focused on reuse, recycling, and sustainable alternatives. He noted that the ministry has already planted millions of mangrove saplings, which serve as natural barriers against pollution and vital nurseries for marine life.
""Pakistan's Indus Delta hosts one of the world's largest mangrove ecosystems. Our restoration efforts, with support from local communities and international partners, are vital to coastal resilience,"" he said. The ministry is also working with port authorities and shipping stakeholders to enforce stricter waste regulations.
In a separate engagement, Chaudhry addressed key figures from Pakistan's shipping industry at a dinner hosted by Aasim A Siddiqui, Managing Director of Pakistan Intermodal Limited. Stressing that over 90% of Pakistan's trade moves through seaports, he highlighted the sector's contribution of more than 10% to GDP and employment for over two million people.
He noted that Karachi Port Trust alone can handle 125 million tonnes of cargo annually, and the shipping sector earned $235 million in revenue in 2023, largely from oil tankers. However, he warned that Pakistan still spends $68 billion annually on foreign freight charges and called for expanding local shipping capacities.
A $1 billion fast-track investment initiative with Hutchison Port Holdings to upgrade Karachi's terminals was also discussed. Chaudhry assured stakeholders of continued collaboration and policy coordination to foster sustainable growth.

Emissions certification misses the mark,"US
The recently launched pilot project fails to address pollution instigated by motorcycles, rickshaws and fuel
Lahore, which battles severe smog each fall season, is once again initiating measures to curb environmental pollution by conducting emissions testing and certification of four-wheel vehicles. Critics, however, have argued that the project overlooks the role of key polluters in instigating air pollution.
Under a pilot project, vehicles in Lahore are undergoing emissions testing after which they receive a green sticker with a QR code on their windshield, confirming that they meet environmental emission standards. However, this testing is currently limited to four-wheeled vehicles, excluding motorcycles and rickshaws, which significantly contribute to pollution. As per statistics obtained from the Punjab Excise Department, the province has 20 million registered motorcycles and 5 million four-wheeled vehicles, with Lahore alone accounting for 5.2 million motorcycles and 1.3 million four-wheeled vehicles.
According to Secretary of Environment Raja Jahanzaib Anwar, the current emissions testing initiative falls under the Vehicle Inspection and Certification System (VIC). ""A decade ago, the Punjab government had established 32 VIC stations across the province through a public-private partnership (PPP). These stations evaluated nine key parameters, including smoke emissions and overall vehicle fitness. However, with the rapid increase in the number of vehicles, the VIC system became overwhelmed. To ease the burden on the Transport Department, the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) has taken over the responsibility for emissions testing, with nine dedicated stations across Lahore, offering free services to the public. This complimentary testing facility will remain available until June 30th,"" claimed Anwar.
According to the Environment Department, vehicles that exceed permissible emission limits are denied certification and instructed to undergo necessary repairs. This system is expected to be fully operational before the upcoming smog season. Vehicles without certification will face restricted movement and may be subject to substantial fines.
Despite the well-intended plan devised by the EPA, key stakeholders in the automotive industry are not too optimistic about the success of the pilot project. Suneel Sarfraz Munj, Chairman of Pak Wheelsa leading vehicle marketplacehighlighted the fact that 60 per cent of road traffic in Pakistan consisted of two- and three-wheelers, which were among the biggest contributors to vehicular smoke emissions. ""Apart from this, we have to focus on improving our petrol and diesel quality. Until fuel quality improves, vehicle certification will not be beneficial. As an analogy, using poor fuel in clean vehicles is as futile as serving bad food in clean dishes,"" explained Munj.
On the other hand, Dawar Hamid Butt, Coordinator of the Pakistan Air Quality Experts Group, considered this initiative a promising pilot project. ""I hope this initiative will deliver positive results and pave the way for broader efforts to protect large cities like Lahore from worsening air quality,"" he added.
Furthermore, many experts have opined that during emissions testing and certification, it was crucial to consider the engine quality, which should be at least Euro III since engines with lower standards emitted more pollutants. Apparently, engines with Euro II or lower standards, such as two-stroke rickshaws, old motorcycles, and vehicles over 25 years old, emit hazardous gases like nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. In contrast, vehicles with modern engines significantly reduce emissions.

Cattle traders draw public rage,"PK
With Eid just around the corner, sacrificial animals are being sold at unregulated prices without proper health test
With Eid-ul-Adha approaching, cattle markets across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) are bustling with activity. However, the exorbitant prices and absence of proper health measures in these markets has raised concerns among buyers and animal health experts alike.
Peshawar's district administration has officially designated two major cattle markets for the festive season, with one on the Ring Road and the other in Lala Kalay.
These markets draw livestock from across the country, including Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, and various other regions of Punjab.
However, traders bringing in animals sell them at significantly high prices, often without regulatory oversight.
Muhammad Haroon Khan, a resident of Peshawar who visited the Ring Road market to purchase a sacrificial animal, told The Express Tribune that livestock prices have skyrocketed over the past one year. ""A regular-sized animal that would cost around Rs2 to 3 lakhs last year is now priced between Rs3 to 5 lakhs. Even smaller animals like sheep and goats are selling for Rs1 to 5 lakhs each.
The administration charges Rs1,500 per animal from the traders, yet provides no veterinary check-ups or relief for the public. There are no veterinarians on-site to assess the animals' health,"" claimed Khan.
Naeemullah Khan, another visitor from Peshawar, echoed similar concerns.
""There is no price regulation. Each seller demands whatever price they want, with some asking up to Rs10 lakh for a small animal. The government should implement a check and balance system. The Livestock Department has resources, but where is their performance? If the department were to invest in developing local livestock farms and supporting dairy farming within the province, it would not only create employment but also ensure affordable animals are available for Eid each year. This would also boost the provincial economy,"" noted Naemullah.
On the other side of the rift are the livestock traders. Ramzan Ali, a cattle trader, who brought animals from Multan to Peshawar, defended the high prices. ""There's a narrative in the media that traders are exploiting buyers, but the reality is different. We ourselves have purchased these animals at very high prices. We are not in the business for losses; we only seek fair profit. Rising operational costs including fuel prices, transport expenses, and labour charges have all gone up. If the government can reduce fuel costs or standardize transport fares, the prices of animals will naturally decrease,"" explained Ali.
When approached for a comment, a senior official from the Livestock Department, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told The Express Tribune that the department had taken steps to ensure animal welfare in the markets.
""We have assigned a veterinary doctor and a disinfection spray team to each market. If an animal is found sick, free medicines are provided. Banners with hygiene guidelines have been placed around the cattle markets, and public awareness campaigns are underway to educate people on preventing the spread of diseases, including the potentially fatal Congo virus. So far, no cases have been reported in K-P this season, but we are actively working to raise awareness and keep the public informed,"" said the official, who maintained that despite limited resources, the Livestock Department was striving to provide as many services as possible.
As the countdown to Eid-ul-Adha continues, citizens remain hopeful that better regulation and government oversight will make the festive sacrifice more accessible and safer for everyone.

UN says malnutrition rate among Gaza children triples,"FR
.
The rate of children suffering from acute malnutrition in Gaza has nearly tripled since a ceasefire earlier this year when aid flowed more freely, according to data collected by humanitarian groups and released by the UN on Thursday.
The report was issued at a time when aid distribution in the Palestinian enclave is under intense scrutiny because of deadly shootings close to the operations of a new US-backed system. After the two-month ceasefire broke down in March, Israel blockaded aid supplies into Gaza for 11 weeks.
Israel, which has only partially lifted the blockade since, vets all aid into Gaza and accuses Hamas of stealing some of it – something the group denies. Around 5.8% out of nearly 50,000 children under five who were screened in the second half of May were diagnosed with acute malnutrition.
This was up from 4.7% in early May and nearly three times the rate in February during a pause in fighting in the 20-month war between Israel and Hamas, an analysis by a group of UN and other aid agencies known as the nutrition cluster showed.
The analysis also reported an increase in severe acute malnutrition cases among childrena life-threatening condition that compromises the immune system. A Palestinian minister reported 29 starvation-related deaths among the children and elderly in just a few days last month.
The report stated that the centres to support medical complications from severe cases in north Gaza and Rafah in the south of the enclave have been forced to close, leaving children without access to lifesaving treatment

Hospitals fail to maintain infection control amid bed shortages,"US
Officials at public hospitals say they are making difficult decisions to save lives
Severe overcrowding and an acute shortage of hospital beds in the major public healthcare facilities of the metropolitan city have made effective infection control virtually impossible, posing serious risks to both patients and medical staff.
In the emergency wards of Civil Hospital and the National Institute of Child Health, the situation has reached alarming levels, with two or more patients routinely forced to share a single bed. In some cases at NICH, three to four children are placed on one bed due to a lack of space.
According to international healthcare guidelines, including those issued by the World Health Organisation (WHO), every patient must be provided with a separate bed and adequate physical distancing to prevent the transmission of infections. But in Karachi's overstretched government-run hospitals, these standards are proving impossible to meet.
Sources within the emergency department of one public hospital revealed that a large number of patients arrive in critical condition after being turned away from over-capacity facilities such as JPMC and Indus Hospital. When these referrals are also denied admission due to full wards, families often refuse to leave hospital premises, leaving medical staff with little choice but to adjust patients on already occupied beds.
""Who will take responsibility if a patient dies on the hospital steps?"" asked a staff member, describing scenes where emergency beds are placed near registration counters, with male and female patients lying side by side. In such chaotic conditions, doctors struggle to provide care, often being jostled by crowds while attempting to treat critical cases.
The lack of space and basic infrastructure is not just a logistical issue - it's a public health hazard. Medical experts warn that placing multiple patients on a single bed increases the risk of cross-infection.
A patient arriving with one illness may leave with another due to the uncontrolled transmission of germs and bacteria.
The situation is particularly dire at children's hospitals, where overcrowding has become routine, and the risk of disease spread is especially high among vulnerable pediatric patients.
Senior officials at public hospitals acknowledge the health risks but argue that under the circumstances, they are making difficult decisions to save lives.

Djokovic downs Zverev in FO quarters,"US
He will face Jannik Sinner in the semifinal
Novak Djokovic said beating Alexander Zverev on Wednesday was a ""testament"" to his ability to compete at the highest level as the 38-year-old reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros to inch closer to a record 25th Grand Slam title.
Djokovic fought past third seed Zverev 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in a gruelling night session duel, which captivated Court Philippe Chatrier over three-and-a-quarter hours.
The 24-time Grand Slam winner moves on to face world number one Jannik Sinner in the last four, after the Italian earlier raced past the unseeded Alexander Bublik in straight sets.
""Jannik is in tremendous form, and he has been the best player for the last couple of years,"" said Djokovic.
""It's going to be of course semi-finals of a Grand Slam against the No. 1 in the world. There is no bigger occasion for me, so I'll try to do my best to step it up and perform as well as I did tonight.
""I just hope that I will be able to physically keep up, you know, with Sinner in few days' time. It's a big challenge for me.""
On centre court, last year's runner-up Zverev roared out of the blocks with an immediate break of serve as he clinched the opener against Djokovic.
It was the first time former world number one Djokovic has dropped a set at the French Open this year.
'Forget the age'
Djokovic engineered himself a 3-1 lead in the second set after Zverev pushed a backhand long when serving at 30-40.
The three-time Roland Garros champion then held firm through the rest of the frame to level the match as he started to punish the 1.98m-Zverev with drop-shots.
The Serb sniffed out a break opportunity in game five of the third set and snaffled it, before again breaking the German as he took control of the encounter.
Now on a high, Djokovic started the fourth by again pouncing on his opponent's usually reliable serve.
He brought Chatrier to its feet when he whipped a cross-court forehand past Zverev to save break point in the sixth game at the end of an exchange that the 28-year-old looked certain to win on at least three occasions.
Zverev appeared a defeated man when he eventually passed up that chance at a vital break-back with a netted forehand.
Djokovic marched on and sealed his 101st win at the French Open, raising his arms aloft in triumph after finally converting match point at the fifth time of asking.
""It was an amazing match,"" summarised Djokovic.
""Obviously beating one of the best players in the world on the biggest stages is something that I definitely work for, and I still, you know, push myself on a daily basis at this age because of these kind of matches and these kind of experiences.
""It's a proven kind of testament to myself that I can and to others that I can still play on the highest level.""
A poor run of form earlier in the season and his advancing years had some questioning whether Djokovic could still match his younger rivals.
But he had a response for his doubters: ""I think the win against (Carlos) Alcaraz in quarters of Australian Open (2025), to win quarters against Zverev tonight proves to myself and others that I can still play on the highest level, and I just thrive on these occasions.""
A sentiment echoed by Zverev.
""I think at the moment he's a bit underrated, to be honest,"" Zverev said of Djokovic.
""I think like a lot of people count him out already, but this year he's had wins over Carlos at the Australian Open, he has had a win over me at the French Open. Forget the age. I think for any player, those are pretty good results.""
Defeat at the quarter-final stage of the tournament in which he has reached at least the last four every year since 2021 brings an end to a disappointing clay-court season for Zverev.
The three-time Grand Slam runner-up endured early exits at the Monte Carlo Masters and Madrid Open, as well as in the last eight in Rome.

No decision yet to annul treaties with India: FO,"US
Issues a clarification a day after Asif said Simla Agreement lost sanctity
Pakistan has not made any formal decision to abrogate any bilateral agreement with India as the two countries compete on diplomatic front post April 22 Pahalgam incident.
""No formal decision on abrogation of any bilateral agreement with India has so far been made,"" a Foreign Office official said on Thursday
The statement came a day after Defense Minister Khawaja Asif told a private TV channel that the Simla Agreement signed between Pakistan and India in 1972 has lost its ""sanctity"" due to New Delhi's unilateral actions, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
""The [Simla] Agreement was bilateral [...] as no third party or the World Bank was involved,"" Asif said, maintaining that the Line of Control (LoC) would convert into a ceasefire line in the absence of the bilateral treaty.
""If this is the case and India has begun this [attitude] then the Simla Agreement is between two parties and has no interference or patronage from the World Bank or anyone else, so the LoC will revert to a ceasefire line, which was its original status as per the [UN] resolution passed at the time of the 1948 plebiscite.
""The sanctity of the Simla Agreement has been eliminated due to India's actions,"" the defence minister added, further saying that its conditions, such as for India and Pakistan to resolve issues bilaterally, were no longer applicable. ""The agreement as a whole after this episode of war has now no value,"" he added.
The agreement was signed between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the 1971 war; the signatories were Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi.

Why is 'Mera Jism Meri Marzi' so controversial?,"US
Mira Sethi reflects on women's autonomy, society's flaws
On Tuesday, Mira Sethi shared a clip of herself at a panel discussing why the slogan 'Mera Jism Meri Marzi' (my body, my choice) sparks controversy in Pakistan and is seen as a threat to traditional values.
""Why is 'Mera Jism Meri Marzi' so polarising? I think it is [polarising] because it goes right to the heart of patriarchy in our context, which is premised on the control of women's bodies and their sexuality,"" Mira said.
She added that the slogan comes across as a threat because it challenges what men and women are socialised to believe. ""Women saying that they will not cede control of their bodies is a threat to the entire social structure. Because in general, women are thought to be the property of their male kin, by which I mean male relatives. Before marriage, they belong to their fathers, and after marriage, to their husbands. 'Mera Jism Meri Marzi' is a refusal to submit to that system of patriarchal control.""
Given the nature of the controversy, the Kuch Ankahi actor turned off her comments under the post. However, she did not shy away from stance, as she later posted a clip from an interview where she addressed men's need to police women's clothing.
Recalling a degrading comment under a colleague's post where said colleague wore clothes that prompted criticism, Mira said, ""Someone wrote, 'Now if I fall prey to my masculinity and say or do something you don't like, then you'll complain.' What does this even mean, becoming so helpless against your masculinity? Is your definition of 'masculinity' so fragile that it limits itself and your dignity to a woman's clothes? Is this your masculinity?""
She added that it is absolutely possible for an empowered woman and a broad-minded man to co-exist in a society without one gender posing harm to the other. She also believes that masculinity as a concept has been reduced to trivial ideas of control, in that it feels threatened by a woman's right to choose. Baffled by the 'masculine' desire to control women, she admitted that she doesn't understand this mindset at all.
Urging men to expand their minds, Mira said, ""If I encounter a man who's wearing ripped jeans, I'm not going to say things like, 'You are inviting me to sin.' Women don't say such outrageous things. Why is that? Firstly, our minds don't stray that far. And secondly, society hasn't given us the right to berate men like that. But they believe otherwise.""

Ronaldo fires Portugal into Nations League final,"US
The 40-year-old scored the winner against Germany
Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner as Portugal fought back to beat Germany 2-1 on Wednesday, with the 40-year-old bagging his 137th international goal to send them into the Nations League final.
It was Portugal's first win over Germany since 2000 with Ronaldo's goal earning them a spot in their second Nations League final, after winning the inaugural edition in 2019.
Spain and France will clash in the other semi-final on Thursday to decide who will face Portugal in the decider on Sunday.
Germany dominated the first half, but it remained goalless thanks to the heroics of Portugal keeper Diogo Costa.
The shotstopper made an excellent start to the first half, keeping out a low shot from Germany's Leon Goretzka after four minutes with a strong save.
Costa came to Portugal's rescue again with an incredible save from Nick Woltemade's close-range effort and two minutes later, he produced another quick reaction stop, diving low to tip away another attempt from Goretzka.
Germany took the lead in the 48th minute, as Florian Wirtz headed in unmarked in the box, following a pinpoint lobbed pass from Joshua Kimmich.
However, Portugal turned the match around, first equalising through substitute Francisco Conceicao in the 63rd minute, before Ronaldo tapped in five minutes later after Nuno Mendes teed him up.
For Conceicao, the win carried extra significance, as his father Sergio scored a hat-trick the last time Portugal beat Germany — at the European Championship in 2000.
""We need to enjoy the victory — we won for the first time in a while against Germany. Tactically we were exceptional and our commitment helped... it was a team victory,"" Portugal coach Roberto Martinez said.
""Now we can recover and evaluate,"" he added. ""We want another performance with personality in this shirt.""
Germany looked to shift the momentum when substitute Karim Adeyemi unleashed a powerful rising strike with his left foot, only to see it crash against the outside of Costa's right-hand post.
Portugal could have grabbed a third goal very late in the match but Germany keeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen stretched impressively to perform a double save.
It was a disappointing 100th appearance for Germany captain Kimmich.
""The defeat is absolutely deserved. We weren't playing well enough in the first half. After going 1-0 up, nothing came of it in the second half,"" he told reporters.
""We have to learn from this. If we're not at 100%, we can't beat a top European team. Today was one of our worst games, purely based on our performance.""
Silva praised Cristiano
Portugal midfielder Bernardo Silva praised Cristiano Ronaldo's ""hunger"" after the 40-year-old striker continued to defy the years with a 68th-minute winner which booked a spot in Sunday's Nations League final.
Ronaldo came into the tournament amid swirling doubts about his future at club level, with the veteran's contract at Saudi side Al-Nassr set to expire at the end of June.
In May, the Portuguese posted on social media ""the chapter is over"" as reports emerged he could switch to another club, potentially Saudi side Al Hilal, in order to play the Club World Cup in the United States in June.
But he left behind all the speculation as he knocked in his 137th international goal, extending his own record in his 220th game for Portugal.
Ronaldo had missed a few half chances but after Francisco Conceicao had levelled after Florian Wirtz had put Germany ahead early in the second half, he was on the spot to tap in a Nuno Mendes pass which put Portugal on track for victory.
""It's his ambition to keep going,"" Silva said of his long-time teammate.
""It's never easy -— I don't know how old he is, I think he's like 40 — to still be hungry to go every day.
""He's been doing this for more than 20 years. It's tough, but he's here with us and we're happy he scored again.""
The victory was Ronaldo's first against Germany, after five straight losses. Portugal last won against Germany in 2000.

Balochistan CM says enemy wants to destabilise Pakistan
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti has stated that India's intelligence agency, Research and Analysis Wing (RAW), is sponsoring the terrorist group ""Fitna al Hindustan"" to destabilise Pakistan.
Addressing a news conference in the provincial capital alongside Provincial Minister for Planning and Development Zahoor Ahmed Buledi and Balochistan Chief Secretary, the chief minister said that India's intelligence agency RAW is actively supporting terrorist groups to destabilise peace in Pakistan, especially in Balochistan.
He added that the group was ""purely terrorist"" and has no connection to the Baloch people or the province of Balochistan.
During the news conference, misleading reports by Indian media were also shown, including false claims about Karachi Port amid recent tensions between Pakistan and India.
Audio recordings of Fitna al Hindustan operatives Shanbay and Rehman Gul were also played for journalists, in which they could be heard exchanging information with their RAW handlers.
The chief minister further said that the terrorists responsible for the killing of innocent children in Khuzdar were acting under the instructions of Fitna al Hindustan, with funding and directives provided by RAW.
""These terrorists are not representatives of the Baloch people; they are merely tools of RAW.""
""India cannot tolerate Pakistan's growing economy and aims to harm us through proxy warfare,"" he said.
The chief minister dismissed reports of enforced disappearances.

Trump restores travel ban on 12 countries,"US
Order deals a fatal blow to thousands of Afghans waiting in Pakistan for resettlement in US
Thousands of Afghan nationals who are waiting in Pakistan for their onward settlement in the United States received a fatal blow to their plans, as US President Donald Trump signed a proclamation on Wednesday banning the Afghan citizens from entering the United States.
Trump banned the citizens of 12 countries – Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen – from entering the US, saying that the move was needed to protect against ""foreign terrorists"" and other security threats.
Besides the entry of people from seven other countries – Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela – will be partially restricted. The directive is part of an immigration crackdown Trump had launched this year at the start of his second term.
""We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm,"" Trump said in a video posted on X. He added the list could be revised and new countries could be added. According to the order the proclamation is effective on June 9, 2025, while visas issued before that date will not be revoked.
Earlier in January, just days after taking the office, Trump's administration halted visa processing for Afghan refugees, including those who collaborated with the coalition forces in Afghanistan for decades but had to flee to Pakistan after the American pull-out and return of the Taliban government in 2021.
Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, the leading coalition of resettlement and veterans groups, had said in January this year that there were 10,000-15,000 Afghans in Pakistan, waiting for special immigration visas or resettlement in the US as refugees.
Trump said on Wednesday that the countries subject to the most severe restrictions were determined to harbour a ""large-scale presence of terrorists,"" fail to cooperate on visa security, have an inability to verify travellers' identities, inadequate record-keeping of criminals and high rates of overstays in the US.
""We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter"" the US,"" he said. He cited a incident on Sunday when a man tossed a gasoline bomb into a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators as an example of why the new curbs are needed.
A spokesperson for the Taliban-led Afghan foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pakistan's foreign ministry also did not immediately reply to a request for comment on how it would handle the thousands of Afghans, who had been in the pipeline for US resettlement.

Reddit sues AI firm,"US
Anthropic allegedly trained bots using user comments
Social media outlet Reddit filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against artificial intelligence company Anthropic, accusing the startup of illegally scraping millions of user comments to train its Claude chatbot without permission or compensation.
The lawsuit in a California state court represents the latest front in the growing battle between content providers and AI companies over the use of data to train increasingly sophisticated language models that power the generative AI revolution.
Anthropic, valued at $61.5 billion and heavily backed by Amazon, was founded in 2021 by former executives from OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT.
The company, known for its Claude chatbot and AI models, positions itself as focused on AI safety and responsible development.
""This case is about the two faces of Anthropic: the public face that attempts to ingratiate itself into the consumer's consciousness with claims of righteousness and respect for boundaries and the law, and the private face that ignores any rules that interfere with its attempts to further line its pockets,"" the suit said.
According to the complaint, Anthropic has been training its models on Reddit content since at least December 2021, with CEO Dario Amodei co-authoring research papers that specifically identified high-quality content for data training.
The lawsuit alleges that despite Anthropic's public claims that it had blocked its bots from accessing Reddit, the company's automated systems continued to harvest Reddit's servers more than 100,000 times in subsequent months.
Reddit is seeking monetary damages and a court injunction to force Anthropic to comply with its user agreement terms. The company has requested a jury trial.
In an email to AFP, Anthropic said ""We disagree with Reddit's claims and will defend ourselves vigorously.""
AI companies generally defend their practices by claiming fair use, arguing that training AI on large datasets fundamentally changes the original content and is necessary for innovation. afp

A 25-year-old inmate who recently escaped during the mass jailbreak at District Jail Malir has died by suicide in Madni Colony, Mauripur. Police say the deceased, identified as Raza, a resident of Ranchor Line, was found hanging inside his sister's home.
Police were alerted after the body was found, and the deceased was shifted to Civil Hospital for medico-legal formalities. According to PS Mauripur SHO Sardar Ali Abbasi, Raza had been visiting his sister's home at the time of the incident. He is believed to have taken his own life while alone in the house.
Raza had been incarcerated at Malir Jail in connection with a narcotics case registered at Eidgah police station on March 30, 2022. He was among over 200 prisoners who fled during the jailbreak that occurred between Tuesday and Wednesday night, triggering a sweeping manhunt and ongoing investigation by police.
So far, 126 escapees have either been re-arrested or returned voluntarily. However, at least 90 inmates remain at large, with police conducting a large-scale search operation to trace them.
Meanwhile, a video statement recorded by Raza shortly before his death has surfaced, indicating the psychological distress experienced by some of the escapees. In the emotional footage, Raza claims he was innocent as he describes the chaotic circumstances under which the escape took place. Raza's suicide has raised serious questions about the psychological condition of the escapees and the management of the prison system.

Sacrifice pool prices rise in line with animal costs,"RO
Welfare organisations, mosques and madaris packages increase by Rs10,000
The cost of each share of collective or pool sacrifice has also increased with the hike in the price of the sacrificial animals.
Bulls, cows and camels have seven shares in sacrifice for the Eidul Azha. While many households buy their own animals and distribute the share among family and friends, others choose to pool the sacrifice with local mosques or welfare organisations to fulfil the religious obligation.
Due to the high cost of sacrificial animals, it is becoming difficult for many people to perform the Sunnah of Ibrahim on an individual level. That is why there has been an increase in the trend of collective sacrifice on Eidul Azha in Karachi this year.
Imran-ul-Haq, the administrator of a welfare organisation that conducts collective sacrifices, informed The Express Tribune that sacrificial animals are being sold at exorbitantly high prices this year.
He said that people who bought a heifer for less than Rs100,000 and a goat for around Rs30,000 last year, have found it difficult to sacrifice individually this Eidul Azha. That is why a large number of citizens are opting for collective sacrifice. He said that due to the high cost of animals, the share of collective sacrifice has also increased from Rs3,000 to Rs10,000.
He said that various madaris, mosques and welfare organisations have introduced various packages of collective sacrifice. The share which was Rs20,000 to Rs25,000 or less last year has increased to Rs28,000 or more this year.

PHC halts rollback of cadet promotions,"US
Bars K-P police from undoing ranks, seeks departmental reply
A two-member bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) has restrained authorities from revoking the promotions of police officers who had advanced in rank as cadets in the Khybe-Pakhtunkhwa police.
The court also sought a detailed response from the concerned departments.
The bench, comprising Justice Naeem Anwar and Justice Farah Jamshed, was hearing a writ petition filed by Amjad Hussain and others through Advocate Syed Asif Ali Shah.
The petitioners argued that they are currently serving at the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) and other senior positions in the police force, having received promotions during their training period when they were officially designated as cadets (those candidates who topped their promotion courses).
According to the petitioners, under Standing Order No. 11 of 1987, police officers declared cadets during their course were entitled to faster promotions compared to their peers. These promotions, they asserted, do not fall under the category of ""out-of-turn"" promotions, which were declared unlawful by the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the context of Sindh and Punjab.
The petitioners further stated that the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government had initially attempted to reverse their promotions by misapplying the Supreme Court's ruling. However, in 2022, the Peshawar High Court had ruled that these promotions were legally protected through proper legislative measures and did not qualify as out-of-turn promotions.
They noted that the Supreme Court had laid out distinct procedures for various categories of promotions and that the current Inspector General of Police had, on May 23, 2025, issued a notification wrongly categorizing their cadet-based promotions as out-of-turn.

Leaders rally for green Pakistan,"US
President, PM urge unity for cleaner country on World Environment Day
On the World Environment Day, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged every citizen, organization, and public institution to unite for a cleaner, greener Pakistan.
In their separate messages, they said the day reminded us of our shared responsibility to protect the planet and secure a sustainable future for the generations to come.
""Pakistan is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Each year, we face devastating floods, droughts, and heatwaves that displace millions of people. Yet, our contribution to global carbon emissions is less than 1%. This imbalance highlights the urgent need for global climate justice and strong international support,"" President Secretariat Press Wing, in a press release, quoted the president as saying.
Despite limited resources, the president said, Pakistan was taking steps to tackle environmental challenges.
""We are working to mobilize climate finance by combining national efforts with private investment and international support. Key strategic instruments include: The $1.4 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility from the IMF, which supports reforms such as a carbon levy, electric vehicle promotion, and improved energy efficiency: the World Bank's Country Partnership Framework (2026-2035), focused on flood resilience, clean energy transition, sustainable agriculture, and better air quality. The 2024 Carbon Market Policy Guidelines aim to attract green private investment. All these efforts align with Pakistan's broader economic transformation plan — Uraan Pakistan,"" he added.
The president observed that the governments alone could not solve this crisis, stressing that each of them had a role to play.
Prime Minister
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif calling the plastic pollution an environmental challenge threatening ecosystems, economy, and future generations, reaffirmed his government's commitment to eco-friendly policies, responsible consumption, and stricter plastic regulations.
""Real change begins with each of us — in our homes, our communities, and our choices,"" the prime minister said.
He said that on the Day, Pakistan joined the international community in reaffirming its commitment to safeguard our planet and pursue sustainable development.
The prime minister said that this year's theme — ""Putting an End to Plastic Pollution"" — was both timely and urgent.
""Plastic pollution is an environmental challenge that threatens our ecosystems, our economy, and future generations. From choking our rivers and seas to harming marine life and contaminating our food chain, plastic waste has reached alarming levels across the globe — and Pakistan is no exception. This calls for a bold and collective action,"" he remarked.
He said that the Day should serve as a reminder of our shared responsibility — to ourselves and to the generations yet to come.

Indo-US posturing on China via Bangladesh?,"US
.
A Zee News report on May 29 suggests the intentions of Indian and US security establishments in the coming months. It also points to the possible deterioration of Sino-Indian relations and a spike in regional tensions due to the emergence of a so-called ""Bangladesh-Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran -China strategic axis"".
India deployed Rafale fighter jets and the Russian-made S-400 air defence system at the Siliguri Corridor, a strategically important stretch, due to threats from Dhaka, according to Zee News.
US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on May 30 emphasised ""the real and imminent threat China poses"". He said Beijing is ""credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"" and that the US is reorienting toward deterring aggression by communist China.
Both developments are centred around China. Let's examine the US posturing towards China.
The US establishment focuses on the ""ascendent China challenge"", projecting military build-up and war-games as aggressive Chinese posturing. However, history contradicts this.
Has China ever invaded another country or used deadly ammunition on foreign territories? Has it occupied an alien country like the US did in Afghanistan, Iraq or Libya? Has Beijing ever quietly endorsed or condoned a genocide, like Israel's repression against Palestinians?
Beijing got back Hong Kong after a century of negotiations with the British and is following the same approach for Taiwan, which it considers part of One China. For President Xi Jinping, reuniting Taiwan with the mainland is a mission his generation is committed to achieving.
Raising alarm over war drills, a legitimate right of sovereign nations, contradicts US-NATO war games, including in the South China Sea. The latest example was the largest joint military exercises between the US and the Philippines in April, involving 17,000 troops to simulate war with China over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Why would China's marine patrols and exercises be questioned without supporting evidence?
After challenging Pakistan and losing multiple aircraft on May 7, New Delhi is now deflecting criticism by bullying Bangladesh in indirect messaging to China.
A Zee News report as well as a backgrounder by The New Indian Express reflect the Indian establishment's current focus on Beijing and Dhaka. It noted that the interim government in Dhaka is reportedly leaning toward China and Pakistan, which could reshape India's strategic balance in the east. The report also detailed the reinforcement of the 22km Siliguri Corridor, India's only land link to its northeastern states, which sits at the crossroads of Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China.
The Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal connects India's mainland to its northeastern states, known as the Seven Sisters. Any disruption in this narrow strip between Nepal and Bangladesh would sever India's northeastern states from the rest of India.
The deployment of the S-400 air defence system and a Rafale squadron at Hashimara Airbase is more than just tactical positioning; it's a strategic warning. India's military posturing at the Siliguri Corridor is a show of strength and a declaration that any misadventure from the north (China) or east (Bangladesh) will be met with full force,"" highlights The New Indian Express report.
India's overreaction began after Bangladesh's interim leader Dr Muhammad Yunus referred to India's northeast as landlocked during his China visit in March. New Delhi promptly restricted certain Bangladeshi exports through its entry points, exempting Nepal and Bhutan though, signaling that undermining India's strategic autonomy in the region has economic and political consequences.
The Indian sensitivity primarily stems from Sheikh Hasina's rise to power in August 2024, which diminished India's clout gained over the past two decades.
The growing Dhaka-Beijing proximity causes anxiety in New Delhi, especially after the Yunus administration moved the $1 billion Teesta River project to China and decided to revive the 1931 Lalmonirhat airbase .This airbase is near the Siliguri Corridor, which China has also promised to rehabilitate.
The Hegseth speech and Indian defence reinforcement at the Siliguri Corridor are both directed at China. Even though the US and India may disagree over tariffs, China will likely force both into a convenient embrace after the recent strategic shift in the region. Both countries may use the feared China-Bangladesh-Sri Lanka-Pakistan-Afghanistan-Iran axis as a justification for attacking China and undermining its interests. However, this may hurt the combined interests of India and the US more than China's, which has built a vast community across Africa and Asia through the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) rather than intimidation and military interventions.
What we need in these times of turbulence across the globe, and the disruption that an aggressive Donald Trump has caused, is intensified mutually beneficial cooperation instead of artificially drummed-up threats to unjustifiably demonise target countries.

Govt eyes tractor policy for agri-mechanisation,"KR
SAU announces academic conference to align curricula with market needs
Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain met a delegation from the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) on Thursday to discuss a proposed National Tractor Policy aimed at boosting agricultural mechanisation, productivity, and export potential.
The PAAPAM delegation noted that the tractor industry contributes $400 million annually to the economy and argued that a coherent policy could raise this to $1 billion through enhanced exports, job creation, and technology transfer. They emphasised that affordable access to modern tractors is essential for improving farm productivity and ensuring national food security.
Hussain agreed that mechanisation is vital for better crop yields and reduced post-harvest losses. He assured the government's support and pledged coordination with the Ministry of Industries and Engineering Development Board to develop an integrated policy.
Separately, Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), Tandojam, announced a multi-disciplinary conference to align academic programmes with market needs. Speaking at the renovated Molecular Parasitology Laboratory, Dr Altaf Ali Siyal stressed the economic potential of agriculture and livestock and highlighted SAU's work on indigenous breeds. Senior faculty shared updates on climate impact, research, and diagnostics. The Sindh HEC has recognised the lab as a scientific research centre.

GDP growth forecasted at mere 2.44%,"DE
LSE report says manufacturing slump, crop failures, and policy missteps dampen outlook
Pakistan's economy continues to face challenges in achieving meaningful growth, with projections for the fiscal year 2024-25 indicating a slow recovery.
According to estimates from the Lahore School of Economics Modelling Lab, GDP growth is expected to reach only 2.44%, reflecting a slight improvement from the 1.7% growth recorded in the previous fiscal year but still remaining below par.
These projections broadly align with official figures, including a recent revision by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, which lowered its Q3 GDP growth estimate from 2.7% to 2.4%. While international institutions such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and Asian Development Bank (ADB) have provided slightly higher projections ranging from 2.5% to 2.7%, the overall picture still reflects a sluggish economic recovery.
One of the main reasons for the weak growth outlook is the poor performance in key productive sectors, particularly manufacturing and agriculture. Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM), which should ideally be a driving force for GDP growth, has contracted by 1.9% during the current fiscal year. This continues a trend of stagnation and decline observed over the past two years. In the absence of manufacturing growth, the economy has had to rely heavily on agriculture. However, the agricultural sector has also underperformed, growing at just 0.56%only a quarter of its historical trend rate.
The disappointing agricultural growth is largely due to a significant contraction in the production of major crops. Wheat production has dropped by 9%, from 32 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, while maize has declined by 15%, from 10 million tonnes to 8 million tonnes. Sugarcane production fell by 4%, and rice saw a marginal decrease of 1.4%.
Cotton suffered the sharpest fall, contracting by 31%, with output reducing from 10 million to 7 million bales. Analysts argue that this sharp decline cannot be blamed on weather patterns, which have remained consistent. Instead, they attribute the drop to government policy changesmost notably, the removal of long-standing support prices for key crops, a decision that has likely discouraged production.
Furthermore, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) measures these crop contractions only in terms of volume, not monetary value. This may result in an underestimation of the actual impact on GDP. For instance, the price of wheat has declined by about Rs1,000 per 40 kg compared to the previous season, reducing the overall value of wheat production by nearly 25%. This translates to significant income losses for farmers and suggests that the real contraction in the agricultural sector could be even worse than officially reported.
On the inflation front, the situation has improved compared to previous years, but it still remains a concern. Inflation for FY202425 is projected at 8.37% by the Lahore School's model, higher than the government's upper-end estimate of 7.5% and significantly above the IMF's estimate of 5.1%. The major driver of high inflation in recent years has been the depreciation of the exchange rate, which has now somewhat stabilised due to more effective monetary policies and intervention by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
However, energy prices remain a key contributor to inflation. It is estimated that they add around 4% to the inflation rate, primarily due to increased government taxes rather than higher supplier costs.
There has been a trade-off between taming inflation and stimulating growth. The current low inflation has come at the cost of stifling agriculture, the only productive sector showing some promise in the absence of manufacturing growth. Experts warn that while bringing inflation down is important, it should not come at the cost of agricultural output, especially when manufacturing is already in decline.
Another structural challenge remains the current account deficit, which has long constrained Pakistan's GDP growth. Historical data show that whenever GDP growth exceeds 5%, the current account deficit tends to widen sharply due to increased imports, which are highly sensitive to economic growth. While remittances provide temporary relief, they are not a sustainable solution. With global trade becoming more volatile due to tariff wars and changing regulations, the potential for export-led growth appears to be diminishing.
One proposed solution is to focus on investment-led growth by liberalising the import of investment goods. This would allow domestic industries to upgrade their capabilities and drive growth, provided that non-essential consumption imports are controlled to maintain current account balance.
Overall, the outlook for Pakistan's economy remains cautious. While inflation is being brought under control, the country has yet to find a solid path to sustainable and inclusive growth. Both manufacturing and agriculture need policy support, and investment strategies must be realigned to address structural weaknesses in the economy, the LSE Modelling Lab added.

Inzaghi to coach Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal,"US
The Italian is set to sign a two-year deal with Saudi club
Former Inter boss Simone Inzaghi was revealed as the new coach of Saudi Arabia's Al Hilal on Thursday, days before they take part in the new-look Club World Cup.
The Italian, who led Inter to a heavy defeat in Saturday's Champions League final, had earlier played down rumours of a two-year deal worth 50 million euros.
""I am Simone Inzaghi and today begins my story with Al Hilal,"" he said in a slickly produced video posted on X, in which he sips Arabian coffee and pins an Al Hilal lapel badge on his suit.
Inzaghi, 49, becomes just the latest high-profile footballing acquisition for oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which will host the World Cup in 2034.
""The Italian genius is here,"" Al Hilal posted. ""Welcome, Simone Inzaghi.""
Inzaghi joins the likes of Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic at Al Hilal, which let injury-hit Neymar go in January after just seven appearances since his arrival in August 2023.
A source with knowledge of the negotiations last week told AFP that the ""first option"" for Cristiano Ronaldo, who has signalled he is leaving rival club Al Nassr, could be a move to Al Hilal.
Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes this week said he rejected Al Hilal's reported $135 million offer because he wanted to ""continue to play at the highest level"".
Inzaghi's Inter slumped 5-0 to Qatar-funded Paris Saint-Germain in Saturday's Champions League final. His departure was confirmed on Tuesday.
The former forward guided Inter to one Serie A title and two Italian Cups since joining in 2021. He took them to two Champions League finals in three seasons but lost both.
On track to repeat the treble heroics of 2010 just a few weeks ago, Inter ended the season trophyless after falling away in each competition.
Inter, PSG, Real Madrid and Manchester City are also among the 32 teams at the expanded Club World Cup, which starts on June 15.

WB readjusts poverty line in Pakistan at 44.7%,"PK
New statistics reflect changes in prices of goods and services
The World Bank has adjusted upward the income levels in an effort to measure global poverty, which has also pushed the percentage of Pakistanis living in poverty by to 44.7% — an outcome that may not still be fully reflecting the harsh ground realities due to the use of seven years old survey data.
The Washington-based lender on Thursday released its new international poverty line to reflect changes in the prices of goods and services and their implications on the global population.
The new poverty line for Pakistan, which is a lower middle-income country, is set at $4.20 per person per day, up from $3.65, said Christina Wieser, the senior poverty economist of the World Bank while briefing the media persons here.
She said that due to the upward revision, for the lower middle income level, the poverty ratio has jumped from 39.8% of the old level to 44.7% on the threshold of $4.20 per day income.
The World Bank has also updated the extreme poverty line from $2.15 to $3 per person per day. Because of the revision in the threshold, 16.5% of the Pakistani population lives in extreme poverty, up from 4.9% under the previous $2.15 threshold, said Christina.
She said that one of the reasons for such a high jump was that the majority of the people were clustered around $2.15 to $3 per day income level, which resulted into a significant surge.
About 82% of this increase in extreme poverty is due to the higher value of the new international poverty line reflecting increases in the national poverty lines of comparator countries, with the rest explained by price increases in Pakistan between 2017 and 2021, according to the World Bank.
The World Bank has not used the latest population census data and instead relied on the United Nations population dataset.
Christina also added that the underlying Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2018/19 data has been used for both national and international estimates. While international poverty lines are essential for tracking global progress and comparisons, national lines remain more appropriate for informing country-specific policy decisions, said the senior economist.
Anything that has affected since 2019 is not included in either Covid-19 or 2022 floods, as the baseline remains the same, said Christina while responding to a question. We are desperately looking forward to the new household integrated economic survey to update our baseline, she added.
The local economists had estimated a sharp rise in poverty after the 2022 floods, which inundated one-fourth of the country and adversely impacted populations in three provinces.
These updates to the international poverty lines ensure that poverty estimates remain accurate and comparable across countries. The methodology remains consistent with past updates, continuing a practice that began with the introduction of the dollar-a-day line in 1990, according to the World Bank economist.
""The revisions help position Pakistan's poverty levels in a global context and underscore the importance of continued efforts to reduce vulnerability and improve resilience,"" said Najy Benhassine, the outgoing World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.
For domestic policy and programme targeting, the national poverty line remains unchanged and continues to serve as the primary benchmark for assessing poverty within Pakistan, Christina said.
The forthcoming World Bank Poverty, Equity, and Resilience Assessment for Pakistan will provide critical context for interpreting these updated poverty estimates, she added. The report would offer a detailed update on poverty, inequality, and non-monetary outcomes, will investigate key drivers of poverty, and outline a forward-looking agenda to enhance prosperity and resilience for all Pakistanis.
According to the government's last official available numbers, which are based on the 2018-19 survey, 21.9% of the population was living below the national poverty line. However, because national poverty lines differ widely, the resulting poverty rates are not comparable internationally.
The need for new international poverty lines arises from the evolving price levels and cost of basic needs across the world and within income groups, according to Christina Wieser.
To maintain accurate global comparisons, the World Bank periodically updates these poverty lines. International poverty estimates are based on the headcount of people with consumption below the international poverty line, defined in purchasing power parities (PPPs).
Pakistan is among the countries experiencing the largest changes in poverty when transitioning to the 2021 PPPs based on the Low-Income International Poverty Line, according to the World Bank.
The World Bank said that the international poverty line should be used only for cross-country comparison and analysis; for evaluating poverty in a particular country (Pakistan), the national poverty line remains the appropriate standard.
The revisions help position Pakistan's poverty levels in a global context and underscore the importance of continued efforts to reduce vulnerability and improve resilience,
The new figures reflect updated international thresholds and improved data from other countries, not deterioration in living standards, according to Christina.

"KSE-100 retreats on budget jitters, taxes","KR
Market sees profit-taking after record highs as concerns grow over fiscal tightening, rupee weakness, and export
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a volatile session on Thursday, with the benchmark KSE-100 index retreating after hitting record highs a day earlier. Investor sentiment turned cautious due to concerns about stringent conditions linked to a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, including proposed enforcement of agriculture income tax and the IMF's opposition to provincial energy subsidies.
Adding to the bearish outlook were fears of aggressive fiscal measures in the upcoming FY26 federal budget. These include possible new taxes on banking and savings income, along with anticipated hikes in petroleum levies on petrol and diesel. A weakening rupee and a 10% year-on-year (YoY) decline in exports for May also dampened investor confidence.
Arif Habib Corporation Managing Director Ahsan Mehanti commented that the market declined following reports of IMF pressure for strict enforcement of agriculture taxation and improved tax collection mechanisms, while resisting provincial subsidies on power. ""Expectations of higher taxes on banking and savings, increased petroleum levies, rupee instability, and a sharp YoY decline in exports all weighed on sentiment,"" he said.
The KSE-100 index closed at 121,641 points, down 157.87 points or 0.13% from the previous day. Despite the decline, the market remained within a broad range throughout the session, with an intra-day high of +483 points and a low of -281 points, according to Topline Securities. The firm noted that the range-bound activity came ahead of the long Eid holidays, following a recent rally.
Topline also highlighted the most traded companies by value, with Unity Foods leading at Rs1.67 billion, followed by Engro Holdings (Rs1.24 billion), K-Electric (Rs1.03 billion), Searle Company (Rs847 million), and TRG Pakistan (Rs785 million).
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) noted that despite the minor setback, the week had remained positive overall, with the market touching all-time highs. Engro Holdings (+3.24%), Pakgen Power (+10.0%), and Service Industries (+5.49%) contributed to the index's gains. On the downside, Meezan Bank (-2.11%), Systems Ltd (-1.68%), and Fauji Fertilizer (-0.5%) were key laggards.
In broader developments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia on June 5-6 to meet Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for talks on bilateral cooperation, regional security, and economic collaboration. Meanwhile, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) stated in a corporate briefing that its capital expenditure (capex) is expected to hover around Rs30 billion annually over the coming years.
Analysts projected 120,000 points to act as a post-Eid base level for the KSE-100, with potential to move higher provided macroeconomic stability continues.
KTrade Securities echoed similar views in its market wrap, observing that despite the volatility, trading activity remained strong with volume reaching 854 million shares. Leading the volume chart were K-Electric (179 million shares), Unity Foods (62 million), and WorldCall Telecom (52 million).
However, slight profit-taking was noted in banking, cement, and oil and gas sectors. KTrade added that investors are expected to stay cautious in the lead-up to the federal budget announcement on June 10, 2025.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala reported that the index had opened positively and surged to a new intra-day high of 122,281, but profit-taking dragged it down by the close. Notable trading activity was seen in oil & gas, fertiliser, power, and banking sectors.
A total of 478 companies' shares were traded. Among them, 217 closed higher, 208 declined, and 53 remained unchanged.
K-Electric was the volume leader, gaining Rs0.42 to close at Rs5.83. It was followed by Unity Foods, which rose Rs0.75 to close at Rs26.89, and WorldCall Telecom, which added Rs0.05 to close at Rs1.42.
Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs271.6 million, according to the National Clearing Company.

Khamenei's no,"US
.
Any potential new nuclear deal between Washington and Tehran has already hit a massive hurdle, as Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei flatly rejected abandoning uranium enrichment. While the statement may be downplayed as an opening gambit to push for better terms, the fact that the person making the statement was the supreme leader, rather than a 'politician', could lead to domestic pushback down the line.
It is true that US President Donald Trump is the only person to blame for the fact that a new deal is even being negotiated. He unilaterally quit the landmark Obama-era deal, which Iran had been respecting, but then began violating as well, citing how Trump's withdrawal had already voided it. This is also why the US, despite being in a strong bargaining position, will have to give a lot to gain a little — trust in Trump is non-existent.
And while continuing to vilify US intentions can rally domestic support, it also perpetuates a cycle of distrust that can derail negotiations. Iran has the capability of making weapons-grade uranium but has long claimed it only enriches the element up to the level required for power generation. However, a key dispute is over the country's refusal to offshore enrichment activities to a country that the US and nuclear regulators can easily monitor.
Under normal circumstances, such a move would be a welcome trade-off, but the Trump administration is not a normal government that respects treaties or international law, so Iran is justified in its stance on the US for the supply of uranium.
As an aside, Trump violated the old deal — the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan — without even knowing what was in it. Leaked memos at the time suggested he only did it to spite former president Barack Obama, as it was one of Obama's signature achievements. As things stand, even if a deal is agreed, it will almost certainly be weaker than the original nuclear deal, keeping alive Trump's track record of legislative U-turns that leave America worse off than when he started.

The dilemma of the right strategic choice,"US

Right or wrong, fallacious or prudent, assertive or devastative, India has announced its intent. She calls it the 'new normal' and call it what we may, she is unlikely to desist from it till Modi dispensation is in place — unless someone can hammer sense into this ludicrous mindset. Clearly, she has chosen to challenge the prevailing deterrence regime around nuclear capability on both sides.
Her army chief declared in his public interactions at the Shangrila Dialogue that there was space for a conventional war under the nuclear overhang without really testing the threshold. Problem? Threshold is both numerative as well as perceptive.
It translates thus: If and when India attributes a 'terror' event on its territory to Pakistan she will respond by attacking Pakistan in the name of neutralising terror network and its sponsors. This does not take into consideration international obligations which bind nations to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries.
Neither will India honour the sanctity of international borders under agreed covenants of international law. In fact, India will violate those norms to assert its strategic dominance over Pakistan rubbishing any respect and deference in compliance of the internationally recognised principles of peaceful coexistence and neighbourly courtesy.
India will go to war against Pakistan every time a 'terror event' takes place on its soil. That leaves Pakistan with only one option: defend against this aggression and fight back as evinced in the four-day war.
I believe, in doing so, India is probing the limits of the space for conventional war in a nuclear environment. She began with a proclaimed 2016 surgical strike, to the Balakot 2019 expedition, to her most recent misadventure. In each case Pakistan acted with restraint hoping that a minimum defensive effort will enthuse some rationality to Indian juvenility. India may also be aiming to 'normalise' sporadic Indian outburst, 'immunise' Pakistani sentiment to India's presumptive outrage, and inure sensitivity to a perceived nuclear threshold. This is playing with fire.
With seventeen simultaneous insurgencies enveloping one-third of India — most in the east and north-east, farthest from Pakistan — how she determines that an event may have had its roots in Pakistan is perhaps the hubris that India bestows upon itself. It is at best childish, juvenile and devoid of a mature, responsible and stately act by an entity that aspires to a global mantle and recognition.
No amounts of international entreaties to jointly investigate an event to determine responsibility can cut with India's instinctive bias to only label Pakistan. Intrinsically, it remains a system reeking of intense racial and ethnic hatred as a means to societal cleansing and remains blind to civility. It betrays presumed hubris and ethnic exceptionalism. She mimics Israel without realising she is not Israel surrounded by ravaged, listless and emaciated nations in the middle east.
How may India eventually act will be India's choice. Pakistan will be forced to react, at worst in a riposte or a counteroffensive. Preemption, Pakistan's preferred option as an opening gambit, had to be forsaken under the strategic environment of nuclear parity. Were Pakistan to initiate hostilities in any preemption - unless a full-scale attack by India seemed imminent - it would puncture its own narrative of the much-propounded deterrence stability.
India's recent pronunciations in defiance of operational logic and trumping common-sense forces upon Pakistan the dilemma of thwarting India's ill-conceived intent and misplaced aggression. India's declaration imposes the reality of a continuous, perpetual war over South Asia with its own hair-trigger dynamics.
Pakistan's response in the four-day war was exceptional in the air and restrained on the ground — a little less quid pro quo, measured and calibrated. The reason was obvious: the PAF had wrought such damage on the Indian air force in the very first hour of the hostilities that it outweighed all else that India may have intended to do.
And although Pakistan had declared that an offensive will respond to India's arrogated right to violate its borders with a direct attack, it was still meant to be proportionate and non-escalatory. It came some ninety hours later but by then its intensity, spread and volume had enhanced considerably. India upped the ante with a foolish last gasp impact by unleashing a missile barrage against PAF bases and infrastructure. It achieved little but paid a heavier price in the losses that she suffered in Pakistan's return offensive.
Is India smarting yet? Seems not when Modi claims in public gatherings that India was in pause and that a 'new normal' has been established and will stay in effect granting India the godly right to strike whenever and wherever she deemed necessary. Note the arrogance and the shamelessness, and the deficient sense of probity and responsibility of a global thug.
This misplaced haughtiness justifies hubris and entitlement. This needs to be treated. If the international community will shy away from helping correct the conceptual malfeasance emerging in South Asia, it shall be Pakistan's weight to carry. And this is what Pakistan is currently grappling with — what will and should change India the way she imagines her presumptive preponderance in action and thought.
The recipe is simple. Keep the level of pain and punishment, and shame - although it remains a subjective measure - above the tolerance level of the current Indian order. How do we get there? The menu of items we have on the inventory is exhaustive enough to create a mix that will deliver what is intolerable and will pain long enough, but it must of essence be wholesome, definitive and complete in effect.
And we are not talking non-conventional yet except maybe a sprinkling to add intensity to excite the latency. Another DCA/OCA (Defensive/Offensive Counter Air - the air force guys know what I am talking about) to send the message across from enemy's excursion is a sine qua non. The offensive which should follow soon after should be sectorially substantive whether value or forced-oriented. Whether it shall be counterforce or countervalue, and in what mix from the available options is under consideration.
Pakistan's conventional capability is sufficient to change the way India and Modi assume the arrogated role of a regional policeman with a sense of entitlement. But with the most recent swarm attack by Ukraine of Russia in different geographical locations, the fine division between conventional, unconventional and non-conventional has turned murkier.
The decision points escalating from one level to the next are muddled into singular entity. In fact, the effect is almost simultaneous of all elements which earlier composed different strands and levels of capability. The whole spectrum is in play at all times which makes any miscalculation entirely devastating. That makes Jaishankar's call to Pakistan before India launched its attack on the May 6/7 night laughable and incredulous. If India does not desist from its declared recourse, Pakistan's punch must be substantive, focused and finite.

FIA 'uncovers' multibillion-rupee scam,"US
SBP report had revealed call center network linked to suspicious transactions worth billions from 36 accounts
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Commercial Banking Circle Islamabad has registered a case involving a multibillion-rupee scam operated through call centres and arrested a woman and a bank manager.
According to sources, a network of call centres was revealed in a State Bank of Pakistan report, which highlighted suspicious transactions worth billions of rupees from the accounts of 36 companies.
Following an inquiry, the FIA filed a case and arrested a woman named Nida and a private bank manager allegedly linked to the network. The network reportedly includes over six individuals, among them two Chinese nationals.
Sources indicate that the criminal enterprise collected funds through illegal online activities, including gambling, loan apps, call centres, fraudulent investment schemes, and pornographic content platforms. These funds were then funneled abroad using various channels such as hawala and hundi, and converted into cryptocurrency.
Investigations are also underway into potential involvement of FIA and cyber crime officials. When contacted by The Express Tribune for comment, the FIA spokesperson did not respond.
However, a senior FIA officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the registration of the case and ongoing raids for further arrests.

Public input invited on SME finance guidelines,"DE
SBP drafts new lending regulations for small to mid-range businesses amid calls for reform
To enhance access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has issued a comprehensive draft of revised Prudential Regulations (PRs) for SME financing. Aimed at promoting sustainable, responsible, and inclusive financing practices, the updated framework introduces new regulations while revising several existing ones to make them more principles-based and market-responsive.
""In addition to the introduction of some new regulations, several existing PRs have also been revised to make the PRs principles-based, remove structural barriers in SME finance, encourage banks to leverage technology, and foster partnerships with fintechs and other non-financial service providers to better serve the financing needs of SMEs,"" the SBP stated.
The draft PRs have been uploaded on SBP's official website for public consultation. The consultation period is open from June 5 to June 20, 2025. Feedback may be submitted at SME.PRs@sbp.org.pk using the feedback form provided on the SBP website. ""The change is needed from the grassroots level to ensure no one is left out,"" said the President of The Union of Small and Medium Enterprises (UNISAME), Zulfikar Thaver.
He said the PRs were much needed because digital banking demands inclusive financing at all levelsfrom micro to medium enterprises. In this connection, the PRs had to be revised to accommodate all categories of SMEs.
""Finance must be made accessible to every entrepreneur, from freelancers and home-based workers to upper-medium entrepreneurs,"" he said. ""The definition has to be revised, as must the system of registration of entrepreneurs to make access to finance possible and easy.""
Thaver also stressed the need to teach risk management to bankers and to give banks the flexibility to finance entrepreneurs according to their needs. ""The limits will have to be revised, as money has been devalued. In view of Islamic banking gaining ground, it is very important that every aspect of Islamic financing is included to make the PRs comprehensive and complete.""
He added that UNISAME has set up a committee of experts for an in-depth study and will submit suggestions accordingly.
""The core issues in Pakistan's dismal performance in providing formal financing to SMEs (both debt and equity) are simple, somewhat by design, and may not be resolved without a structural change in how Pakistan's financial markets operate,"" said Hashim Raza, former CEO of the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA).
""For example,"" he said, ""our financial markets are crowded by the government, which consumes around 65% of the total debt in any given year. The remaining 35% credit is barely enough to service corporate, trade financing, commercial, personal, etc.""
He explained that under these conditions, it does not make business sense for banks to venture into SME lending — especially when the cost of lending is high and so are the risks, both historically and based on actual performance over the past two decades.
Raza said the SME financing market failure is further aggravated by the absence of a viable public or public-private SME financing bank. ""It views SME financing as an issue of affordability when it is, in fact, an issue of access — just as microfinance was in the early 2000s in Pakistan.""
""As a result,"" he continued, ""informal loan sharks, suppliers' credit, buyers' advances, and personal or family savings remain the primary sources of funding for an approximately — and very conservatively estimated — Rs1,500 billion SME debt financing market.""
""Only one-third of this is serviced by banks,"" Raza added. ""According to SBP data, the total principal outstanding for the SME sector in Pakistan is about Rs470 billion. But even these numbers are misrepresentative — my estimate is that actual credit advanced to SMEs is less than Rs100 billion.""

Hafizabad gang-rape prime suspect killed in encounter,"IE
Three accomplices flee after encounter
A key suspect in a gang-rape case was killed in an alleged police encounter near Jorian in the Mangat Uncha area, while three of his accomplices managed to flee, according to officials from the Crime Control Department (CCD).
The CCD stated that the operation was conducted based on intelligence reports about the presence of suspects linked to a recent gang-rape incident.
During the raid, the suspects reportedly opened fire on law enforcement officers from inside a building.
Police retaliated in self-defence, and during the exchange of gunfire, one suspect, identified as Khawar, was fatally shotallegedly by bullets fired by his own accomplices during the crossfire.
The remaining three suspects escaped and are currently being sought in an ongoing manhunt.
Police sources revealed that Khawar, along with his associates Ikraam Mangat, Laeeq and Chand, had allegedly abducted a husband and wife at gunpoint and subjected them to sexual assault. The suspects reportedly forced the couple to engage in intercourse while filming the incident.
The video was later shared online, sparking widespread outrage.
The incident prompted swift action from District Police Officer (DPO) Atif Nazir, who ordered an immediate investigation and crackdown on the accused.
Authorities confirmed that efforts are underway to apprehend the remaining suspects and that further legal proceedings will follow.
Earlier on Wednesday, the female complainant in a gang-rape case that took place in Mangat Uncha on April 25, recorded her statement under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code before Civil Judge and Area Magistrate Ali Naqi Tipu, detailing the events involving abduction and assault.
Over a month after the incident of gang-rape and forced sexual abuse, police registered a First Information Report (FIR) on June 3.
The incident involved three armed men who allegedly gang-raped a woman in front of her husband at gunpoint, while one of the suspects recorded the assault on video. The case gained renewed urgency after the explicit footage surfaced on social media.

K-P grant shortfall sparks LG fury,"US
Local govt workers, pensioners face Eid hardship
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Local Government Employees Federation has expressed strong concern over the provincial government's inadequate release of grants for the payment of salaries and pensions to employees and pensioners of financially weak local government institutions.
In an official statement, provincial leaders of the federation said that despite the relentless efforts of the organization, the Finance Department recently issued directives to release grants amounting to Rs360.400 million and Rs150 million for settled areas, and Rs71 million for merged areas.
However, these grants fall significantly short of meeting the actual financial needs of the respective Tehsil Municipal Administrations (TMAs).
The federation criticized the provincial authorities for not considering ground realities before releasing the grants. They emphasized that such insufficient allocations are a recurring issue.
Often, the approved amounts do not reflect the genuine demands submitted by TMAs, and in some cases, grants are denied altogether to the most financially vulnerable councils.
As a result, many local government employees and pensioners were unable to receive their dues in time for Eidul Fitr and now face similar hardships ahead of Eidul Azha.
The delay in grant approval further complicates the situation, as the funds do not reach the local bodies in time, leaving employees and pensioners without the means to perform religious obligations, including Qurbani (sacrifice).
Leaders of the Local Government Employees Federation, including Patron-in-Chief Shaukat Kayani, Chairman Mehboobullah, President Haji Anwar Kamal Khan Marwat, and General Secretary Sulaiman Khan Hoti, strongly urged the provincial government to ensure that grant approvals are based on actual financial needs rather than favoritism or outdated formulas.
They called for the timely and fair disbursement of grants.

Turmoil in Bangladesh,"US
.
After its traumatic struggle to separate from the rest of Pakistan, Bangladesh aspired to become a secular and pluralistic democracy. However, despite its relatively impressive economic performance and human development achievements, this densely populated country has remained plagued by recurrent political violence.
After experiencing years of bitter rivalry between its two main political parties, the political future of this second largest Muslim country in South Asia has become increasingly uncertain. Bangladesh has certainly seen its share of turmoil over these past five decades. The Awami League had been in power for just a few years when a bloody coup led to the assassination of Sheikh Mujeeb-ur-Rehman, along with many of his family members, in 1975. This assassination set the stage for the Awami League's deep-seated rivalry with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), formed by Zia-ur-Rahman.
Zia-ur-Rahman was also assassinated in another coup in 1981, by Awami League sympathisers for his alleged role in Mujeeb's murder. The military then remained in charge of the country for almost nine years. From the early 1990s onwards, the BNP (led by Zia-ur-Rahman's widow Khalida Zia) and the Awami League (led by Sheikh Mujeeb-ur-Rahman's daughter Sheikh Hasina) began alternating in government, barring another two-year period of a military-backed emergency caretaker regime which suspended parliamentary elections in 2007.
Khaleda Zia was the PM twice from 1991 to 1996, and from 2001 to 2006. Sheikh Hasina first became the PM in 1996. She then returned as PM in 2008 and remained in power till her ouster in August 2024.
The Awami League managed to stay in power for multiple terms by creating a broad-based coalition which included Bangladeshi nationalists, moderate Islamists and secular supporters. But Sheikh Hasina soon began exhibiting authoritarian tendencies. Under her, there was increased repression of opponents, including not only BNP leaders and workers, but also Jamaat-i-Islami members for their alleged collaboration with Pakistan while East Pakistan was struggling for independence. Sheikh Hasina used the security apparatus, and even co-opted the judiciary, to punish her opponents. She is also accused of engaging in massive electoral rigging.
Soon after Sheikh Hasina's controversial electoral victory in 2024, students rose up to protest the government decision to institute job quotas devised to benefit its own stalwarts. Repressive tactics to disperse protesters caused around 1,500 deaths, which is when the Bangladeshi military decided to withdraw its support to the government, and Sheikh Hasina was compelled to resign and flee to India.
Widely welcomed was the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of a new caretaker government which has taken upon itself the herculean task of institutional reforms, deemed a precondition for enabling fresh and fair elections. However, this interim setup is struggling to maintain law and order, implement its reform agenda, and avert the politics of revenge.
Moreover, the caretaker government has yet to announce a firm date for elections, and its decision to ban the Awami League is raising doubts about its intention to hold 'inclusive' elections. Conversely, the Jamaat-e-Islami, banned in 2013 by Sheikh Hasina, is now free to engage in the political process again.
BNP took to the streets recently demanding that elections be held during the current year. Students who led the 2024 protests have also formed their own political party. Despite Yunus claiming that he will not run for office, there is growing tension between him and the army. There are increased fears of communal violence, and uncertainty surrounding what the Awami League will do to push back against being sidelined by the interim setup.
The present political situation in Bangladesh is thus quite fluid. Whether Bangladesh will be able to form a new government, which can overcome the current polarisation, and transcend the politics of vindictiveness which has plagued the country for much of its existence, remains to be seen.

Vegetables drive weekly SPI up 0.02%,"DE
.
The Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) for the week ending June 4, 2025, registered a marginal rise of 0.02%, reflecting mixed price trends for essential commodities across Pakistan. The SPI, which monitors 51 key items across 50 markets in 17 cities, showed notable weekly increases in tomatoes (16.94%), potatoes (11.52%), and onions (5.21%). Moderate price hikes were also observed in bananas (1.57%), eggs (1.34%), sugar (1.24%), Basmati broken rice (1.02%), gur (0.81%), and petrol (0.41%).
Conversely, chicken prices dropped sharply by 11.22%, while garlic declined by 3.71%. Minor decreases were recorded in LPG, vegetable ghee, and cooking oil. Overall, prices of 18 items (35.29%) increased, 6 items (11.77%) fell, and 27 items (52.94%) remained unchanged.
On a year-on-year basis, the SPI posted a slight decline of 0.02%, indicating relative price stability. However, some items experienced steep annual hikes, including ladies' sandals (55.62%), eggs (35.36%), pulse moong (31.74%), powdered milk (23.82%), and sugar (23.51%). Other increases were seen in beef, bananas, and various pulses.
Major annual declines were recorded in onions (64.90%), electricity charges for the first quarter (36.54%), garlic (27.79%), potatoes (23.15%), and tomatoes (18.10%). Wheat flour, tea, chilies, diesel, and rice Irri also registered lower prices compared to last year.
Pakistan's Consumer Price Index (CPI) is projected to be 2.7% for May 2025, according to KS Global. ""The base effect is now fading, signalling a return to normalised price trends,"" said Muhammad Waqas Ghani, Research Head at JS Global. This brings the average inflation for 11MFY25 to 4.7%, down significantly from 24.9% in 11MFY24. JS Global forecasts FY25 average inflation at 4.6%, with a forward 12-month estimate of 5.7%. Following rapid disinflation, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) cut the policy rate to 11% in its last Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. A further reduction of 50100 basis points is possible, with the next MPC meeting scheduled for June 16, 2025.

Lawyers foil bid to arrest Haleem Adil, other party leaders
During the hearing for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan's bail plea in the Al-Qadir Trust case, PTI leaders and workers staged a protest outside the Sindh High Court (SHC) under the leadership of PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh.
The protesters demanded the release of Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, and other PTI leaders in custody, along with their acquittal in the false cases filed against them. During the peaceful demonstration, a police contingent attempted to arrest Haleem Adil Sheikh and other leaders. However, PTI lawyers intervened, and escorted Sheikh and the others into the court premises.
Haleem Adil Sheikh stated, ""our protest was peaceful, yet the police resorted to brutality and violence, which we will challenge in court. A civilian dictatorship has been established in Sindh, and martial law has been imposed across the country.""
Sheikh further said that Imran Khan has remained falsely imprisoned for over 600 days, stating, ""the 26th Constitutional Amendment has resulted in a massacre of justice, and the judiciary has been weakened.""
Regarding the Al-Qadir Trust case, Sheikh asserted that Imran Khan is not a beneficiary and has committed no corruption, and instead ""the real corruption was committed by Asif Ali Zardari and others, who purchased flats in London using stolen money, with the Sharif family as the beneficiaries. Imran Khan, on the other hand, established Al-Qadir University for religious education.""

How we love and lost Bakra Eid,"DE
Everyone's favourite festival is back, time to put our blinders on
By the time Eidul Azha actually rolls around, the country has long surrendered to it. Around this time, an empty plot rarely stays that way for long – transforming into a jam-packed mandi. There, you will find people gripping goats by their mouths to inspect their teeth. (For the unaware: the goat's teeth reveal its age, with the two-toothed ones holding the highest value). On the roads, cars cautiously crawl behind the occasional herd of cows that make their way like they own the place and somehow, they do.
No one bats an eye when a Suzuki drives by overflowing with animals stacked on top of each other, their limbs poking out from every possible gap. Kids run outside with bags of 'chaara' leaving a trail behind for their newly adopted goats. And of course, there is always that one cousin trying to one up everyone else, proudly boasting about how much cash they dropped on their cow or camel since a goat is simply too basic.
It is loud, it is chaotic, but it is unmistakably ours.
Because for many of us, this Eid is a direct line to our childhood memories. Trips to the mandi were our first introduction to the coveted phrase 'munasib lagao'. We all have a Bakra Eid story: the one goat that escaped through the neighborhood chased by a party of screaming uncles or the chachu who got smacked in the face by a panicked cow. Above all, we will never forget the dizzying excitement of waking up on Eid morning to the sound of knives being sharpened, the scent of raw meat in the air and our moms portioning out qurbani meat into plastic bags for our dads to distribute.
Certainly, there is an intimacy to this Eid that has stayed with us long after the meat has been packed away.
Yet, somewhere along the way, its spirit has started to fade away. For all the affection we offer our animals, it cannot be denied that we grossly overlook their comfort. Goats are tied too tightly under the harsh sun with no shade, cows stand for hours on hot concrete, and water is forgotten between rounds of eager children tugging at their ears or climbing on their backs. We decorate them in elaborate garlands and shiny bells, and laugh when they struggle under the weight as if their discomfort is part of a quirky performance. Perhaps our cruelty is not deliberate – we mean well in our excitement but it is increasingly on the edge of negligence.
Qurbani for the algorithm
A large part of what has changed also is that this sacred act has become entirely performative. Qurbani now arrives with a front-facing camera and animals are documented from the moment they arrive. Their pictures and videos are spammed across WhatsApp from every angle imaginable (including things no one wants to see) and posted to Instagram reels none of us can escape.
Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with it. In fact, much of it is, admittedly, hilarious. A goat named Pathan Khan eating biryani off a plate, another balancing between three men on a bike. However, our laughter should not negate the fact that this trend is reducing the animal to a source of entertainment, distorting the lines between sacrifice and spectacle. In doing so, it inevitably makes way for the more disturbing act of filming the Qurbani itself, with people resorting to posting pictures, full videos and even live streaming it. Which leaves us to question, who even watches those and what does that accomplish other than turning an act of worship into a sensationalised broadcast?
And then there is the matter of price. In the weeks leading up to Eid, prices soar to near absurd heights. An animal becomes a status symbol, less about sacrifice and more about wanting to surpass our neighbours – and their uncles and their brothers. Sellers, knowing that people will spend whatever it takes, take full advantage of this demand, because they know one simple truth: you cannot walk away without buying. And so, a ritual that is literally about charity ends up feeling increasingly out of reach, excluding the very people it was meant to uplift.
Blood, smell, and tears
Unfortunately, the challenges do not end here. Most densely populated cities in Pakistan are simply not designed infrastructurally to accommodate the scale, animals or the waste that comes with Eid. And Karachi, more than anywhere else, bears the grunt of it. This part – the aftermath – may be the hardest to joke about. It neither smells or looks good when zthe remains of the animals are left to rot on the side of the roads, as we jump over them to get to our cars. To make matters worse, there is always the impending doom that the rivers of fresh blood and sewage water will meet halfway to create a pungent sludge of filth and contamination.
And God forbid if it rains, the bloody waste water mixes with rainfall to create an unpleasant and foul mess to say the least. Not to mention, it stretches out already overburdened municipal services and falls on sanitation workers who are rarely paid or treated fairly.
In a religion where the ethical treatment of animals and the importance of cleanliness are fundamental, it is hard to overlook the irony. Ours is a ritual meant to honour life and sacrifice – it should not, under any circumstances, disregard it in the process.
To be clear, none of this is a rejection of the festival. If anything, it comes from a longing for a time we desperately ache for. Eid is still one of the few moments where the country feels connected. The endless BBQ dawats, the chaos in everyone's kitchens, the collective participation in something bigger than ourselves; these are things worth celebrating. But celebration should never come at the cost of compassion.
That is also not to say that everyone is getting it wrong. There are families who treat their animals gently, butchers who work cleanly and children who are taught clearly – not just what is happening but why it matters. Simply put: Bakra Eid can be the same, if only we let it be.

'Andheray Kay Roop' shines at drama festival,"US
The story revolves around a blind girl battling loneliness
On the twelfth day of the ongoing Regional Drama Festival organised by the Punjab Council of the Arts, Rawalpindi, the stage play ""Andheray Kay Roop"" was performed.
The play featured outstanding performances by renowned artists including Shazia Sheikh, Dr Waqar Azeem, Sania, and others, earning enthusiastic applause from the audience.
The story revolves around a blind girl battling loneliness, the shadows of her past, and her inner conflicts. Isolated from the world, she interacts with a single male character who represents her memories, fears, hopes, and dreams. This character appears in multiple forms — sometimes as a friend, sometimes an enemy, and sometimes a romantic figure — symbolising her emotional journey.
The performance drew a large audience, including city dignitaries, media representatives, families, officials, and members of literary and cultural circles, all of whom praised the cast's exceptional performances.
Dr Afshan Malik, a renowned poet, and PML-N President Raja Naseer were the special guests. They lauded the Government of Punjab's Family Theatre initiative, noting that the drama festival is not only delivering wholesome, high-quality entertainment but also preserving and promoting cultural heritage.

India paving ground for N-war: Bilawal,"CA
Terms stoppage of water act of war; Says any country will fight; Urges world not to allow violation of IWT
Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday said India is laying the ground for the first nuclear war over water by disrupting the supply of the precious resource and disregarding the World Bank-brokered Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan.
Addressing the Middle East Institute in Washington, Bilawal, who is also chairman of the Pakistan People's Party, said India shutting off Pakistan's water supply is laying the foundation for the first nuclear war over water. ""We have declared that cutting off our water supply would be an act of war,"" he added.
The PPP chairman said, ""We don't say it in a jingoistic manner. We don't say it with any relish. It is an existential crisis for us. Any country on the planet, no matter their size, their strength or their ability, would fight for their survival and fight for their water.""
He asserted that India must abide by the IWT and the US and other countries must take a firm stance to not allow it to violate the treaty.
""You cannot allow this precedent to be set in the Pakistan context, because we'll fight the first war, but it won't be the last. If India is allowed to stop our water, every upper riparian with hostilities to a lower riparian will have a carte blanche,"" Bilawal highlighted.
""And if our dialogue and diplomacy in pursuit of peace are to be successful, if we are to talk to India, have a positive dialogue with India, make new arrangements, new deals, perhaps even new treaties with India, then surely they first must abide by the old treaties and take back their decision vis-a-vis the IWT,"" the former foreign minister noted.
He said India held the IWT in abeyance after the deterioration in relations between the two countries following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. In retaliation, Pakistan decided that it would exercise the right to hold all bilateral agreements with India, including but not limited to the Simla Agreement, in abeyance. It also announced the closure of the Wagah border and suspension of all trade with New Delhi, among other measures.
Bilawal criticised the Indian government, saying it had refused cooperation on terrorism, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's offer for cooperation on investigating the Pahalgam attack, US President Donald Trump's mediation in the current dispute and more dialogue.
""All that means there'll be more terrorism, more war, and no peace. The prime minister of India and his government may want to damn his people to this fate. I refuse to damn my people, and I refuse to damn the people of India to this fate, which is why my delegation and I will be traveling from capital to capital with a simple message: We want peace. We need your help,"" said Bilawal.
""Surely, India and Pakistan working together, we can eradicate terrorism from the subcontinent. India and Pakistan working together can create that conducive environment in Kashmir where the people that live there can live there free from oppression, suffocation, and actually see prosperity. India and Pakistan's cooperation obviously would require the waters to flow freely, but it should lead to broader cooperation,"" Bilawal maintained.

Govt ignored agri sector in upcoming budget: SAB,"RO
No consultative process underway to invite growers' suggestions
The Sindh Abadgar Board (SAB) has deplored that the government appears indifferent to budgetary suggestions of their cohort as no consultative process has got underway with only few days left in the budget presentation.
A meeting of the board, a group which lobbies for the rights of farmers, was held in Hyderabad on Thursday with Mahmood Nawaz Shah in the chair. The meeting underlined that the prevailing slump in agricultural economy, on the contrary, called for painstaking pre-budget deliberations among the stakeholders.
The growers found fault with what they described as the government's 'cherry-pick' policy with regard to their sector's deregulation which, they claimed, is now being manipulated by the traders to the detriment of their corps. They contended that the actual deregulation of the agro-economy also encompassed free export of the agricultural produce, which to the utter disadvantage of the agriculturists, is being retrained.
""[Besides] the export will only enhance when the agricultural industry is competitive. One of the aspects of competitiveness is to analyze the international prices which are backed by heavy subsidies in input costs like in India,"" they said. They pointed out that they will become competitive with foreign growers when a robust infrastructure is provided to the rural economy.
""The anomaly of 18% GST [General Sales Tax] on locally produced cotton and the duty free import of cotton ought to be removed."" The meeting also demanded withdrawal of the GST from imported and locally made machinery, implements and tractors.
The measures like arranging subsidised credit, grants, equity participation and public private partnership have also become essential to support the sector with which the livelihood of tens of millions of people is connected.
They gave reference of India, which has converted 22% of their area to high efficiency systems whereas Pakistan has not achieved even 0.5% target.
Livestock
The SAB has discredited the official figure of the livestock sector's over 4% growth in the ongoing fiscal. The Federal Planning Commission's working paper for the upcoming federal budget speaks about 4.7% expansion in the sector over the previous year.

"Imran, Bushra fail to get Eid relief","US
IHC defers hearing on petitions seeking suspension of £190m case sentences till June 11
Imran Khan and Bushra Babi could not get a relief ahead of Eidul Azha as the Islamabad High Court (IHC) allowed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to appoint a special prosecutor to present its point of view on the couple's pleas seeking the suspension of their sentences in the £190m case.
A division bench of the capital's high court, comprising IHC Acting Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, on Thursday took up the PTI founder's and his wife's applications, seeking their release on bail after suspension of their sentences in the corruption case.
During the hearing, Barrister Salman Safdar, representing Imran and Bushra, quipped that they had managed to get the applications listed for hearing ""after countless prayers and pleas"".
He claimed that cases Toshakhana I case, Toshakhana II, and then the £190 million case – were fabricated to keep the couple behind bars. ""This is the most controversial verdict. The Supreme Court had made observations on the judge who delivered this verdict,"" he said.
Islamabad Accountability Court-I Judge Nasir Javed Rana on January 17 sentenced former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi respectively to 14 and seven years in prison in the £190 million case
In addition to the prison sentences, the court also imposed fines of Rs1 million on Imran and Rs500,000 on Bushra. The couple later challenged the verdict in the IHC.
Referring to other cases, Safdar said the trial courts convict Imran and Bushra but high courts later state that the convictions are wrong and suspend such verdicts.
NAB Prosecutor Rafiq Maqsood stated that he was informed about the case just a day earlier and received the notice only the previous night. ""I request that since the federal government has to appoint a special prosecutor for this case, and correspondence is needed with the Ministry of Law, we should be granted four weeks' time,"" he said.
Safdar, however, requested the court to decide Bushra's plea for suspension of her sentence prior to Eid."" ""If they want to bring a special team against the PTI founder, they can go aheadwe are not afraid,"" he added.
Latif Khosa, who also belongs to the PTI, said Imran Khan is in jail without any evidence. ""He has no intention of fleeing the country or tampering with the record,"" he said. The court remarked that the legal team should be given time to notify their representation. It adjourned the hearing until June 11.

Caution urged on foreign advice,"US
Think-tank urges govt to choose between home-grown recipes, IMF prescriptions
Amid Pakistan's heavy reliance on foreign consultants to run its economy, an independent think tank has advised the government to choose a path between a truly home-grown economic model and a foreign lender-driven policy agenda.
The Tola Associates policy advice came in the middle of a major shift in national tariff policy, where foreign consultants are advising a complete opening of the economy. However, the concerned economic ministries oppose this due to potential adverse implications for businesses and jobs.
Pakistan's economy is currently bipolar, and policymakers must choose between home-grown recipes and the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) policy prescriptions, according to the report released on Thursday. The report suggests that home-grown policies should aim to keep policy rates closer to the inflation rate to reduce debt servicing, maintain the currency at its true value, stimulate growth, and reduce the fiscal deficit.
In contrast, the IMF's policies focus on monetary tightening, import-led growth, and tariff reduction, which have consequently led to high inflation and suppressed economic growth, the report stated.
The government has agreed on a plan to lower import tariffs by almost half over the next five years. In the first year alone, this would result in a Rs200 billion negative impact on revenues. While the IMF has no objection to the steep reduction in import revenues, it is unwilling to allow much-needed relief to all segments of the salaried class.
The relief for the salaried class may not even cost Rs100 billion, nearly half the fiscal cost of liberalising the economy — a move that also carries employment risks.
The Tola Associates report stressed that next year's economic strategy must prioritise introducing targeted policy measures for industrial development. These include rationalising interest rates for industrial borrowers, reducing electricity tariffs, abolishing export financing schemes on semi-finished and finished goods, and implementing a balanced tariff structure on raw materials.
Encouraging import substitution and offering performance-based subsidies — particularly in key sectors such as textiles, leather, and engineering goods - is critical, the report added. However, past experiences suggest that import substitution policies have shown limited results, and the country must shift toward implementing export-focused policies.
The report also highlights how efficient crop production could enhance exports by an estimated $2.2 billion. Increasing cotton yields, boosting rice exports, and reducing input costs to return to wheat surplus status were among the key recommendations.
Based on its estimates, the report stated that if the current account deficit stays within the government's FY25 target of 0.4% of GDP, the exchange rate should ideally stabilise around Rs272 per US dollar. Including incorporated valuation adjustments for FY25, the rate should not exceed Rs282, it added.
However, market fundamentals indicate that the rupee is under pressure, with importers struggling to find adequate dollar liquidity at reasonable rates. Major players like Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pak Arab Refinery Company (PARCO) are being forced to pay higher interbank rates.
According to Tola Associates' estimates, Pakistan can achieve a current account surplus of 0.1% of GDP by improving cash crop yields in the next fiscal year.
If that surplus is realised, the currency could appreciate by up to Rs23, leading to a 4.6% drop in inflation. This, in turn, would create room to reduce interest rates, cut debt servicing costs, and open up significant fiscal space, the report added.
Pakistan can substantially bring down interest rates in the next fiscal year to single digits. A 1% reduction in the policy rate could lower the debt servicing cost by Rs515 billion. Aligning interest rates with inflation could allow for a 4.6% rate cut, saving up to Rs2.4 trillion in interest expenses, according to the report.

Haunted by missed potential,"DE
Exceptional performances add life to 'Deemak' and then the ghosts arrive
Without question, Deemak is the most divisive Pakistani release of the year. For those who still invoke ""support local cinema"" regardless of a film's craft or coherence, this is perhaps the moment they've been waiting for. A harsher critique of director Rafay Rashdi's horror-family drama might be too easy — were it not for the sobering state of Pakistani cinema.
When the only local competition is a film like Love Guru, hopes for a lively Eidul Azha at the movies are already dim. If audiences are weary of seeing Humayun Saeed and Mahira Khan replay the same formulas Hollywood created and Bollywood retired, Deemak is at least a departure. Rashdi deserves credit for venturing into a genre still novel in Pakistan's mainstream — psychological horror -— and for roping in A-listers like Faysal Quraishi, Sonya Hussaiyn, and Samina Peerzada, who are compelling enough to carry a lesser film.
Unfortunately, there's little novelty, or even the bare minimum, to distract an audience raised on Zee Horror Show or accustomed to the polish of big-budget US and UK. The result is a film that reminds you — every ten minutes, if not every second — how much better it could have been had it dared to be original. There are brief stretches when you can lose yourself in Samina's commanding performance or the slow unravelling of Faysal and Sonya's marriage. But just then, the ghosts arrive in all their ridiculous CGI glory.
An ugly genre
It's hard to tell whether the film assumes its audience is gullible and unfamiliar with horror, or simply so starved for content that it'll watch anything. Because there's no way the filmmakers genuinely believed their GTA-gameplay-style CGI ghosts would convince anyone. If the cross-border success of last year's Stree 2 is anything to go by, the lucrative appeal of comedy-horrors is undeniable. Stree 2 in particular — unlike the Bhool Bhulaiyaa franchise — leans heavily on preposterous CGI and still manages just fine.
However, Deemak is anything but a comedy-horror. Cut the CGI ghosts, and you're left with a politically resonant, emotionally intelligent family saga — not groundbreaking, but grounded. The writing does well to reimagine a typical saas-bahu conflict as a multi-generational horror, haunted less by ghouls than by grief, control, and intergenerational rage.
Most remarkably, Samina delivers the performance of her career as the embittered mother-in-law who knows only how to wound those around her. Sometimes she's domineering and ruthless, other times sickly and scheming, and by the second half, somehow all at once. Samina is also, single-handedly, Deemak's most effective off-screen source of fear.
If Samina is gorgeously uninhibited, Sonya, as the begrudged daughter-in-law, cannot escape the demands of stardom. Most scenes find her composed and impeccably put together — not a hair out of place. It's no secret that the pressure to look attractive often clashes with acting freedom. But Sonya may be a star beyond her looks. When she lets go of the prim, proper façade — her gel-manicured nails forgotten — and comes undone over a plate of bland rice and curry, she becomes something else entirely. With rice and grime smeared across her face, she looks simultaneously deranged and ethereal.
If horror is an ugly genre, Faysal gets the memo and enthusiastically complements Samina, his on-screen mother. Their dynamic as a possessive mother and protective son isn't surprising, especially if you recall the 2008 supernatural drama The Ghost, a Pakistani TV adaptation of Danielle Steel's eponymous novel. Set in an old, eerie Scottish castle, Faysal knows a thing or two about being haunted by the ghosts of the past when Samina is around. And boy, does it show. He's livid, raging, and spooked — not by what he sees, but by what he remembers. For those wary of mama's boys, watching Faysal's patience snap as yesterday's horrors bleed into the present adds the film's richest layer of emotional complexity.
Missed opportunities
It is these emotionally turbulent performances that dash any hope of passing Deemak off as a comedy horror. This leaves us with an emotionally rich palette that cannot reconcile its comical reliance on ghosts without revealing an underlying confusion.
It's not just that Deemak fails to scare - after all, few films genuinely do. The bigger indictment is that it haunts you in ways it never intended. While the frequent appearances of CGI ghosts are hard to ignore, the film feels burdened by a rigid allegiance to what a horror film should be. Cue the infamous scenes of people levitating off their beds, and the exorcist who spells out the supernatural menace for the audience.
If the resources to execute special effects and clichés are sparse, a film like Deemak could arguably dispense with them altogether. Its primary audience is, after all, well-versed in the visual vocabulary of the unseen. We cherish our saints, myths, and spirits — even when they have no face or flesh. With the right direction, it's clear that the film's real horror lies in grief, not the ghosts.
Unfortunately, Deemak is unwilling to risk being misunderstood at any cost. But there's only so much you can explain within a reasonably paced two-hour runtime before it borders on boring and pedantic.
By the time Deemak ends, the leading trio will have delivered solid performances, bolstered by capable child actors and memorable turns from Bushra Ansari, Javed Sheikh, and Saman Ansari — all anchored by a promising emotional core. Yet, at the end of the day, Deemak remains a ghost story haunted by its own potential.

"Overton, Bethell in Eng squad for India Test","GB
The Test at Headingley is the first in a five-match series
Jamie Overton was on Thursday handed a surprise recall to the England squad for the first Test against India while Jacob Bethell's return creates a top-order selection headache.
Overton has been a regular in England's white-ball set-up but won his solitary Test cap against New Zealand in 2022, taking two wickets and hitting an unexpected 97 with the bat.
It is unclear whether the all-rounder will be fully fit to take the field at Headingley on June 20, having broken a finger during the recent one-day internationals against the West Indies.
The England and Wales Cricket Board said the 31-year-old will be ""assessed and reviewed daily"" by its medical team.
Overton's Surrey teammate Gus Atkinson is not fit after injuring his hamstring in England's Test win against Zimbabwe last month.
England have brought back pacemen Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, both of whom missed the early part of the season with injury problems.
Woakes could edge out Sam Cook, who retains his place in the squad after a quiet debut against Zimbabwe.
Rising star Bethell is back from Indian Premier League duty after winning the tournament with Royal Challengers Bengaluru.
The 21-year-old impressed during his debut Test series in New Zealand in November and December, scoring three half-centuries at number three, and averages 52.
Vice-captain Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley were thought to be under pressure from Bethell's reintroduction but the pair both scored hundreds against Zimbabwe.
The Test at Headingley is the first in a five-match series.
England squad:
Ben Stokes (capt), Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, Harry Brook, Brydon Carse, Sam Cook, Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Jamie Overton, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jamie Smith (wkt), Josh Tongue, Chris Woakes.

"Trump, Xi discuss trade, rare earths","US
Two presidents hold rare leader-to-leader call
US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping confronted weeks of brewing trade tensions and a battle over critical minerals in a rare leader-to-leader call on Thursday that left key issues to further talks.
During the more than one-hour-long call, Xi told Trump to back down from trade measures that roiled the global economy and warned him against threatening steps on Taiwan, according to a Chinese government summary.
""The US side should take a realistic view of the progress made and withdraw the negative measures imposed on China,"" the Chinese government said in a statement summarizing Xi's call with Trump published by the state-run Xinhua news agency.
""Xi Jinping emphasized that the United States should handle the Taiwan issue prudently.""
But Trump said on social media that the talks focused primarily on trade led to ""a very positive conclusion,"" announcing further lower-level US-China discussions, and that ""there should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products"".
He later told reporters: ""We're in very good shape with China and the trade deal."" The leaders also invited each other to visit their respective countries. The highly anticipated call came in the middle of a dispute between Washington and Beijing in recent weeks over ""rare earths"" minerals that threatened to tear up a fragile truce in the trade war between the two biggest economies.
It was not clear from either countries' statements that the issue had been resolved. A US delegation led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet with their Chinese counterparts ""shortly at a location to be determined"", Trump said on social media.
Major US stock indexes were higher on Thursday.
The Chinese ministry said President Xi pointed out that recalibrating the direction of the giant ship of China-US relations requires us to take the helm and set the right course. ""It is particularly important to steer clear of the various disturbances and disruptions.""
The Chinese always honor and deliver what has been promised. Both sides should make good on the agreement reached in Geneva.
In fact, China has been seriously and earnestly executing the agreement. The US side should acknowledge the progress already made, and remove the negative measures taken against China.
The two sides should enhance communication in such fields as foreign affairs, economy and trade, military, and law enforcement to build consensus, clear up misunderstandings, and strengthen cooperation.
President Xi emphasised that the United States must handle the Taiwan question with prudence, so that the fringe separatists bent on ""Taiwan independence"" will not be able to drag China and America into the dangerous terrain of confrontation and even conflict.
President Trump said that he has great respect for President Xi, and the US-China relationship is very important. The US wants the Chinese economy to do very well. The US and China working together can get a lot of great things done. The US will honor the One-China policy.
The meeting in Geneva was very successful, and produced a good deal. The US will work with China to execute the deal. The US loves to have Chinese students coming to study in America.
President Xi welcomed President Trump to visit China again, for which President Trump expressed heartfelt appreciation. The two Presidents agreed that their teams should continue implementing the Geneva agreement and hold another round of meeting as soon as possible.

IPL's Bengaluru pledge cash help for stampede victims,"US
'Our fans will always remain at heart of everything we do'
Royal Challengers Bengaluru said Thursday they stood ""united"" with fans as the Indian Premier League champions announced financial aid to families of those crushed to death during their title celebrations.
Hundreds of thousands had packed the streets in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru on Wednesday to welcome home their hero Virat Kohli and his RCB team-mates after they beat Punjab Kings in a thrilling IPL final.
But the euphoria of the vast crowds ended in disaster when 11 fans died in a stampede near the city's M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, where the players were parading the trophy.
Most of the dead were young fans aged between 14 and 29 who had gone out just to catch a glimpse of their heroes. Dozens of abandoned shoes and flip-flops littered the site in the aftermath.
RCB offered financial aid of $11,655 to each family of those killed.
Indian media have widely reported the team earned $2.3 million in prize money alone for taking the title on Wednesday. ""Our fans will always remain at the heart of everything that we do,"" RCB said. ""We remain united in grief.""
Kohli, who top-scored in the final, said he was ""at a loss for words"" after celebrations of a dream IPL crown turned to tragedy.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the accident ""absolutely heartrending"".
Police used mild force to disperse people outside the stadium, an eyewitness told AFP, but the crowd was ""extremely difficult"" to control.
Lakshminarayan, who lost his 14-year-old granddaughter in the crush, said his family carried the child in a motor rickshaw to hospital. He said celebrations should have been delayed to prepare for the widely expected mass crowds.
""There was no need to conduct celebrations the very next day, they should have postponed it to a week and organised it a better way,"" he said. ""You should take all precautionary measures, they should have police protection and follow the queue system.""
Street food vendor Manoj Kumar mourned the death of his 18-year-old son. ""I wanted him to go to college,"" Kumar told the Indian Express newspaper. ""I brought him up with a lot of care. Now he is gone.""
A grieving mother outside a city mortuary said her 22-year-old engineering student son had also died. ""He was crazy about RCB,"" she was quoted as saying by the Indian Express. ""He died in an RCB shirt. They danced when RCB won and now he is gone. Can RCB give him back to us?"".

KWSC employee falls victim to 'target killing',"RO
Two MQM-P workers among four injured in firing by armed men
An employee of Karachi Water & Sewage Corporation (KWSC) affiliated with MQM-P Liaquatabad Sector died at a private hospital after he was seriously injured in a firing incident at a tea cafe at Al-Karam Square in Liaquatabad late on Wednesday.
According to details, Adeel Ali alias Ali Builder was a resident of FC Area Liaquatabad, and an employee of the Water Board. Adeel was the member of Liaquatabad sector, and Mustafa was the joint unit in-charge of the Alkram Square unit.
They were injured when four armed men riding two motorcycles opened indiscriminate fire. Four people were injured in the firing, identified as Adeel Ali, 38; Mustafa, 35; Muhammad Ishfaq, 58; and Abdul Khaliq, 22.
Adeel and Mustafa, were taken to a private hospital, while Muhammad Ishfaq and Abdul Khaliq were shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital.
Initial investigation by the police suggests that the target of the attackers was Adeel, while the other injured individuals were caught in the crossfire. The incident appears to be a case of personal enmity rather than a political motive.
The police are facing challenges in obtaining CCTV footage due to a power outage in the area at the time of the incident. It is stated that Adeel had no known enmity with anyone. He leaves behind four daughters, one son, and wife.
Funeral prayer of Adeel Ali was offered at the central Imambargah, Ancholi, on Thursday. A large number of Haq Parast leaders and workers attended the funeral. Later, the deceased was laid to rest at the Wadi-e-Hussain graveyard.

Citizens view barbecue gatherings as essential part of Eid festivities
As Eidul Azha draws near, the capital's residents eagerly prepare for festive barbecues, with Aabpara and G-9 Markaz markets bustling as demand surges for essentials like coal burners, skewers and knives. With Eid just around the corner, shopkeepers are witnessing a surge in sales, highlighting the timeless charm of outdoor cooking during the festivities.
Zaidi, a vendor at Aabpara Market, shared with media that the demand for BBQ burners and accessories surges to nearly twice the usual levels in the days preceding Eid. This is a profitable season for us, and the best time to sell these items,"" he said, while arranging stock for eager customers.
Many buyers view barbecue gatherings as an essential part of Eid festivities. Ali, a shopper at Aabpara Market, said, ""Eidul Azha feels incomplete without barbecue and seekh kebabs. We host a barbecue night for our family and friends every year."" However, Ali and other consumers voiced concerns over the steep rise in barbecue essentials prices, urging the government to intervene and offer relief during this festive occasion.

'I want Pak team to be nation's pride',"US
Head coach Hesson shares his coaching philosophy and vision
Pakistan's new white-ball head coach Mike Hesson appeared in a recent interview on the PCB Podcast, and shared his coaching philosophy and vision for the team's future.
Speaking candidly with former Test cricketer Bazid Khan, Hesson discussed his approach to player development, team culture, and what he hopes to achieve during his tenure with the Pakistan national team.
Looking ahead, Hesson's long-term goal is to leave a legacy that extends beyond immediate results. ""I would like the Pakistan public to say, 'This is a great team to watch,'"" he reflected.
Hesson, who brings years of experience from previous coaching roles, including the New Zealand cricket team, highlighted that his focus as a coach isn't on dictating how players should perform but rather on maximising their individual talents.
""Coaching is about trying to maximise talent. It's not necessarily about telling them about the greater things that I have played during my time,"" Hesson said.
He also emphasised the importance of building strong relationships with players.
""Once you understand a player's journey, you can add value,"" he explained, noting that coaching is a more holistic approach rather than a one-size-fits-all model.
His strategy revolves around understanding each player's background, what motivates them, and their specific goals before offering tailored guidance.
For Hesson, communication plays a pivotal role. ""Players deserve the right to know what's expected of them,"" he added, stressing that technical coaching and constant observation are key to his method.
""It's about observing a player first before deciding when to intervene,"" he said.
A significant part of Hesson's plan involves working closely with Pakistan's domestic circuit to spot talent. He noted the importance of developing clear pathways for emerging players.
""There'll be identified groups of players where I'll be keen to go and have a look, talk, and meet players,"" he said. ""This will ensure that players are well-trained, versatile, and ready to step up when called upon for national duties.""
In the years to come, Hesson hopes to lay a foundation for success that will endure after his departure, ensuring a smooth succession for future coaches.
""If when you leave, things fall over, then you haven't done a great job,"" he concluded, adding that his focus is on building a sustainable model.
Hesson's approach appears to be driven by a strong sense of long-term planning, aiming to not only improve the current team but also shape Pakistan's cricketing future for years to come.
Uncertainty surrounds Asia Cup 2025: report
The fate of this year's ACC Men's Asia Cup hangs in balance due to the recent cross-border tensions between two cricketing giants, Pakistan and India.
The six-team tournament, originally set to be hosted by India, now faces significant hurdles due to ongoing political tensions between the two neighbouring countries.
Last month, reports emerged that the defending champions and host are eyeing to pull out of the tournament due to the aforementioned reasons but the claims were soon after quashed by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Meanwhile, as per the latest development, a top BCCI official has refused to confirm India's availability for the tournament, stating that they did not have any discussions regarding the Asia Cup.
""To be honest, we have had no discussions within the board about the Asia Cup,"" a top official of the BCCI told Reuters, refusing to confirm whether the tournament will go ahead as scheduled. ""We have been busy with the Indian Premier League and then we have India's tour of England. These are our immediate concerns,"" he added.
Similarly, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) was also uncertain about its men's team's participation in the continental event as well.
""We will cross that bridge when we come to it,"" the PCB told Reuters in a statement. Earlier this week, ACC also announced the postponement of the Women's Emerging Teams Asia Cup 2025, which was originally scheduled to begin on June 6 in Sri Lanka.
The decision follows a request from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) President Shammi Silva, who wrote to ACC President Mohsin Naqvi, seeking a postponement due to unfavourable weather conditions and growing health concerns related to the chikungunya virus outbreak in the region.

Life of Chuck' explores essence of life and love,"PL
Tom Hiddleston stars in Stephen King adaptation
Before finishing the science-fiction drama film The Life of Chuck, English actor Tom Hiddleston and American director Mike Flanagan had a conversation about life, death and existence.
""I think (the conversation) went far deeper than just about any conversation I can recall having with an actor,"" Flanagan told Reuters during an interview in Los Angeles.
For both Hiddleston and Flanagan, the core of the film, based on author Stephen King's 2020 novella of the same name, is understanding the essence of being alive.
""I loved the wisdom in the story,"" Hiddleston said.
""This idea of holding onto the people you love and the people who matter, because you never know when it'll all end, and to have the courage to live as fully as you can with what you have,"" he added.
The film produced by Intrepid Pictures, FilmNation Entertainment, and WME Independent arrives in theatres on Friday.
The story follows Charles ""Chuck"" Krantz, whose life story is told chronologically backwards, depicting the influence he has on the world and also how the world influences him.
The film explores existentialism, death and loss, and the apocalypse, fitting the thematic elements that both King and Flanagan are known for.
The cast includes Hiddleston as Chuck Krantz, Mark Hamill as Chuck's grandpa Albie Krantz, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Karen Gillan as ex-spouses Marty Anderson and Felicia Gordon.
Beyond the supernatural themes, Hamill believes the messages of The Life of Chuck delve into current real-world divisions.
""I really think it's the perfect timing for this movie, because we are so divided as a nation, and we are dealing with just one outrage after another,"" he said.
""It's almost frightening to open up your computer every day and see what's happened now. And so, I think this movie couldn't arrive at a better time. It's almost therapeutic,"" he added. Reuters

"Nepra allows relief for Karachi, raises tariff for the rest","US
New changes to be reflected in the current month's electricity bills
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday issued two separate notifications, reducing the power tariff by Rs2.99 per unit for the consumers in Karachi, while increasing the rate by Rs0.93 per unit for the rest of the country.
The changes in the tariff had been done on account of fuel adjustment for the month of March in case of Karachi and for the month of April for other parts of the country. In any case, the new changes would be reflected in the current month's electricity bills.
According to one notification pertaining to the tariff of the K-Electric, the authority ""decided to allow a negative FCA of Rs2.9898/kWh (negative Rs4.045 billion) for March 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of June 2025"".
Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to ""all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff"".
It said that the KE would reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of March in the billing month of June. ""The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers' bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains,"" it added.
According to a separate notification, the authority ""has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform increase of Rs0.9306/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos [Distribution Companies] on account of variations in the fuel charges for April"".
The notification added that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.

West plans N-resolution against Iran,"US
.
Western allies are planning to file a resolution to the world nuclear watchdog condemning Iran for ""non-compliance"" over its nuclear programme, diplomatic sources told AFP on Thursday.
It is the latest move in years-long efforts to restrict Iran's nuclear activities over fears that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, which it denies.
The United States and European countries will submit the resolution to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board next week, with the threat of referring the issue to the United Nations, the sources said.
After a recent IAEA report showed ""a general lack of cooperation"" by Tehran, the United States, Britain, France and Germany ""are tabling a resolution that will find Iran in non-compliance"" with its nuclear obligations, a senior diplomatic source said.
Recent rounds of talks between the United States and Iran, mediated by Oman, have aimed to secure an agreement on limiting enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief.
Two other diplomats confirmed the resolution initiative in comments to AFP, saying it would ""increase pressure"" on Iran, with a vote scheduled at the IAEA board in Vienna on June 11.
Iran rejected last week's IAEA report, calling it a ""political"" manoeuvre, and accused Israel of contributing ""unreliable and misleading information"" to it.
The moves come with high tensions in the Middle East over Israel's military offensive in Gaza.
Iran has denied seeking nuclear arms and says it needs the uranium for civilian power production.

"PTI wanted to spread chaos, witness testifies in ATC","US
Defence lawyers in GHQ attack case protest
The key witness in the GHQ attack case testified in the Anti-Terrorism Court on Thursday, saying that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was involved in spreading hatred against the military and the state institutions in the country.
During the hearing of the case, related to the attack on the GHQ gate on May 9, 2023, against the PTI founder Imran Khan and others inside the Adiala Jail, Sub-Inspector Muhammad Riaz, who was the complainant of the case, said that the PTI wanted to spread chaos and anarchy in the country.
On Thursday, prosecution witness SI Riaz recorded his statement before ATC Judge Judge Amjad Ali Shah amid the ruckus created by the defence lawyers. On that the judge issued a show-cause notice to the defence lawyers for contempt of court.
SI Riaz testified that DVDs and other evidence received from the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) were played on a big screen in a joint investigation team's (JIT) meeting.
After seeing all the evidence, it was proven that the PTI as a party was involved in spreading hatred against the army and state institutions to spread chaos and anarchy in the country. He added that USBs and DVDs related to the provocative speeches of the PTI founder and Shehryar Afridi, and about the spot and surrounding areas, were seized in his presence.
During the hearing, the defence lawyers insisted on calling in senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja to the court. Prosecutor Zaheer Abbas Shah objected to the request, saying that Raja had not assisted the court even for a single day, rather he wanted to come inside to plot violent protest.
The PTI founder had announced that he would lead the protest across the country from inside the jail and Raja wanted to consult with the PTI founder to finalise the conspiracy against the state and state institutions. Shah said that no political meeting could take place during the court proceedings.
However, the protest by the defence lawyers continued and at one point they also warned by boycotting the proceedings. The ATC expressed his anger over the situation and issued show-cause notices to the defence lawyers for contempt of court.
Because of protest, the statements of two more prosecution witnesses, Sub-Inspector Saleem Qureshi and Manzoor, could not be recorded. Later, the hearing of the case was adjourned until June 21 inside the Adiala Jail.
During the hearing, JIT Convener SP Faisal Saleem also appeared in court, however, SSP Investigations Rawalpindi did not appear despite the court summon. The judge issued notices of the SSP investigation and sought reply until June 11.
PTI founder Imran Khan was produced in the court, while several accused, including Shibli Faraz, Zartaj Gul, Amjad Niazi, Usman Dar and Fawad Chaudhry, appeared in court to attend by the hearing

Zakat Department cancels Eid payouts,"US
Fails to distribute promised financial aid to orphans, widows and needy families
Due to a severe 'financial crisis', the District Zakat and Ushr Department on Thursday again failed to distribute Eid gifts to 10 deserving recipients, including orphans and widowed women, in Rawalpindi district on the occasion of Eidul Azha.
Earlier, no financial assistance or Eid gifts were distributed during Eidul Fitr either.
On Thursday, needy individuals, widows, and other deserving recipients, who visited the Zakat office in hopes of receiving financial aid, were informed that there would be no disbursement, which prompted widespread protest among the affected families.
For the past 18 months, no financial aid has been distributed to eligible beneficiaries across Punjab due to the ongoing economic crisis. Prior to Eidul Fitr, there were announcements of Eid gifts worth Rs12,000 per recipient from the 20th to the 25th of Ramazan. However, on the 28th of Ramazan, the beneficiaries were told, ""There is no money,"" and the distribution was canceled.
Similarly, this Eidul Azha, an official announcement was made on April 28, stating that Rs24,000 would be given to each deserving individual as part of a one-time Eid gift. The news had brought joy to many needy families, widows, and orphans. However, when a large number of women arrived at the Zakat office to collect the promised aid, they were informed that funds had not been released and that the Eid gifts were canceled. Officials told them the money might be disbursed after Eid, once funds become available.
Many women were seen in tears. One widow, Razia Begum, expressed her distress, saying, ""They humiliated us on Eidul Fitr too. At that time, we were told we'd receive Rs12,000; now Rs24,000 was promised as annual aid, and once again, we've been turned away. If there's no money, they shouldn't make false promises.""
Families of patients suffering from leprosy were also denied financial assistance, despite being listed among recipients.
Zakat Department employees in Rawalpindi revealed that they themselves have not received their salaries, even though staff in other government departments were paid on May 30 and 31. Without their wages, these employees said they couldn't buy clothes or shoes for their children, and their Eid celebrations were ruined. They have been told salaries might be issued on June 10 or 11.
On Thursday, all deserving women and families who came in hopes of receiving financial assistance returned disappointed.
The Zakat Department typically provides a monthly subsistence allowance of Rs2,000, paid every three to four months via EasyPaisa. However, due to the ongoing financial crisis across Punjab, this allowance has not been disbursed for the past 18 months. A full year's unpaid aid, amounting to Rs24,000, was supposed to be given as an Eid gift this time, butjust like Eidul FitrEidul Azha passed without any assistance due to unavailability of funds.

"Denmark aims to ban veils in schools, varsities","US
.
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday her government planned to extend the ban on full-face Islamic veils in public places and apply it to schools and universities as well.
She also said she wanted to see an end to prayer rooms at universities but stopped short of calling for a outright ban.
""God has to step aside. You have the right to your faith and to practice your religion but democracy takes precedence,"" she told Danish news agency Ritzau.
In August 2018, Denmark banned the wearing full-face Islamic veils like the burqa and niqab in public places, with offenders subject to a fine.
Human rights campaigners and religious groups have criticised the ban as discriminatory and as a violation of both freedom of religion and women's freedom of choice.
Supporters argue it enables Muslims of immigrant backgrounds to better integrate into Danish society.
Frederiksen alleged that prayer rooms at universities could be used for ""social control and oppression"".
She said her government would start talks with universities to have them removed.
""It's not a discussion about whether we want them or not,"" Frederiksen said.
""We are actively taking a position that we don't want them because they are used as a mechanism of oppression against girls and potentially boys as well.""
Frederiksen said she did not know how widespread the phenomenon was.
""For me, it's not just the scale that matters. I'm the prime minister of Denmark. I'm also a woman. And I can't tolerate the oppression of women.""

"Dialogue, not aggression","US
.
In an endeavour to achieve a new-normal relationship between India and Pakistan, the former Foreign Minister has taken a leap-forward in his approach. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari's suggestion that sleuths from ISI and RAW should sit down for brain-storming to address the pestering dispute of terrorism is worth-appreciating. In fact, that is the way to go as the warring factions need to set in some semblance in their distrustful ties, and that can only happen when stakeholders from the security domain huddle in for a sincere de-escalation effort.
The PPP leader's idea must galvanise into the next orbit of thought-process, and New Delhi and Islamabad must put behind their ulterior conventions to make a stride in the right direction. The precedent that DGMOs and NSAs had off and on been meeting to iron out grievances, especially after skirmishes and eventualities, should make a headway in intelligence bosses spectrum too, and there is no harm in giving it a try for the wider sake of confidence building measures and congeniality.
Pakistan's thrust that outstanding disputes with India should be resolved through diplomacy is laudable. The stance has won laurels in the US and Russia, as well as the UN, where Islamabad had sent in its emissaries to convince the world community that India should opt for a policy of dialogue and restraint, rather than unilateralism or intimidation.
The Pakistani delegates made a forceful point by telling the US legislators that Delhi should exhibit respect for International Law, UNSC resolutions and the Indus Water Treaty, and desist from war-mongering to appease its domestic agenda at the cost of regional peace and security.
Islamabad's synopsis, as reiterated by Bilawal, that there is no military solution, and only diplomacy and dialogue can deliver lasting peace in South Asia must resonate in world capitals. It is imperative that the Kashmir dispute be resolved and the cross-border terrorism enigma be sorted out once and for all by huddling of heads and hearts. Let there be a perpetual de-escalation and not merely a thaw.

Ayeza Khan under fire for 'insensitive' statement,"US
Actor's comments follow the murder of Sana Yousaf
Following the murder of 17-year-old influencer Sana Yousaf, Ayeza Khan joined her fellow celebrities and the internet in speaking out about the issue. However, her priorities didn't quite align with what netizens were expecting from her.
Instead of condemning the murder or the perpetrator, Ayeza chose to discuss the repercussions of sharing one's personal life on social media. ""Let's all understand the pros and cons of social media, especially when it comes to our security. Keep your addresses, car numbers, regular spots, and children's details private,"" she wrote.
""It's not safe. It's just not safe. Share less. Times have changed,"" she emphasised. ""Recognise that the audience you have today isn't the one you personally chose. It's from all over the world.""
The Meray Paas Tum Ho actor believes that it is one's own responsibility to guard what they put out in the digital world. ""Let's take responsibility for what we share,"" she said. Adding a prayer, she concluded, ""May Allah protect us all and keep us in good company. Ameen.""
'Tone deaf much?'
Although Ayeza's sentiments stemmed from a place of concern for the detrimental impact of social media on one's life, netizens called out her statement for lacking sensitivity and veering towards victim blaming.
""Someone lost their life because some man had a similar toxic ideology as the roles your husband plays in every single drama he stars in, and your main takeaway is 'let's protect ourselves'? Tone deaf much?"" an Instagram user questioned.
The user didn't mince their words, urging Ayeza to tell her actor-husband Danish Taimoor to stop romanticising toxic masculinity in his drama serials and have empathy for the family who lost their young girl.
""You should at least have some form of the humanity that you were preaching a few weeks ago, telling others to not victim blame,"" the user continued. ""You seriously need to check yourself first and then hire a decent PR team because every statement you make is the most ridiculous, tone-deaf, and insensitive thing ever.""
A different netizen suggested that the Humraaz actor is hypocritical for having an active Instagram account and still putting out such statements. ""While your whole life is on your social media account, you still have the guts to shape cold-blooded murder into a lack of self-protection. Please come out of the fancy clothes and glamorous shoots. The victim was not at fault at all. Maybe tell your dear husband to not choose scripts like he does all the time and stop normalising abuse on screens.""
Other criticism ranged from speaking out against male privilege to hoping to de-platform celebrities who perpetuate harmful ideas that influence the wrong minds. Many argued that the problem is not social media but the entitlement that criminals have to commit such heinous crimes without the fear of being watched or punished.
As per the BBC, a 22-year-old man confessed to murdering Sana after being arrested. Authorities believe that Umar Hayat murdered the influencer at her home in Islamabad after she rejected his ""offers of friendship"". They informed the BBC that he broke into her house, fired two shots, and fled with her phone.
Sana's family gathered in Chitral for her burial. Her father, Syed Yousaf Hassan, shared that she was his only daughter a ""very brave"" one at that. He added that she had never mentioned Umar or reported any threatening behaviour before her life was taken on Monday.

K-P chief minister observes they reserve the right to protest
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Thursday said they did not see any sign of PTI founder and patron-in-chief Imran Khan being released from prison, adding that they reserved the right to protest and would defeat the current system with their strength.
He was speaking to reporters outside Adiala Jail after meeting the former premier.
Terming the incumbent regime ""fraud and deceit"", the K-P chief minister said the current setup believed they can enslave the nation through the use of batons. ""They should know that we will hit back with batons against batons, and bullets against bullets. If anyone shoots at me, those protecting me will shoot back,"" he declared.
Gandapur noted that the prospects of PTI's founder release seemed distant. ""We don't see any sign that Khan sahib will be released. We reserve the right to protest, and we will defeat this system with our strength.""
He accused the authorities of delaying the prosecution and described the judiciary as ""no longer independent"". ""A prosecutor claimed last night that there would be a hearing today - this is all drama. The courts are not free,"" he said.
He announced that the upcoming K-P budget would be tax-free.
The chief minister also said that his meeting with the party's founder had been detailed, during which he instructed that K-P's development funds be spent on public welfare. ""Previously, we used to give funds directly to members. Now we will require them to submit development schemes that will be scrutinised by a committee before funds are approved,"" he explained.
He warned that the National Finance Commission (NFC) share for the province was being delayed and the meeting had been pushed to August. ""If that meeting is not held on time, we will decide on a course of action,"" he warned.
Gandapur criticised the treatment of Bushra Bibi, Imran's wife, who he said was under house arrest without even family visits being allowed. ""Never before has anyone treated another person's wife in this manner.""
He said PTI's movement would continue with patience and resilience, but that ""if human rights are not respected in this country, we will come out on the streets"".
He said ""those who have taken over this country are destroying it"".
The K-P chief minister also mentioned Imran's call for dialogue [with the establishment], noting that the PTI founder was still open to talks for the ""sake of the country"" ¬.
Gandapur maintained that the PTI founder also referenced Omar Ayub, saying he was the opposition leader.

Messi uncertain for WC qualifier against Chile,"US
Argentinian coach to monitor champion footballer's fitness
Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni said on Wednesday he had yet to decide whether captain Lionel Messi would start in their next World Cup qualifier against Chile, as he continues to closely monitor the 37-year-old's fitness.
With their place at the 2026 World Cup already secured, Argentina, who lead the South American qualifying standings, travel to face bottom-placed Chile on Thursday without several regulars and with Messi's role uncertain.
""We've been in contact (with Messi) recently. We haven't decided yet whether he'll play from the start or not. It would be good to know how he's feeling physically,"" Scaloni told reporters.
""It's clear that today we're in a position to try other things. In principle, he's available to play, and we'll decide later."" With a number of key players sidelined by injury or suspension, Scaloni called it a chance to test new talent ahead of their World Cup title defence next summer in the United States, Mexico and Canada.
""We're going to have a lot of players out. If some of the guys we call up are fit and ready to play, they'll get their chance,"" he said.
""I don't have the starting eleven confirmed yet, but we will give some playing time to players who haven't played much and who we believe are ready to play.
""Although the result is always important, we don't think it's crucial today. We'll probably try to help these players settle in and give them the chance to get some playing time with the team.""
The 47-year-old coach stressed that Argentina's mentality remains unchanged and delivering a strong performance is still the priority.
""We want to play, it's good for us to see other players, even those who are playing well. A match is never inopportune,"" Scaloni said.
""It's not that we national teams play so much that we would say we don't want to play this match. On the contrary. We think it's a nice match to play, with its difficulties. We are in a good position.""
Scaloni also weighed in on Carlo Ancelotti's appointment as Brazil coach, saying he believes the Italian will strengthen the five-time world champions.
""I think it's great. We're talking about one of the best coaches of recent times. He's going to raise the profile of Brazil even more,"" Scaloni added.
""I like his attitude, I like everything about him. I think he's going to be good. At the end of the day, he enriches the game. He's welcome here and I wish him all the best.""

'Outsiders' appointed to top prison posts following jailbreak,"US
DIG Hyderabad Traffic Police appointed IG Prisons after promulgation of ordinance
The Sindh government has started appointing officers from non-prison service groups to senior positions within the provincial prison system.
This move comes in the wake of a major jailbreak at Malir District Jail, where more than 200 inmates escaped earlier this week.
On Thursday, the Sindh government appointed Fida Hussain Mastoi, a Federal Police Service officer and current DIG of Traffic Police Hyderabad, as IG Prisons.
This marks the first time an officer from outside the Prisons Service Group has been appointed to this role.
The appointment follows the promulgation of an ordinance amending the Sindh Prisons and Correctional Services Act, 2019. Issued by Acting Governor Owais Qadir Shah, the ordinance allows officers from other federal and provincial services, including the Pakistan Administrative Service, Police Service of Pakistan, and the Provincial Management Service, to be appointed to senior prison posts such as IG Prisons, DIG Prisons, and Senior Superintendent of Jails.
The revised law also grants the Provincial Minister for Prisons, Haji Ali Hassan Zardari, the authority to directly appoint Senior Superintendents of Jails in major facilities, including Karachi Central Jail.
Previously, such appointments were made on the recommendation of the Home Department, which forwarded candidate summaries to the Chief Secretary for approval.
Until now, only officers from the Prisons Service Group were eligible for top positions in the Sindh Prisons Department, in accordance with the 2019 Act.
With this ordinance, that restriction has been lifted, and officers from other backgrounds, including Sindh Police, are now eligible for prison leadership roles.
The timing of the ordinance has raised eyebrows, as it was issued just hours after the high-profile security breach at Malir Jail.
In response to the escape, the Sindh government has dismissed IG Prisons Qazi Nazir and suspended DIG Prisons Muhammad Hassan Sehto, along with the superintendent, deputy superintendent, and several jail officials.
Inmates sent on judicial remand
An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Thursday remanded 115 inmates to judicial custody in connection with the recent jailbreak at District Jail Malir.
The prisoners were brought under heavy security to the Anti-Terrorism Complex located within Karachi Central Jail.
During the hearing, the court strongly criticised police for submitting an incomplete remand report.

Pilgrims ascend Mount Arafat for Hajj climax
Muslim worshippers prayed on Mount Arafat during the high point of the Hajj pilgrimage on Thursday, as authorities urged them to avoid the hottest hours of the day after tragedy struck last year.
Thousands of white-robed pilgrims recited verses from the holy Quran from dawn on the 70-metre (230 feet) rocky rise near Makkah, where the Prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) gave his last sermon.
But numbers thinned by midday following official warnings for pilgrims to stay inside between 10:00am and 4:00pm, a year after 1,301 people died in temperatures that hit 51.8 degrees Celsius (125 degrees Fahrenheit).
Delivering the annual Hajj sermon at Masjid-e-Nimrah in Arafat, the Imam and Khateeb of the Grand Mosque, Sheikh Dr Saleh bin Abdullah bin Humaid, emphasised the profound spiritual and unifying significance of the Day of Arafah, urging Muslims around the world to uphold the true essence of Islam through faith, humility, and sincere devotion to Allah.
Addressing the pilgrims, Sheikh Dr Humaid highlighted Islam's core principles, underscoring the importance of monotheism, compassion, moral conduct, and social justice.
He called on believers to strengthen their connection with Allah through constant remembrance, heartfelt prayers, and righteous deeds, especially on this sacred day known for divine mercy and the acceptance of supplications.
""The Day of Arafah is not only a symbol of unity for the Ummah but also a reminder of our collective submission to the Creator. On this day, Allah's mercy descends abundantly, and prayers are answered. Let us fill our hearts with gratitude and our tongues with His praise,"" he said.
""I came here early to (avoid) the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,"" said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.
Saudi authorities have taken several steps to reduce the risk from heat at the Hajj, which has drawn more than 1.6 million pilgrims to one of the world's hottest regions, according to fresh figures published on Thursday.
Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands more medics are on standby and more than 400 cooling units have been deployed, the hajj minister told AFP last week.
The Saudis have also cracked down on unregistered, non-fee paying pilgrims, who lack access to the full amenities and made up more than 80 percent of last year's deaths.
On Thursday, icepacks were handed to people walking towards Mount Arafat, with some placing the small bags on their heads.
With temperatures reaching 42C (107.6F), officials ushered people away if they spent too long in one place near the bouldered hill, which had fans spraying mist and cool air at its foot.
Late Thursday afternoon, pilgrims began making their way to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles for Friday's symbolic ""stoning of the devil"".
Despite the heat, they were generally delighted to be performing the Hajj. ""I don't think about the sun or the temperature or anything like that,"" said Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Egypt.
""Because standing in Arafat is a great thing and a beautiful day, and as you can see, all the pilgrims"" are doing it.
Ali, 33, from Pakistan, said he felt ""blessed"" to take part. ""This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Hajj and I always thought: ""I wish I could be here',"" he said.
Through tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform the Hajj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.
""It's a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,"" the Egyptian woman in her 50s told AFP from the foot of the mount.
Saudi officials said the heat-mitigation measures implemented this Hajj had largely been successful in preventing a repeat of last year.
""We are encountering a limited number of heat related illnesses cases this year and this is evidence of the effectiveness of all the organisation measures as well as preventive measures,"" said Mohammed Al-Abd Al-Aali, Saudi Arabia's assistant minister of health.
Along with the anti-heat measures and thousands of extra personnel, Saudi Arabia is also using an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.
More than 15,000 cameras run through artificial intelligence software are monitoring the holy sites and walkways during an event that has a history of deadly stampedes.
This year, officials have also clamped down hard on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, using raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
