A budget beyond rhetoric,"AE
Game-changing ideas and transformative actions, not routine fixes, are what Pakistan needs now
There is no dearth of proposals and ideas for the forthcoming federal budget for the year 2025-26, nor is there any shortage of ambition and claims by the finance ministry about the poor-friendly nature and positive impact of the budget on the economy of Pakistan.
What, in fact, is lacking is any innovation or change — and above all, the resources to meet the aforementioned aspirations and claims. Why not think out of the box and come up with some game-changing and transformative actions? This is the time for Pakistan to defy rhetoric and prove an ability to do something different and unexpected. Some of these ideas are as follows.
First and foremost, there is a real need to expand the revenue base and numbers. Every year there are certain adjustments in tax rates and incidence, primarily to expand the taxpayers' base. This adds a couple of hundred billion rupees each year, in addition to the normal increase in the revenue base due to economic growth.
This time, why not meet this target by another source — bar the banks, particularly the government-owned ones, from loan write-offs and recover those as part of the federal revenue? This would yield at least a couple of hundred billion rupees. Moreover, why not cease the subsidies to state-owned enterprises, especially the likes of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan Steel, and Pakistan Railways? This would save another few hundred billion rupees. This would spare the poor taxpayers, especially individuals, who must bear the burden of increased tax collection every year.
Among the more standard and expected actions to increase revenue is the implementation of comprehensive tax reforms. This includes broadening the tax base by bringing more individuals and businesses into the tax net.
Simplifying the tax code, reducing exemptions, and enhancing tax compliance through digitalisation and automation can significantly improve tax collection. Additionally, introducing progressive taxation policies can ensure that the wealthy contribute their fair share to the national exchequer.
Secondly, rather than curtailing public sector expenditure in the development sector, it is imperative that we increase it. Investing in infrastructure is crucial for boosting productivity and economic growth. The government should prioritise the development of transportation networks, energy projects, and digital infrastructure by itself rather than relying only on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
Public-private partnerships (PPPs) can be leveraged to attract private investment in large-scale infrastructure projects. Improved infrastructure will not only facilitate international and internal trade and commerce but also enhance the overall quality of life for citizens.
Thirdly, it is important to incentivise and invest more in the agriculture sector rather than finding ways to tax it. Agriculture remains a vital sector for Pakistan — not only for the economy and jobs but for the very basics of society and the future of food security. Increasing agricultural productivity will have a transformative impact on the whole economy and society. The government should invest in modernising agricultural practices, providing access to high-quality seeds, fertilisers, and irrigation systems. Promoting research and development in agriculture and offering training programs for farmers can lead to higher yields and better-quality produce. Additionally, establishing efficient supply chains and reducing post-harvest losses can improve the profitability of the agricultural sector.
Fourthly, it is important to announce an impactful and sizable support package for the promotion and strengthening of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs are the backbone of Pakistan's economy, and supporting their growth can lead to substantial economic benefits. The government should introduce targeted incentives for SMEs, such as a blanket tax break for innovation-oriented SMEs, low-interest loans, and grants for innovation and technology adoption. Establishing business incubators and providing access to training and mentorship programmes through government support programmes can also help SMEs thrive and create more job opportunities.
Fifthly, it is time to adapt the fiscal system to promote innovation and technology. Innovation and technology are key drivers of economic growth in the modern world. The government should invest in research and development (R&D) and promote collaboration between academia, industry, and government institutions. Providing grants and incentives for startups and tech companies can spur innovation and create new business opportunities. Additionally, enhancing digital literacy and expanding access to high-speed internet can empower citizens to participate in the digital economy.
Sixthly, to ensure inclusive growth, it is essential to strengthen social safety nets and provide support to vulnerable populations. The government should enhance resources for social welfare programmes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), but also expand these to healthcare, education, and housing. Implementing targeted cash transfer programs and providing subsidies for essential goods can help alleviate poverty and improve the standard of living for marginalised communities.
It is quite easy, despite the challenging economic situation, to come up with a budget with some adjustments in the usual economic and budget toolkit and create a political marketing package for it. It may, however, be much easier for the citizens, more impactful in the long term, and better for the country if some game-changing actions are taken at the cost of short-term political capital.

Reconstruction work stalls over land dispute,"US
Resource disagreements between Pakistan Railways and the Sindh government have instigated a development impasse
For a city as big as Karachi, a citywide transit network is crucial for addressing the transportation needs of the low-income masses and reducing the atmospheric pollution plaguing the industrial hub. Yet progress on public transport projects like the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) has remained minimal due to persistent land disagreements between state bodies.
According to information received by The Express Tribune, in 2021, on the directions of the Supreme Court, Pakistan Railways had started development work on underpasses and flyovers at various places in the city to eliminate the KCR gates. ""The revival of the Karachi Circular Railway was planned to be done in two phases. The first phase, costing Rs20 billion, involved the elimination of 24 railway crossings while the second project concerned the revival of the Circular Railway, including the construction of double tracks, reconstruction of stations and purchase of light rail. This phase was estimated to cost Rs200 billion under a public-private partnership. The entire project was to be completed in two years,"" said an official from Pakistan Railways, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
The official further revealed that in 2022, caretaker Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had approved the request of Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, directing Pakistan Railways to immediately hand over all the assets and land of the Karachi Circular Railway to the Sindh government. However, senior officials of Pakistan Railways were skeptical on the grounds that the construction, repair and operation of the railway system was a highly technical task requiring ample experience, which the Sindh government lacked. Since the federal government rejected the concerns of Pakistan Railways, development work on the railway crossings of the KCR was halted three years ago.
According to the concerned officer, underpasses, flyovers and elevated rail tracks were to be constructed at seven locations along the 44 kilometre loop of the Karachi Circular Railway. Work on two underpasses at Gulshan-e-Iqbal 13D had started three years ago, 70 per cent of which had been completed. In addition, a railway overhead bridge at Hussainabad, a 3.5 kilometre elevated track from Musa Colony to Manghopir and a 6.5 kilometre elevated rail track from Gulbai Phatak to West Wharf were also under construction. Moreover, an underpass was to be constructed on University Road and a flyover at Ahmed Shah Bukhari, Machar Colony. Unfortunately, none of this could be completed.
Dr Syed Nawaz Al-Huda, a regional planner, was of the opinion that had the Karachi Circular Railway project been completed in time, the people of Karachi would not have been victims of so many road accidents today. ""In principle, this project should remain with Pakistan Railways because the Sindh government has no experience in railway construction and operations. It has been 36 years since the closure of the KCR, but this project is still plagued by the red tape,"" highlighted Dr Al-Huda, who implored the government to complete this project on a priority basis.
Addressing the criticism, Managing Director of the Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) Kamal Hakim Daio told The Express Tribune that the Sindh government had not yet taken over the Karachi Circular Railway project. ""Pakistan Railways has not yet handed over the land and assets of the Circular Railway to the Sindh government since it is seeking land or compensation in exchange. The Sindh government is still in the process of negotiating for the land for the KCR project, which will cost 2 billion US dollars,"" said Daio.
On the other hand, a spokesperson for Pakistan Railways assured that progress was being made on land-related matters in connection with the KCR project. ""Details of the land of KCR have been shared by Pakistan Railways with the SMTA while discussions are also underway with the Board of Revenue, Sindh Management and Budgetary Reforms (SMBR) and the provincial government. No final decision has been made yet,"" claimed the official.

"Qatar, Egypt to intensify efforts to resume Gaza truce talks","PL
.
Qatar and Egypt announced on Sunday plans to step up efforts for Gaza truce negotiations, as the Palestinian militant group Hamas said it was prepared to ""immediately"" hold a fresh round of talks.
""Qatar and Egypt, in coordination with the United States of America, affirm their intention to intensify efforts to overcome the obstacles facing the negotiations,"" the two mediators said in a joint statement.
""The two countries are also striving to swiftly reach a 60-day temporary truce, which would pave the way for a permanent ceasefire agreement in the Gaza Strip,"" the statement added.
Doha, Cairo and Washington have been engaged in months of back-and-forth mediation with Israel and Hamas but another round of negotiations aimed at ending 20 months of war in Gaza this week appeared to conclude once more without a breakthrough.
A two-month truce, in which dozens of hostages held by Hamas were released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, collapsed in March, with Israel intensifying military operations in Gaza afterwards.
Following the statement by the Arab mediators, Hamas said it was ready ""to immediately begin a round of indirect negotiations to reach an agreement on the points of contention"".
Hamas previously said it had responded positively -- albeit with requested amendments -- to the latest US-backed truce proposal on Saturday which would see 10 living hostages released form Gaza.
The United States envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, wrote on X, ""Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week.""
""That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days,"" he added.
Israel has in recent weeks expanded its offensive in the Gaza Strip, drawing international condemnation as aid trickles in following a months-long blockade that has caused severe food and medical shortages.

Govt refutes allegations of irregularities,"US
The project underwent rigorous evaluation and received clearance from a Technical Committee.
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has strongly rejected allegations of irregularities and financial misconduct in its flagship initiative to provide free solar energy systems to 130,000 low and middle-income households.
In a statement issued on Sunday, the provincial administration labeled recent media reports as ""baseless"" and part of a ""misleading propaganda campaign"" allegedly driven by vested interests within the solar industry.
The Energy and Power Department clarified that the large-scale solarization project is being implemented through the Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organization (PEDO), a subsidiary body of the department.
Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur recently inaugurated the first phase of the initiative via online e-balloting, ensuring a transparent selection of eligible beneficiaries. Authorities emphasized that no funds have yet been disbursed under the scheme, nor has any contract been awarded to a vendor. The project's cost estimates have been prepared in line with the Market Rate System (MRS) 2024 and endorsed by the Finance Department's approved market analysis.
The project underwent rigorous evaluation and received clearance from a Technical Committee.

"Climate shifts, droughts threaten migratory bird haven","PK
Numbers have dropped dramatically due to a mix of reasons including wetlands degradation
Pakistan's once-thriving wetlands, long a sanctuary for millions of migratory birds fleeing Siberia's brutal winters, are witnessing a disturbing decline in avian visitors.
Experts warn that a mix of prolonged drought, receding water levels, and growing habitat degradation is driving away these seasonal guests — some possibly for good.
Sindh province, a traditional favorite for migratory birds, has seen the most drastic decline. According to the Sindh Wildlife Department's 2024-25 waterfowl count, the number of migratory birds fell sharply from 1.2 million in 2023 to 603,900 in 2024 and just 545,000 this year, a staggering drop of over 50% in two years.
In 2023, the region experienced an exceptional influx of birds, buoyed by the lingering effects of the catastrophic 2022 floods that, while devastating for communities, temporarily revived Pakistan's lakes, streams, and lagoons.
The excessive rainfall had replenished many wetlands, making them ideal resting spots for birds making the 4,500-kilometre (2,800-mile) journey from Siberia to India via the Indus Flyway, with stopovers at various lakes and water reservoirs in Pakistan. However, this year tells a different story.
""Sindh has long been a refuge for migratory birds because of its unique biodiversity and its many lakes, lagoons and other waterways,"" Mumtaz Soomro, an official from the Sindh Wildlife Department, told Anadolu.
""But those numbers have seen a gradual decline since 2023 due to receding water levels and droughts.""
Soomro explained that the latest survey — covering 40% of Sindh's territory — found notable shortages at key bird habitats, including Manchar, Keenjhar, Hamal and Haleji lakes, Nareri lagoon, and the Rann of Kutch wildlife sanctuary. ""During the survey, our teams reported water shortages at most of the sites, including the marshy Rann of Kutch wildlife sanctuary,"" he said.
Shadow of past flocks
The migration is seasonal, with birds arriving by late August and departing by February. Among the over 50 recorded species were gulls, mallards, plovers, snipes, cormorants, cranes, and storks.
The highest number of birds — 112,000 — was spotted at Nareri lagoon, followed by 91,000 at Rann of Kutch. But even these numbers are a shadow of past flocks.
Zohaib Ahmed, a Karachi-based ornithologist, said climate change is not the only factor pushing migratory birds away from Pakistan, as man-made habitat degradation, pollution, and illegal hunting also play a significant role.
""Human-induced changes and rampant human interference, often in the name of development, has exposed these fragile ecosystems of wetlands to a string of threats,"" Ahmed told Anadolu.
Despite the alarming trends, some officials argue that threats like poaching and trapping have been brought under control.
""Hunters and poachers are there but they do not pose a major threat to migratory birds. It's climate change that really haunts them,"" said Hasan.
But not everyone agrees
Ahmed, the ornithologist, contests this assessment, particularly in Sindh: ""At least for Sindh, I can say with surety that there is no drop in hunting and trapping of migratory birds, especially in the Kirthar mountain range and Karachi's coastal belt."" He added that several migratory species are still being openly sold at illegal bird markets, undermining conservation efforts and contributing further to the birds' decline.

Stray dogs terrorise villagers,"US
Nearly 90 bite cases reported at rural health centre
A rising threat from stray dogs has created panic among residents in Sarai Mughal and surrounding areas, where daily reports of dog bite injuries continue to surge amid an apparent lack of official response.
According to Dr. Muhammad Aamir Niaz, Medical Superintendent (MS) of the Rural Health Centre (RHC) Hallah, at least 88 dog bite cases have been reported at the facility as of May 28. The victims include children, women, the elderly, and young people, many of whom require urgent medical aid and vaccinations.
The areas most affected include Hanjra Kalan, Sheikhum, and Baharool Kalan, where stray dogs are said to roam the streets and neighborhoods in aggressive packs.
Frightened residents say it has become nearly impossible to safely walk through local streets without fear of being attacked.
Despite the severity of the situation, residents claim that the Tehsil administration of Pattoki remains inactive, failing to control the growing population of stray dogs or provide adequate support to bite victims.
""The stray dogs are everywhere. Our children can't even go to school safely,"" said a local resident from Hanjra Kalan.
""Every day we hear about new attacks, but the administration is doing nothing.""
A major concern raised by citizens is the limited availability of rabies vaccines. Currently, vaccines are only available at RHC Hallah and THQ Hospital Pattoki, both located far from many rural settlements. Nearby Basic Health Units (BHUs) in Sarai Mughal, Hanjra Kalan, and Sheikhum reportedly have no vaccine supplies, putting patients at risk of delayed treatment.
Locals have appealed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif to take immediate notice of the situation. They demand urgent action to control the stray dog population and ensure vaccine availability at all BHUs to prevent further injuries and suffering.

Humanity on the line: true cost of a third world war,"US
The children and youngsters play with their sacrificial animals in front of those who can't afford to buy one.
Consequentialism is defined as ""the ethical study of morals, duties and rights with an approach that focuses consequences of a particular action or cause"". A consequentialist holds the belief that ""consequences form the basis for any valid moral judgement about an action"". Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome or consequence.
The Muslims observe the Greater Bairam, known as the Eid-ul-Adha, in remembrance of the great sacrifice by Hazrat Ibrahim (AS) of his son Hazrat Ismael (AS) obeying his Creator. The sacrifice of what is dearest to heart in the world was demanded as a proof of unconditional obedience. The father was ready to offer the sacrifice of his son who was the dearest thing to him as the son was born in the father's old age.
The demands of sacrifice become more poignant when the father is required to slaughter his son with his own hands. It is quite difficult to imagine feeling the agonising pain at the writhing body of one's own son being slaughtered. When the father was close to slaughter, the Creator transformed the son into a ram. The father came out victorious in the litmus test for devotion and love.
The Muslims, particularly in our part of the world, have transformed this devotional sacrifice into a worldly affair of ostentation and self-aggrandisement. The wealthier the person is, the costlier the sacrificial animal is. The purchase in hundreds of thousands is a way to showcase one's opulence, as the sharing of wealth with the poor unshowingly doesn't satisfy one's urge for self-exhibitionism. Accepted that one ought to buy the cattle at par with one's financial muscle, but the real sacrifice would be to distribute its meat among the destitute.
The children and youngsters play with their sacrificial animals in front of those who can't afford to buy one. It nurtures hopes in the poor neighbours that they would get a meal with the meat which has been unaffordable to them throughout the year, but this day, too, they wouldn't.
We must advise our children to include such children in the festivities. A religion that enjoins upon its adherents to cover the eatables being taken home lest it might tantalise the poor children in the neighbours cannot allow them to exclude the less privileged from the festivities of a religious festival.
Some families have devised a ploy to defang the pricking of conscience: They reserve mutton for the family and distribute beef among the poor. Paradoxically, the rich who relish mutton throughout the year behave as if they have never eaten mutton. As is the norm, they stuff their deep freezers with the meat for ""the rainy days"". The divine sacrifice demands parting with one's desires and avarice. The desire to store and avarice for more makes man the poorest of the lot.
The irresponsibility people display in disposing of the remains of the sacrificed animals goes against the spirit of the sacrifice and Islamic teachings. The offal fly-tipped along the streets and roads creates an unpleasant scene marring the beauty and sanctity of the holy tradition of the great sacrifice as these litter louts don't bother that their actions might become the cause of public nuisance.
Even if the remains are thrown away from the vicinity, they land near the slums and ghettos, compounding miseries of the dwellers twofold. First, they were not included in the joys and blessings of the festival. Second, they were reminded with the heaps of stinking offal that they are the segregated part of society. What to speak of including the minorities in the joys and blessings of the festival? The bliss of divine sacrifice is in inclusivity, not in exclusivity. It's a communal festival.
If our offering of sacrifice doesn't make us shake off all the impurities of ego – arrogance, avarice, ostentation, selfishness and the ilk – we will have to take stock of our intentions and actions. If we don't find ourselves a changed, rather a metamorphosed, person after sacrificing what is dearest to us, it means we haven't sacrificed what is dearest to us – the raison detre of the divine sacrifice.

India arrests 81 for 'sympathising' with Pakistan,"PK
.
Indian police have arrested scores of people for ""sympathising"" with Pakistan, a month after the worst conflict between the arch-rivals for decades, a top government official said Sunday.
The arrests took place in the northeastern state of Assam, where Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said ""81 anti-nationals are now behind bars for sympathising with Pak"".
Sarma, from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist ruling party, said in a statement ""our systems are constantly tracking anti-national posts on social media and taking actions"".
One of the persons was arrested after he posted a Pakistani flag on his Instagram, Assam police told AFP.
No further details about other arrests were given.
There has been a wider clampdown on social media since an April 22 attack on tourists in IIOJK.
Indian media have reported that Assam's government has allegedly rounded up dozens of alleged Bangladeshis in the past month and taken them to the frontier to cross.
The Times of India newspaper on Saturday reported that Assam was ""dumping them in no-man's land"", suggesting that at least 49 had been pushed back between May 27-29 alone.
The Assam government has not commented on the reports.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy, after the Dhaka government was toppled in an uprising last year.
Bangladesh has also moved closer to China, as well as to Pakistan.

Pakistan whitewash Bangladesh in T20 series,"US
.
Mohammad Haris hit a swashbuckling maiden international century to guide Pakistan to a 3-0 clean sweep of Bangladesh with a seven-wicket win in the third and final Twenty20 international in Lahore on Sunday.
Haris, playing in his 17th T20I, carted seven sixes and eight boundaries in his 107 off just 46 balls as Pakistan chased down a challenging 197-run target in 17.2 overs for their first home T20I series win in three-and-a-half years.
Pakistan won the first two matches by 37 and 57 runs at the same venue.
Parvez Hossain smashed four sixes and seven boundaries in his solid 34-ball 66 to lift Bangladesh to 196-6 in their 20 overs.
Pakistan lost Sahibzada Farhan for one in the first over but Haris, whose hundred came up off 45 balls, added 92 for the second wicket with Saim Ayub and an unbroken 60 for the fourth with Salman Agha who made 15 not out.
Ayub hit four sixes and two boundaries in his 29-ball 45 while Hasan Nawaz scored 13-ball 26 as the home batters enthralled a near-capacity 30,000 crowd at Gaddafi Stadium. Earlier, Parvez shared a 110-run opening stand with Tanzid Hasan (32-ball 42 with three sixes and as many boundaries) after the tourists were sent in to bat.
The Parvez-Tanzid stand gave Bangladesh an ideal start for their highest T20I total against Pakistan beating the 175-6 they made against them at Pallekele in 2012.
Towhid Hridoy, who scored 25 from 18 balls with a six and two boundaries, then added 49 for the third wicket with Litton Das who made 22.
Fast bowlers Abbas Afridi (2-26) and Hasan Ali (2-38) were the pick of the home bowlers.

Electric bus fares go up in capital,"PK
The decision was taken due to some administrative and financial reasons.
The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has increased the fares of electric buses in the federal capital. The increase in fares has been implemented formally from Sunday.
According to sources, the fares of Orange, Green, Blue lines and electric buses have been revised from Rs50 to Rs100. The decision was taken due to some administrative and financial reasons.
Around 90,000 passengers travel on these buses daily, sources said, adding that the CDA will soon introduce a new proposed policy of concession on fares in different categories.
Under the proposed policy, separate packages will be given to office workers, students and senior citizens. The proposed concessional packages will be for people travelling on a daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly basis and for those taking bus cards.
Sources further said that work is underway on the proposed concessional packages. Notification of the proposed concessional packages will be issued soon. The authority has increased the fare from Rs50 to Rs100, which will be discounted under daily, weekly, fortnightly and monthly packages.
CDA Chairman and Islamabad Chief Commissioner, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, has directed relevant authorities to ensure that comprehensive information, including the complete schedule, arrival, and departure times, of the electric buses operating in the capital is made available on Google Maps. The move aims to help residents conveniently plan their journeys from home.

"Field Marshal must act on Kashmir, Palestine too: Hafiz Naeem","US
Hafiz Naeem praised countries like South Africa, Spain and Ireland for taking a bold stand against Israel
Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan Ameer Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has called on the country's military leadership to actively take up the causes of Kashmir and Palestine.
Addressing a large rally titled ""Down with Israel and India"" at Koh-i-Noor Chowk, he said Pakistan must go beyond statements and play a leading role in supporting oppressed Muslims globally.
He said, ""If we don't raise our voice for Gaza and Kashmir, we will lose the nation's support. One who saves a life saves all humanity is our duty.""
He also criticised Pakistan's political elite for remaining silent on Israeli aggression, accusing PML-N, PPP, and PTI of fearing US displeasure.
Hafiz Naeem praised countries like South Africa, Spain, and Ireland for taking a bold stand against Israel, and urged Pakistan to lead a Muslim world summit, both political and military, to demand an end to Israeli atrocities and Indian occupation in Kashmir.
He warned that continued silence and inaction from Muslim rulers and Pakistan's establishment would erode public trust. ""People backed you against India despite their grievances. But if you stay quiet on Palestine and Kashmir, the nation will stop standing with you,"" he said.

Mobile tower outsourcing comes,"PL
Optic fibres should follow suit, backed by facilitating regulatory framework
Just two weeks ago, we witnessed a groundbreaking milestone for Digital Pakistan. After years of effort, the country's largest mobile network operator (MNO) successfully cleared all regulatory hurdles to transfer ownership of its mobile towers to a specialised tower company.
Traditionally, MNOs worldwide built and owned their own towers, which they did not share with their competitors. However, around two decades ago, MNOs began to realise that the capital expenditure required to develop proprietary tower infrastructure was both substantial and largely unnecessary.
At the same time, as many mobile towers sprouted all over the place, the competitive edge of owning towers receded. All this prompted MNOs to spin off their tower assets to independent entities known as ""TowerCos,"" who specialise in the operation and management of telecom towers.
In China, there are three MNOs, but only one TowerCo, which owns over two million towers. In India, of the approximately 800,000 towers, the TowerCos own more than 500,000. In Indonesia, various TowerCos collectively own nearly all of the country's over 122,000 towers. In Malaysia, TowerCos hold ownership of about 62% of all towers. In Myanmar, Bangladesh and the Philippines, TowerCos own more than half of the existing tower infrastructure. And so on.
TowerCos allow multiple MNOs to share a single tower, for which MNOs just pay a ""rent"". It increases asset utilisation, lowers the cost of operations and reduces environmental impact.
With streamlined processes and dedicated resources for rapid tower deployment, TowerCos help MNOs roll out technology upgrades much faster. As the industry prepares for 5G, which requires a significantly higher density of cell sites, this trend has accelerated.
Story of Pakistan
When MNOs established their presence in Pakistan, each MNO outspent the other, investing billions in setting up towers across the country. It became common to see four to five towers standing next to each other, which not only looked ugly but also represented a colossal national waste.
However, around a decade back, this mindset began to shift. New towers started to be built exclusively by TowerCos. Slowly TowerCos' ownership of towers in Pakistan went up to about 20%. Unfortunately, 80% still remained with MNOs.
Jazz (then Mobilink) first attempted to divest its tower assets in 2017 by creating a subsidiary, Deodar, which took over ownership of Jazz's entire tower infrastructure. Soon after, in 2018, Jazz reached an agreement with Edotco, a leading Malaysian TowerCo and one of the largest in Asia, for a proposed deal valued at $940 million.
However, the transaction faced a setback when regulatory approval was not granted. The reasons behind the denial remain unclear, giving rise to various conspiracy theories about the real cause of the decision.
Subsequently, in 2022, Jazz and its owner Veon worked out a conditional agreement with a consortium comprising TPL REIT Management Company and UAE-based TASC Towers Holding. This deal, too, failed to materialise, reportedly due to complexities in deal structuring and consequent delays in getting regulatory approvals.
In December 2024, Jazz owner Veon and Engro Corp announced a strategic partnership for telecom infrastructure. A press release announced the agreement for the sale of Jazz's 10,500 towers – managed by Deodar – to Engro Corporation's subsidiary, Engro Connect, for $563 million.
Over the past weeks, the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) and the sector regulator, Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), approved this deal. The sanctioning of ""The Scheme of Arrangement"" by Islamabad High Court cleared the final obstacle two weeks ago.
It is a matter of concern that the country's largest MNO had to make three separate attempts over eight years to adopt a globally recognised best practice – ironically, a practice that the country should be encouraging as a policy.
Telenor Pakistan also attempted to sell its towers in 2023, by first transferring them to its subsidiary, Orion Towers (Private) Limited. However, the sale was unsuccessful. Frustrated Telenor Group CEO Sigve Brekke publicly stated, ""It's very challenging to do business in Pakistan right now. That's one of the reasons why we have decided to exit."" Based on recent accounts, even exiting is proving to be a challenge.
Optic fibre networks
Just as MNOs once built separate towers in the same locations, fixed-line internet service providers (ISPs) in Pakistan lay individual fibre cables along the same streets. The data-carrying capacity of optic fibres is virtually limitless and a single fibre cable can easily serve the entire locality.
However, for understandable reasons, the ISPs are reluctant to share fibres with their competitors. This leads to an unnecessary multiplicity of fibres in affluent neighbourhoods and a near-complete absence in less privileged ones. This imbalance is a key factor behind Pakistan's low fibre penetration.
When a service provider invests in a specific locality, a local monopoly gets created, which the ISP likes to keep. All the new ISPs who want to enter the market must lay their own fibres. This acts as an entry barrier for newcomers, especially for smaller ones.
A more efficient approach would be to have neutral telecom infrastructure providers (TIPs) own the fibre networks, which many ISPs could use by paying rent – similar to how TowerCos operate mobile infrastructure. The business model of TIPs relies on fibre sharing among multiple ISPs – the more ISPs that share a TIP's infrastructure, the more TIP's business thrives.
Many countries like Singapore, Sweden and New Zealand follow this model. Pakistan too has a licensing category for TIPs – although work needs to be done on a comprehensive regulatory framework that facilitates both the ISPs and the TIPs and hinders any unfair use of the TIP licence.
The Universal Service Fund (USF) should also shift its focus from subsidising ISPs to neutral TIPs. This shift would enhance the utilisation of deployed fibres.
Concluding
Global benchmarks show that Pakistan's telecom sector has been falling behind. To catch up – even leapfrog ahead – the country must focus on developing its digital infrastructure through policy-backed, neutral infrastructure providers.
Whether for mobile or fixed networks, every policy and regulatory lever should be used to encourage and incentivise (even entice) neutral parties to invest in this critical area. Without a robust, ubiquitous and affordable digital infrastructure, the dream of inclusive Digital Pakistan will remain just that – a dream.

Death toll in Indonesian quarry rock fall reaches 18,"PL
.
The death toll from a rockfall at a limestone quarry on Indonesia's Java island rose to 18 on Sunday, with another seven people still missing and feared dead, a military official said.
Workers and heavy equipment were buried when rocks suddenly fell at the mining site in the city of Cirebon in West Java province on Friday morning.
The rockfall also injured at least 12 people. ""Today, we retrieved one more body, which brings the total death toll to 18 people, while seven more people are still missing,"" local military chief Mukhammad Yusron told AFP.
""We suspect the missing victims have already died.""
Rescuers have deployed excavators and rescue dogs to search for the remaining victims, Mukhammad said.
He said the search operation was challenging and dangerous due to the unstable structures of the rock.
""We must pay attention to the rescuers' safety because there have been more rockfalls during the operation.""
The local company overseeing the mine was operating legally. Still, safety standards were lacking, according to West Java governor Dedi Mulyadi, who said he had ordered its closure following the accident.

Clint Eastwood wants filmmakers to be original,"US
95-year-old laments world of remakes and sequels
Hollywood star Clint Eastwood urged fellow filmmakers to come up with new ideas as he approached his 95th birthday this weekend.
Oscar-winning director Eastwood told Austrian newspaper Kurier he planned to keep working, saying that he was still in good physical shape and hopeful that no one would have to worry about him in that regard ""for a long time yet.""
Eastwood's most recent film, legal drama Juror #2, came out in the United States last year and the newspaper said he was currently in the pre-production phase for another film.
When asked for his view on the current state of the film industry, the star of films such as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and Dirty Harry, and director of dozens of films including Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby, said, ""I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote movies like Casablanca in small bungalows on the studio lot. When everyone had a new idea.""
""We live in an era of remakes and franchises. I've shot sequels three times, but I haven't been interested in that for a long while. My philosophy is: do something new or stay at home,"" added Eastwood, who turned 95 on Saturday.
Asked where he got his energy from, Eastwood said, ""There's no reason why a man can't get better with age. And I have much more experience today. Sure, there are directors who lose their touch at a certain age, but I'm not one of them.""
Eastwood also shared the secret to his success. ""As an actor, I was still under contract with a studio, was in the old system, and thus forced to learn something new every year,"" he said. ""And that's why I'll work as long as I can still learn something, or until I'm truly senile."" Reuters

No country can tax itself into prosperity,"PK
Tax reform should scrap incentive to hide income, generate revenue efficiently
While all taxes are bad, some taxes are worse than others. It's important to distinguish among various types of items on which the government imposes taxes.
First, we have income or value-added taxes, which correspond to taxes on the returns to factors of production such as capital and labour. Second, we have turnover or gross receipt taxes, which correspond to the volume of total revenues a business has irrespective of that business's purchases or pass-through expenses. Finally, we have wealth taxes, which year after year tax the same item irrespective of the volume of business that item generates or its income.
In general, gross receipts/turnover taxes are worse than income/value-added taxes and far more damaging per cent for per cent are wealth taxes. Income and value-added taxes are the most common types of tax governments impose in order to raise revenues so that it performs its requisite tasks.
Income tax is based on production whereas the value-added tax is based on consumption. These two types of taxation must adhere to six primary factors: fairness, simplicity, transparency, completeness, efficiency and stability. They should be low rate and broad-based.
A broad-based low flat-rate tax on income and value added will significantly provide people the least opportunity to avoid and evade paying taxes. This will also result in the reduction in associated costs of monitoring these activities to the tax collector and reduce compliance costs for the taxpayer.
From the day, the flat-rate tax is enacted and beyond, the government would not only get more revenues, but the revenue stream would be stable and predictable from year to year.
On the other hand, turnover or gross receipt taxes are far more damaging than the income/value-added taxes. Turnover taxes punish compliant, low-profit or loss-making firms and individuals; deter domestic/foreign investment and violate the six primary factors as previously mentioned.
For loss-making companies, the entire minimum tax payment would come directly from their capital; there is no rationale behind this unfair tax.
Tariffs, being a gross receipt tax, are taxes on traded products. Tariffs just like other taxes reduce output, income and employment; therefore reduce both imports and exports and will not raise much in net revenue for the government with very little change in trade balance.
Wealth taxes by far are the most damaging in comparison to income/value-added and turnover/gross receipt taxes. Wealth taxes are immoral and unjust. People don't save and invest to go bankrupt. Hard-earned wealth created by a generation or generations should not be seen as a vice but rather as a virtue.
Wealth taxes like inheritance (death) taxes have historically shown to generate very little in government revenues in terms of tax-to-GDP ratio and have shown a very good reason for capital flight.
Besides the types of items on which the government imposes taxes, the mode of taxation is ever more important and there are many. Governments over the years have found insidious ways and means to collect as much revenues as possible, but to no avail.
These modes of taxes act as a ""wedge"" and apply to every segment of the economy – households and businesses. To name a few: withholding taxes, minimum advance taxes, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, presumptive taxes, super taxes, capital value taxes, excise duty, additional and regulatory duties; a whole wide range of levies and the list goes on and on. Yikes!
Taxes are a negative incentive, causing people not to report taxable income through tax evasion, tax avoidance, moving locations, etc. What is needed is for people, businesses and the government to focus exclusively on the country's path to prosperity, not on how to avoid taxes, regulations and misrepresent taxable transactions.
Tax revenues needed to run the government should be collected via a system that does the least damage to the overall economy. Tax reform should essentially eliminate the incentive for one to shelter income and generate tax revenue efficiently.
Governments should eliminate all direct and indirect taxes and rely exclusively on income (production) and value-added (consumption) taxes plus specific excise taxes. Those taxes that are chosen to remain should have low rates on broad bases. Exemptions, deductions, exclusions, credits and write-offs should be kept to the bare minimum.
Low tax rates provide the least incentive for people and businesses to avoid, evade or otherwise not report or under-report their taxable income. Unreasonably high tax rates, quixotic tax enforcement, corrupt implementation of rules and regulations and self-serving trade interventions incentivise expensive tax-sheltering policies and counter-productive behaviour from individuals and businesses.
The lesson to be learnt here is that ""no country has ever taxed itself into prosperity""!

Piastri triumphs in Spain with McLaren one-two,"US
The Australian extended his lead to 10 points with fifth win of season
Formula One championship leader Oscar Piastri won the Spanish Grand Prix from pole position in a McLaren one-two on Sunday to forge 10 points clear of teammate Lando Norris in the title battle.
The Australian's win, by 2.4 seconds, was his fifth in nine races this season and McLaren's seventh.
Ferrari's Charles Leclerc completed the podium after passing Max Verstappen's Red Bull six laps from the end following a safety car period that triggered the main talking point of the afternoon with the champion demoted from fifth to 10th.
""It's a nice way to bounce back from Monaco. A superb weekend,"" said Piastri, who finished third last weekend in a race won from pole by Norris. Verstappen, who made four stops in total and ended up on the slower hard tyres against rivals on softs, collided with Leclerc and twice with Mercedes' George Russell after the safety car restart.
The angry Dutch driver was given a 10-second penalty added to his overall time for the second Russell collision that was clearly his fault.
He and Leclerc also faced a post-race investigation for their clash that could lead to further sanctions.
""I tried to push him to the left, there was a bit of contact but fortunately no consequences,"" said Leclerc. Verstappen claimed the Monegasque had rammed into him and should have given back the place.
Russell finished fourth after eventually being let through by Verstappen, who reluctantly did as his team told him.
Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg finished a surprising and morale-boosting fifth for the future Audi team after passing Ferrari's seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton on the penultimate lap.
Hamilton was a disappointing sixth, Isack Hadjar seventh for Racing Bulls and Pierre Gasly eighth for Renault-owned Alpine.
First points
Home hero Fernando Alonso scored his first points of the season with Aston Martin, who had only one car on the grid due to Lance Stroll's withdrawal through injury after Saturday's qualifying.
Piastri led away cleanly at the start with Verstappen seizing second from Norris while Hamilton and Leclerc moved up to fourth and fifth as Russell lost out.

ICC fines WI for slow over-rate,"US
Players are fined five percent of their match fee for every over
West Indies cricket team has been fined for maintaining a slow over-rate during the first One Day International (ODI) against England at Edgbaston, Birmingham on May 29.
Match referee Jeff Crowe of the Emirates ICC Elite Panel imposed a five percent fine on each West Indies player's match fee after the team was found to be one over short of the required target by the end of their innings, once time allowances were taken into consideration.
This penalty is in accordance with Article 2.22 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which deals with minimum over-rate offences.
The ICC regulations mandate that players are fined five percent of their match fee for every over their team fails to bowl within the allotted time.
West Indies captain Shai Hope accepted the sanction, and a formal hearing was not required.
The charge was brought against the team by the on-field umpires Kumar Dharmasena and Martin Saggers, along with third umpire Adrian Holdstock and fourth umpire Graham Lloyd.
The match saw England post a mammoth total of 400 runs for 8 wickets, with outstanding half-centuries from Ben Duckett, Joe Root, Harry Brook, and Jacob Bethell powering the hosts.
In response, West Indies struggled against disciplined bowling, getting bowled out for 162 runs. England's Saqib Mahmood and Jamie Overton were the pick of the bowlers, each taking three wickets.
England secured a dominant 238-run victory, leaving West Indies with much to reflect on as they prepare for the second ODI.
The next match is scheduled to take place on Sunday, where the West Indies will aim to bounce back and level the series.

K-P vows furniture for all students,"US
No student should sit on the floor, CM directs authorities in education emergency push
In a significant move to bolster public education, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur has announced that all students enrolled in government schools across the province will receive proper furniture during the next fiscal year.
The initiative is part of the province's ongoing ""education emergency"" campaign aimed at uplifting basic educational infrastructure.
Chairing a high-level meeting on Sunday to finalize the Annual Development Programme (ADP) for the upcoming financial year, the chief minister directed relevant authorities to ensure that no student in the public sector is left sitting on the floor due to a lack of furniture.
He assured that all necessary funds for this initiative would be made available on a priority basis. Emphasizing the provincial government's commitment to improving basic school facilities, Gandapur reiterated that functional washrooms, access to clean drinking water, and adequate classroom furniture are non-negotiable priorities.
In a broader push for quality education, the chief minister also announced the launch of a special program to enhance teaching standards in public schools. He directed that modern, skills-based training be made mandatory for all newly recruited teachers, adding that capacity-building for educators is essential for long-term educational reform.
The ADP planning meeting was attended by Advisor to the Chief Minister on Finance Muzammil Aslam, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, Additional Chief Secretary for Planning and Development Ikramullah Khan, and administrative secretaries of various departments.
Participants held detailed deliberations on development proposals submitted by departments including Education, Health, Irrigation, Water Supply, Planning, Communications, and Local Government. Each project was individually reviewed for inclusion in the new ADP.
Speaking to the attendees, Chief Minister Gandapur described the upcoming ADP as a ""visionary document"" that would guide the province's development agenda for the next four years.
He said the plan would incorporate input from elected representatives and prioritize projects based on the genuine needs of local communities.
He further stated that the bulk of next year's development budget would be dedicated to completing ongoing projects, particularly those with over 80 per cent of work already completed. Approximately 50 per cent of other existing projects are also expected to be finalized within the year.
""The new ADP will be realistic and rooted in public needs,"" Gandapur said. ""We will not chase superficial progress at the expense of essential services. Taxpayers' money will be used wisely and transparently.""
Declaring that ""every constituency in the province is my constituency,"" the CM assured that development initiatives would be allocated without political bias, with a special focus on uplifting underdeveloped areas.

Osman Khalid Butt rants about the rain,"US
Islamabad's monsoon romance meets gridlock realism
Actor Osman Khalid Butt took to X (formerly Twitter) on Friday to share his signature blend of wit and weather commentary, this time on the rainy season in Islamabad. ""The thunder, the cool breeze, petrichor, rain in Islamabad makes me believe in love,"" he wrote, before taking a sharp, humorous turn. ""Traffic during rain makes me believe in natural selection.""
The post quickly resonated with Islamabadis and beyond, capturing the emotional and logistical duality of the city's monsoon season, beloved for its moody skies and fragrant earth, cursed for its traffic jams and waterlogged roads. While many fans replied with memes and their own rainy day photos, others echoed OKB's observation, pointing out the lack of city preparedness for even moderate rainfall.
On Friday, intermittent rainfall swept across Islamabad and Rawalpindi, offering brief spells of relief from the heat. The Pakistan Meteorological Department had forecast more showers and thunderstorms over the weekend, particularly in upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad. The rain cooled temperatures but also caused localised flooding and traffic snarls in major areas such as Blue Area, F-6, and Faizabad. Commuters reported extended delays due to water accumulation and malfunctioning traffic signals, a seasonal frustration that has come to define urban rain.
Osman's online presence continues to strike a chord with fans, blending humour, and relatable observations. In April, the star sparked a wave of early-internet nostalgia with a heartfelt post on X (formerly Twitter), writing: ""I miss Orkut and waking up one random day to find someone's written you a beautiful testimonial."" The post resonated deeply with millennials who came of age during Orkut's heyday, prompting an outpouring of memories.
Fans reminisced about the platform's simplicity, sincerity, and lost sense of community. ""Good old days,"" many commented, while others noted how their generation uniquely experienced the shift from Orkut to Facebook and Instagram.

JUI-F announces drive against 'un-Islamic' child marriage law,"PK
Fazl says legislation promotes vice over virtue
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday came out strongly against the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025, announcing a nationwide protest campaign to ""raise awareness"" among the public.
Speaking at a press conference in Peshawar, the JUI-F supremo categorically rejected the legislation, claiming it undermined Islamic values and societal norms by criminalising underage marriage while enabling extramarital relationships.
""Pakistan is a strange country during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women's rights that decriminalised sexual intercourse outside of marriage,"" he said. ""It took it out of the realm of sin.""
""Now, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulemas and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and sunnah,"" he added, accusing the government of trampling constitutional guarantees.
Fazl announced that his party would launch a series of protest activities in response to the law, including rallies and a major public conference scheduled for June 29 in Hazara Division, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
""We will stage rallies, but they won't focus on one subject, like Al-Aqsa Mosque,"" he said. ""Now, we will host rallies to create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance.""
""God willing, we will present our stance to the world freely. Islam is a faith that moves with the world and can be beneficial.""
The law, which was signed by the president on May 27 following its passage through both houses of Parliament, aims to prohibit child marriage in Islamabad by outlawing marriages involving individuals under the age of 18.

4 Ghibli films to show you the inspiration behind the trend
If you're an artist or just someone who admires the effort that goes into drawing and animation, you must have strong feelings about the heaps of AI-generated art that's been plaguing social media for a long time now. The recent trend of AI-generated images that has beguiled netizens recreates the visual style of Studio Ghibli's signature 2D animation. And if there are any doubts as to where the studio's founder — Hayao Miyazaki — would stand, here are his views on machine-created art that resurfaced after OpenAI launched its update: ""I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself.""
In case you're not aware of what Studio Ghibli films are, I — first and foremost - express my deepest sympathies that you had to learn through this trend, but I am also happy to inform you that you've come to the right place. If your curiosity is pushing you to find out what life looks like through the Ghibli lens, you need not wait any longer. Here are four of the studio's films to introduce you to the painstakingly hand-drawn and remarkably emotive world of animation — or, if you're a fan, to trick you into a binge watch.
'Howl's Moving Castle'
It has become culturally imperative to begin your Ghibli journey with this one. Howl's Moving Castle follows Sophie, a young woman cursed by a jealous witch to transform into an old lady due to the witch's affection for Howl, a vagabond wizard who crosses paths with Sophie in the beginning. As the curse makes our protagonist forget her identity, she accidentally moves in with Howl's motley crew and helps them out with domestic duties, oblivious to the fact that the solution to her problem is nearby.
If the found-family trope is an easy way to your heart, this film will win you over no sweat while serving you an extra slice of tender romance. Although a stunningly serene film, it strikes a fine balance between wholesome moments and gut-wrenching reality that'll have you aching for more.
'Kiki's Delivery Service'
If you like witchcraft in your media and are looking for more magic after Howl's Moving Castle, you'll find it all in Kiki's Delivery Service. This coming-of-age fantasy story follows Kiki, a young witch who heads out of home to fulfill her desire for self-exploration.
Aside from flaunting the picturesque world of Studio Ghibli, this film is your reassurance that hardships are a necessary part of growing up on your own. From introducing animal companions to unexpected friends, it reminds you that every step out of your comfort zone is worth the anticipation.
'The Secret World of Arrietty'
If you grew up adoring Thumbelina or illustrated tales of a similar nature, it might be time to indulge your inner child with this heartwarming film. The Secret World of Arrietty follows its titular character in a miniature world as she ""borrows"" from the world of the much-larger humans for a living. Everything seems to be working in her family's favour until they are discovered by the humans and must fend for themselves.
Packing compelling visuals that every Ghibli film is decked with, this feature stands out for its immersive look into the world that exists around us, just much bigger. If you're in the mood of a story that champions hope and courage, you wouldn't want to miss this one.
'Spirited Away'
Ever wondered what your most inexplicable dreams would look like onscreen? Spirited Away is your answer. It focuses on Chihiro, a ten-year-old girl who visits an amusement park with her family but soon realises that something is off, though her protests are dismissed by her parents. After a mysterious meal turns them into pigs, it is up to Chihiro to bring them back by stepping into the world of uncanny supernatural beings.
Released at a time when animation was seen as a form of entertainment reserved only for children, Spirited Away would sooner be a kid's nightmare than a fond core memory to look back on. But for grownups who don't mind being unnerved, the film's appeal lies in its unsettling elements and melancholic storyline. Does hope prevail in the end? Find out for yourself.

FinMin praises rising consumer confidence,"XX
Ipsos Q2 survey shows strongest economic optimism in six years
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb welcomed on Sunday the findings of the Ipsos Consumer Confidence Survey for the second quarter of 2025, calling it a strong affirmation of the improving economic outlook and public sentiment across Pakistan.
A press release issued by the Finance Ministry said that Aurangzeb welcomed the survey findings, saying that those were a timely validation of Pakistan's economic direction and a clear signal that the country was on a steady path toward recovery and resilience.
Ipsos is an international market research firm that gathers insights on consumer behaviour, public opinion, and market trends. The firm uses methods like online polls, interviews, and focus groups across 89 countries.
The survey reveals a significant surge in consumer confidence, with 42 per cent of Pakistanis now believing that the country was heading in the right direction – the highest level recorded in six years. Perceptions of the economy being strong had also reached their most favourable levels since August 2019.
Aurangzeb noted that this encouraging data reflected the success of the government's disciplined and targeted macroeconomic strategy implemented over the last 14 months.
""The stabilisation of key economic indicators, including the containment of inflation, strengthening of the exchange rate, rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves, and improved fiscal discipline has created a foundation for renewed public trust and economic recovery,"" he added.
He highlighted that consumer confidence in making major purchases and investments has doubled compared to the same period last year, indicating that households were beginning to feel more secure in their financial prospects.

Moscow accepts Taliban ambassador,"US
.
Russia has officially accepted the Taliban's nomination of an ambassador to Moscow, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday, as economic and political ties grow between the two sanctions-hit nations.
Russia in April suspended its ban on the Taliban in a move that paved the way for Moscow to normalise ties with the leadership of Afghanistan.
No country has formally recognised the Taliban's government, which took over the country in 2021 as US-led forces withdrew.
""We hope this new phase will allow both countries to expand cooperation in various fields,"" said Amir Khan Muttaqi, the Taliban's acting foreign minister, in a statement.
China in 2023 became the first country to accept a diplomat at ambassador level from the Taliban and several countries have since followed, including Pakistan which announced it would upgrade the position this week.
Diplomats say formally presenting ambassadorial credentials to a foreign head of state signals a step towards recognition.

Swiatek passes Rybakina test at Roland Garros,"US
The Pole will face Svitolina in her bid for a fourth successive French Open title
Iga Swiatek kept her bid for a fourth successive French Open title alive as she fought back from a set and a break down to defeat Elena Rybakina on Sunday, ahead of reigning men's champion Carlos Alcaraz's last-16 tie against Ben Shelton.
The four-time Roland Garros champion, who has been struggling for her best form and has not reached a final since winning the title last year, was in serious trouble when trailing 2-0 in the second set.
But the 24-year-old dug deep to clinch a 1-6, 6-3, 7-5 victory.
Swiatek is aiming to become the first woman to win four straight Roland Garros crowns since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.
The Pole will next face Ukraine's Elina Svitolina, who knocked out 2024 losing finalist Jasmine Paolini, in the last eight on Tuesday.
Swiatek is now on a 25-match winning streak at the French Open and boasts a remarkable 39-2 win-loss record in the tournament.
Rybakina had won both of her previous career meetings with Swiatek on clay and the Kazakh dominated the opening set, hammering 12 winners past her bewildered opponent.
""Well it was tough you know, first set I felt like I was playing against Jannik Sinner,"" said Swiatek.
""I needed to do something to get back in the game, but with her playing like that I didn't feel like I had much hope.""
Rybakina broke in the first game of the second set as she threatened to run away with the match.
But Swiatek impressively turned the set around with a run of five straight games.
The fifth seed looked to have finally seized total control with a break to lead 4-3 in the deciding set, only to hand it straight back.
Swiatek was one game from defeat when trailing 5-4, but she managed to end Rybakina's resistance and held her nerve to serve out the match.
Svitolina made the quarter-finals for the fifth time with a comeback 4-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-1 win over last year's runner-up Paolini, saving three match points in a dramatic opening match on Court Philippe Chatrier.
The former world number three, who has never made a Grand Slam final, will be bidding to reach a first Roland Garros semi-final when she faces Swiatek.
""I still cannot believe that this match finished my way,"" said Svitolina.
""It was a really difficult match today, Jasmine was playing really well. It was really tough for me but I'm very happy I was able to stay composed and fight until the very last point.""
Fourth seed Paolini, who won the Italian Open last month, fell to the same opponent for the second straight major tournament.
Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen secured a quarter-final place with a hard-fought three-set victory over 19th-seeded Russian Liudmila Samsonova.
The Chinese eighth seed extended her winning streak at Roland Garros to 10 matches, winning 7-6 (7/5), 1-6, 6-3 on Court Suzanne Lenglen.
Zheng will continue her bid for a maiden Grand Slam title against either world number one Aryna Sabalenka or American 16th seed Amanda Anisimova.
Later on Sunday, Alcaraz continues his title defence against big-hitting American Ben Shelton on Court Philippe Chatrier.
Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz survived a brief scare against Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in the third round before battling through in four sets.
Shelton will be fresh after racing past Matteo Gigante in the last 32, after receiving a second-round walkover.
""Playing the defending champion, round of 16... centre court, that's a pretty cool opportunity, pretty cool experience, that not a lot of people get or see in their lifetime,"" said Shelton of facing Alcaraz.
The winner will take on Tommy Paul in the quarter-finals, after the American 12th seed saw off Australia's Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-3, 6-3.

PAC orders audit of Rs2b monthly allocations to UCs,"PL
NA's public spending watchdog smells financial irregularities
The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of the Sindh Assembly has ordered a comprehensive audit of the Rs2billion monthly budget allocated to union councils (UCs) across the province, citing concerns over financial irregularities and lack of oversight.
In a formal letter to the auditor general of Pakistan, the PAC expressed concern that the substantial funds distributed to 1,600 UCs across Sindh are not being properly audited. The committee noted that while the Sindh government disburses Rs2billion monthly to these local bodies, there is no ongoing scrutiny of how the funds are being spent.
According to the letter, only the UCs in Karachi Division were audited by the Directorate General (DG) Audit between 2018 and 2019. The financial activities of UCs in other districts of Sindh remain unaudited, raising serious accountability concerns.
In response, the PAC has urged the AGP to instruct the relevant DG Audit offices to conduct a three-year audit of the budgets and expenditures of UCs throughout Sindh.
Meanwhile, the PAC reported huge recoveries from various government departments in Sindh, totaling over Rs16.22billion to date. The latest recovery of Rs3.42 billion includes, Rs1.87billion deposited by DG Audit Local Government from recoveries made between September 2024 and April 2025. It also has Rs782.72million collected by DG Audit Sindh between July 2024 and April 2025 and Rs772.18million recovered by DG Audit Works during the same period.Additionally, Rs12.59billion was recovered in outstanding water charges from various federal and provincial institutions on behalf of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board.
These amounts have all been deposited into the government treasury.
PAC Chairman Nisar Khuhro stated that the PAC held 97 meetings between July 2024 and May 2025. During this period, the committee reviewed 1,383 audit paras from various departments, settling 325 of them. The remaining 1,058 paras were deferred for further consideration.
Khuhro stressed that the recovery and deposit of over Rs16billion into the government treasury reflect the PAC's unwavering commitment to financial accountability and transparency. He affirmed that the PAC will continue its efforts to recover public funds and ensure fiscal discipline across all government departments.

PML-N leads in Sialkot by-elections,"US
Hina Arshad Warraich secures 78,702 votes, according to unofficial results from 165 polling stations
PML-N's Hina Arshad Warraich was leading with 78,702 votes in PP-52 Sialkot by-elections, according to unofficial and incomplete results from 165 out of 185 polling stations received in the late hours of Sunday.
Hina was fielded as the ruling party's candidate in the by-elections announced after the death of MPA Chaudhry Arshad Warraich who had won the seat in the Feb 8 general elections on the PML-N's ticket.
Hina held a clear lead over candidates from other parties including the PTI-backed independent candidate Fakhar Nishat Ghumman, who secured 39,018 votes, according to the unofficial tally.
Speaking to a private TV channel, Hina said the people did not elect her for politics but for service. ""I stand here today because of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz,"" she stated.
Defense Minister Khawaja Asif, who also belongs to Sialkot, visited the residence of Hina Warraich.
Addressing party workers, he thanked those who participated in the election campaign across Punjab, adding that based on results from 165 polling stations, Hina is securing a decisive victory. ""Sialkot was, is, and will remain a stronghold of the PML-N,"" he said.
PTI's Central Secretary for Information Sheikh Waqas Akram, during a press conference in Islamabad, however, alleged that the by-election in PP-52 Sambrial witnessed ""thuggery under police patronage"".
""The turnout at our rally in Sambrial was unforgettable. People came out early in the morning to protect the mandate, but the PML-N's goons resorted to violence,"" he claimed.
He alleged that under police protection, PTI supporters were forcibly removed from polling stations and subjected to violence. ""PML-N forcibly entered polling stations and cast fake votes,"" he said.
PPP Central Punjab President Raja Pervaiz Ashraf also accused the PML-N of resorting to rigging in a press conference held in Sambrial.
""The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) must take notice of the rigging in the PP-52 by-election. Our polling agents and workers were attacked in Roliya, Begowal, Mitranwali, and Babundoki Chamiyan.
""Local PML-N leadership should not have resorted to such actionsthis undermines the credibility of the entire electoral process,"" he added. ""Elections should be free and fair. Our people were harassed and forced out of polling stations.""
PPP General Secretary Syed Hassan Murtaza also claimed that the PML-N cannot contest elections ""without siding with the umpires"". The 2024 elections, he said, witnessed the worst rigging in history.""
After the press conference, the ECP issued a statement describing Raja Pervaiz Ashraf's allegations of rigging in PP-52 Sialkot as baseless. It advised PPP leaders to file a formal complaint with solid evidence.
""The ECP will address all complaints promptly,"" it said, adding that the reports about the administration shutting down various polling stations are completely false.

PSG's UCL win gives Qatari owners glory,"US
The Parisian outfit defeated Inter Milan 5-0 in Munich
After almost 15 years of huge investment, frequent disappointment and occasional humiliation, Paris Saint-Germain got their hands on the UEFA Champions League trophy on Saturday, allowing their Qatari owners to bask in the glory of an emphatic triumph.
PSG could not win European football's biggest prize in previous seasons with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, or later with Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, and even after that when they added Lionel Messi to the mix.
But they have done it now after shifting the focus away from signing glamorous superstars and letting a brilliant coach in Luis Enrique work with a hungry, dynamic young team.
PSG have been Europe's best side in 2025, but the display against Inter Milan in Munich topped it all as they romped to a 5-0 victory, the biggest win in the final in the competition's history.
It was ultimately worth the long wait for the Gulf owners who arrived in 2011 when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) bought an ailing club.
Qatar got the perfect World Cup final in 2022, when Messi's Argentina beat Mbappe's France on an epic night in Doha, and now Qatari-owned PSG have the most stunning Champions League final win.
It is easy to forget now, but they lost three of their first five games in the tournament this season.
""We had a difficult start. Everyone criticised us and doubted us. Lots of people didn't believe in our project,"" PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi told broadcaster Canal Plus.
""The objective now is to win again. It has taken 14 years of hard work but we are building something for the future.""
Khelaifi, who is close to Qatar's ruler and holds several influential positions in football including as chairman of the European Club Association, was beaming as he celebrated with the trophy. It is just the second time any French club has won it after Marseille in 1993. It surely won't take over 30 years for PSG to win another Champions League, especially as this thrilling young side should now stay together for a long time.
The average age of their starting line-up on Saturday was under 25 and their oldest player is Marquinhos at 31 -- he has been there since 2013.
""I have suffered and I have grown with this team,"" the Brazilian told broadcaster M6.
""My thoughts are with all the players who played here but were not able to win it.""
It has required 14 years, eight coaches, and over two billion euros ($2.27 billion) spent on transfer fees for QSI to get here.
In the last 12 campaigns before this season, PSG reached one final, losing to Bayern Munich in Lisbon in 2020.
There were two semi-final defeats, but there have also been humiliating collapses in the last 16 against Barcelona in 2017, Manchester United in 2019 and Real Madrid in 2022.
""I said when I came in that the objective was to win important trophies, and the only one missing was the Champions League,"" said Luis Enrique, appointed in 2023.
After Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City's victory two years ago, also against Inter, it is another triumph for a club with mega-rich Gulf owners.
PSG's victory was always only a matter of time. Their revenue last year of just over 800 million euros made them the third-richest club in analysts Deloitte's Football Money League.
They sat behind only Real and City, and just ahead of traditional European aristocrats United, Bayern and Barcelona.
PSG's last reported annual wage bill was close to double Inter's entire revenues.
The difference with past years is that they are now spending the money more intelligently, on the likes of Saturday's two-goal hero Desire Doue, Joao Neves and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.
Luis Enrique and sporting director Luis Campos recently signed new contracts with the club who also won all three available titles in France this season.
PSG will now take away more than 100 million euros just in prize money from winning the Champions League, and there is the chance for more glory and riches as they head to the highly lucrative FIFA Club World Cup in the USA.

"Simplicity, faith drive Thal endurance","GB
Their music, rich in melody and culture, resonates in the vast expanse of Thal.
Stretching from central to South Punjab, Thal, Pakistan's smallest desert, is a symbol of enduring human spirit, long thriving in an environment fraught with challenges.
Most of the land of this over 20,000 square kilometres stretch is arid, making parts of Bhakkar, Khushab, Layyah, Mianwali, Muzaffargarh and Jhang districts. There are also some plain irrigated areas where people grow food crops like chickpea and wheat. In raid-fed areas, fodder crops are cultivated but their survival depends on rains.
Dr Ashu Lal, a noted intellectual from Layyah district, narrated that in ancient times Thal's people used to sing folk songs to seek divine intervention for rainfall and in some areas they still cling to this tradition. ""So the singing for them was like a prayers to save them from harsh climatic conditions.""
Their music, rich in melody and culture, resonates in the vast expanse of Thal, as a spiritual and practical expression of hope for better days.
The British rulers described the desert as a ""tract of barrenness,"" inhabited by scattered clans, sustaining through rudimentary agriculture and nomadic grazing.
Local people find solace in vibrant oral tradition, colourful folk tales and deep spiritual connections to Sufi saints, shaping a cultural identity rooted in simplicity, endurance and faith.

Govt enforcement failure ignores law safeguarding rights of home-based women workers
Although the Sindh government has legislated a law to grant and protect rights of the women home based workers, a lack of implementation on the law continues to deny rights to these workers.
A consultation meeting , organized in Sukkur by the Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) and Bhittai Social Watch and Advocacy (BSWA) on Saturday night, shed light over the issue, identifying bottlenecks and suggesting solutions.
The Sindh Home-Based Workers Act was legislated in 2018 to safeguard rights of the home based workers. Tens of thousands of women work in the province in the informal sectors like creating embroidery, crafting multi-coloured tapestry quilts called rilli in Sindhi language, date leaves and wheat straw, besides a range of other items. ""The Act is a pioneering law in South Asia,"" observed Abdullah Dayo, Program Advisor at Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES). ""We must now focus on implementing its rules to transform legal recognition into the real-world protections for women workers.""
Additional Inspector General of Police Gender and Human Rights Shahla Qureshi acknowledged the law's significance, underlining the need to integrate gender protection, coordination with anti-GBV services and proactive roles by police in facilitating survivors' access to support services without procedural delays.
SSP informed about the role of Anti-Rape Crisis Cells (ARCCs) and the Gender Desks in assisting women workers. She encouraged greater coordination between police, SHRC, and CSOs for survivor-centered responses.

Hitman killed by accomplice's 'fire',"US
The police shifted the body for autopsy.
A contract killer was killed by the alleged firing of his accomplices during a 'police encounter' near Baddrah, police said.
Shah Nazar alias Abdul Rehman from Peshawar was accused of murdering two innocent citizens for Rs100,000. He was in police custody at the time he was killed.
Fatah Jang police said that the arrested suspect was being taken for evidence recovery. The police team was ambushed near Baddrah, in the vicinity of Hattar, where unknown armed assailants had blocked the road with stones.
The suspects opened fire on the police to free the suspect from custody under the cover of darkness. The attackers continued indiscriminate firing and fled the scene.
During a subsequent search operation, police found Shah Nazar's dead body near Dhok Namdar. Initial findings suggested he was killed by the bullets fired by his own unidentified accomplices.
The police shifted the body for autopsy, registered a murder case against the unknown attackers and began an investigation.
In recent months, several suspects have reportedly been killed or injured in similar police encounters in Attock, with the police claiming that all of them were killed or injured by the firing of their own accomplices.

A tax system built on evasion,"PK
To fix budget, govt must remove non-filer category, enforce real compliance
Those drafting the upcoming budget face a formidable set of challenges: the mammoth and still growing debt burden, the skyrocketing cost of living for the poor, and the seemingly intractable trade deficit, to name just a few.
But by far the biggest challenge is the mismatch between income and expenses. This has led the government to run a perennial budget deficit. Of course, this is a situation that cannot continue forever. If the government were a corporation, it would have been declared bankrupt years ago.
There are only two ways to address this problem: increase tax revenues or decrease expenses. On the latter, there's much the government can do to curb needless extravagance — think of the number of cabinet ministers it supports and their ancillary costs, or the number of MNAs and MPAs in our assemblies, whose presence or absence has zero impact on the country.
But ultimately, cutting expenses is a game of diminishing returns. You can trim the fat only so far before you get to the meat.
So, the solution to the budget deficit must rely on boosting revenues. And here lies the real problem. Pakistan is perhaps the only country in the world that gives its citizens the option to pay taxes — or not.
We have a whole category of people called non-filers who can legally refuse to be part of the tax net. Only a slim — and some might say foolish — minority has opted to become filers, actually submitting tax returns.
In an effort to improve tax compliance without broadening enforcement capacity, this filer versus non-filer distinction was introduced through the Finance Act 2013 under the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government. It allowed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to impose differential withholding tax rates on certain transactions — like vehicle registration, banking, and real estatebased on taxpayer status.
This had several goals: encouraging non-filers to register and become filers, using third-party withholding as a substitute for weak enforcement, and generating quick revenue from high-volume transactions.
Despite some early gains in revenue collection, the system created a host of negative consequences. It spawned a parallel economy which, rather than pushing non-filers into the formal system, effectively legalised non-compliance by allowing them to continue operatingalbeit at a higher cost.
Instead of enforcing mandatory return filing, the government began collecting advance taxes from non-filers on transactions such as vehicle registration, bank withdrawals, and real estate deals. This turned non-compliance into a revenue stream.
Many prefer to remain non-filers and simply absorb the higher withholding tax — it's often cheaper and less risky than formal registration. Cash-based and undocumented businesses continue to function outside the tax net, limiting the impact of broader economic reforms.
A particularly troubling outcome is that filers often feel punished for their honesty, while non-filers continue with impunity. Filers face politically motivated audits, complex filing requirements, and penalties for minor errors. Non-filers avoid scrutiny altogether. This disillusionment fosters cynicism and erodes trust in tax authorities.
Instead of encouraging compliance, the system paradoxically discourages it — especially when filers see no benefits in return for their transparency.
Tax systems thrive on fairness and reciprocity. Yet this two-tier structure undermines both. Filers rarely witness improvements in public services or infrastructure proportional to their contributions, further dampening their motivation to comply.
Knowing that non-compliance attracts no real penalty — beyond a slightly higher withholding rate — many make the rational decision to avoid filing. Certain sectors, like real estate and wholesale/retail trade, thrive despite being dominated by non-filers, making voluntary compliance appear naïve and burdensome.
This split also introduces market distortions. Individuals and businesses structure transactions to dodge higher non-filer taxesusing intermediaries, splitting invoices, or underreporting.
Genuine investors are deterred by sectors with high compliance burdens, creating a tilt toward low-visibility, low-regulation activities. Non-filers still invest in property— albeit at higher ratesfuelling speculation rather than productivity.
While withholding taxes have boosted collection, actual compliance and accountability remain weak. The government may celebrate rising revenues, but much of it comes from advance taxes on non-filers who remain beyond the system's reach.
There's been no expansion of the taxpayer base. Withholding doesn't equate to documentation or broader participation. Worse, the administrative burden has increased. Focusing on transaction-based tax grabs distracts from building institutional audit and enforcement capacity.
This system undermines progressive taxation. A core tenet of modern tax policy is that those who earn more should pay morea principle weakened by our current regime.
Withholding taxes are levied regardless of an individual's ability to pay, hitting poor and low-income non-filers hardest. Since non-filers are taxed per transaction, not income, the regime becomes regressive. Equity is eroded. The wealthiest often remain outside the net entirely by structuring their finances to avoid detection.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has called the upcoming budget a ""structural budget"" — implying fundamental reforms are on the table. If he truly intends to walk the talk, he must begin by scrapping the non-filer category. It's iniquitous and untenable.
But this alone won't suffice. The FBR's enforcement capacity must be enhanced to manage a larger filer base. Digitisation must also accelerate. Cashless, online transactions should be made mandatory. AI can automate many functions — like audit selection — that currently rely on human input.
These reforms will take time, but eliminating the non-filer status can happen immediately. It's the necessary first step, and it alone could significantly boost revenues and help reduce the chronic budget deficit that continues to haunt the country.

Man Utd sign Brazil forward Cunha,"US
The Wolves player signed the deal worth a reported £62.5 million
Manchester United signed Brazil forward Matheus Cunha from Wolves in a deal worth a reported £62.5 million ($83 million) on Sunday.
Cunha is expected to pen a five-year contract with the Old Trafford club, who have the option of extending the deal by a further 12 months.
""Manchester United has reached agreement with Wolverhampton Wanderers for the signing of Matheus Cunha,"" a United statement said.
""Everyone at Manchester United looks forward to welcoming Matheus to Old Trafford.""
The 26-year-old was in Manchester over the weekend to put the finishing touches to his move, which is subject to a visa and registration. Cunha, who has won 13 caps for Brazil, scored 18 goals in all competitions for Wolves this season, winning the club's player of the year award.
The Brazilian finished his Wolves career with 33 goals in 92 appearances in all competitions after signing from Atletico Madrid in January 2023. United activated the release clause in Cunha's Wolves contract to ensure he becomes boss Ruben Amorim's first signing of the summer transfer window.
Wolves said the deal was a club-record fee received as they thanked Cunha ""for his contributions in old gold"" in a statement confirming his departure.
Cunha will join up with Brazil ahead of Friday's World Cup qualifier against Ecuador, which will be Carlo Ancelotti's first game in charge of the Selecao.
Amorim's side lost the Europa League final against Tottenham to cap a dismal season featuring a 15th place finish in the Premier League that ranked as their lowest final position since 1973-74.
Cunha will add his predatory instincts and creative guile to a United attack that struggled throughout this season.
United's lack of cutting edge was evident yet again when they failed to find a solution to Tottenham's defensive tactics in the Europa League final.
Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo has also been linked with United, whose transfer business has been made harder by their failure to qualify for the Champions League.

Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) provincial spokesperson Haji Abdul Jalil Jan has accused Barrister Saif of misleading the nation by blaming 12 years of corruption on the caretaker government.
Responding to recent statements by the K-P Adviser on Information, Jalil Jan challenged Barrister Saif to present the cheques issued during Taimur Jhagra's tenure as finance minister in connection with the Kohistan scandal.
He said that those who constantly label others as thieves have now been caught red-handed. The same political party that promised one million jobs, five million homes, and rivers of milk and honey in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is itself mired in corruption scandals.
Jalil Jan further stated that following the BRT project, Malam Jabba land case, Billion Tree Tsunami, wheat scandal, and misuse of the Sehat Card program, the Kohistan scandal has further exposed the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Even ministers and MPAs from the ruling party have come forward with revelations, shedding light on the extent of corruption within Barrister Saif's party.

Food price disparities persist across metropolis,"XX
Enforcement of official rate lists virtually ineffective
A steep and widespread increase in the prices of perishable food items has been observed across the provincial capital this week, highlighting the ineffectiveness of official measures aimed at curbing artificial inflation and profiteering.
Despite repeated claims by the Punjab government, enforcement of the official price list remained virtually ineffective in markets.
Retailers openly flouted the government-fixed prices despite then recent establishment of a price monitoring department led by a secretary.
Live chicken prices were officially reduced by Rs28 per kilogram this week, bringing the rate to Rs369383 per kg. However, it was generally unavailable, while chicken meat sold for Rs580690 per kg and boneless chicken for Rs900 to Rs1,050.
Among vegetables, the official price of A-grade soft skin potatoes increased by Rs10 to Rs5560 per kg, but they were sold at Rs120140 per kg. B-grade potatoes, fixed at Rs4550, and C-grade at Rs3540, were sold as mixed lots for Rs80100 per kg. Sugar-free potato prices also rose, with A-grade set at Rs4550 but sold for as high as Rs100 per kg.
A-grade onions, fixed at Rs3540, were sold for Rs80 per kg. Similar disparities were observed in B- and C-grade onions. Tomatoes followed the same trend, with A-grade fixed at Rs3540 but retailing between Rs80 and Rs120 per kg.
Garlic and ginger prices showed notable increases. Locally produced garlic, officially priced at Rs176185 per kg, was sold for Rs200250, while Chinese garlic, fixed at Rs252265, was sold for Rs400. Ginger prices dropped on paper, with the Thai variety set at Rs582610 and Chinese at Rs535580 per kg, yet both were sold for Rs8001,000 per kg.
Spinach, fixed at Rs3540, was sold for up to Rs100 per kg. Other items showing significant disparities included cabbage (Rs4750, sold at Rs120150) and Chinese carrots (Rs5255, sold at Rs200250).
Among fruits, apple prices surged by Rs30, with official rates ranging from Rs250 to Rs420 per kg, but market prices reached Rs800 per kg. Bananas were also sold well above official prices. Papaya, melon, watermelon, cantaloupe, peach, and phalsa all recorded price gains, with official rates far lower than selling prices.

The Greater Bairam: a festival of inclusivity,"US
The Muslims observe the Greater Bairam, known as the Eid-ul-Adha
Consequentialism is defined as ""the ethical study of morals, duties and rights with an approach that focuses consequences of a particular action or cause"". A consequentialist holds the belief that ""consequences form the basis for any valid moral judgement about an action"". Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right action is one that produces a good outcome or consequence.
The Muslims observe the Greater Bairam, known as the Eid-ul-Adha, in remembrance of the great sacrifice by Hazrat Ibrahim (AS) of his son Hazrat Ismael (AS) obeying his Creator. The sacrifice of what is dearest to heart in the world was demanded as a proof of unconditional obedience. The father was ready to offer the sacrifice of his son who was the dearest thing to him as the son was born in the father's old age.
The demands of sacrifice become more poignant when the father is required to slaughter his son with his own hands. It is quite difficult to imagine feeling the agonising pain at the writhing body of one's own son being slaughtered. When the father was close to slaughter, the Creator transformed the son into a ram. The father came out victorious in the litmus test for devotion and love.
The Muslims, particularly in our part of the world, have transformed this devotional sacrifice into a worldly affair of ostentation and self-aggrandisement. The wealthier the person is, the costlier the sacrificial animal is. The purchase in hundreds of thousands is a way to showcase one's opulence, as the sharing of wealth with the poor unshowingly doesn't satisfy one's urge for self-exhibitionism. Accepted that one ought to buy the cattle at par with one's financial muscle, but the real sacrifice would be to distribute its meat among the destitute.
The children and youngsters play with their sacrificial animals in front of those who can't afford to buy one. It nurtures hopes in the poor neighbours that they would get a meal with the meat which has been unaffordable to them throughout the year, but this day, too, they wouldn't.
We must advise our children to include such children in the festivities. A religion that enjoins upon its adherents to cover the eatables being taken home lest it might tantalise the poor children in the neighbours cannot allow them to exclude the less privileged from the festivities of a religious festival.
Some families have devised a ploy to defang the pricking of conscience: They reserve mutton for the family and distribute beef among the poor. Paradoxically, the rich who relish mutton throughout the year behave as if they have never eaten mutton. As is the norm, they stuff their deep freezers with the meat for ""the rainy days"". The divine sacrifice demands parting with one's desires and avarice. The desire to store and avarice for more makes man the poorest of the lot.
The irresponsibility people display in disposing of the remains of the sacrificed animals goes against the spirit of the sacrifice and Islamic teachings. The offal fly-tipped along the streets and roads creates an unpleasant scene marring the beauty and sanctity of the holy tradition of the great sacrifice as these litter louts don't bother that their actions might become the cause of public nuisance.
Even if the remains are thrown away from the vicinity, they land near the slums and ghettos, compounding miseries of the dwellers twofold. First, they were not included in the joys and blessings of the festival. Second, they were reminded with the heaps of stinking offal that they are the segregated part of society. What to speak of including the minorities in the joys and blessings of the festival? The bliss of divine sacrifice is in inclusivity, not in exclusivity. It's a communal festival.
If our offering of sacrifice doesn't make us shake off all the impurities of ego – arrogance, avarice, ostentation, selfishness and the ilk – we will have to take stock of our intentions and actions. If we don't find ourselves a changed, rather a metamorphosed, person after sacrificing what is dearest to us, it means we haven't sacrificed what is dearest to us – the raison detre of the divine sacrifice.

Families flock to outdoor breakfast spots,"XX
Embrace new weekend tradition to enjoy delicious meals and quality time together
The weekend breakfast scene at 'Breakfast Point' has become a sensation, with families and couples flocking to enjoy not only delicious food but also the serene surroundings, creating a new weekend tradition.
A shift is underway in how families across Pakistan are embracing their weekend mornings. Rather than sticking to traditional indoor breakfasts, many are now opting for the great outdoors, especially in parks and scenic spots. This trend is rapidly gaining momentum, particularly among young families who value quality time together in nature.
According to recent reports, outdoor family breakfasts are quickly becoming the new norm. Parks, gardens, and scenic spots are seeing an increase in gatherings, with families enjoying the fresh air and picturesque views as they share breakfast. ""We love spending our Sunday mornings at Bagh-e-Jinnah in Lahore,"" shares a mother of two, highlighting the appeal of fresh air and green spaces for weekend bonding.
In response to the rising demand, local vendors are tailoring their offerings to cater to this new tradition. Popular breakfast spots now feature special menus, including everything from parathas, omelettes, haleem, and nihari, to fresh juices. Some are even offering themed breakfasts, such as traditional Pakistani dishes or international options like pancakes and waffles.
For many, the outdoors have become an extension of home. ""It's a great way to spend time with family while enjoying the fresh air and beautiful surroundings,"" says another local citizen. A father of three from Islamabad adds, ""We often visit Shakarparian Hills on weekends. It's a wonderful way to bond with our kids and create lasting memories.""
This outdoor breakfast trend isn't confined to just one city. Breakfast points in Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar, and Karachi are also capitalizing on this growing interest. ""We've seen a huge uptick in demand for outdoor breakfasts on weekends,"" says the owner of The Breakfast Club in Lahore's Gulberg, noting that their special outdoor menu and relaxed ambiance have become a favorite among customers.
Hotels and restaurants in Islamabad are also catching on. One well-known hotel reports that more and more guests are opting for outdoor seating to enjoy their meals with a scenic view. In Karachi, a popular restaurant sees the same trend. ""We offer a buffet-style breakfast with a variety of options, and our outdoor seating area is always packed on weekends,"" says Maria, a restaurant representative.
As this trend continues to grow, it's clear that outdoor family breakfasts have become a cherished weekend tradition. Whether it's a visit to a scenic park, a rooftop café, or a small family-run eatery, families are finding new ways to make their weekends special and memorable.

Webster seeks dream pairing in WTC Final,"US
It is scheduled to take place at Lord's from June 11-15
Australia will defend the mace against South Africa in the ICC World Test Championship Final 2025 at Lord's.
Since his debut against India at the SCG in January 2025, Beau Webster has presented himself as a viable all-round option in the Australia Test setup.
His three Test outings, which yielded 150 runs and three wickets, impressed the selectors enough to select the Tasmanian into the squad for the upcoming World Test Championship Final against South Africa, starting June 11.
Webster further boosted his claims during his county stint with Warwickshire, scoring 172 runs and picking 10 wickets from his four outings. This was a follow-up to his 2024 returns for Gloucestershire, where the all-rounder scored 233 runs and picked 16 wickets in four games.
Cameron Green, Australia's other pace all-rounder in the squad for the Ultimate Test, has also impressed with his three centuries from five county games for Gloucestershire.
However, Green is returning from a back surgery and hasn't bowled yet, which means that Webster's returns with the ball in English conditions assume greater significance.
Green's excellence as a batter and Webster's all-round perseverance open up the possibility of both players featuring in the Ultimate Test.
Speaking to The Sydney Morning Herald, Webster was excited at this prospect.
""He [Green] is a generational talent and a phenomenal cricketer,"" Webster said.
""He's only going to get better. He's only 25, so he's got a lot of cricket ahead of him.
""I don't know what the make-up of the top six is going to look like or which way they're going to go with in terms of all-rounders, but I'm certainly hoping we can both be in there.""
Webster hoped that his performances in England could catch the selectors' attention before Australia's title defence against South Africa.
""I like testing myself with the Dukes ball in different conditions. Hopefully, I can keep putting my name in front of selectors and become hard to drop out of that XI. That's probably my main purpose coming over, to keep my game ticking over.""
In case of a scenario where both players feature in the XI, someone like Marnus Labuschagne could be pushed up the order to open the innings. Webster backed Labuschagne, who averages nine from three county innings, to deliver his best in the summit clash.
""When he's at his best, he's unbelievable. His record speaks for itself. He's a hundred-maker and a game winner.
""I'm sure going to the top [of the batting] wouldn't phase him too much. Whoever gets the nod for that final is going to be raring to go.""
Webster's international journey has been quite a ride, with the all-rounder's impressive domestic run converting into an international debut at the start of this year in the Sydney Test against India, courtesy of Green's absence and Mitch Marsh's unimpressive returns in the summer.
""I'm very, very proud of what I've done,"" Webster added. ""But it's only the start and I'm looking to build on what I've started in the Baggy Green.""
Webster looked back at his Test debut as his most memorable memory. The all-rounder hit the winning runs at the SCG for Australia as they claimed the Border-Gavaskar Trophy by a 3-1 margin in the five-Test series.
""It was a bit of a whirlwind. It all went so quickly, and I do wish I had soaked it up a little bit more. To be out in the middle with Travis was something I will never forget.
""To this day [hitting the winning runs] was my favourite cricketing moment, without a doubt.""

Pakistan's missed climate opportunity,"US
Anyone concerned about animal welfare often faces the objection that human lives are at stake
In Pakistan, most people would likely scoff if you told them climate change wasn't a problem but an opportunity. This skepticism stems from past experiences where they've missed numerous chances to capitalise on situations arising from problems like biodiversity loss or pollution.
Instead of mitigating the social costs of pollution to save on healthcare expenses — which are nearly double — they opted to pay higher medical bills while consistently ignoring the underlying pollution issues. Consequently, they now suffer from the health impacts of pollution alongside increasing poverty levels. Few believed then, and many still don't believe now, that there's a direct link between pollution and their current predicament.
Anyone concerned about animal welfare often faces the objection that human lives are at stake, so worrying about ""dumb"" creatures incapable of thought or feeling is misplaced. What they fail to grasp is that fewer species mean a weaker ecosystem, less able to withstand the impact of pollution, which ultimately contributes to their poverty.
In Pakistan, a staggering 68% of the population is either unwilling to learn about climate change or completely unaware of it, beyond the discomfort of intense summer heat.
Sadly, even those who are knowledgeable about its devastating consequences often fail to reduce their own carbon footprint or adapt to its effects. Furthermore, a significant number prioritise profit, exploiting the issue to gain financially through climate change services or advocacy.
Consequently, efforts to promote climate action largely go unheard by the public, or if acknowledged through incentives, remain unimplemented. There's a lack of visible examples demonstrating that consistently addressing climate change can be a legitimate and profitable endeavour. This situation could improve if the demand for climate-smart products and services increases in Pakistan, as a larger market would create more jobs and earning opportunities.
It is a reality that outside of a small group of climate experts, academics and activists, hardly anyone realises Pakistan could be raking in over $2 billion annually just by tapping into its carbon credit potential. Think about it: as an agricultural nation, if only half our farmland embraced agroforestry, that alone could generate carbon credits worth a cool $1 billion. Then you've got our coastal areas and other huge swathes of plains that could easily bring in another billion.
But here's the frustrating part – setting up the system for carbon trading is moving at a snail's pace, and it doesn't look like it'll be ready anytime soon. The main issue is the lack of clarity. We can't just copy another country's carbon trading model wholesale because things work so differently here in this potentially very profitable sector.
The majority of our farmers, and often even the landowners, aren't educated enough to grasp how practices like regenerative agriculture can also generate carbon credits, or how bio-fodder can cut down on methane emissions from livestock – which, as we know, is a really potent greenhouse gas.
It's a real shame that even our climate-focused NGOs aren't really grasping the earning potential tied to this issue that demands global action. They're great at tree planting, but they don't know how to register a massive tree-planting drive – one aiming for hundreds of thousands of trees – to then verify their growth and ultimately claim carbon credits.
Apart from a few corporate-style NGOs run by big business figures, you don't see any other NGOs showcasing services to generate carbon credits or trade renewable energy certificates. Grassroots organisations often excuse their lack of awareness by saying they work at the local level and don't need to understand such significant earning opportunities.
They just want a few hundred thousand dollars to keep their local climate activities going. Sadly, they and many others, likely due to their narrow thinking, wouldn't even be open to the idea of generating carbon credits through a crowdfunding model, similar to retail mutual funds.
Given that our total carbon footprint is reportedly less than 1% of global greenhouse gas emissions, shouldn't we explore how to turn this into a financial advantage? The principle of carbon tax allows companies emitting below their allocated limit to generate carbon credits, which they can then sell to those exceeding their quotas. If, as our total emissions suggest, all our companies operate below their limits, couldn't we potentially sell the carbon credits generated from industrial decarbonisation on the international market?
To capitalise on this, we need to implement the carbon tax framework promptly. Achieving this requires convincing both industries and policymakers to participate transparently, ensuring our carbon credits from industrial decarbonisation are recognised fairly in global markets. Once again, limited awareness and governance challenges appear to be the primary obstacles preventing us from tapping into this significant earning potential.
Once again, we're missing out on a chance to make money simply because we lack the confidence to see problems as opportunities. Instead, we're just loudly proclaiming that Pakistan is among the top five countries most affected by climate change, hoping to secure climate finance.
Many enthusiastically support this idea, believing that if the global climate community recognises this, we'll receive our fair share of funding. However, many of these same people don't realise that only a small portion of climate finance comes as grants, while the rest will be guarantees, low-interest loans and equity investments.
It begs the question: don't respectable nations conduct business to overcome financial crises, while those constantly seeking grants and funding are... well, it's obvious what they are.

Cattle markets spring to life amid soaring prices,"US
Vendors struggle with heat, inflation; families flock to choose sacrificial animals
With Eidul Azha approaching, cattle markets across the metropolis have come alive with the hustle and bustle of buyers and sellers, but this year's skyrocketing prices have left citizens stunned.
From the outskirts to the heart of the city, several makeshift livestock markets have been set up where people, including children, are eagerly heading to select their preferred sacrificial animals. However, prices for both small and large animals have surged drastically, making it difficult for many to afford this religious obligation.
At the markets, the starting price of a bull is reported to be around Rs350,000, calves range between Rs200,000 to Rs250,000, and camels are being sold for Rs400,000 to Rs800,000.
The steep rise in prices, driven by inflation and supply costs, has left both sellers and buyers anxious.
To attract buyers, vendors have gone to great lengths to groom and decorate the animals. Protective measures against the summer heat are also in place as sellers are seen cooling their livestock with cold water baths and offering them traditional desi drinks.
Makeshift shades have been erected to shelter the animals from the harsh sun.
Meanwhile, the prices of fodder have also soared. Dry fodder such as bhoosa and toori is being sold for Rs800 to Rs850 per 40kg, while chopped green fodder costs Rs600 per 40kg, and unchopped green fodder is priced at Rs400 per 40kg.
At Manawan Mandi, traders have arranged for their own electricity via generators and installed borewells for the animals' drinking water. However, no government-provided facilities like water filtration units or cooling systems for visitors have been set up.
A complaints cell has been established, but many citizens remain concerned about the lack of basic amenities. Despite the challenges, the buying and selling of sacrificial animals continues in full swing.

Two addicts die stealing high-voltage power lines,"US
In a shocking new trend, drug addicts in Peshawar have begun stealing electricity wires in a daring
Two alleged heroin addicts lost their lives while attempting to steal a high-voltage electricity line near the Galle Baba graveyard in the Tehkal Bala area late Saturday night, according to police sources.
The bodies of the two men, found with severe burn injuries, were discovered near the graveyard early Sunday. Authorities believe the pair was trying to cut an 11,000-volt power line when electricity was unexpectedly restored, resulting in fatal electric shocks. Police recovered tools commonly used for illegal power connections, including a wooden stick and wire typically used for hooking live wires, from the scene.
Local residents reported that the power had gone out in the area during the night. The two men allegedly attempted to tamper with the line during the outage, not anticipating the sudden return of power.
DSP Town Asif Sharif confirmed that both individuals remain unidentified. In an effort to establish their identities, police have released a video of the deceased on social media. A formal report has been filed, and further investigation is underway.
In a shocking new trend, drug addicts in Peshawar have begun stealing electricity wires in a daring, Spider-Man-like fashionclimbing poles and leaping between structures to cut and sell high-voltage cables.

Nisho's note for Rambo,"XX
Veteran steals hearts with cheeky ode
When veteran actor Nisho (also affectionately known as Nisho Jee) takes the stage, expect fireworks, flair, and maybe even a little family poetry. Appearing on a local chat show on DAY, the Rangeela icon lit up the studio with a delightful tribute to son-in-law and actor Jan Rambo.
Rambo, born Afzal Khan, rose to fame with '90s action-comedy films and tied the knot with Sahiba, Nisho's daughter and fellow film star, in 1998. Still going strong, the couple has raised two sons.
In the middle of the segment, Nisho playfully launched into a couplet that had the audience roaring with laughter, and then sighing with admiration. With her signature flair, she described the curious evolution of Pakistani sons-in-law: ""Neechi nazrein aur phool sa lehja, har khata se yeh paak hotay hain / Joon he shaadi ho aur banein damaad, bohot khaufnaak hotay hain.""
As the room erupted in response, Nisho clarified that this was not a cheeky dig at Rambo. ""There is no need to praise my son-in-law. Everyone already knows Jan Rambo!"" She furthered on, ""When daughters marry men like him, their futures are nothing short of radiant.""
Clips from the show quickly went viral, with many calling it ""the mother-in-law moment of the year.""
In the same interview, she revealed that suitors still propose to her but added, ""Men are disloyal; they're often after a woman's money."" She clarified, ""Not all, but some."" While her contemporaries like Sangeeta, Bushra Ansari, and Samina Ahmed married, she said she won't. ""I was foolish about love and marriage when I was young. Now, I have wisdom,"" she said, laughing, a moment that made everyone else laugh too.
Tensions once brewed between the actor and her son-in-law, particularly when Rambo reunited Sahiba with her estranged father after decades. This act of love, though complicated, led to a moment Sahiba would never forget. In March 2024, she met her biological father, Inam Rabbani, for the very first time, an emotional reunion captured in a video on her YouTube channel. Clips circulating online showed tearful embraces, hesitant confessions, and a father overwhelmed by guilt and gratitude.
After 42 years of silence, Rabbani told Sahiba he had held on just to apologise before he died. Sahiba, moved by his remorse, chose to forgive him. While she expressed lingering fears of abandonment, she listened as he acknowledged Rambo as a good husband.

Govt bans temporary mechanical rides,"US
The spokesperson clarified that the decision had been made to protect lives.
The Punjab government has banned temporarily installed mechanical rides during the Eidul Azha holiday.
According to a spokesperson for the Punjab Home Department, the ban applies to mechanical rides that are set up temporarily during the holidays.
Mechanical rides permanently installed in amusement parks across the province are exempt from the ban with a condition to get the fitness certificates from the deputy commissioners.
Under the directives issued by the department, the district administrations will verify that every mechanical ride meets all necessary safety standards before issuing the certificate.
The spokesperson clarified that the decision to ban temporary and mobile mechanical rides had been made to protect lives.
During the Eid holidays, a large number of citizens, especially children, use the rides. Temporary rides often fail to meet security protocols and pose a threat to citizens due to overloading.
The ban will remain in effect throughout the Eid holidays.

Water project contract dispute lands in court,"US
LHC's Pindi Bench has given both parties two weeks to resolve the dispute amicably
The Lahore High Court's Rawalpindi Bench has taken notice of a petition filed by a Turkish firm against the cancellation of two contracts worth Rs20.4 billion under the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-funded Developing Resilient Environment and Advancing Municipal Services (Dreams-I) for water supply improvement at Chahan Dam.
Justice Jawad Hassan has granted both the petitioner and the Dream-I project director a two-week period to resolve the matter amicably, highlighting its significance as a case involving foreign investment and international relations.
The petition was filed by Turkish company MS 5H Insaat, one of the original winners of the Lot 2 and Lot 3 contracts alongside Pakistani firm Qasim & Co. Although both firms had secured the bid, the contract was ultimately awarded solely to MS 5H Insaat, citing performance guarantees and other reasons.
Upon learning of the situation, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz ordered a fact-finding investigation by the Chief Minister's Inspection Team (CMIT), which identified serious flaws in the procurement process.
It noted that the project, despite being foreign-funded, had not undergone quarterly reviews by its Steering Committee as required.
Following the findings, the project's Steering Committee, chaired by Punjab Planning & Development Chairman Barrister Nabeel Awan, decided to cancel the contract and reinitiate the tendering process.
The committee also recommended disciplinary action against the officials responsible for the contract award and mandated quarterly reviews for all future foreign-funded projects to ensure transparency.

"Islamabad, Kabul bonhomie surges","PK
Dar, Muttaqi hold telephonic conversation
Pakistan and Afghanistan stepped up their contacts as a new push to reset their long troubled ties is making significant strides, officials said here as the foreign ministers from the two countries spoke on Sunday by phone.
The latest telephonic conversation between Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Afghan Interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi came days after Pakistan agreed to upgrade diplomatic ties with Kabul.
The Interim Afghan government welcomed Pakistan's move to appoint a full time Ambassador in Kabul, becoming the fourth country to do so.
China took the lead last year when it sent a full time ambassador to Kabul and accepted a Taliban Envoy in Beijing.
China has been instrumental in persuading Pakistan and Afghanistan to exchange ambassadors. The breakthrough came after the interim Taliban government took a series of steps to address Pakistan's concerns over the cross border terrorist attacks.
Pakistani officials confirmed to The Express Tribune that Kabul for the first time moved against elements particularly the Afghan nationals who either joined the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) or were thinking to be part of the group. Scores of such Afghans were arrested as well as those who were facilitating young people to join the ranks of TTP.
Those steps encouraged Pakistan to increase interaction with the Afghan Taliban government. The decision was also significant since India was trying to exploit the strained relationship between Pakistan and Afghanistan to its advantage.
A statement issued here by the Foreign Office said Foreign Minister Muttaqi welcomed the decision of Pakistan to up-grade its diplomatic relations to the ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan decided to reciprocate the same.
He termed it a very positive development in bilateral relations.
Both leaders also reviewed implementation of decisions taken during DPM/FM's visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations.
Emphasizing the importance of Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity, both leaders agreed to work closely for an early finalisation of the framework agreement, according to the statement.
The Afghan foreign minister is expected to visit Islamabad soon. This will be Muttaqi's first visit to Pakistan in two years.
Pakistan and Afghanistan ties have remained strained since Taliban returned to power in August 2021.

Development budget likely to top Rs4tr,"US
Coalition's political priorities dominate as health, education and water see deep cuts
The government is set to approve a record Rs4.1 trillion national development budget for the Centre and provinces amid scarcity of resources that has compelled it to ban small-scale projects and not to include federally-funded province-specific new schemes for next year.
Despite the threat of blocking water by India, the government has proposed to reduce the water sector allocation by 45% or Rs119 billion to just Rs140 billion for the fiscal year 2025-26 against the originally approved budget.
Yet, the proposed federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) reflects the coalition government's political priorities, with hefty allocations for road infrastructure, while funding for education, health, and water has been significantly slashed for the fiscal year 2025-26.
The Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) will today (Monday) approve the national development budget outlays for the federal government, four provincial governments and the special areas of Pakistan.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal will chair the meeting, which will also recommend 4.2% economic growth and 7.5% inflation targets for the next fiscal year.
The federal PSDP has been finalised by a committee constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif aimed at accommodating the needs of the coalition partners.
The APCC will approve a cumulative Rs4.1 trillion outlay for development, which will be Rs300 billion or 8% higher than this fiscal year's original budgets approved by the National and four provincial assemblies.
There has been a reduction in the federal PSDP, but the four provincial governments will cumulatively spend 28% higher than this year's budget from their own resources. Provinces are rich, thanks to the ill-planned National Finance Commission award of 2010.
The APCC will approve Rs1 trillion federal PSDP, down by Rs400 billion compared to this fiscal year's original budget approved in June last year. The federal government will borrow Rs270 billion from abroad to fund this Rs1 trillion spending.
The four governments plan to spend Rs2.8 trillion, higher by Rs609 billion or 28% over this year's original budgets. The provincial governments will also borrow Rs802 billion from abroad to fund their projects.
Another Rs288 billion will be spent by the government-owned companies outside the federal budget.
Punjab is on a spending spree, as it plans to spend Rs1.19 trillion, which is higher by Rs346 billion or 41% over this fiscal year's budget.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa will follow Punjab with Rs440 billion spending, also higher by 63%.
Sindh government plans to spend Rs887 billion, higher by Rs60 billion or 7%. The Balochistan government is proposing Rs280 billion for development, which is higher by Rs32 billion over the originally approved budget.
No fiscal space
The federal and provincial governments are loosening their purses despite the country facing challenging economic conditions. The federal government, constrained by limited fiscal space, is once again allocating Rs1 trillion, even though it managed to spend only Rs600 billion during the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.
The APCC will approve not to include any new provincial nature project in the PSDP due to fiscal constraints. It will also approve a moratorium on approval of up to Rs1 billion projects till completion of the IMF programme. However, an exception is also being proposed from the moratorium in case of ""compelling conditions"".
Despite fiscal constraints, projects pertaining to devolved subjects and provincial in nature are still being financed under the federal PSDP. About 30-40% of PSDP goes to the provincial nature projects, which have seriously undermined the progress of mega and core projects of national significance, according to the planning ministry.
The projects of national importance are delayed due to thin spread funding, and around 90% ongoing projects have been revised with cost increase and time overrun, it added.
The APCC may also issue directions that the development funds should not be diverted to non-development purposes during the currency of the fiscal year.
The APCC will review whether projects with high impact, focused on completion within 3-4 years, will be funded. The proposed PSDP gives priority to foreign-funded and core, and high-impact projects.
However, a cursory look at the proposed PSDP suggests that despite tough economic conditions, the government has given importance to politically nature projects by increasing allocations for the National Highway Authority and the provincial nature projects.
The allocation for the provincial projects has been proposed to be increased from Rs19 billion to Rs93.4 billion. Likewise, the NHA budget has been proposed to be increased to a whopping Rs229 billion, up by Rs49 billion or 27%.
To make room for higher spending on political priorities of the coalition partners, the government has proposed to drastically reduce the funding of the water and power sector projects.
The power sector budget is proposed to be reduced by Rs72 billion or 41% to Rs104 billion. The water sector allocation is proposed to be cut by Rs119 billion to just Rs140 billion. Diamer Basha dam project will get Rs35 billion in the next fiscal year compared to Rs40 billion this year, according to the sources.
The federal ministry of education's budget has been proposed to be cut by 27% to Rs20 billion, while the Higher Education Commission's budget is proposed to be reduced by Rs21 billion or 32% to Rs45 billion.
Despite challenges, the government has also retained a Rs50 billion allocation for the parliamentarians' schemes under the umbrella of the Sustainable Development Goals Achievement Programme.
Around 1,071 development projects with a cumulative cost of Rs13.4 trillion are currently under implementation.
They need another Rs10.2 trillion for completion, which the Planning Ministry states would take more than 10 years to complete.
Compared to the original Rs1.4 trillion approved federal PSDP in the budget, the actual spending as of the end of May remained at Rs596 billion, which is hardly 43% of the parliament's approved budget.
The government admits that Pakistan, withan IMF programme, undergoes some limitations and thus the challenge ahead is to leverage the limited resources in a way to achieve maximum returns from each project to satisfy goals and objectives outlined in the national economic transformation plan, the 5Es-based five-year plan and the ""Uraan Pakistan Programme"" while overcoming challenges.
There are also implementation issues, and during recent reviews, the planning ministry had identified 183 projects, mostly at the DDWP level, as problematic and slow-moving. It has been recommended to cap or close all these projects by June 2025.
By capping or closing such projects, around Rs1 trillion could be saved and fiscal space could be created for fast-moving ongoing projects as well as new high-impact priority projects, according to a proposal to the APCC.

Beaten to death,"US
The ban on corporal punishment means nothing if it is not enforced.
Another child has died. Not from illness or accident, but from the savage hands of the very person entrusted with his education and protection. In Jamrud tehsil of K-P, a fifth-grade student was tortured by his school head during morning assembly. The boy was beaten with a stick on his head, neck, face and back. He later died of his injuries. Let that sink in.
The accused may have been arrested but the incident begs the deeper question: What kind of a system allows such barbarity to fester within the walls of an educational institution? How many more children must suffer before Pakistan stops treating corporal punishment as tradition rather than the crime that it is? Pakistan's laws — on paper — prohibit corporal punishment.
But enforcement is virtually non-existent. Schools, especially in under-regulated districts, operate in a vacuum where oversight is minimal and cruelty is often justified as 'discipline'. This has created a dangerous culture where violence is not only tolerated but expected. The community's demand for exemplary punishment is not only justified but essential.
Moreover, the ban on corporal punishment means nothing if it is not enforced. The problem is the absence of will, not the absence of law. There is no nationwide enforcement. No teacher training on child rights. No functioning complaint systems. The truth is, most children who are beaten never report it. And most teachers who beat them are never held accountable.
It is not enough to arrest the accused school head. He should be charged with murder. But beyond that, the government must move from statements to action. Bans must be implemented. Teachers who use violence must be removed from the system for good. School inspections must be routine. And child protection must be made central to our education system.

"More than 1,100 migrants crossed Channel","PL
.
Some 1,194 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats, a record for this year according to AFP counting from government data.
It brings the overall number of migrant crossings this year to 14,808, an unprecedented figure despite several measures in place by the French and UK governments to curb the crossings.
French coastal authorities said they also rescued nearly 200 migrants between late Friday and late Saturday.
The latest crossings, which UK Defence Secretary John Healey described as ""shocking"", fall short of the all-time record of 1,300 migrants arriving on small boats in a day in September 2022.
But they will still prove a headache for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been at pains to toughen his rhetoric on irregular immigration amid pressure from the far right to slash migrant numbers.
""We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security,"" the Home Office said in a statement on the latest arrivals.
Starmer unveiled tough new immigration policies this month that include doubling the length of time before migrants can qualify for settlement in the country and new powers to deport foreign criminals.
The raft of measures was widely seen as an attempt to win back support from voters and fend off threats from the increasingly popular hard-right Reform party.
Separate legislation to tackle irregular immigration, called the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, is currently going through parliament.
But the latest crossings will be a fresh blow.
The overall figure of 14,808 crossings is the highest for the first five months of the year since records began in 2018, when the route into the UK first became popular.

Bangladesh opens fugitive ex-PM's trial over protest killings,"US
.
Fugitive former prime minister Sheikh Hasina orchestrated a ""systemic attack"" to try to crush the uprising against her government, Bangladeshi prosecutors said at the opening of her trial on Sunday.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina's government launched its crackdown, according to the United Nations.
Hasina, 77, fled by helicopter to her old ally India as the student-led uprising ended her 15-year rule, and she has defied an extradition order to return to Dhaka.
The domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures connected to Hasina's ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League.
""Upon scrutinising the evidence, we reached the conclusion that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,"" Mohammad Tajul Islam, ICT chief prosecutor, told the court in his opening speech.
""The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her armed party members to crush the uprising.""
Islam lodged charges against Hasina and two other officials of ""abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy, and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising"".
Hasina, who remains in self-imposed exile in India, has rejected the charges as politically motivated.
As well as Hasina, the case includes ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al Mamun -- who is in custody, but who did not appear in court on Sunday -- and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal, who like Hasina, is on the run.
The prosecution of senior figures from Hasina's government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power. The interim government has vowed to hold elections before June 2026.
The hearing is being broadcast live on state-owned Bangladesh Television.
Prosecutor Islam vowed the trial would be impartial.
""This is not an act of vendetta, but a commitment to the principle that, in a democratic country, there is no room for crimes against humanity,"" he said.
Investigators have collected video footage, audio clips, Hasina's phone conversations, records of helicopter and drone movements, as well as statements from victims of the crackdown as part of their probe. The ICT court opened its first trial connected to the previous government on May 25.
In that case, eight police officials face charges of crimes against humanity over the killing of six protesters on August 5, the day Hasina fled the country.

Survivors of terrorism lack access to counselling,"US
With terrorist activity persistently plaguing public safety, families recovering from trauma are left without support
Located just 45 kilometers from the Afghan border, Peshawar has been in the grip of terrorism since the last 15 to 20 years, with thousands of people losing their lives and livelihoods to the war on terror. However, not a single rehabilitation center could be built in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) to help victims of terrorism and their families to recover from their trauma.
In 2009, Yasir Khan lost six members of his family in the horrific bomb blast in Peshawar's Pipal Mandi. ""More than 15 years have passed since the incident, but even today, when a terrorist incident occurs, my mind goes into shock again for a few moments. Perhaps the trauma of that incident has been buried deep within me. About 150 people were killed in the blast while about 250 were injured. The survivors are suffering from post-traumatic stress, but they have not been able to access psychological help,"" said Khan.
Likewise, in 2014, Arif Aqeel, a school teacher was badly injured in two suicide attacks at the All-Saints Church in Peshawar. Hailing from the Christian community, Arif lost one of his legs and a large chunk of his memory due to severe head injuries. Three years later, Arif's wounds could not heal, and he passed away. ""First the shock of the explosion and then the death of Arif left a lasting impact on his wife and children. The family has not received counseling till date, due to which they are still suffering from psychological problems,"" shared Arif's brother-in-law, Augustine Jacob.
Similarly, Sir Naeem Gulzar, who was injured in the Peshawar Qissa Khawani blasts twice, shared a poignant narration of what goes on in the mind of a survivor coping with the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Even though ten years have passed since the tragedy, even today Gulzar is fearful of leaving the house and going to work. ""Whenever I hear the sound of a vehicle, rickshaw, or a tyre bursting, I run away, thinking it is an explosion. Despite my efforts, I cannot get rid of the fear in my mind. My family has taken me to a psychiatrist twice, but it has not helped,"" shared Gulzar.
Gulzar's experience is not an isolated case. With the alarming increase in terrorist activity over the past few years, more and more people directly impacted by extremist atrocities are stuck in a cycle of trauma. According to data obtained by The Express Tribune, in 2022, 200 incidents of terrorism were reported in K-P and the tribal areas, while in 2023, 560 incidents of terrorism occurred.
In 2022, a total of 83 police officers and 96 soldiers were martyred, while in 2023, 167 police officers and 101 soldiers were killed. These incidents include the Peshawar Police Lines blast, the suicide attack on the Peshawar Kocha Risaldar Mosque and the explosion at a public meeting in Bajaur. In 2023, cases of terrorism witnessed a surge of about 70 per cent in K-P and the tribal areas, while 2024, saw a further 20 per cent increase in such incidents, with 630 incidents reported throughout the year.
Talking about the impact of terrorism on the quality of life, Professor Dr Jamil Chitrali, Chairman of the Department of Peace and Conflict Studies at the University of Peshawar, revealed that in the past 20 years, 70,000 to 80,000 people have been killed in terrorist activity in Pakistan, out of which about 60,000 were civilians while 20,000 were personnel from the police, armed forces and other government agencies.
""The APS attack, Pipal Mandi and Khyber Bazar blasts were such big tragedies that it seems that people in every street of Peshawar have experiences their trauma. Unfortunately, however, there are only 500 mental health professionals in the country for a population of over 240 million. Until or unless there is a district-level rehab center for victims of terrorism and their families, these people will continue to suffer from despair, depression and psychological problems,"" implored Dr Chitrali.
Dr Uzma Ali, a clinical psychologist, told The Express Tribune that survivors of terrorism required clinical treatment and community support to deal with the post-traumatic stress disorder. ""Furthermore, the families of such victims also need counseling. People going through trauma should be supported by family, and relevant institutions such as health, social welfare, and the district administration. These victims should be considered under the Victim Support Program, which could help them cope with their trauma,"" said Dr Ali.

"CM, governor pay tribute to parents","SG
Call for greater recognition of parents as cornerstone of strong communities
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Governor Mohammed Kamran Khan Tessori paid tributes to parents on the occasion of the Global Day of Parents, recognising their invaluable sacrifices and enduring role in shaping the future of their children.
In his message, Chief Minister Shah stressed that the unconditional love and dedication of parents form the foundation of a child's successful and prosperous life. He said that parents often set aside their own desires and needs to ensure a better future for their children.
Highlighting the challenges posed by the rapidly evolving modern world, CM Shah remarked that contemporary development has created a lot of difficulties for parents. Referring to this year's United Nations theme for the day, he stressed the need to support parents with the resources necessary to raise and nurture the next generation. He reiterated the Sindh government's commitment to providing support for parents in their essential role within society.
Governor Tessori also expressed deep appreciation for the efforts and sacrifices made by parents. He stated that the success of children is often a direct result of their parents' guidance, prayers, and unwavering support. ""The Global Day of Parents serves as a reminder that respecting and valuing our parents is a fundamental duty of every individual,"" the governor said, urging people not to forget the contributions and sacrifices made by their parents.
Both leaders called for greater societal recognition and support for parents, underlining their role as the cornerstone of strong families and communities.

Rivalling ICJ,"XX
Keep in mind that BRI partners may be wary of arbitration on related projects at a Chinese-controlled venue.
The establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong last week marks a watershed in China's diplomatic ambitions. With 33 founding nations — including Pakistan, Indonesia, Belarus and Venezuela — and backing from 85 countries, the intergovernmental body is positioning itself as a rival to institutions such as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which critics often accuse of having a Western bias.
However, while China touts IOMed as a ""public good"" for peaceful dispute resolution, it is undeniable that its formation coincides with an era of increasing global polarisation between Western nations and China, which has accelerated due to the aggressive policies and frequent U-turns of US President Donald Trump. In fact, some analysts have said that the new organisation is a direct attempt to capitalise on the global power vacuum created by Trump's isolationist policies.
In a telling cultural flex, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi termed IOMed as a triumph of ""Chinese wisdom"" that transcends ""zero-sum mentalities"" through mediation. This, according to analysts, suggests that the focus will be on amicable solutions rather than straight 'win-lose' verdicts. The organisation will work like other international courts and tribunals, some of which already operate out of Hong Kong, as a forum for disputes between states, state-investor conflicts, and private international disputes.
However, the success of IOMed depends not on China and its allies, but the wider world. International courts can usually only arbitrate disputes between member states or companies and other entities that are subject to the laws of these states. IOMed will not be able to fully live up to its goals without widespread adoption, which is as much a political question as it is a legal one.
Keep in mind that BRI partners may be wary of arbitration on related projects at a Chinese-controlled venue. But if Beijing allows IOMed to be genuinely independent and can attract non-BRI countries, even without Western powers' involvement, the mediator could evolve into a legitimate alternative forum for international dispute settlement.

'Sinners' highlights Mississippi,"US
The horror film draws on history, religion and folklore
Clarksdale, Mississippi didn't just provide history and blues for director and writer Ryan Coogler's hit film about art, Jim Crow and vampires. One of the Mississippi Delta town's musicians contributed to the Sinners script, as reported by Reuters.
After a special screening in the town, which has no cinema, Coogler told the audience gathered in a community hall about the first time he described the film's plot to a group of Clarksdale blues musicians he had asked to contribute to the score.
He said he hesitated when he got to the part about the vampires. He went ahead. Then, Grammy winner Bobby Rush filled the silence.
""I had a girl once that was a vampire,"" the musician joked.
The line was given to Delta Slim, played by Delroy Lindo, a piano-playing character who brings both comic relief and depth to the movie.
Thursday's screening and discussion came after Tyler Yarbrough, a community organizer and film buff in Clarksdale, wrote an open letter asking Coogler and Warner Brothers to bring the film to a town where people drive 80 miles (130 km) to Memphis, Tennessee to get to a cinema.
Warner Brothers outfitted the Clarksdale Civic Auditorium with a big screen, projector and sound system. There was even popcorn.
Path to ancestors
Sinners has been widely acclaimed by reviewers and filmgoers, who praised the film for its stars' performances, its showcasing of African American art, and its wrestling with painful history and big ideas.
According to Variety, by the end of its opening month of April, Sinners had grossed $122.5 million in North America and $161.6 million worldwide.
At what was billed as a community screening, it was apparent the community was not just the geographical entity of Clarksdale. The audience came together around art and American history, including Jim Crow, the legal and often brutally policed racial hierarchy that subjugated Black people in America's South.
Shelby Simes arrived at 7 AM from nearby West Helena, Arkansas, earning first place in a line that had grown to hundreds by the time the doors opened about an hour before Thursday's 11 AM screening, the first of six scheduled over three days.
Simes said Coogler's film, which she had already seen seven times, was particularly important at a time when what many see as the truth about the Black American experience has been criticised by President Donald Trump as ""improper, divisive or anti-American ideology.""
""They're taking books off shelves,"" Simes said. ""They're not teaching us properly in the schools.""
She said with Sinners, which is fiction but offers a realistic portrayal of the Jim Crow era, Coogler and his team made the past tangible.
""I love how they were able to create a path to talk to our ancestors,"" she said, echoing the reaction of other Black viewers.
Apt genre
Michael Johansson, who has worked with community members to memorialise lynchings in the county where the University of Mississippi is located, said it made sense for Coogler to weave vampire folklore into his storyline.
""The horror genre is appropriate for the damage, the cruelty, the barbarism of what has been done to Blacks in this nation,"" said Johansson, who came from Jackson to see the film on Thursday.
Andrea Driver, who supports library sciences students at the University of Mississippi in Jackson, was touched on a personal level. She cried when she saw that a young character had survived horror and reached old age.
""He somehow carried that experience with him for years and didn't perish, didn't take his own life. I don't know that I could live with those memories my whole life,"" she said, saying it spoke to the experience of many Black Americans.
Poet C Liegh McInnis, who was born and raised in Clarksdale, noted the hometown audience recited the Lord's Prayer along with a character during a tense moment in the film.
He said Coogler had drawn from history, folklore and religion.
""I love the fact that Coogler gave us a three-dimensional film,"" he said.
Sinners is set at a time when Clarksdale was a bustling agricultural center in which Black residents were exploited. Many fled north, bringing the blues to cities such as Chicago and Kansas City.
While Coogler set his film in Clarksdale, he filmed it in neighboring Louisiana, in part because Mississippi lacked infrastructure such as the soundstages he needed.
Clarksdale Mayor Chuck Espy said the attention Sinners had brought could help revive his majority Black town of about 14,000, where 40% live under the poverty line. He hoped to capitalise on Clarksdale's status as a cultural capital by expanding performance and educational opportunities.
Coogler saw a future for Clarksdale because of the entrepreneurial spirit that led residents to reach out for Thursday's screening, and its cultural resources.
""The thing that you guys have is a thing that can't be taught,"" he said. Reuters

Pak weightlifters win 8 golds at Asian Masters Championship,"US
The PMWA were fielding 11 athletes who won 11 medals in total
Pakistani weightlifters grabbed eight gold medals, at the inaugural Asian Masters Weightlifting Championships that concluded in Doha on May 31.
The weightlifters bagged 11 medals in total.
This was a 100 percent result for Pakistan. The Pakistan Masters Weightlifting Association (PMWA) fielded a squad of 11 athletes, including three women.
The championship was featuring 145 athletes from 25 countries, with the biggest contingent coming from Iran.
""It has been the best performance we could look for because we really couldn't predict the results as this was just the first edition of the Asian Masters Championships,"" the PMWA secretary Rashed Malik told this correspondent.
""We formed this association because we understand that our athletes and the country need international events, so we can participate in them and also host them and that adds to the economy of the country as well.
""But mostly, we are independent of the Pakistan Olympic Association, the Pakistan Weightlifting Federation, etc.
""Our body is affiliated with the International Masters Weightlifting Association, which used to be a part of the International Weightlifting Federation but after the mutual understanding and the consent of the main world body, the new organisation was formed to help the weightlifters who were retired, or veterans, or who are 30-years and above to compete.
""Because there have been many cases where weightlifters ended up dying young as they were not getting the activity they needed once they left the professional sphere.""
Currently, the PMWA is in the process of getting affiliation with the Pakistan Sports Board and the ministry.
Meanwhile, the resounding success of the athletes will only help further the cause.
Among women, Sybil Sohail won the gold medal in 59 Kg.
Nadia Maqsood (87 Kg category) was also declared the best women's weightlifter of the 1st Asian Masters Weightlifting Championships with another gold medal for Pakistan.
Among men, Rasheed Khan won the gold medal in 89 Kg.
Kashif Rehan was declared the winner in M-45 102 Kg. Maqsood Amjad Rathore was the gold medallist in 96 kg, and Furqan Anwar was the winner of the 89 Kg M-30 category.
Muhammad Iqbal won the gold medal in the 102 Kg M-35 event, and Umer Rasool Lone got the title of the 96 Kg M-35 category.
The remaining two athletes received bronze medals, Abdul Malik in the 109 Kg M-50 event and Usman Amjad Rathore in the 109 Kg M-35 category.
Malik also emphasised that PMWA athletes, like those from Balochistan, get the chance to compete again as they are often left behind due to systemic issues in Pakistani sport.

Help accident victims without fear of legal trouble: IG,"US
After tragic death of SZABIST professor, Memon asks citizens to act rather than be silent witnesses
Inspector General of Sindh Police Ghulam Nabi Memon has expressed deep concern over the public's failure to assist SZABIST Assistant Professor Iftikhar Ahmed after a tragic road accident in the Shrafi Goth area of Malir.
The incident, captured on mobile phone videos that later circulated on social media, showed the victim trapped beneath a trailer, receiving no immediate aid from bystanders.
According to a statement issued by police spokesperson Syed Saad Ali, IG Memon said that a valuable life could have been saved had the injured professor received timely medical attention. ""Helping accident victims is not just a humanitarian act - it is a moral, legal, and religious obligation for every citizen,"" the IG stated.
He emphasized that excessive bleeding, critical injuries, and unnecessary delays often result in fatalities that could otherwise be prevented. ""Do not let the fear of legal complications stop you from helping,"" he urged. ""Saving one life is like saving all of humanity - this is not just a good deed, it is an act of faith.""
The IG further stated that remaining passive or silent in the face of such emergencies is unacceptable. ""Every life matters. Step up and act - don't be a silent witness,"" he said.
Assuring full support from law enforcement and civic agencies, he said that citizens who help the injured are heroes and will be treated with respect and protection. ""Police and civil agencies cannot fulfill their responsibilities without the active support of the public,"" he added. ""Even a small effort can save a life - so take that step without hesitation.""
The statement comes after viral footage showed Professor Iftikhar Ahmed trapped between the wheels of a trailer following an accident. The lack of immediate help sparked widespread outrage and prompted this public appeal from the province's top cop.

Railways privatisation hits low-income commuters,"BE
The outsourcing of 11 more trains risks impacting the affordability of inter-city travel
In a latest development, Pakistan Railways has initiated the process of outsourcing 11 more trains, which will now operate under the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model. Critics, however, have argued that the move overtly aimed at improving railway services might actually be a ticket to exclusion for the low-income passengers relying heavily on cheap modes of inter-city transportation.
While railway officials claim that outsourcing will improve the quality of services, civil society representatives have expressed deep concerns over the move, which may lead to increased fares, creating difficulties for the underprivileged masses. It is worth noting that railway travel in Pakistan is still considered a popular mode of cheap transportation for the poor and middle-class groups. According to estimates, around 100,000 people travel daily by trains, mostly on major railway routes between Karachi and various cities in Punjab.
A passenger, Muhabbat Ali, who frequently travelled from Larkana to Karachi on the Mohenjo-Daro Express, revealed that although various bus operators were operating on this route, he preferred traveling by train due to the reasonable fare and comparatively comfortable journey.
Malik Tanveer Awan, a Karachi-based employee, revealed that he frequently travelled to Punjab by train. ""While a slight fare increase may not affect salaried individuals, even a minor fare hike could seriously impact labourers who travel from Punjab to Karachi for work. Pakistan Railways should reserve some economy coaches on PPP trains with no fare hike, ensuring affordability for low-income passengers,"" requested Awan.
According to sources of The Express Tribune, Pakistan Railways currently operates a total of 47 trains, of which 11 have already been outsourced, while 11 more are being offered for public-private operation. According to Pakistan Railways administration, the trains being outsourced include Bolan Mail (Karachi to Quetta), Hazara Express (Karachi to Havelian), Khushhal Khan Khattak Express (Karachi to Peshawar), Bahawal Din Zakariya Express (Karachi to Multan), Shalimar Express (Karachi to Lahore), Musa Pak Express (Dera Ghazi Khan to Lahore), Thal Express (Multan to Rawalpindi), Mehran Express (Karachi to Mirpurkhas), Mohenjo Daro Passenger (Kotri to Rohri) and Rawalpindi Express (Havelian to Rawalpindi).
According to Zahid Farooq, an urban planning expert at the Urban Resource Centre (URC), trains are still a preferred mode of transportation for the labour class therefore, any increase in fares will disproportionately affect this segment. ""Pakistan Railways' decision to hand over more trains to private operators will gradually reduce government control over railways. As a result, the government will not be able to provide relief to the public in the future by running special trains on holidays or reducing fares on special occasions. Therefore, handing over trains to private operators is not the correct way of improving the railways' services,"" said Farooq, while suggesting that the government may increase its railway revenue by reviving cargo services.
Hamid Qureshi, Divisional Commercial Officer (DCO) of Pakistan Railways in Karachi, told The Express Tribune that under the PPP model, fare increases of more than 10 per cent were not permitted. ""Therefore, only a minor fare increase may be expected, but in return, passenger services will be improved. PPP trains are equipped with water dispensers and Wi-Fi; amenities not commonly available in regular trains,"" claimed Qureshi.

Cattle prices surge by up to 70%,"PL
Sacrificial animals' traders cite soaring costs; buyers decry lack of govt oversight
With Eidul Azha just around the corner, the sale of sacrificial animals has gathered pace across the metropolitan city, with markets seeing an uptick in activity. However, buyers are facing steep price hikes, with the cost of sacrificial animals surging by 50 to 70 per cent compared to last year.
In various cattle markets of the metropolis, the starting price for goats is now around Rs40,000, while heifers - regardless of weight - are hardly available for less than Rs140,000. Last year, a low-weight heifer could still be purchased for under Rs100,000 were now fetching Rs200,000 or more.
Buyers are increasingly frustrated at the lack of official regulation in animal pricing. Traders are setting prices arbitrarily, leaving buyers to negotiate deals through bargaining.
Traders attribute the increase in prices to several factors, including the rising cost of animal feed, transportation, and other logistical expenses. ""The cost of fodder alone has surged by over 50 per cent,"" Kashif Qureshi, a trader, told The Express Tribune. He added that animals are bought from larger markets in Punjab and Sindh, and medium-sized traders then transport them to Karachi - incurring fuel, tax, and miscellaneous expenses.
""The total cost accumulates through various stages - purchasing from big traders, transportation to Karachi, and maintenance at the local markets, including lighting and security,"" Qureshi added. ""Only after accounting for all these factors do traders add their margin, which can range from Rs15,000 to Rs50,000 for smaller animals and Rs50,000 to Rs200,000 or more for larger animals.""
Traders say that the pricing of animals is also influenced by breed, appearance, and weight. ""While 13 government-designated cattle markets operate in Karachi, animals are also being sold informally in various neighbourhoods,"" said another trader, Arif Qureshi.
He explained that cows, heifers, and camels are among the large animals available, but due to the current price surge, many middle-income families are struggling to afford them. Heifers of average weight are now selling between Rs200,000 and Rs300,000, while heavier, premium animals are priced between Rs400,000 and Rs1 million. Elite buyers are purchasing high-end animals ranging from Rs1.2 million to Rs2 million or more.
As Eidul Azha nears, buyers are increasingly visiting the markets during evening and nighttime hours, typically seeking medium-sized heifers for around Rs200,000. Most animals are sourced from various districts across Punjab.
In the goat market, prices have also risen sharply. Saifuddin, a goat trader, told The Express Tribune that medium-weight goats that were previously sold for Rs30,000 to Rs35,000 are now priced at Rs50,000 to Rs60,000. The starting price for goats is around Rs40,000, with some reaching up to Rs300,000, depending on breed and build.
Rams and sheep are similarly priced, ranging from Rs40,000 to Rs200,000 or more. Their valuation is also driven by factors such as weight, breed, and appearance, according to trader Rashid Saleem.
Camel trader Ibrahim Din spoke about a growing trend in camel sacrifices over the past two years, though it remains relatively limited. He said camels brought in from different districts of Sindh now cost Rs300,000 and above.
Karachiites have voiced their concern over the sharp rise in prices. Saeed-ul-Zafar from Nazimabad said the same heifer he purchased for Rs150,000 last year cost him Rs240,000 this time. ""There needs to be a government-regulated pricing mechanism for sacrificial animals,"" he urged.
Similarly, Asif Abbasi from Saddar criticised the lack of oversight, saying, ""Traders are charging arbitrary prices. I bought a goat for Rs60,000 this year, which cost me just Rs35,000 last Eid.""
With no formal pricing framework in place, people are left to navigate the inflated market through direct negotiations with traders - hoping to uphold the tradition of sacrifice amidst economic challenges.

Bangladesh SC restores Jamaat-e-Islami,"US
Dhaka replaces ousted PM's father portrait from banknotes
Bangladesh on Sunday restored the registration of the largest Islamist party, allowing it to take part in elections, more than a decade after it was removed under the now-overthrown government.
The Supreme Court overturned a cancellation of Jamaat-e-Islami's registration, allowing it to be formally listed as a political party with the Election Commission.
""The Election Commission is directed to deal with the registration of that party in accordance with law,"" commission lawyer Towhidul Islam told AFP.
Jamaat-e-Islami party lawyer, Shishir Monir, said the Supreme Court's decision would allow a ""democratic, inclusive and multi-party system"" in the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people.
""We hope that Bangladeshis, regardless of their ethnicity or religious identity, will vote for Jamaat, and that the parliament will be vibrant with constructive debates,"" Monir told journalists.
After Sheikh Hasina was ousted as prime minister in August, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 high court order banning it.
Sunday's decision comes after the Supreme Court on May 27 overturned a conviction against a key leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, A.T.M. Azharul Islam.
Hasina banned Jamaat-e-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.
In May, Bangladesh's interim government banned the Awami League, pending the outcome of a trial over its crackdown on mass protests that prompted her ouster last year.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh on Sunday issued new banknotes to replace designs featuring its founding president, the father of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina who was overthrown last year.
""Under the new series and design, the notes will not feature any human portraits, but will instead showcase natural landscapes and traditional landmarks,"" Bangladesh Bank spokesman Arif Hossain Khan told AFP.
Among the designs in the Muslim-majority nation are images of Hindu and Buddhist temples, as well as historical palaces.
They also include artwork of the late painter Zainul Abedin, depicting the Bengal famine during British colonial rule.
On Sunday, notes for three of the nine different denominations were released.
""The new notes will be issued from the central bank's headquarters, and later from its other offices across the country,"" he added.
""The other denominations of the notes with new designs will be released in phases"".
Existing notes and coins will remain in circulation alongside the new notes.
It is not the first time that the design has changed to reflect changing politics.

In a historic public Jirga held in Kabal, Swat, Chairman of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) and Member of the National Assembly, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, announced a nationwide movement to be launched after Eid-ul-Azha, aimed at restoring constitutional order and democratic integrity under the Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Ayeen Pakistan.
He delivered a forceful and impassioned speech addressing Pakistan's political turmoil, constitutional challenges, and the plight of the Pashtun people.
Speaking before a large crowd under the banner of TTAP Achakzai, who also is its president, emphasized that Pakistan's survival depends on the supremacy of its Constitution. ""There can be no compromise on constitutional rule,"" he declared.
He underscored the Pashtun people's right to control their resources, drawing a comparison with global nationalist sentiments. ""If Trump can say 'America First,' we too can say 'Pashtun First,'"" he stated, clarifying that the demand is rooted in both international law and Islamic principles.
Achakzai rejected any form of subjugation, asserting, ""We are not asking for separation, but we will not accept slavery.""
He decried the portrayal of Pashtuns as extremists, pointing to the community's suffering from both global conflicts and flawed state policies. He likened their struggle to that of Palestinians and Kurds, criticizing historical and ongoing divisions imposed by colonial and state authorities.
The veteran politician condemned the state's economic policies, particularly the handing over of local resources to foreign investors under the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), and slammed the February 2024 elections as ""blatantly rigged,"" alleging large-scale vote manipulation.

Climate debt unpaid,"US
The UN report indicates that agriculture is the most vulnerable sector to climate change
The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) recently released a Global Assessment Report highlighting a dramatic surge of over 150% in annual direct disaster costs between the periods 1970-2000 and 2001-2020. A broader assessment of total economic losses, including indirect impacts, now exceeds an astonishing $2.3 trillion.
Despite these alarming numbers, the current trajectory of global climate action and disaster risk reduction foretells an even bleaker picture of the future. Currently, the international community only spends 2% of its development aid on disaster risk reduction, setting the stage for short-term financial reprieve but a worsened crisis in the longer run. Major climate disasters – earthquakes, floods, storms, droughts and heatwaves – will only increase in frequency and intensity, and an escalation is already being observed in the global arena.
The UN report indicates that agriculture is the most vulnerable sector to climate change, owing to extended droughts and heatwaves. This is particularly alarming for Pakistan, often ranked among countries most vulnerable to climate change, with over 40% of its labour force employed in the agricultural sector.
Countries like Pakistan with low- and lower-middle-income economies face disproportionate climate impacts and mounting losses, while wealthy countries contributing most to global warming remain free of liability. The US, the UK, EU and China are reportedly the largest climate polluters but promises for climate reparations have time and again fallen short.
In 2009, developed countries pledged $100 billion annually in climate reparations. After failing to meet the target, they repeated the promise in 2020 and again in 2023, yet it remains unfulfilled. These reparations are not only essential to offset climate disaster losses, but also to address the legacy of colonial plundering that left underdeveloped nations ill-equipped to face global warming.
Without urgent, accountable action from wealthy nations, the global climate crisis risks greater losses and even greater injustice.

SC calls for mediation first in litigation,"US
Judges, lawyers urged to identify mediation-worthy cases early on
The Supreme Court has called for embracing a pro-mediation approach across the judiciary, particularly at the earliest stages of litigation.
In a detailed four-page order authored by Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, the top court stressed the importance of sensitising judges and lawyers to identify cases appropriate for mediation and to ensure their timely referral.
""Judges and lawyers must be sensitised to identify cases fit for mediation and facilitate their referral in a timely manner. Litigants, likewise, should be encouraged to consider mediation and other methods of alternative dispute resolution as a first resort, rather than a last recourse,"" the order states.
The directive came during the hearing of a family dispute that the court, on March 15, referred to mediation. Sara Tarrar, an advocate of the high court and an accredited mediator notified by the Law and Justice Division under the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017, was appointed as the mediator.
According to the order, both parties actively participated in the mediation process and ultimately reached a settlement. Tarrar submitted her report, along with a copy of the settlement agreement dated May 5, 2025, which was officially recorded by the court.
Counsel for both sides requested that a decree be issued in line with the agreed settlement.
A three-member bench of the apex court, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, heard the matter. The case involved a challenge to a family court decision that had increased monthly maintenance for each daughter from Rs30,000 to Rs150,000, in addition to educational expenses. The father had contested the order in appellate courts, where his case was dismissed. He later approached the SC in June 2021.
After remaining pending for more than three and a half years, the bench finally referred the matter to mediation, leading to a successful resolution.
In its order, the SC underlined that mediation was ""not merely an alternative to litigation; it is a paradigm shift in dispute resolution, built on the principles of collaboration, confidentiality, and party autonomy"".
Unlike traditional litigation, the order said, mediation empowers parties to shape the outcomes of their disputes through neutral facilitation rather than adversarial judgment.
""It offers a nonadversarial framework that empowers parties to shape the outcome of their own disputes, guided by a neutral facilitator rather than a judicial determination."" The order highlighted several advantages of mediation, including cost-effectiveness, speed, reduced burden on the judiciary and greater privacy for the disputing parties. Its informal setting fosters open dialogue and solution-focused negotiation.
""The flexibility of the process allows parties to explore creative, interest-based solutions that a court of law may not be empowered to grant,"" the order notes. ""These benefits were remarkably evident in the present case. What years of litigation could not resolve, mediation achieved within weeks.""
The court observed that earlier recourse to mediation often results in substantial savings of time and cost, reduces emotional tolls and helps restore relationships.
The order cited the statutory framework established under the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act, 2017, and further supported by various provincial legislations.
In addition, the ADR Mediation Accreditation (Eligibility) Rules, 2023 and Mediation Practice Direction (Civil) Rules, 2023, have consolidated mediation's place in the judicial landscape as a mainstream tool for dispute resolution.

"Ringleader, accomplice killed in 'encounter'","US
Senior police officers arrived at the scene following the incident
The ringleader of a gang involved in robbing overseas Pakistanis was killed along with an accomplice during a police encounter, while other members of the gang managed to escape on Chak Beli Road in the jurisdiction of Chauntra police station.
According to the police, the gang would impersonate police and law enforcement officials to carry out their crimes. The gang leader, Amjad Saeed, along with his accomplices, had recently committed a robbery in the Mandra area.
When police received information about the incident, they responded swiftly, prompting the accused to flee. During the pursuit, the fleeing accused opened fire on the police team. In the ensuing exchange of gunfire, gang leader Amjad Saeed and his accomplice Darwaiz were killed.
Senior police officers arrived at the scene following the incident and launched a manhunt to arrest the fleeing accused by setting up blockades.
A police spokesperson said that the gang had been involved in dozens of reported and unreported robberies targeting overseas Pakistanis in Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, and other cities. The gang members would conduct surveillance at airports and then follow their targets on highways, often using uniforms of police or other LEAs.

President urges unity among coalition partners,"US
Zardari, Shehbaz discuss foreign ties, security and upcoming budget
President Asif Ali Zardari has stressed the need for political unity among coalition partners, suggesting that the government adopt a collective approach in the national interest during his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called on President Asif Ali Zardari at the Governor House in Lahore on Sunday, where discussions ranged from the prevailing political and security situation in the country, to recent engagements with friendly countries, as well as climate change.
The meeting was attended by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan and Senator Saleem Mandviwala.
The participants also reviewed the outcomes of the prime minister's recent visits to friendly nations and their significance for Pakistan's foreign relations.
The discussion also touched upon the importance of coordination and cooperation among political allies, underscoring the need for unity in the current political landscape.
President Zardari, while highlighting the importance of public welfare, urged the government to take practical and impactful measures in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man.
""The government must take measures in the upcoming budget to provide relief to the common man,"" the president stressed.
He further reiterated the need for unity among coalition partners, stating: ""Political allies need to move forward together in the national interest.""
It is pertinent to mention that Zardari has been staying in the provincial metropolis since last weekend. Initially, it was disclosed that he was here only for the match, following which he would stay a day or two in Lahore before flying back.
A day earlier, two different party sources revealed that the president had been hosted by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, during which Governor Sardar Saleem Haider was also present. However, there was no official confirmation from either side.
Several other party leaders claimed they were not aware of last week's meeting, but observed a slight shift in the PPP's posturing towards the PML-N, noting that ""our criticism against Maryam and her team was not as harsh as it once was"".
Party insiders hope that the meeting will strengthen ties between the two parties in Punjab, providing their leaders with access to the provincial budget.

Army will crush all threats: COAS,"PK
Field Marshal Munir addresses Grand Jirga in Quetta; Says India behind terror networks; Warns nefarious attempts fail
Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has said that the Pakistan Army remains fully alert and prepared to respond decisively to any threat and reiterates that peace in Balochistan is non-negotiable and that the future of Pakistan is directly linked to a stable and prosperous Balochistan.
While interacting with tribal elders during a Grand Jirga at the Zehri Auditorium in Quetta, the chief of the army staff lauded the bravery and resilience of security forces and the law-enforcement personnel operating in Balochistan, said a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office on Sunday.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Munir jointly addressed the Jirga, which was organised to interact with the tribal leadership and discuss the evolving security situation in Balochistan, with particular focus on the ongoing proxy war fuelled by India.
""This Indian sponsored proxy war is no longer hidden, it is an open malicious act of terrorism waged on our people, our progress, and our peace. We have concrete proof of India's hand behind terrorist networks operating in Balochistan,"" Field Marshal Munir said.
""These nefarious attempts of the enemy will fail. The Pakistan Army, with the unwavering support of the nation and the brave Baloch people, will confront and crush every enemy, foreign or domestic, that dares to challenge our sovereignty.""
On the occasion, Prime Minister Shehbaz highlighted that Indian-sponsored proxies operating in Balochistan had intensified their efforts to undermine peace, destabilise the province, and disrupt development initiatives led by the government and the armed forces.
He said that terrorist groups like the Fitna al-Hindustan sought support of the locals which must be denied to them. He stressed the need for engaging at the grassroots level and ensuring that terrorists found no social space.
Praising the leadership and constructive role of the elders, Shehbaz reiterated that denying social space to terrorists was crucial for the success of counter-terrorism efforts and for the long-term peace and stability. He vowed that the enemies of peace would find no space to operate within Pakistan.
""Our message to them is clear: the government, armed forces, the LEAs and the administrative apparatus,"" with the complete support of the people, would take the fight against terrorism to its logical conclusion and defeat terrorism in a decisive manner.
Highlighting a series of monumental developmental packages for prosperity in Balochistan, the prime minister emphasised the need to ensure that people at the grassroots level benefited from the government's initiatives.
He praised the people of Balochistan for their historic role in safeguarding the national unity and urged them to remain vigilant against foreign-backed subversion and sabotage orchestrated and sponsored by India.
Prime Minister Shehbaz and Field Marshal Munir lauded the bravery and resilience of security forces and the LEAs operating in Balochistan. Shehbaz assured the families of Shuhada of full cooperation and support, and vowed that terrorists, their abettors, and facilitators would not be spared.
The Jirga concluded with a unanimous pledge from tribal elders to stand shoulder to shoulder with the government of Pakistan and the armed forces, reaffirming their commitment to the security, stability, and development of Balochistan, the statement said.
Earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz visited the Command and Staff College in Quetta and addressed Students and Faculty of the college. His address reflected the government's commitment to strengthening Pakistan's defence institutions amid the evolving regional and internal security dynamics.
Shehbaz underscored the importance of professional excellence, operational readiness, and strategic foresight in the face of emerging and hybrid threats, especially in sensitive regions like Balochistan, where Indian sponsored proxies target ""our people and aim to disrupt our progress and prosperity"".

Pindi's cinema era fades into history,"US
With demolition of Rose Cinema, city's cultural heartbeat comes to silent end
With the recent demolition of the iconic Rose Cinema, established in 1926 during the British era, Rawalpindi has witnessed the symbolic end of a vibrant chapter in its cultural and cinematic history.
Once a hallmark of the city's thriving film scene from the 1960s to the early 2000s, the destruction of this nearly century-old cinema marks the final blow to the city's once-flourishing film industry.
Located in the heart of the city near Raja Bazaar, Rose Cinema was built on land donated by a wealthy Hindu philanthropist, Bhimas Ram.
Adjacent to the District Headquarters Hospital, the cinema was conceived with a clear purpose: to provide accessible entertainment to labourers and workers from the surrounding 30 wholesale markets and trade centres after a hard day's work.
It succeeded for over four decades, particularly as a hub for Punjabi films, drawing large crowds of working-class moviegoers. It was not just a place of entertainment but a cultural landmark, often enjoying ""sold-out weeks"" with massive queues for tickets.
At its peak, Rawalpindi boasted 24 cinema houses. These included notable names such as Naz, Shabistan, Gulistan, Kahkashan, Shaheen, PAF, Moti Mahal, Rialto, and Sangeet along the Faizabad-Marrir Chowk route.
In the inner city, cinemas like Nadir, Khursheed, Rose, Nishat, Imperial, Taj Mahal, and Novelty thrived, while Saddar was home to Ciros, Odeon, Plaza, and Capital. In other areas, there were Tasveer Mahal in Lalkurti, and Rex, Garrison, and Qasim Cinema near the Qasim Airbase in Dhamial.
For decades, these cinemas offered more than just films. They supported a parallel economy, offering part-time jobs to thousands. After their day jobs, people would run food stalls, manage ticket counters, or work security. Cinema projectionists held full-time positions, and skilled artists hand-painted film posters and signboardsan art that has now vanished.
In parallel, Rawalpindi's Liaquat Hall, a grand auditorium in Liaquat Bagh, served as the epicentre of theatrical performances. Securing a slot there was considered a guaranteed success for any stage production.
Iconic performers like Moin Akhtar, Qavi Khan, Masood Akhtar, Roohi Bano, Agha Talish, Umer Sharif, and Ismail Tara brought the stage to life, often drawing family audiences in large numbers. Women made up the majority of attendees during the golden years of family-oriented stage dramas.
However, as the years went by, things began to unravel. Crass humour and vulgar dialogues alienated families, who once formed the backbone of the theatre audience.
The advent of VCRs, the flood of international dramas, social media, and a decline in film quality gradually pushed cinemas and stage plays into obscurity. Once a thriving industry with long booking queues for new film releases and stage shows, Rawalpindi now finds itself devoid of any meaningful cinema culture.
Of the original 24 cinemas, nine have been converted into commercial plazas, four into wedding halls, seven are permanently closed, and four have been demolishedawaiting new construction. The art of painting movie billboards, once a proud tradition, has also disappeared.
Today, only a few cinemas remain, occasionally hosting stage plays, most of which fade quickly due to lack of quality and interest. With the fall of Rose Cinema, Rawalpindi's cinematic legacy has, in many ways, reached its final scene.

Four TTP men neutralised in DG Khan,"US
The police later surrounded the terrorists and launched an operation
Punjab Police on Sunday carried out a major operation against operatives of outlawed TTP in DG Khan and killed four alleged terrorists.
According to a statement, police received intelligence about the movement of terrorists at Daulat Wala Mor, located in Kot Mubarak, a border area between Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The terrorists were reportedly setting up illegal checkpoints in the area.
Later, Punjab Police and its Elite Force teams swiftly moved in, while commandant of Border Military Police, Asad Khan Chandia, sealed entry routes into the tribal area.
The police later surrounded the terrorists and launched an operation, during which intense exchange of fire took place. The TTP operatives, heavily armed, attacked police teams, but Punjab Police responded ""with timely and effective action, foiling their nefarious plans"".
In the operation, four TTP men were killed, while several others were injured.
According to the Punjab Police spokesperson, the remaining terrorists used the cover of darkness, bushes and dunes to flee the scene. Police recovered weapons and explosives from the possession of the deceased terrorists. A search and sweep operation is ongoing in the area following the encounter.
President Asif Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to law enforcement agencies for ""eliminating four Khawarij during an operation in DG Khan"".

Navigating towards sustainable growth,"PK
While economy has averted crisis, growth forecasts remain subdued
In this article, I offer some insights into Pakistan's current economic trajectory and the challenges that lie ahead. This review highlights key areas such as growth, stability, inflation, tax policies and fiscal discipline, providing a nuanced understanding of the nation's economic health.
Over the past three years, Pakistan's economy has shown resilience, moving from a state of high inflation and low growth to a phase of low inflation and recovery. While the economy has averted a crisis, growth forecasts remain subdued. This transition signifies a move in the right direction but also indicates that sustained efforts are required to achieve robust and lasting growth.
The subdued forecasts suggest underlying structural issues that need to be addressed for more optimistic projections. The country's journey from near-collapse to a recovery mode is a testament to its resilience but also a reminder of the vulnerabilities that persist.
Stability and C/A dynamics
Pakistan's current account has achieved stability, a crucial development for maintaining economic equilibrium. However, this stability hinges on timely rollovers and meeting export and remittance targets. Dependence on external factors for maintaining stability highlights potential risks and uncertainties. Any disruptions in these areas could destabilise the economy.
In the short term, uncertainties around the Trump Tariff remain one possible source, though it can also trigger opportunities. In the medium term, continued access to the EU market in the wake of India-EU free trade agreement (FTA) should remain an important goal. Diversifying sources of income and enhancing domestic productivity are vital to ensure long-term stability and reduce reliance on external aid and remittances.
Inflation and monetary policy
The headline inflation has declined significantly, but overall price levels have not followed suit. Core inflation, which is almost 9%, continues to be the linchpin of monetary policy, indicating the challenge of managing inflationary pressures.
The reduction in headline inflation is encouraging, but the persistence of high price levels suggests underlying structural issues in the economy. Managing core inflation requires a multifaceted approach that addresses demand-side and supply-side constraints.
Furthermore, transparent and data-driven monetary policies are crucial for maintaining public confidence and ensuring economic stability. A reduction in interest rate from 22% to 12% is a significant positive development and private sector credit has started to increase.
Tax policies and tariffs reform
Pakistan's tax policy is undergoing positive changes with the expansion of the tax net to more sectors. However, tax rates remain ""punitively high."" The government's intention to abolish the non-filers category is a step in the right direction, however, half of the current tax filers do not contribute anything. This structural problem of tax collection needs to be addressed to maximise revenue.
Customs tariff reforms have also been initiated, indicating a broader effort to overhaul the tax system. Reducing tax rates while broadening the base could stimulate economic activity and increase overall tax revenue. The tax structure has significant implications for businesses, investments and overall economic activity.
Fiscal discipline, public expenses
Historically, the actual current expenditures have surpassed budgeted levels, while development spending has fallen short. Currently, the fiscal trajectory aligns with the budget, which is a positive development. Public expenditures on subsidies have declined from 16.2% in 2022 to 7.2% in 2024, indicating a more focused approach to resource allocation.
Defence expenditures have also seen a reduction, falling from 22% to 12.4% of total expenditures, though a substantial increase is imminent. However, the increasing gap between budgeted and actual expenditures on the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) is concerning. Efficient allocation of funds can significantly boost economic growth.
Revenue losses, tax evasion
On the upside, almost Rs9 trillion is stuck in the system and even a partial recovery can bring dividends without burdening the existing taxpayers.
The Tax Expenditure Report 2024 indicates a revenue loss of Rs3,879 billion due to tax concessions and exemptions. Income tax, sales tax and customs duty losses are substantial, highlighting significant gaps in tax collection. Additionally, the annual tax revenue loss due to illicit trade is estimated at Rs750 billion. Furthermore, Rs4,457 billion in tax revenue is stuck in over 100,000 court cases. Addressing these issues is critical for increasing government revenue and improving the fiscal health. The government needs to strengthen tax enforcement, streamline legal processes and formalise the undocumented economy.
Conclusion
The budget 2025-26 presents an opening. While progress has been made in certain areas, significant challenges remain. The government must focus on maintaining stability, controlling inflation, reforming the tax system and ensuring fiscal discipline. Addressing tax evasion and the undocumented economy is also crucial for enhancing revenue collection. These efforts will pave the way for sustainable economic growth and prosperity. The nation's ability to navigate these economic challenges effectively will determine its future trajectory.

Islamic state and the Muslim world,"US
There was an enormous cultural difference between the members of these two communities.
What is an Islamic state? This is a question that has been asked ever since the founding of the religion by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). As I will discuss later, this question has been answered in several different ways in different parts of the Muslim world.
Most recently, the question has become important as the various factions and leadership groups in Syria are attempting to establish a state that would serve its highly diverse population. What happens to Syria is likely to affect the rest of the Muslim world.
I should perhaps start with what Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan's founding father, had in mind when he campaigned for the establishment of Pakistan, a country in which the large majority of the citizenship would follow the Islamic faith. Was Jinnah creating an Islamic state or a country in which the large majority of the citizens would follow the Islamic faith?
He had an answer to this question in the much-quoted address delivered on August 11, 1947, three days before being sworn in as Pakistan's first Governor General. He made it clear that he had worked hard not to create an Islamic state but a state in which most Muslims of the British Indian colony would be able to live their lives as Muslims, not subject to the wishes of the Hindu majority that would greatly outnumber the Muslim subjects.
There was an enormous cultural difference between the members of these two communities. To illustrate this point, Jinnah is reported to have said that ""whereas Hindus worship the animal cow, Muslims eat it.""
In the countless meetings Jinnah had with the British leaders who had been instructed by the government in London to take India towards independence, he pressed this point and managed to convince the departing British that the best way for the two religious communities would be to let them have their own countries in which they would follow their own ways.
If Pakistan were to be created he did not suggest that it would be an Islamic state; only a country where the Muslim community could live comfortably not fearing intrusion by the majority Hindu population.
At the time the British handed over power to the successor states of India and Pakistan, their colony's population was estimated at 400 million people. Of these, one fourth or 100 million were Muslims. Of the Muslim population, 75 million became Pakistanis and 25 million stayed bank in India.
However, those who were to become Pakistanis would live in two parts, East and West Pakistan separated by a thousand miles of Indian territory. This was not a viable solution to what the British had called the ""India's Mussalman problem"". In December 1971, after a bitterly fought civil war, East Pakistan became the independent state of Bangladesh.
The people of Pakistan had to wait 70 years before they saw the truth in Jinnah's strongly held views about the cultural differences between the large religious communities that lived together uncomfortably under the British rule. When Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in India after winning the elections of 2014,
Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist, led the devoted followers whose aim was to turn India into a Hindu nation. The BJP made it clear that the large Muslim minority by then estimated to number 200 million – eight times its size in 1947 – could not be treated as equal to the large Hindu majority. Modi also began to work to change the name of India to Bharat.
There was logic in this move since the name India applied by the British rulers of the land they governed was named for the River Indus, one of the longest rivers in the world. It originated in the high plateau of Tibet and then flowed into Pakistan, not touching India. After moving through Pakistan it emptied into the Indian Ocean, through a large delta not far from the Indian border but not located in India.
I will go briefly into the history of Islamic states in the Muslim world. The first Islamic state was in the Arabian city of Medina to which the Prophet (peace be upon him) went after conveying the messages sent to him by God to preach to the Meccans. These came in the form of revelations in the Koran. In my fairly extensive readings on early Muslim history, I have found the book, The First Muslim, by Leslie Hazelton to be especially revealing.
According to her, the concept of al-Shura consists of the following four elements: One, selection of a leader to guide the discussion about Islamic governance. This leader was usually called the caliph. Two, all members of the community are given the opportunity to express their opinions. Three, the basic discussion should be to define public interest. Four, the majority opinion should be accepted as long as it does not violate the teachings of the Koran and Sunnah.
Muslim scholars of Islam identify the following countries as providing different interpretation of Islamic statehood. Brunei is an absolute Islamic monarchy, with the constitution of 1959 adopting Islam as the official religion. Iran's 1979 revolution led to the adoption of the doctrine of Imamate which initially allowed political rule by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) or one his true successors.
The current supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is now the imam. Saudi Arabia leadership has declared the Koran and the Sunnah to be the official constitution of the country. The Taliban rulers of Afghanistan claim to have followed Saudi Arabia by declaring the Koran and the Sunnah to be the ultimate basis of governance. But the way they govern is not envisioned in the holy books of Islam.
Nowhere do the Islamic scriptures downgrade the status of women to the level to which they have been brought down by the governance structure in Afghanistan. The governing Taliban have gone to the extent of totally isolating women. They are not allowed to go to schools and educate themselves. They can't venture out unless they are accompanied by a male member of their family.
There are other examples of nations moving towards extremism in other parts of the Muslim world. Turkey, for instance, became a secular state patterned after those in the West. Its then leader, Mustafa Kamal Ataturk, brought about radical changes in the way the country was governed. He went about to the extent of abandoning the Arabic script in favour of Romanising the language thus depriving the Turks the knowledge of their own history. Tayyip Erdogan, the current president of the country, is attempting to bring his country back to its traditions.

Kashmir settlement mandatory: CJCSC,"PK
General Mirza says India's weaponisation of water violates international law
Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has called for the urgent resolution of the Kashmir dispute between Pakistan and India, warning that continued tensions between the neighbours threatened regional peace and security.
Representing Pakistan at the 22nd Shangri-La Dialogue 2025 in Singapore, General Mirza stressed the need for active and effective dialogue frameworksbilateral, regional, and globalto prevent conflicts rather than responding to them after escalation.
""The resolution of the Kashmir dispute in line with UN Security Council resolutions is essential for lasting peace in South Asia,"" General Mirza said, describing the conflict as the ""root cause"" of enduring hostility between Pakistan and India.
The CJCSC criticised India's recent actions regarding water flow management, accusing New Delhi of attempting to weaponise the shared water resources. ""India's use of water as a weapon of war is a clear violation of international law,"" he said.
""Any attempt to block or divert Pakistan's waters will be considered an act of war, in accordance with the Pakistan National Security Committee's policy,"" he warned. He reaffirmed that Pakistan was open to durable peace with India, but such a peace must be based on dignity, equality, and mutual respect.
General Mirza expressed concern over the absence of reliable crisis management structures, noting that the failure to act early often prevented the international community from intervening before tensions spiralled.
""The situation since the Pahalgam incident is endangering regional development. We need mutual restraint, recognition of red lines, and equilibrium to ensure durable peace,"" he said. He called on the world powers to help restore a formal dialogue mechanism between Pakistan and India, warning that the current vacuum increases the risk of miscalculation and escalation.

BD share tentative dates with PCB,"US
The Men in Green are scheduled to play three T20Is in July
The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has drafted the initial schedule and shared it with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
The T20I series will begin on July 20, with the second and third matches scheduled for July 22 and 24, respectively.
All three matches are set to be hosted at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Mirpur, Dhaka.
Pakistan's tour of Bangladesh is not part of the Future Tours Program (FTP). This series was agreed upon during discussions between senior officials of the PCB and BCB on the sidelines of the ICC Champions Trophy, which is scheduled to be hosted by Pakistan.
After the conclusion of the T20 series against Bangladesh, the Pakistan team will depart for the West Indies.
There, they will face the Caribbean side in a three-match T20I series beginning on July 31 in the United States. This will be followed by a One Day International (ODI) series against the West Indies as well.
Meanwhile, the third T20I between Pakistan and Bangladesh will be played on Sunday at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.
Shoriful Islam injured
Bangladesh fast bowler Shoriful Islam has been ruled out of the third and final T20I against Pakistan, scheduled for Sunday at Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium, after suffering a groin injury.
In his absence, pacer Khaled Ahmed is likely to be included in the playing XI for the third match. Additionally, Najmul Hossain Shanto may also be given a chance in the Bangladesh lineup.
Pakistan holds an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match T20I series, having thoroughly outclassed the visitors in both earlier games.
Meanwhile, Pakistan defeated Bangladesh by 37 runs in the first T20I here at Gaddafi Stadium Lahore on May 28. Chasing a target of 202, the Bangladeshi side was bowled out for 164 in 19.2 overs.
The second T20I also saw a dominant Pakistani performance. Batting first, the hosts posted 201/6 in their allotted 20 overs. In response, Bangladesh was bundled out for 144 in 19 overs.
Pakistan delivered a clinical performance to defeat Bangladesh by 57 runs in the second T20I, securing an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
Meanwhile, Pakistan are expected to make one change to their playing XI for the third and final T20I against Bangladesh, scheduled for Sunday at the Gaddafi Stadium.
Pacer Haris Rauf is likely to be rested due to his poor form, with either Abbas Afridi or Naseem Shah set to replace him in the lineup.
Rauf has struggled in the ongoing series, claiming just one wicket while conceding 59 runs in five overs at an economy rate of 11.80.
Despite Saim Ayub's disappointing form — scoring a duck in the first T20I and four runs in the second — the opening pair of Saim and Sahibzada Farhan is expected to be retained.
In the second T20I, the hosts delivered a dominant performance, defeating Bangladesh by 57 runs.
After electing to bat, Pakistan posted a commanding 201/6 in 20 overs. Despite an early setback with the dismissal of Saim Ayub, wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Haris (41 off 25) and Sahibzada Farhan (74 off 41) stitched together a blistering 103-run stand for the second wicket.
Farhan's knock featured four boundaries and six towering sixes. Following their departure, captain Salman Ali Agha (19 off 12) and Hasan Nawaz added 45 runs for the fourth wicket, maintaining the tempo.
Hasan finished unbeaten on 51 off 26 balls, striking two fours and three sixes.
In response, Bangladesh got off to a flying start, reaching 38/0 in just three overs with Tanzid Hasan scoring a quickfire 33.
However, a middle-order collapse, sparked by Haris Rauf and Faheem Ashraf, reduced them to 77/7 by the 10th over.
Tanzim Hasan Sakib showed some resistance with a valiant 50 off 31 deliveries, including five sixes, but received little support from the other end. Bangladesh were eventually bowled out for 144 in 19 overs. Pakistan's bowling effort was well-rounded, with Abrar Ahmed leading the way with figures of 3/19 in four overs.
Hasan Ali, Haris Rauf, Faheem Ashraf, Shadab Khan, Khushdil Shah and Saim Ayub each claimed a wicket to complete a dominant team performance.

How House got it wrong,"US
Doctors list how often the fictional medic stretched reality
He's the maverick medic who loved to confound the medical establishment with his brilliant, unorthodox diagnoses.
But Dr Gregory House, the misanthropic genius who was the star of the long-running House television series, got an awful lot wrong himself, Croatian doctors claim, as reported by AFP.
In a paper titled 'House MD Between reality and fiction' published in May, Denis Cerimagic, a professor at Dubrovnik University, and two fellow neurologists — all big fans of the series — listed 77 errors after analysing all 177 episodes of the show, which ran from 2004 to 2012.
""We focused on the diagnoses of main cases, reality of clinical practice presentation and detection of medical errors,"" Cerimagic told AFP.
He and his peers - Goran Ivkic and Ervina Bilic — broke the mistakes down into five categories including misuses of medical terminology, misinformation and simple weirdness — something which the show's anti-hero, played by British star Hugh Laurie, possessed in abundance.
That limp
The errors included the use of mercury thermometers, the term heart attack and cardiac arrest being used interchangeably, vitamin B12 deficiency being corrected with just one injection and a universal chemotherapy for all types of malignant tumours, medical procedures being done by specialists who had no business being there such as an infectologist performing an autopsy, complex lab tests showing results within hours and doctors breaking into patients' homes to look for causes.
But arguably the biggest error of all is that Laurie — whose character's genius for deduction comes from the misdiagnosis that left him with a limp and chronic pain – uses his cane on the wrong side.
The stick should be carried on his unaffected side, Cerimagic said, though he understood why the actor had done it because ""it's more effective to see the pronounced limp on the screen"".
Medical errors
Whatever their criticisms, the researchers say that modern medical series are far better produced than in the past, thanks to medical advisors. Despite its flaws, they thought the series could even be used to help train medical students.
""The focus could be on recognising medical errors in the context of individual episodes, adopting the teamwork concept and a multidisciplinary approach in diagnosis and treatment,"" Cerimagic said.
He said he and his colleagues were taken aback by the response to their paper. ""The idea was to make a scientific paper interesting not only to doctors but also to people without specific medical knowledge.""

Experts urge fiscal reforms before budget,"XX
Say focus should be on uplift of women and children
Experts at a pre-budget dialogue on Wednesday called for inclusive fiscal reforms in the upcoming budget to empower children and women that get least attention in the fiscal discourse of the country as a residual component.
The dialogue on 'Strengthening Fiscal Policies for Inclusive and Sustainable Development: Advancing Child and Gender-Responsive Public Investments' was jointly organised by the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, UNICEF Pakistan and Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
The dialogue, which mainly focused on aligning Pakistan's fiscal strategy with inclusive growth goals, brought together key government officials, economists, development partners and civil society representatives to deliberate on reorienting fiscal frameworks toward equity, sustainability, and inclusive growth.
The speakers said that with a budget deficit of over 6.8 per cent of the GDP and debt levels exceeding 70 per cent, there is an urgent need to safeguard and expand investments in health, education, nutrition and social protection. Despite tax revenues below 10 per cent of the GDP, they said, development for children and marginalized groups cannot be delayed.
Insights from UNICEF's Public Expenditure Reviews (PERs) revealed a persistent gap between policy commitments and actual social sector allocations, notably in provinces like Sindh where education spending has dropped to 1.8 per cent of GDP.
Anchored in the government's Uraan Pakistan programme - specifically the equity and empowerment pillar — the speakers called for targeted fiscal shifts toward inclusive and people-centred development. Key priorities include digital literacy, green skills, education access, and civic engagement, especially for women, youths, and underserved communities.

31 dead in Israeli gunfire near aid site,"US
UN's agency for Palestinian refugees chief says Gaza 'aid distribution has become a death trap'
Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli gunfire killed at least 31 Palestinians near a US-backed aid distribution site on Sunday.
Israel has faced growing condemnation over the humanitarian crisis in the war-ravaged Gaza Strip, where the United Nations has warned the entire population faces the risk of famine after no aid was allowed to enter for more than two months.
Israel recently eased its blockade and introduced a revamped aid mechanism in cooperation with a newly formed US-backed organisation, bypassing the longstanding UN-led system.
The organisation, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), says it has distributed millions of meals since operations began last week, but the rollout has been marked by chaotic scenes at the limited number of distribution centres, as well as reports of casualties from Israeli fire nearby.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that ""31 people were killed and more than 176 injured... after Israeli gunfire targeted thousands of civilians near the American aid centre in Rafah"", in southern Gaza.
AFP images showed Palestinians transporting bodies on donkey carts near the aid point as others carried away boxes and bags of supplies under the early-morning sun.
Abdullah Barbakh, a 58-year-old Palestinian man, described ""chaos"" at the site.
""The army opened fire from drones and tanks,"" he said. ""I don't understand why they call people to the aid centres and then open fire on them.""
Near another GHF aid centre in central Gaza, AFP images showed rescuers evacuating injured people. Bassal reported one dead and dozens wounded there, again blaming Israeli fire.
Sameh Hamuda, a displaced 33-year-old from northern Gaza, told AFP he had walked from Gaza City and spent the night with relatives near Rafah before heading to the aid centre around 5:00 am to wait among a crowd of people.
""Suddenly quadcopter drones opened fire on the people, and tanks started shooting heavily. Several people were killed right in front of me,"" he said.
""I ran and survived. Death follows you as long as you're in Gaza.""
At Al-Awda hospital in central Gaza, Umm Muhammad Abu Khousa told AFP her son was among those wounded near the other aid centre in Bureij.

Demand for butchers and charges go up,"US
The charges for goat and sheep sacrifices range from Rs6,000 to Rs7,000, he added.
With Eidul Azha less than a week away, demand for butchers in the capital has surged significantly, driven by the anticipated increase in the slaughter of sacrificial animals during the Islamic festival.
While some residents have already purchased their animals, many are still searching for suitable livestock. In this context, the role of butchers has become crucial for ensuring proper slaughter and meat preparation.
Owing to their high demand and limited availability, professional butchers have increased their service charges compared to last year.
Khawar Shehzad, a butcher who also runs a meat shop in Islamabad's sector I-10, said that Eidul Azha is a special Islamic festival following the slaughtering of animals at a mass level, highlighting that everyone looked for professional butchers to chop their meat, which sparked high demand.
""Everyone looks for a professional and skilled butcher on Eidul Azha to ensure quality meat cutting - this is our peak season,"" he said.
Shehzad shared his slaughtering rates for this year, noting that cow slaughtering on the first day of Eid is priced at Rs25,000, while the rate drops to Rs20,000 on the second day. By the third day, the charges range between Rs15,000 and Rs18,000, depending on demand.
The charges for goat and sheep sacrifices range from Rs6,000 to Rs7,000, he added.
While residents of the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) are eagerly preparing for Eidul Azha, many have expressed concerns over the soaring prices of sacrificial animals and the high fees charged by butchers.
Tariq Mahmood, a resident of the same sector who purchased his animal on Eid, said that he was trying to get the booking of a professional butcher for his meat preparation, who has high rates and high demand, adding, ""If I can't book one, I'll go with a seasonal one.""
According to Tariq, the seasonal butchers are more or less equally efficient and skilled, sharing his previous year's experience.
Despite the fact that the demand for professional and skilled butchers is notably high, people somehow manage to find a suitable person to sacrifice their animal.
To help meet the growing demand, many butchers from across the country also travel to Islamabad during Eid. These visiting butchers often charge slightly less and provide a practical solution to the city's shortage of skilled labour. Their presence also provided them an opportunity to enhance their earning more than they typically have in their hometowns.

Russian jets destroyed in Ukraine drone strikes,"PK
.
Ukraine said in a spectacular claim on Sunday it destroyed Russian bombers worth billions of dollars in a ""large-scale"" drone assault on enemy soil as it geared up for talks with Moscow counterparts to explore prospects for a ceasefire.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy praised the ""absolutely brilliant"" drone attack launched on Russian air bases, saying it inflicted tangible losses on Moscow. He said that 117 drones had been used to attack the Russian bases.
Ukraine said the strike on the eve of peace talks damaged $7 billion worth of Russian aircraft parked at four airbases thousands of kilometres away, with unverified video footage showing aircraft engulfed in flames and black smoke.
A source in the Ukrainian security services said the drones were concealed in the ceilings of shipping containers, which were opened up to release them for the assault. The long-planned operation came at a delicate moment three years into Russia's invasion.
""An absolutely brilliant outcome. And an outcome produced by Ukraine independently,"" Zelenskiy wrote on the Telegram messaging app and a video address. He noted the operation took more than a year and half to prepare. ""This is our longest-range operation. Russia has had very tangible losses.""
Zelensky said that he was sending a delegation to Istanbul led by his Defence Minister Rustem Umerov for talks on Monday with Russian officials. Turkey is hosting the meeting, which was spurred by US President Donald Trump's push for a quick deal to end the three-year war.
A source in Ukraine's SBU security service said the coordinated attacks inside Russia were ""aimed at destroying enemy bombers far from the front"". The SBU source added that the strikes targeted Russian airbases in the eastern Siberian city of Belaya, in Olenya, in the Arctic near Finland, and in Ivanovo and Dyagilevo, both east of Moscow.
More than 40 aircraft had been hit at the Belaya base and a fire had broken out there, the source said, showing a video in which several aircraft could be seen in flames and black smoke rising. AFP was not able to independently verify the claims or the video images.
Russia's defence ministry confirmed on Telegram that several of its military aircraft ""caught fire"". Rybar, an account on the Telegram message platform that is close to the Russian military, called it a ""very heavy blow"" for Moscow and pointed to what it called ""serious errors"" by Russian intelligence.
Russia's defence ministry said that there were no casualties and that several ""participants"" had been arrested. Igor Kobzev, Governor of Russia's Irkutsk region, which hosts the targeted Belaya airbase, said it was ""the first attack of this sort in Siberia"".
On Sunday, Ukraine's air force said it was hit by 472 Russian drones and seven missiles overnighta record since the beginning of the invasion.
In a rare admission of its military losses, the Ukraine army said Russia's ""missile strike on the location of one of the training units"" had killed a dozen soldiers, most of whom had been in shelters during the attack, and wounded more than 60.
The attack led Ukrainian ground forces commander Mykhailo Drapaty to announce his resignation, saying he felt ""responsibility"" for the soldiers' deaths.
Separately on Sunday, the Russian army said it had captured another village in Ukraine's northern Sumy region, where Kyiv fears Moscow could mount a fresh ground assault. Russia claims to have captured several settlements in the region in recent weeks, and has massed more than 50,000 soldiers on the other side of the border, according to Zelensky.
Authorities in the region have evacuated more than 200 villages amid intensified shelling.
In Russia, officials said a blast brought down a road bridge in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine on Saturday, derailing a passenger train heading to Moscow and killing seven people. A separate rail bridge in the neighbouring Kursk region was blown up hours later in the early hours of Sunday, derailing a freight train and injuring the driver.
Authorities did not say who was behind the explosions, but investigators said a criminal inquiry was underway.

CM Maryam orders action against toxic discharge into drains
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has approved a comprehensive plan for the restoration, management and reform of the drainage systems throughout the province.
The environmental protection department and district administrations have been strictly directed to ensure legal enforcement of the Punjab Drainage and Local Government Acts.
A province-wide operation has been approved to prevent the discharge of toxic water and chemicals into Punjab's drains. Under environmental protection guidelines, the 'polluters pay' principle will be strictly enforced, holding polluting industries accountable for environmental damage.
A ban has been imposed on the disposal of industrial and municipal waste into all drains across Punjab, including the Hadyara Drain.
As a Drainage Restoration and Management Committee commenced implementation of the measures, in the first meeting chaired by Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, a detailed briefing was given on the Hadyara Drain. The environmental protection department was tasked with strict enforcement actions around the Hadyara area. A crackdown will be initiated against factories that fail to install water treatment plants and continue to discharge chemical waste into the drain.
The health department was instructed to submit a report and plan regarding public health conditions around Hadyara. WASA, along with the departments of industry and irrigation were directed to take immediate action to improve the conditions.
A survey of the drainage system across the province will be conducted to identify flaws and propose solutions.
Approval was granted for a plan to repair and upgrade the drainage system. Moreover, it was decided to enhance the wastewater management infrastructure through a public-private partnership (PPP) model.
The provincial senior minister said key environmental projects have been included in the Annual Development Programme (ADP).
Meanwhile, during a meeting with Punjab Assembly Members Muhammad Ahmed Khan Leghari and Naeem Akhtar Khan Bhabha to discuss welfare projects, public problems and development issues of their constituencies, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz termed education and financial independence of the youth her top priorities. She said, ""We want to bring benefits of development to every section of the province.""
The MPAs thanked the chief minister for starting the construction and expansion project of the Multan-Vehari road.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif directed the authorities concerned to start classes in the Vehari Girls College after the summer break.
She also directed the authorities to launch a water supply scheme for Fort Munro.
In her message on the Global Day of Parents, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said, ""Today, do remember those children whose parents sacrificed their precious lives for the security of our beloved homeland.""
She added, ""I also pay tribute to those parents whose children were martyred.""

Pakistan seeks stronger ties with Bangladesh,"PK
President says Dhaka is a success story in the world
President Asif Ali Zardari said on Sunday that Pakistan intended to forge strong bilateral relations with Bangladesh in all areas, including commerce, trade, sports, culture and people-to-people ties.
Speaking at a reception hosted to Bangladesh and Pakistan Men's cricket teams at the Governor's House here on Sunday, he said the Pakistan government was trying to work together to build a stronger relationship, adding that it could not happen overnight but ""we need to keep investing in people and come up with solutions to take our relations"" to new heights.
The Bangladesh cricket team is in Pakistan to play a three-match T20I series. Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, Bangladesh High Commissioner to Pakistan Muhammad Iqbal Hussain, BCB Operations Head Nazmul Abedeen Fahim, team officials, and members of Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket teams were present.
Zardari said that Pakistan businessmen wished to collaborate with Bangladeshi businesses, adding that the Pakistani government was also interested in working with the Bangladeshi government in the long run. ""We have a bright future as two nations"", the president remarked.

""Bangladesh is a success story in the world both financially as well as in human resource capital and everybody knows. Allah has given you strength financially and in the form of manpower. ""Bangladesh is destined to progress and prosper  and Pakistan will contribute as much as it can,"" he said.
Reminiscing on the shared history and pangs of separation as brothers, when the two brothers parted ways in 1971, Zardari said that the younger generation was not aware of the pain ""we had gone through as the older generation"", adding that we had broken each other's hearts in the past and there was a need to mend the hearts today"". He stressed the need for reconciliation and mutual understanding.
Recognising transformative power of cricket as a sport, which helps in uniting people throughout the world, he said: ""I am happy to host you all in Pakistan, in Lahore. And I hope that there will be many such trips"".
Zardari also expressed the desire to visit Bangladesh, adding that he had not been to Dhaka for a long time. He fondly recalled his student days at the Cadet College Petaro and the lasting friendships he made during those days, adding that he was in contact with Bangladeshi college friends even today.
President Zardari reassured the Bangladesh envoy to Pakistan of his full support in furthering the bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries. He hailed the Bangladesh tigers for their immense talent and wished them a great future.
He also lavished praise on the young Pakistan team and expressed the hope they will do well on the international front. ""The world is young, you are young and it's your time. We've seen our time, this is your time. All of you are going to see the future and I bless you and I hope that you'll have an eventful good future,"" President Zardari maintained.

Monsoon rains kill 30 in India,"US
.
Flash floods and landslides after torrential monsoon rain over the last two days killed at least 30 people in India's northeast, officials said Sunday.
State disaster management officials said eight people died in Assam, and nine in Arunachal Pradesh, many of them in landslides as earth loosened by the water slumped into the valley below.
Another five people died in a landslide in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, state authorities said.
The officials said that six people lost their lives in Meghalaya and at least two others were killed in the states of Nagaland and Tripura. A red alert warning was issued for several districts in the region after the non-stop downpour over the last three days.
Rivers swollen by the lashing rain — including the mighty Brahmaputra, which rises in the Himalayas and flows through India's northeast towards its delta in Bangladesh — broke their banks across the region.
The Indian army said that it had saved hundreds ""in a massive rescue operation"" across Manipur state.
