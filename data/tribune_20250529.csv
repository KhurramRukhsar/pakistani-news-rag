Bhowana ranked Punjab's cleanest tehsil,"DE
615k tons of waste disposed of in six months by FWMC under 'Suthra Punjab' initiative
The Faisalabad Waste Management Company (FWMC) has removed more than 615,400 tonnes of solid waste from 16 tehsils over the past six months, following the outsourcing of sanitation operations to private contractors.
The initiative, launched under the Punjab government's ""Suthra Punjab"" campaign, is aimed at transforming urban cleanliness standards and achieving UN Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.
According to FWMC sources, the company has deployed a workforce of over 15,000 personnel, 5,199 waste containers, and 3,014 pieces of machinery across the division to ensure regular waste collection from households and public spaces.
The massive operation comes as part of a province-wide sanitation reform led by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, who approved the outsourcing model in November 2024 for all eight waste management companies in Punjab.
A half-yearly performance evaluation conducted by the Central Control Room of the Punjab Local Government Department placed Tehsil Bhowana of District Chiniot at the top among 132 tehsils across the province.
Bhowana was recognised for its superior sanitation standards, operational efficiency, and timely resolution of public complaints. Tehsils Jalalpur Pirwala in District Multan and Bahawalnagar secured second and third positions, respectively.
The control room, which monitors key performance indicators such as staff deployment, facial attendance, vehicle tracking, waste enclosure setup, complaint resolution, and tonnage collection, ranked 26 tehsils with average efficiency scores above 90.
Among these high-performing tehsils, seven belong to Faisalabad Division, including Jaranwala, Pir Mahal, Gojra, Kamalia, Chiniot, Lalian, and Toba Tek Singh.
Punjab Local Government Minister Zeeshan Rafiq described the performance monitoring as a vital component in ensuring long-term sustainability of the initiative. He noted that municipal bodies previously managed to lift only 28,000 tons of solid waste daily, while the new system aims to handle 60,000 tons, ensuring proper waste disposal and minimising environmental hazards.
Rafiq added that control rooms have been established at the tehsil level and that more than 100,000 jobs have been created through the outsourcing model.
FWMC Chief Executive Officer Rauf Ahmad credited the first-place achievement of Tehsil Bhowana to the hard work of the company's field staff, as well as the cooperation of provincial and district administrations.

India to conduct mock drills along Pakistan's border,"US
The drill, being organised under the guidance of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
Four Indian states along the Pakistan border are set to conduct large-scale civil defence mock drills from Thursday (today) just weeks after a ceasefire was brokered following military escalation.
According to Indian media quoting authorities, mock drills will be conducted in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), Punjab and Gujarat on Thursday evening.
The Haryana government has also announced a state-wide emergency preparedness exercise titled ""Operation Shield,"" scheduled today across all 22 districts from 5pm (local time) onwards, aimed at enhancing readiness in the event of a crisis.
The drill, being organised under the guidance of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), will simulate critical incidents such as air raids, drone attacks, and other wartime scenarios in the wake of national security concerns, as per the Indian media.
Additionally, a controlled blackout of 15 minutes will be observed from 8pm to 8.15pm near vital installations, with the exception of essential emergency services such as hospitals, fire stations, and police stations.
Home Department Haryana Additional Chief Secretary Dr Sumita Misra said, ""The exercise aims to test existing emergency mechanisms, improve coordination between the civil administration, defence forces, and local communities, and identify areas that need to be strengthened, thus ensuring swift and effective response during any crisis.""
Earlier, a statewide mock drill was conducted on May 7 shortly after India launched airstrikes in Pakistan, which hit civilian populations including mosques, claiming lives of 26 civilians.

Israel claims killing Hamas chief in Gaza strike,"CN
Israel claims killing Hamas chief in Gaza strike
Israel claimed on Wednesday a strike on a hospital in southern Gaza earlier this month killed Mohammad Sinwar, Hamas' Gaza chief and the younger brother of the Palestinian group's deceased leader Yahya Sinwar.
Mohammad Sinwar had been the target of an Israeli strike on the southern Gaza hospital on May 21 and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that it was likely that he was dead. Hamas has yet to confirm Sinwar's death.
Netanyahu announced that Sinwar had been ""eliminated"" in an address to the Israeli parliament as he listed off names of other Hamas officials that Israel had killed over the past 20 months, including Sinwar's brother Yahya.
""In the last two days we have been in a dramatic turn towards a complete defeat of Hamas,"" he said, adding that Israel was also ""taking control of food distribution"", a reference to a new aid distribution system in Gaza managed by a US-backed group.
Israeli military has intensified its genocide campaign in Gaza after breaking a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in March. The war erupted on October 7, 2023 when Hamas-led fighters killed around 1,200 people in southern Israel and took More than 250 hostages.
Israel's war of Gaza has decimated the coastal territory, killing more than 53,000, according to health officials in Gaza, and displaced over 2 million Palestinians. Gazan health officials have said most of those killed have been civilians – children and women.
Israel says it has killed tens of thousands of Palestinian fighters but has not provided any evidence to support those claims. Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir on May 26 said Hamas had lost many assets, including its command and control centre.
Sinwar was elevated to the top ranks of the Palestinian group last year after Israel killed his brother Yahya in combat. Yahya Sinwar masterminded the October 2023 attack was later named the overall leader of the group after Israel killed his predecessor Ismail Haniyeh in Iran.

"Gold rises Rs1,400 as global market recovers","RU
Safe-haven bounces back in range-bound trade to Rs349,300/tola amid international bargain buying
Gold prices in Pakistan rose on Wednesday, tracking gains in the international market as investors sought bargains following a dip in the previous session. The local uptick comes amid global anticipation surrounding the release of minutes from the US Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting.
According to the All Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), the price of gold per tola climbed by Rs1,400 to reach Rs349,300. Similarly, the price of 10 grams of gold increased by Rs1,200, settling at Rs299,468.
This rebound followed a sharp drop on Tuesday when gold fell by Rs3,600 per tola to close at Rs347,900.
Commenting on the trend, Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, noted that international gold prices remained volatile but within a defined trading range. ""The market touched a high of $3,325 and a low of $3,290 today, currently trading around $3,300,"" he said. ""The $3,270 level is proving to be a strong support, from where the market has bounced back. On the upside, $3,350 is a key resistance.""
He explained that gold has been trading in a range-bound pattern, citing historical movements from $3,120 to $3,600. ""Profit-taking is likely when prices approach upper resistance levels. On the downside, unresolved tariff issues and geopolitical tensions, particularly the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, continue to weigh on sentiment.""
Agar added that unless these global hurdles are permanently resolved, gold is expected to remain within the $3,270 to $3,360 range. ""A breakout beyond either end could push prices towards $3,200 or $3,420-3,500, respectively,"" he concluded.
Globally, gold prices rose on Wednesday as traders sought bargains following the previous session's declines, while the market remains focused on minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting due later in the day, according to Reuters.
Spot gold gained 0.4% to $3,312.05 an ounce by 1255 GMT, after hitting a session low of $3,285.19 on Tuesday. US gold futures rose 0.3% to $3,310.60.
""The gold market has been kind of choppy recently, just reacting to fresh daily fundamental news events with no real trending price action. In the near term, the market top is in place,"" Jim Wyckoff, Senior Analyst at Kitco Metals, said.
""The minutes can be market movers. Market watchers are going to be looking at new comments on inflation this afternoon.""
Minutes of the Fed's May policy meeting are due at 1800 GMT. The meeting took place amid heightened concern over global trade tensions, following President Trump's early April announcement of major new import tariffs. Some of the most aggressive tariffs were eased or delayed a week later.
Gold, which performs well in a low-interest rate environment and serves as a safe haven during times of uncertainty, has gained 26% so far this year and hit a record high in April.

Korangi Road cattle market licence cancelled,"US
Traders to move court against administration's decision
The commissioner Karachi has cancelled the licence of a cattle market, established legally on Korangi Road, in compliance with the court orders. The decision causing significant concern among traders. The administration of the cattle market announced they would challenge the decision in Sindh High Court (SHC) on Thursday. They have appealed to the Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court to resolve the matter.
According to Korangi Cattle Market Administrator, Sardar Sohail, the market's licence was properly obtained through an official auction process under the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. A payment of Rs7 million was made to KMC through a bid process to secure the permission. Commissioner Karachi had originally issued the market's operating licence on May 9 after all legal requirements were fulfilled based on reports from relevant authorities including KMC, the deputy commissioner of Korangi, police and other departments.
Korangi Road cattle market spans ten acres of land and currently hosts more than 250 traders and cattle farmers who have set up stalls to sell their livestock.
The market contains approximately 4,000 large and small animals and has developed into a temporary settlement complete with food stalls, online banking facilities, parking and other necessary facilities. In addition to local traders, more than 250 sellers from Punjab and various parts of Sindh have brought their animals to sell in the market, which supports the livelihoods of a number of families.
Traders have expressed deep concern following the sudden cancellation of market's licence by the commissioner's office, which cited court orders as the reason for revocation. They are now facing uncertainty about where to relocate their businesses and decided to approach the court on Thursday for resolution. The market has been serving residents of Korangi, Landhi, Defence, Mahmoodabad, Qayyumabad and surrounding areas, providing convenient access to buy sacrificial animals. Current prices start at Rs40,000 for goats and 150,000 for cows, making it an accessible option for middle-class buyers.
Meanwhile, the commissioner's office has approved a total of 14 cattle markets across Karachi this year. While citizens have been visiting the markets to purchase animals for Eidul Azha, many are finding the prices exorbitantly high.

"India's water war: time for justice, not aggression","PK
This isn't merely a technical dispute over hydro projects.
India's recent hybrid war against Pakistan began not with tanks or missiles, but with a chilling threat - shut off the water. In the wake of the deadly attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam, New Delhi's first line of action was not investigation or diplomacy — it was retribution through water. India has since held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance, in a unilateral and illegal move that poses a grave threat to regional stability and an existential danger to Pakistan.
This isn't merely a technical dispute over hydro projects. This is a hostile act, tantamount to economic terrorism and, by many standards, an act of war. India is weaponising water to pressure Pakistan, jeopardising the lives of millions who depend on the Indus River system for drinking, farming and economic survival.
The IWT, signed in 1960 between India and Pakistan with the World Bank acting as a guarantor, has long been regarded as one of the most successful water-sharing agreements in the world. Its origins lie in the tense post-Partition period, when the 1948 stoppage of canal waters by India exposed the urgent need for a formal and equitable framework for water distribution.
In response to this crisis, and with the mediation of the World Bank, both countries negotiated and agreed upon the IWT — a landmark agreement that provided a durable and structured mechanism for cooperation over the vital Indus River system.
For over six decades, the treaty withstood the test of time — even surviving full-scale wars between the two countries. Pakistan honoured its obligations under the treaty. However, in recent years, New Delhi has increasingly pushed the envelope, building dams and hydroelectric projects on the western rivers in ways that violate both the spirit and letter of the IWT.
The construction of projects like Kishanganga and Ratle has led to legal disputes brought by Pakistan before international arbitration forums. The World Bank had suspended its role as arbitrator in 2016 under Indian pressure but was compelled to resume proceedings following international criticism. In 2023, a Hague-based court ruled in favour of Pakistan, dismissing Indian objections to arbitration. India, in defiance, has still not complied.
The most dangerous escalation came when India threatened to unilaterally exit the treaty or render it inactive by putting it ""in abeyance"" — a term not recognised in international treaty law. This undermines the credibility of international agreements and creates dangerous precedents for future conflicts.
From a legal standpoint, India's unilateral action violates several international norms and principles. First, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969) clearly states that a party cannot suspend or terminate a treaty unilaterally unless it is explicitly provided for within the treaty, which is not the case here.
Second, India's refusal to adhere to dispute resolution mechanisms such as arbitration — despite treaty provisions — violates not only the IWT but also broader principles of international law. By holding the treaty in abeyance, India is attempting to unilaterally rewrite a binding international agreement.
Third, this act of water aggression could be interpreted as a violation of the UN Watercourses Convention and customary international law, which emphasise equitable and reasonable utilisation of transboundary watercourses and the obligation not to cause significant harm.
India's attempt to weaponise water is tantamount to economic terrorism. It undermines trust, violates international obligations and endangers the lives of over 240 million people in Pakistan.
Furthermore, India's actions set a dangerous precedent in international relations. If a country can unilaterally suspend a longstanding water-sharing agreement simply due to political hostility, what prevents others from doing the same? This undermines the very foundation of rule-based international order. Water treaties across the world — from the Nile to the Mekong — could become tools of coercion rather than cooperation.
Despite this aggression, Pakistan has not responded with equal hostility. Islamabad continues to advocate for peace and dialogue, but it is clear that this approach must now be accompanied by a robust diplomatic and legal offensive. The World Bank, as the original broker of the treaty, must be called upon to enforce compliance.
The international community, particularly the United Nations and major water rights organisations, must step forward and treat India's act for what it is - a deliberate violation of a legally binding international treaty with potentially catastrophic humanitarian consequences.
Yet, while holding India accountable, Pakistan must also introspect. The looming water crisis is not solely caused by external aggression. Pakistan loses billions of cubic metres of water annually due to poor irrigation infrastructure, mismanagement and lack of public awareness.
Urban centres waste water, while rural irrigation channels leak and erode. Climate change is reducing snowmelt from the Himalayas, and monsoon patterns are becoming erratic. These are internal challenges that must be addressed immediately.
It is high time Pakistan launched a national water resilience strategy. This must include the construction of new reservoirs and dams to store excess rainwater, the adoption of modern irrigation techniques like drip and sprinkler systems and the repair of outdated canal infrastructure to reduce leakage. Water recycling and greywater usage in urban areas must be prioritised.
Public awareness campaigns on water conservation should be rolled out nationwide. Schools, mosques and media must be mobilised to make water conservation a national habit. Investment in research on climate-resilient crops and water-efficient farming must be accelerated.
Pakistan has acted responsibly, even in the face of repeated provocations. But responsibility should not be mistaken for weakness. India's illegal move to suspend the treaty is a challenge not just to Pakistan's sovereignty, but to the world's shared commitment to peace and cooperation in managing vital natural resources.
Water is not a weapon — it is a lifeline. And if one of the world's most celebrated water-sharing treaties can be threatened by nationalism and political vengeance, then the global community must act before it becomes a flood too powerful to stop.

"Two cops martyred, four terrorists killed in gun battle","US
.
In a fierce gun battle between law enforcement agencies and terrorists in the Hussain Kot area of Rawalakot district, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), four terrorists were killed while two policemen embraced martyrdom.
According to police, when security forces raided the terrorists' hideout, the suspects opened fire and hurled hand grenades at the raiding party, resulting in the immediate martyrdom of two policemen. In an attempt to avoid capture, the terrorists detonated explosive devices, killing themselves on the spot.
Police confirmed that the ringleader and most-wanted terrorist, Zarnosh Naseem, also blew himself up while attempting to flee. He was wanted in multiple high-profile cases, including the murder of Constable Sajjad Resham, and had been in hiding in the Rawalakot area for a long time. Authorities stated that he was an active member of a banned militant organisation operating in AJK.
DIG Poonch Sardar Zaheer confirmed the deaths of four terrorists and the martyrdom of two policemen during the operation.
Meanwhile, Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi lauded the successful counter-terrorism operation in Rawalakot. He paid tribute to the martyred cops, praising their bravery and noting that their sacrifice prevented a major disaster in AJK.
""The martyred officers have set an example by sacrificing their lives in the line of duty,"" Naqvi said. ""The entire nation salutes their courage and stands in solidarity with the bereaved families.""

Police raid on 'gambling den' sparks clash,"US
Shahdara police arrest suspected organiser
A police raid targeting an illegal horse cart race and associated gambling activity near Babu Sabu escalated into violence when local residents attacked the raiding team with sticks.
According to officials, the Shahdara police had received a tip-off regarding large-scale betting during the horse cart race, prompting an operation to apprehend those involved.
However, the raid met with fierce resistance from locals who attempted to obstruct the police action.
During the chaos, the crowd assaulted officers, resulting in injuries and tearing of police uniform.
Despite the resistance, the police managed to arrest a key suspect identified as Bala Aslam who is believed to be the organiser of the betting ring.
The police also seized thousands of rupees in stake money along with several horses and carts from the spot.
A case has been registered against the attackers, including one identified as Tauqeer Bhatti, along with several unidentified persons who had fled from the scene. Eyewitnesses reported that hundreds of spectators had gathered to watch the race when the raid occurred.
Police officials say investigations into the incident are under way.
Meanwhile, Lahore police claimed to have arrested 1,619 suspects during a crackdown on gambling dens and the online illegal activity so far this year and registered 413 cases against them.
According to a spokesperson, more than Rs8.41 million in stake money was seized from the arrested suspects.
Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana said police operations were ongoing to dismantle both traditional and online gambling networks. He directed the police to intensify the crackdown and conduct intelligence-based raids on gambling dens.
""The noose is tightening around those involved in online gambling,"" he said, urging the use of modern information technology to effectively counter the activities.
He also ordered legal action against social media accounts and mobile applications promoting online gambling, emphasising the need for collaboration with the public prosecution department to ensure that the cases are pursued to their logical conclusion. With additional input from APP

Police under fire in abduction case,"CN
The suspect remains at large, with no substantial progress reported in the investigation.
The Rawalpindi police chief showed his 'resentment' over the Rawal Division police after a local court expressed strong displeasure over the police's failure to recover three children allegedly abducted by their father, despite more than a year having passed since the incident.
The suspect remains at large, with no substantial progress reported in the investigation.
Taking notice of the situation, Rawalpindi City Police Officer, Khalid Hamdani, has directed the Rawal Division SP to obtain the suspect's travel history and Call Detail Record (CDR), and personally oversee efforts to trace the accused and ensure the safe recovery of the abducted children.
The CPO has sent a letter titled ""Explanation"" to the Rawal Division SP, criticising the lack of implementation of the court's directives. The letter refers to a written order by a Rawalpindi court concerning FIR No 510 registered in February 2024 at Sadiqabad Police Station, in which a woman alleged that her former husband had abducted her three children. The suspect has not been traced nor have the children been recovered, prompting judicial frustration.
The court has issued multiple arrest warrants under Section 100 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), with the next hearing scheduled for June 5.

IT sector seeks policy continuity,"US
Industry leaders urge support for local hardware, freelancer incentives
Key stakeholders of the IT industry have urged the government to continue reforms and extend incentives for the significant growth of the IT sector and its allied fields to enhance export earnings and create jobs for youth, in line with the objectives of the futuristic ""Uraan Pakistan"" economic plan.
They called for incorporating their recommendations in the upcoming federal budget 2025-26 to enable the IT sector to grow faster, generate more employment opportunities, and contribute more effectively to strengthening the national economy.
They also stressed the need for continuity of existing policies and resolution of regulatory and tax-related challenges in the finance bill for 2025-26, particularly for the IT industry and freelancers, to help accelerate sectoral growth and development.
Khushnood Aftab, Convener of the IT Committee at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), recommended that the government reduce import duties on essential hardware components such as RAM, SSDs, motherboards, batteries, and displays. This would support the local assembly of fully built imported devices like laptops, desktops, and tablets, fostering local value addition and attracting investment in domestic production facilities.
He noted that increased support for the localisation of computer devices and hardware accessories could help Pakistan conserve foreign exchange, create skilled jobs, and position itself as a competitive exporter in regional markets.
The locally branded IT hardware sector, he added, deserves focused attention as it directly aligns with the ""Made in Pakistan"" initiative and the broader Digital Pakistan vision.
Furthermore, he emphasised the urgent need for the fair inclusion of local brands in government procurement, which would encourage scale, improve quality, and support domestic industry without compromising standards.
Pakistan must also prepare for the growing demand for AI-integrated hardware and edge computing devices, he said, which could be achieved through the introduction of targeted Research and Development (R&D) tax credits and innovation grants to support companies working on emerging technologies within the country, said Khushnood Aftab, who is also Chairman Viper Group.
Muhammad Umair Nizam, Senior Vice Chairman of the Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA), said the IT sector is a key driver of economic growth, job creation, and foreign investment. He stressed that extending the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for the next decade would provide the policy stability necessary to encourage reinvestment and help Pakistan maintain its competitive edge in global markets.
He also urged the government to harmonise the definitions of IT and Information Technology Enabled Services (ITeS) across federal and provincial tax laws to ensure consistency, eliminate jurisdictional ambiguities, and reduce compliance burdens. A unified framework, he said, would enhance investor confidence, streamline taxation, and promote sectoral growth by creating a predictable regulatory environmentultimately strengthening Pakistan's digital economy and competitiveness.
Equally important, he said, is reducing income tax for salaried IT professionals, which would help retain top talent and mitigate the ongoing brain drain.
Pakistan Freelancers Association Chairman Ibrahim Amin cautioned against increasing tax rates on freelancers, who already pay taxes on every transaction in addition to fees charged by freelancing platforms and payment gateway service providers.
He recommended that the government exempt freelancers and IT companies from withholding tax (WHT) on international transactions under the Exporters' Special Foreign Currency Account (ESFCA) in the upcoming finance bill, following the concurrence of the Ministry of Finance and Revenue.
He also urged the finance division to ensure that all features of the Roshan Digital Account (RDA) be extended to ESFCAs for IT companies and freelancers, enabling them to benefit from streamlined banking services and improved access to capital.

Salman explains Sufiyan's exclusion,"PK
The spinner was excluded from the Pakistan squad for Bangladesh series
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha revealed the reason behind left-arm spinner Sufiyan Muqeem's absence from the national squad for the three-match T20I series against Bangladesh.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) last week announced a 16-member squad for the aforementioned series, which was selected based on the players' performances in the recently concluded HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10.
Meanwhile, Muqeem, who represented Peshawar Zalmi in this year's marquee league, had a forgetful campaign as he could only play three matches and took only one wicket at a dismal economy rate of 9.72.
The spinner, however, delivered impressive performances for the national team last month on the white-ball tour of New Zealand, where he picked up five wickets in three matches – one T20I and two ODIs.
His exclusion drew an outburst from fans, who flocked to social media to express their disapproval.
Consequently, Pakistan captain Agha was also asked to share the thought process behind the wrist spinner's snub from the home series during the pre-series press conference at the Gaddafi Stadium here on Tuesday.
In response, Agha expressed his admiration for Muqeem and assured that he is in their plans for shorter formats before explaining that he was overlooked considering the conditions here, which according to him are more favourable for the pacers.
""I personally like Sufyan a lot, and in the upcoming series, he will feature in our shorter formats squads. I think Sufyan will play a crucial role in the white-ball format, and he will win a lot of matches for Pakistan in the future,"" said Agha.
""If we look at the conditions, spinners did not have much success here [Lahore], so a fast bowler is added in his place,"" he added.
It is pertinent to mention that the three-match T20I series between Pakistan and Bangladesh is scheduled to be played at the Gaddafi Stadium here on May 28, 30 and June 1, respectively.
Wasim Jr ruled out
Pakistan's fast-bowling all-rounder Mohammad Wasim Jr has been ruled out of the upcoming three-match T20I series against Bangladesh, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed on Tuesday.
According to the cricket board, the 23-year-old picked up a side strain during the recently concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10 and was not able to recover in time.
Earlier, sources had suggested that the doctors advised Mohammad Wasim Jr a one-week rest and thus, will undergo rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) here.
As a result, he has been replaced by Abbas Afridi, who was the joint second leading wicket-taker of the PSL 10 with 17 dismissals in 11 matches at a decent average of 23.52.
""Fast bowler Mohammad Abbas Afridi has replaced Mohammad Wasim Jnr in Pakistan's T20I squad for the three-match T20I series against Bangladesh,"" the PCB said in a statement.
""Wasim Jnr picked up a side strain during the HBL PSL and was not able to recover in time.""
Abbas has thus far represented Pakistan in 20 T20Is and took 33 wickets in his budding career.
For the unversed, the three-match T20I series is scheduled to be played at the Gaddafi Stadium here on May 28, 30 and June 1.
Pakistan squad for Bangladesh T20Is: Salman Ali Agha (c), Shadab Khan (vc), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wk), Abbas Afridi, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wk) and Saim Ayub.

Cyrus debuts album at close-knit fan event,"US
Singer performed 'Something Beautiful' live
In a cosy gathering at LA's Chateau Marmont, Miley Cyrus hosted a special event for fans in collaboration with TikTok. As per Variety, a 100-person audience attended the gathering to listen to Cyrus' upcoming album Something Beautiful, oblivious to the popstar's surprise performance after the album-listening party.
Cyrus came in to debut a handful of songs from the album, such as End Of The World and More To Lose, along with a few fan favourites, including an impromptu rendition of her hit 2009 song The Climb, for an exclusive audience.
Sharing the process of making Something Beautiful with her fans, Cyrus said at the beginning of the set, ""I've been experimenting with this album for the past year or two by having these nights at Chateau. They were invite-only, super exclusive, just my closest friends and my family.""
She added that these sessions were effective in helping her discover the kind of album she was making. She credited Michael Pollack for his work on the piano and being her songwriting partner. She also gave a shoutout to Jonathan Rado on the guitar and Maxx Morando on the drums. Cyrus said she had to own the album with these three artists by her side.
""Making the album and fully realising it all and watching it become this butterfly and have this metamorphosis, this evolution, it's so reflective of my life and everything that I'm experiencing. I pour that into the production,"" she said. ""But at the heart of this album, it's just us, really. It's been us three in a room making this album for the past couple of years.""
Something Beautiful will be released worldwide on Friday, just days ahead of its visual film, which is scheduled for June 6.

Why Dr AQ Khan still matters,"US
The professionalism and precision of the PAF silenced the aggressive posturing of the Indian military
This nation dearly misses you, Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. You are remembered with deep respect and gratitude for gifting Pakistan the nuclear capability that has enabled the country to stand firm in its strategic defence. Your true worth was once again realised when India reacted like a raging elephant after the Pahalgam terrorist attack on 22 April, hastily accusing Pakistan without presenting any credible evidence.
India launched an irresponsible and disproportionate response under a self-declared operation misleadingly named — Sindoor — after a false-flag activity. Civilian areas were targeted through air strikes conducted with drones and fighter jets. Pakistan's government and armed forces exercised the right to self-defence with remarkable professionalism and restraint.
In response, the Pakistan Air Force not only defended our airspace but also humbled Indian military arrogance. The so-called superior Rafael jets failed to make an impact, while Pakistan's air defence successfully brought down three aircraft, including a MiG-21, and challenged the capabilities of the Su-30s. This defeat led to a sarcastic reinterpretation of Rafale in India — RAW Fail.
India was taken aback by Pakistan's measured yet precise retaliation, which directly hit Indian military installations and air defence targets. The professionalism and precision of the PAF silenced the aggressive posturing of the Indian military, often dubbed the ""mad elephant"". The United States had to intervene to de-escalate the skirmishes, which were dangerously close to triggering a nuclear confrontation in South Asia.
It is because of Dr AQ Khan's contributions that Pakistan today possesses a credible deterrent. His work has empowered the nation to stand tall in the face of external threats and deter aggression through strength. Though Pakistan may not match India in economic size, conventional military strength or war equipment on paper, it remains resolute and capable of defending its sovereignty under any circumstance.
All honour and tribute go to Dr AQ Khan — the man who gave Pakistan the power to respond to threats on an equal footing.
Let us now compare Pakistan and India in terms of military capability across the three branches — Army, Navy and Air Force — and evaluate their strengths in terms of war equipment and strategic positioning.
India stands as the fourth-strongest military power in the world, while Pakistan is ranked 12th. India's total military strength is said to be nearly three times more than Pakistan's. It also possesses much more military arsenal than Pakistan does.
Silencing the guns of a hegemonic India became possible when Pakistan declared itself a nuclear power capable of retaliation. This strategic milestone was achieved on 28 May 1998, when Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in the hills of Chagai — a moment now commemorated as Youm-e-Takbeer.
At the heart of this historic moment was the unparalleled contribution of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan — the father of Pakistan's nuclear programme. A metallurgist with rare expertise, Dr AQ Khan had a singular mission: to make his homeland invincible. His relentless efforts transformed Pakistan from a security-dependent nation into a nuclear power with credible deterrence.
The genesis of this nuclear journey lies in the painful memory of the 1971 war and the dismemberment of the country. It is no coincidence that then Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Ali Bhutto — who famously stated, ""we will eat grass, even go hungry, but we will get one of our own [nuclear bomb]"" — laid the foundation of Pakistan's nuclear ambition.
The humiliation of 1971 was a turning point. Pakistan realised that conventional military parity with India would never be enough. Nuclear deterrence was no longer a choice — it had become a strategic necessity.
Today, we must ask ourselves: Are we doing enough to honour the sacrifices and genius that made this feat possible? Are we investing in science and technology beyond military applications? Are we preserving our national dignity not only through strength but also through progress?
And in the end, we must not forget Dr AQ Khan's heartfelt words: ""My biggest regret is working for this nation.""

Indonesia vies more Rafale jets,"CN
.
France and Indonesia have signed a preliminary defence pact that could lead to new orders of French military equipment including Rafale fighter jets and Scorpene submarines, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday.
""I am delighted that the letter of intent signed today could open up a new perspective with new orders for Rafales, Scorpenes, light frigates,"" Macron said at a joint press conference alongside Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto. Prabowo said France was one of Indonesia's main partners as it upgrades its military hardware and develops its defence industry through joint production and technology transfers.
Macron arrived in Jakarta from Vietnam on Tuesday night on the second leg of his Southeast Asia tour. The French president is scheduled to fly to Singapore on Thursday. Dassault Aviation shares were up 3.4% in the morning session in Paris. The jets' performance came under scrutiny last month after reports that Rafales used by the Indian air force were shot down by Pakistan's Chinese-made jets in clashes. Reuters

Iran confirms meetings with cleric held in KSA,"AZ
Saudi authorities have not confirmed the arrest.
Iran said Wednesday it has held consular meetings with a cleric detained during the annual Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia, according to local media.
Gholamreza Ghasemian, a well-known cleric and religious figure in Iran, was arrested in the kingdom on Monday after a video circulated online showing him criticising the Saudi government, Iran's ISNA news agency reported.
Saudi authorities have not confirmed the arrest.
In the footage, Ghasemian, dressed in white pilgrimage robes, accused Saudi leaders of turning the Qibla into ""a place for gambling houses, centres of debauchery, and obscene concerts"".
Alireza Bayat, head of Iran's Hajj organisation, said Iranian officials had held three consular meetings with Ghasemian in coordination with the embassy and consulate in Jeddah, ISNA reported.

Namibia to play South Africa for first time,"US
Both sides will lock horns in a one-off T20I on October 11
Namibia will host South Africa for a historic first meeting between the two sides to mark the official opening of their new ground in Windhoek. The one-off T20I will take place on October 11.
Importantly, it will commemorate the opening of Cricket Namibia's first official stadium - previously internationals took place at the Wanderers, also in Windhoek, which is a club ground. The new ground will host the matches during the 2026 Under-19 Men's World Cup and the 2027 Men's ODI World Cup.
Namibia is the co-host for the Under-19 World Cup with Zimbabwe and for the ODI World Cup with Zimbabwe and South Africa. The ground has been under construction since 2021 and will have a capacity of 7000. It is also the home of Namibia's high-performance centre.
""This truly is a memorable occasion,"" Johann Muller, Cricket Namibia CEO, said in a statement. ""The new ground has been a dream for the last four years and has finally materialised. A match against our neighbours, and one of the top cricketing countries in the world, is the perfect way to open this world-class facility.""
Despite being neighbours, South Africa have never played an international against Namibia, at bilateral or tournament level, and the trip across the western border indicates the growth in relations in cricket on the continent.
South Africa and Zimbabwe are both playing a significant role at the African Cricket Association and there are talks of increased fixtures, such as this one, to grow the game. South Africa will also travel to Zimbabwe for the first time in 11 years later this year to play two Tests and a T20I tri-series.
""We are honoured to be part of this historic occasion,"" Pholesti Moseki, CSA CEO, said. ""Namibia are a competitive side, and this fixture reflects the growing strength of cricket on the continent. As a fellow African cricketing nation and the host of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup 2027, we are proud to support the official opening of this new cricket ground, which will be one of the host venues of the tournament.""
By the time the match takes place, Namibia will have also competed in the Africa T20 World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe, where there are two spots available for next year's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. Namibia have played in the last three T20 World Cups, and their highest profile win was over Sri Lanka in Geelong in 2022.

Metropolis braces for scorching heat,"RO
The weather is likely to remain extremely hot and dry, with the maximum temperature potentially exceeding 41°C
The megalopolis is expected to experience extremely hot weather on Thursday, with temperatures likely to exceed 41 degrees Celsius.
On Wednesday, the city recorded intense heat and humidity, with scorching midday winds creating heatwave-like conditions.
Humidity levels rose to 68 per cent, making it feel about five degrees Celsius warmer than the actual temperature.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature recorded in the city was 37.1 degrees Celsius. Due to the high humidity, however, the temperature felt closer to 42 degrees Celsius.
A spokesperson for the Meteorological Department told The Express Tribune that sea breezes have been continuously prevailing in the city.
Nonetheless, the combined effect of rising temperatures, increased humidity (up to 65%), and weak winds is contributing to the ongoing heatwave-like conditions.
According to the forecast issued by the Meteorological Department's Early Warning Centre, Karachi can expect stronger-than-usual winds on Thursday.
However, the weather is likely to remain extremely hot and dry, with the maximum temperature potentially exceeding 41°C.
Meanwhile, light rain is expected in several districts of Sindh, including Ghotki, Kashmore, Shikarpur, Khairpur, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Badin, and Tharparkar.
Despite the chance of rain, most areas of the province are forecast to experience hot to very hot and dry weather accompanied by strong winds.

ILO slashes 2025 job forecast by 7 million,"CN
The report estimates that 84 million jobs across 71 countries are tied to US consumer demand
The International Labour Organisation (ILO) has downgraded its global employment forecast for 2025, projecting 53 million new jobs instead of 60 million. This revision lowers expected employment growth from 1.7% to 1.5%, reflecting a weakening global economic outlook.
The ILO's latest World Employment and Social Outlook (WESO) Update is based on the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s April 2025 World Economic Outlook, which now anticipates global GDP growth at 2.8%, down from 3.2%.
The report estimates that 84 million jobs across 71 countries are tied to US consumer demand. These jobs are increasingly vulnerable due to intensifying trade tensions, especially in the Asia-Pacific, which holds 56 million of them. Canada and Mexico face the highest exposure, with 17.1% of their jobs linked to the US.
ILO Director-General Gilbert F Houngbo warned of potential ripple effects if geopolitical tensions persist. The report also reveals a decline in labour's share of global income — from 53.0% in 2014 to 52.4% in 2024 — resulting in a $1 trillion loss in worker earnings.

"Thar peacocks perish amid heatwave, illness","US
The sand-swept district of Tharparkar is particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change
Severe heatwave and a mysterious illness are claiming the lives of peacocks in Tharparkar. In the past two days alone, at least seven peacocks have died, with three more fatalities reported recently in the village of Railo Rind, Mithi. Several other peacocks are also reported to be sick.
Local residents indicate that a disease has been affecting the peacocks for the past two months. They describe symptoms such as watery eyes, followed by the birds collapsing. While the specific illness remains unclear, officials suggest that the extreme heat and associated hunger and thirst are significant contributing factors to these deaths.
Sindh Wildlife Department Deputy Conservator Mir Ijaz Talpur stated that teams are being dispatched to villages reporting sick peacocks to provide medicine. He emphasised the importance of supplying affected peacocks with food and water in addition to medical treatment. Local communities are actively involved in caring for the distressed birds.
The sand-swept district of Tharparkar is particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Its arid environment means that heatwaves quickly lead to severe water scarcity and food shortages, devastating both human and animal populations.

PSG see end in sight in quest for UCL,"US
They will face Inter Milan in the final on Saturday
It has taken almost 15 years of huge spending by their Qatari owners and an overdue shift away from signing glamorous superstars, but Paris Saint-Germain go into Saturday's Champions League final against Inter Milan as favourites to finally win the coveted trophy for the first time.
A club that for years made a habit of collapsing in spectacular fashion in big Champions League games has been transformed this season as a thrilling young team, brilliantly coached by Luis Enrique, has taken the continent by storm.
Once they might have been ridiculed by football fans around Europe who dismiss their domestic dominance due to the huge financial advantage they enjoy — PSG have just won their 11th Ligue 1 title in 13 years and eighth French Cup in a decade.
Now, however, they draw admiration from rivals  — ""This is the most complete team we have faced,"" said Arne Slot, whose Liverpool team lost to PSG in the last 16 in March.
The Parisian bid to dominate Europe began in 2011, when Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) bought a club in dire straits.
Their investment immediately catapulted PSG into the top-10 wealthiest clubs in Europe and the rise has been vertiginous since.
More than two billion euros ($2.28 billion) has been spent on transfers, and by last year, PSG's annual revenue of over 800 million euros had made them the third-richest club in the world according to analysts Deloitte, behind only Real Madrid and Manchester City.
Those two clubs are the last two winners of the Champions League, while PSG's only previous appearance in the final came in 2020, when they lost to Bayern Munich behind closed doors in Lisbon during the Covid pandemic.
PSG's Qatari president Nasser al-Khelaifi had initially said the plan was to win the Champions League within five years of buying the club.
That did not happen, while signing both Neymar, for a world-record 222 million euros, and Kylian Mbappe in the same summer in 2017 was also not enough to deliver Europe's biggest prize.
Indeed PSG even went backwards after signing Lionel Messi in 2021.
Change of approach
""It is a trophy the club have been waiting a long time for, but it is very difficult to win,"" insisted Pedro Miguel Pauleta, a star PSG striker in the first decade of this century.
The genesis of their current success goes back to 2023, when the chronically-unfit Neymar and the ageing and unmotivated Messi departed.
That was the summer Luis Enrique arrived, replacing Christophe Galtier to become the eighth coach of the Qatar era.
With their all-time record scorer Mbappe spearheading the attack, PSG got to last season's Champions League semi-finals, losing to Borussia Dortmund.
By then Mbappe had made it clear he would be leaving, yet Luis Enrique kept insisting his team would be better without the France superstar.
""Last season we were also a proper team. I said we were going to improve the side. Players came in and all the stats say we are a better team now,"" the Spaniard said last week.
Hungry young team
The former Barcelona boss needed a young, energetic and hungry squad to make a success of his preferred style of football and they have recruited some of the world's most exciting young players.
Centre-back Willian Pacho, midfielder Joao Neves, and wingers Bradley Barcola and Desire Doue have been outstanding additions.
Ousmane Dembele has been turned by Luis Enrique into a clinical finisher who has 33 goals this season.
Khvicha Kvaratskhelia joined from Napoli in January for good measure, and the oldest player in the squad now is Marquinhos, at 31.
""We have the players to win the Champions League this year, next year or in eight years. We have the base on which to build a great team for the future,"" Khelaifi said in a recent interview with German media.
""The new star at Paris Saint-Germain is the team and I am really proud of the way in which we have transformed the philosophy of the club in such a short space of time.""
In fact it could be said the new star is the coach, so it is over to him to deliver in Munich.
""We began preparing for this when we started pre-season training. It was in the minds of everyone at the club from then,"" he said last weekend.
""It is a game we have had marked in the calendar. We are coming into it in very good shape, full of confidence, and we are determined to go down in the history of the club.""

Kaghan Valley experiences unusual cold snap,"US
Snowfall at Babusar Top highlights the effects of climate change
The Kaghan Valley is experiencing abnormal weather patterns these days most likely due to the effects of climate change.
The region saw snow melting in the high mountains in April, unlike the previous year. By the end of May, snowfall created a January-like atmosphere.
After more than three inches of snowfall in Babusar Top and surrounding valleys, temperatures have dropped, and heavy rainfall in lower areas has increased water flow in streams and rivers. This weather pattern is expected to continue for the next three days.
Heavy rainfall began in the Balakot area and surrounding regions yesterday, leading to snowfall in the upper areas of the Kaghan Valley.
As a result, temperatures have cooled, and May now feels more like January. With up to three inches of snow on Babusar Top, a cold wave has returned to the valley, and the snowfall continues intermittently. After the snow on the Kaghan Valley's mountains melted in April, there had been a noticeable rise in temperatures, but yesterday's rain and snow changed the weather drastically.
The four seasons of the Kaghan Valleysummer, winter, spring, and autumnappear to be impacted, with alterations in weather patterns clearly reflecting the effects of climate change.
If timely measures are not taken to address this issue, not only will the Kaghan Valley be affected, but Pakistan could lose its distinct seasons as well.
Local experts in the Kaghan Valley believe several factors contribute to the region's climate change. Major reasons include unregulated construction and forest fires.
While fires in the valley's forests increase temperatures, unchecked construction, particularly the development of cement structures, is also contributing to the rise in temperature.
If urgent actions are not taken to mitigate these changes, all of Pakistan's four natural seasons could be at risk.

Capital libraries face decline in visitor footfall,"CN
Rapid rise of social media blamed for dying culture of reading
With the rise of immersive technologies, book reading has become a rarity and libraries are struggling to attract visitors in the federal capital.
Major public libraries in the city, including the National Library of Pakistan in Sector G-5, Aiwan-e-Quaid Library at Fatima Jinnah Park, CDA Public Library and Reading Hall in Sector G-11, Smart Street Library in Sector F-6, and Islamabad Public Library in Sector H-9, are facing dwindling footfall.
Once revered as temples of knowledge, libraries now stand deserted — a testament to the decline of a culture that once cherished books.
Once bustling with book lovers, libraries now sit empty, reflecting the waning interest in reading.
Muhammad Taimoor Qureshi, an official from Read Pakistan, described the decline in reading culture as a concerning threat.
He attributed it to several factors, including limited access to quality education and libraries.
""To address this challenge, establishing more libraries and increasing book availability is crucial,"" he suggested.
Taimoor emphasised the need for a national reading policy and community engagement, which he believes could help spark a positive change.
He shared a special message for the youth, urging them to embrace reading as a path to personal growth and empowerment.
""Align your daily routines with your schedules, and try to dedicate at least fifteen minutes a day to reading. Reading is like an ocean, filled with a motley of wonderful pearls that lead you to the horizon of knowledge. It not only enriches you intellectually but also paves the way toward success and the affluence of wisdom,"" Taimoor added.
Shafique, a library administrator, said, ""It's heartbreaking to see libraries empty. Books were once our gateway to knowledge and imagination.""
He attributed the declining interest in reading to the rise of digital media and shifting lifestyles. ""People are more inclined toward social media and online content,"" he added. ""It's a challenge to make reading appealing to the younger generation,"" he stated.
A graduate student, Ali, echoed similar thoughts and said he prefers watching videos or scrolling through my phone rather than reading a book. The decline in the reading culture is a concerning issue that warrants serious attention and immediate action by the relevant authorities, it was recommended.

Eid sacrifice comes at hefty price,"US
Sellers blame rising transportation, operational expenses
With Eidul Azha drawing near, trading activity in cattle markets across Lahore is gaining momentum. However, soaring prices of sacrificial animals have left many citizens frustrated, while sellers point to rising costs of animal husbandry and transportation as key contributors to the surge.
A visit to Shahpur Kanjran — the city's largest cattle market — and several designated sale points revealed a wide variety of livestock on display. However, buyers said prices had jumped by 80 to 90 per cent compared to last year, blaming market manipulation and inadequate regulatory oversight.
Kamran Malik, a buyer at one of the markets, said he had planned to purchase a goat but was taken aback by the prices. ""Even a small goat now starts at Rs80,000 to Rs90,000, and some are priced well into the hundreds of thousands depending on breed and appearance,"" he said. ""It's becoming unaffordable for the average family.""
Prices of larger animalssuch as calves, cows, and bullsare even steeper, starting around Rs200,000 and reaching Rs500,000 or more for healthy specimens.
Premium animals with distinctive features or exceptional build are being sold for over a million rupees in some markets.
Muhammad Buksh, another shopper, criticised what he described as the commercialisation of a sacred tradition. ""Eidul Azha teaches sacrifice, but it has turned into a season of profiteering,"" he said.
""Traders cite inflation, fodder, and fuel costs, but in the end, it's the middle class that's burdened,"" he said.
Other citizens echoed the sentiment and called for government intervention. Zia Qureshi, visiting a market in the Ravi area, urged authorities to regulate livestock prices. ""If these trends persist, many people won't be able to perform qurbani this year,"" he said.
Livestock traders defended the rising prices, citing increased operational expenses. Muhammad Boota, a farmer from Rahim Yar Khan, said fuel price hikes had doubled transportation costs. ""From loading charges to roadside bribes, the journey from our farms to city markets is expensive,"" he said. ""People assume we're overcharging, but we're just trying to recover the costs of raising animals all year.""
Shahid, another trader, said that despite the evening rush, overall sales remained slow. ""Most people are here to survey prices. Nearly half are not committing to purchases yetpossibly waiting for last-minute deals,"" he added.
In light of the growing activity, Lahore Division Commissioner Zaid bin Maqsood visited the Halloki cattle market on Wednesday to assess preparations and ensure compliance with official regulations.
The commissioner inspected service camps set up by the livestock department, Lahore Waste Management Company, Rescue 1122, and other agencies. The Wagah assistant commissioner briefed him on the operational setup and preparedness.
The commissioner reviewed the availability of essential facilities, including electricity, tents, potable water, sanitation, and medical support. He also interacted with traders to gather first-hand feedback.
Special focus was placed on veterinary services. The commissioner examined the stock and expiry dates of medicines and verified staff attendance.
He stressed the need for strict enforcement against unauthorised cattle enclosures and directed officials to take immediate action to dismantle illegal setups, maintaining zero tolerance for violations.

Novak Djokovic made a clinical start to his latest pursuit of a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title at the French Open on Tuesday, while women's contenders Coco Gauff and Mirra Andreeva successfully got their campaigns under way at a windy Roland Garros.
The 38-year-old Djokovic had little trouble in seeing off 98th-ranked American Mackenzie McDonald 6-3, 6-3, 6-3, three days after becoming only the third man to win 100 ATP titles with his victory in Geneva.
""I don't know how many more Grand Slams I've got left in my body,"" said Djokovic, seeded sixth and playing in Paris for the first time since winning Olympic gold last August.
""I'm just trying to enjoy every moment in this magnificent stadium.""
The three-time French Open champion lost his opening matches in both Monte Carlo and Madrid earlier in the clay-court season, but was dominant against McDonald, with his only hic-cup coming when he failed to serve out the second set in the eighth game.
The Serb, who withdrew injured before the quarter-finals in 2024, will meet a Frenchman in either Corentin Moutet or Clement Tabur in round two.
Djokovic is on the same half of the draw as world number one Jannik Sinner and last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev, who saw off American teenager Learner Tien 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
World number three Zverev is hoping to go a step further than 12 months ago when he lost the final to Carlos Alcaraz in five sets, his third defeat in as many Grand Slam finals.
His preparation has been far from ideal after his plane was struck by lightning on the journey to Paris following a last-16 loss in Hamburg. The 19-year-old Tien, who knocked out Daniil Medvedev en route to the Australian Open last 16 in January, was overpowered on Court Suzanne Lenglen.
Zverev, who has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the last four French Opens, will next face Dutchman Jesper de Jong.
Former US Open champion and five-time Grand Slam runner-up Medvedev was dumped out in the first round for the sixth time in Paris, losing a dramatic clash with Cameron Norrie 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5.
Grigor Dimitrov retired injured for a fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament, calling it quits due to a leg injury when leading American Ethan Quinn by two sets to one.
Ninth seed Alex de Minaur, a quarter-finalist at each of the past four majors, started well with an accomplished 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) win over Serbia's Laslo Djere.
Miami champion Jakub Mensik came through an entertaining match against Frenchman Alexandre Muller, repeatedly taunting the home crowd during a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 6-3 victory.
Gauff, Andreeva impress
In the women's draw, 2022 runner-up Gauff brushed aside Australia's Olivia Gadecki 6-2, 6-2.
Gauff, the 2023 US Open winner, has not won a tournament since last year's WTA Finals but reached the finals at both Madrid and Rome this month.
The 21-year-old American has reached the quarter-finals or better in each of her past four visits to Roland Garros.
""I knew it wasn't going to be a clean match with how windy it was,"" said the second seed, who initially forgot her racquets which had to be collected by a ball boy.
""Honestly, it was two different matches depending on which side of the court you were on.""
Rising Russian star Andreeva is eyeing her maiden Grand Slam crown after WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells and recovered well after falling 3-0 down to Spaniard Cristina Bucsa in the first set. The 18-year-old quickly overturned the double-break deficit and eventually cruised to a 6-4, 6-3 victory over the world number 98.
""With time I played better and better, so I felt like closer to the end of the match was playing good, not like in the beginning,"" said the sixth seed. Andreeva, who reached the semi-finals last year, will play American Ashlyn Krueger in the second round on Thursday.
Third seed Jessica Pegula also made serene progress with a 6-2, 6-4 success against Romania's Anca Todoni as the American returned to Roland Garros after missing the 2024 edition due to injuries.
Two-time former Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka hammered Belgium's Yanina Wickmayer, who will retire after Wimbledon, 6-0, 6-0 on Court 6, while Magdalena Frech knocked out three-time Grand Slam finalist Ons Jabeur.

Traffic challan spree irks Hafizabad residents,"US
Record 46,400 tickets issued during ongoing year
The Hafizabad Traffic Police have issued a staggering 46,400 challans during the current year, amassing over Rs41.3 million in fines for various violations.
While police officials have hailed the figures as evidence of stringent enforcement and improved road safety, the district's residents and business community have voiced criticism, accusing the authorities of adopting a punitive, quota-driven approach rather than focusing on sustainable traffic management.
According to the official breakdown for 2025, the traffic police fined 6,209 motorists for one-way violations, 6,688 for driving without a licence, 1,545 for riding motorcycles without helmets, 8,014 for overloading of goods or passengers, 2,107 underage drivers, 1,724 for lane and line violations.
As many as 2,254 vehicles were fined or impounded via crane-lifter operations.
The violations collectively generated Rs41.3 million in fines, an amount considered unusually high for a district of Hafizabad's size and population.
Senior officials praised the performance of the traffic department and reaffirmed their commitment to a ""zero-tolerance"" policy.
""We believe in law enforcement, but this is turning into economic harassment,"" said a shopkeeper from Madni Bazaar, a commercial hub where traders staged strikes twice earlier this year.
Protesters described the fining practices as ""indiscriminate,"" arguing that repeated penalties — especially in a time of economic inflation, are burdening low- and middle-income citizens.
A spokesperson for the traffic department defended their actions, stating, ""Ensuring the safety of lives and property is our foremost duty. Obedience to traffic laws is a hallmark of responsible citizenship, and a safe, civilised society is only possible through collective discipline.""
However, local residents appealed to the authorities to review the traffic police's current operational model. Critics argue that enforcement must go hand-in-hand with education, improved infrastructure and professional training of traffic personnel.
""There's a difference between discipline and distress,"" said one resident. ""What we need is community-oriented enforcement, not revenue-driven policing."" He warned that continued public distrust could undermine both the legitimacy and effectiveness of traffic law enforcement in the area.

YouTuber denied bail by court,"US
During the interview, Adil allegedly made derogatory remarks against the complainant, Ayesha Chaudhry.
An additional sessions court of Lahore on Wednesday dismissed the pre-arrest bail application of Haseeb Sajjad Khan, host of a YouTube channel, in a case involving allegations of cyber defamation and harassment.
The case, registered at the FIA Cyber Crime Wing, Lahore, stems from a controversial interview Khan conducted with co-accused Dr Omar Adil.
During the interview, Adil allegedly made derogatory remarks against the complainant, Ayesha Chaudhry.
The interview, later uploaded to Khan's channel, gained widespread attention online, prompting Chaudhry to lodge a complaint under Sections 21 and 24 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016 - pertaining to cyber defamation - as well as Sections 509 (insulting the modesty of a woman) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
Khan's counsel, Advocate Zain Qureshi, argued that his client merely facilitated the interview and openly criticised Adil's offensive remarks, claiming that Khan bore no direct responsibility for the defamatory content.
However, Judge Muhammad Suleman Ghumman ruled that Khan, by choosing to upload and promote the video, played a role in disseminating the content.

Russia proposes Ukraine talks in Istanbul on June 2,"US
Lavrov says Moscow to give Kyiv its peace terms
Russia proposed the next round of direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2 with a view to achieving a sustainable peace settlement, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a video statement on Wednesday.
The statement came after the head of Russia's delegation at peace talks on Ukraine, Vladimir Medinsky, said on the Telegram messaging app that he had called Ukraine's Defence Minister Rustem Umerov with proposals for the date and venue of the next meeting.
""Our delegation, led by Vladimir Medinsky, is ready to present a memorandum to the Ukrainian delegation and provide the necessary explanations during a second round of direct talks in Istanbul on Monday, June 2,"" Lavrov said.
""We hope that all those who are sincerely, and not just in words, interested in the success of the peace process will support holding a new round of direct Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Istanbul,"" Lavrov added.
""I would like to once again express our gratitude to our Turkish partners for providing a hospitable venue, as confirmed yesterday by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan during his visit to Moscow,"" he said.
Under pressure from US President Donald Trump to end the bloodiest conflict in Europe since World War II, delegates from the warring countries met earlier this month in Istanbul for the first time since March 2022, the month after Russia sent troops to its neighbour.
The May 16 talks failed to reach agreement on a ceasefire and Moscow said certain conditions must be met before such a move was possible. Russian President Vladimir Putin, after a call with Trump on May 19, said that Moscow was ready to work with Ukraine on a memorandum about a future peace accord.
Medinsky said Russia was ready for talks and that he expected a reply from Ukraine. ""Let me emphasise: right there, on the spot, we are ready to begin an essential, substantive discussion of each of the points of the package agreement on a possible ceasefire,"" he said. There was no immediate reaction from Kyiv.
Separately, Russian foreign ministry's spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said it was agreed that Russia and Ukraine would each prepare their vision of ""modalities of settlement and ceasefire"" and would discuss and exchange the documents at the next round of talks. agencies

Student's family attacks school teacher,"US
Police register case against woman, husband and her cop brother
Many mothers get angry when teachers punish their children but a mother went a bit too far when she sent her cop brother and husband to beat up female teachers for trying to discipline her daughter for habitually coming late to school.
The Jamshed Quarters police registered a case involving an incident in which the parents of a student, accompanied by a police officer, allegedly assaulted female teachers at a private school on Jamshed Road. The confrontation reportedly stemmed from a disciplinary action taken by a teacher against the student for habitual tardiness.
The FIR was lodged on the complaint of the affected teacher, Saira Iqbal. According to her statement, on May 16, she reprimanded a student, Eshal Shahid, for repeatedly arriving late to school and briefly made her stand as a disciplinary measure. The following day, the student's mother visited the school and, after confronting the principal, verbally abused Saira. Both the teacher and the principal offered an apology, after which the situation appeared to have been resolved.
However, on May 26, the situation escalated. According to the FIR, Eshal Shahid's father, Shahid, and her uncle, Abdul Hafeez - who identified himself as the SHO at Kalakot police station - arrived at the school accompanied by the student's mother. They physically assaulted teacher Maria Shahid and Saira. SSP East Dr Farrukh Raza confirmed that legal proceedings are underway based on the school administration's complaint.

Govt to revive development forum this year,"US
World Bank offers support for advancing reforms, strengthening project implementation capacity
Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal has reiterated the government's resolve to revive the Pakistan Development Forum later this year – a platform that fosters strategic dialogue between the government of Pakistan and its development partners.
During a meeting with newly appointed World Bank Country Director for Pakistan Bolorma Amgaabazar on Wednesday, the minister appreciated the World Bank's continued partnership with Pakistan. Departing country director Najy Benhassine also participated in the meeting, according to a press release issued by the ministry.
Iqbal acknowledged the instrumental role played by Benhassine in deepening development cooperation during his tenure. He expressed confidence that the positive trajectory would continue under the new World Bank official, especially under the evolving priorities set forth in Pakistan's long-term development road map.
He pointed out that the government had launched Uraan Pakistan – a comprehensive and future-oriented development framework designed to turn the country into a $3 trillion economy by 2047.
He noted that the initiative was rooted in five strategic pillars, known as 5Es, which comprised exports, e-Pakistan, environment and climate resilience, energy and infrastructure, and equity, ethics and empowerment. This programme is focused on smart governance, inclusive growth and public sector transformation.
""In today's fast-changing global context, planning must be intelligent and adaptive,"" the minister remarked. ""Uraan is about creating hope, harnessing innovation and enabling long-term stability through scenario-based planning and institutional reform.""
The minister underscored the planning ministry's leadership during the recent national emergencies, including the 2022 floods and the Covid-19 pandemic. He cited the examples as successful case studies of integrated planning and swift execution – the core principles being institutionalised under Uraan.
Iqbal told the World Bank officials that his ministry was leading an extensive consultative process to modernise civil services and improve public sector delivery.
The World Bank officials offered continued support for advancing reforms and strengthening the implementation capacity, particularly for large-scale infrastructure and social development projects.
Discussions between the two sides included the significance of collaborative planning, federal-provincial coordination and institutional resilience. At the conclusion, the minister reaffirmed the commitment to deepening cooperation with the World Bank in pursuit of a resilient, inclusive and future-ready Pakistan.

Asian bonds draw large foreign inflow in April,"US
Investors buy bonds worth $8.9b, highest for any month since last August
Investors from outside Asia piled into bonds from the region in April, especially in the second half of the month, seeking to diversify from the United States in their quest for markets with stable, high yields and appreciating currencies.
These investors bought bonds worth $8.92 billion, on a net basis, in April, the highest for any month since last August, according to data from regulatory authorities and bond market associations in South Korea, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia.
Interest rate cuts in the region – in India, Thailand and the Philippines last month and in Indonesia earlier this month – also enticed investors as bond prices rose in tandem.
The highest inflows were into South Korea, where foreign investors bought $7.91 billion in bonds, the most since May 2023, although they pulled $6.97 billion from the equity market.
Investors also added $2.37 billion in Malaysian bonds and $1.6 billion in Thai bonds. In contrast, Indonesia recorded net outflows of $1.4 billion due to concerns over potential fiscal slippages and sluggish growth.
Despite a rate cut, India recorded outflows of $1.55 billion, which analysts said was mainly due to nerves following the country's short-lived military conflict with Pakistan.
US President Donald Trump's announcement of reciprocal tariffs early in April sparked turmoil across financial markets globally, but he announced a 90-day pause for most countries later in the month, which calmed investors and drew them back to markets, including the bond market, analysts said.

VOA nears its mic-drop moment,"CN
.
Termination notices are expected to go out to all remaining Voice of America employees this week, Politico reported on Wednesday, likely marking the end for a media broadcaster founded in 1942 to counter Nazi propaganda.
The termination notices would affect the 800 remaining workers at the agency, which operates in nearly 50 languages and broadcasts to authoritarian regimes, Politico reported, citing four VOA employees familiar with the matter.
VOA has been on the chopping block since March, when President Donald Trump ordered the gutting of the government-funded media outlet's parent, the US Agency for Global Media (USAGM), along with six other federal agencies.
Earlier this month, nearly 600 VOA contractors were dismissed, leaving the roughly 800 remaining workers. Prior to the cuts, VOA reached 360 million people a week, many living under authoritarian regimes.

Major shake-up in ICT police amid rising crime,"US
Sources say authorities have decided to replace SHOs of all police stations
In response to the alarming surge in street crime across the capital, the Islamabad Police have initiated a major reshuffling of personnel.
Following the transfer of 370 officials, including sub-inspectors, assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), and constables, across 27 police stations, the department has now decided to also replace all Station House Officers (SHOs).
This move comes amid growing public pressure and widespread calls for reform. Citizens, especially on social media platforms, have welcomed the earlier wave of transfers and are now strongly advocating for the replacement of SHOs as well. Many have voiced concerns that without changes at the leadership level, efforts to curb crime would remain ineffective.
The transfer of SHOs is expected to take place before Eidul Azha. The decision is part of a broader strategy to improve law enforcement and restore public confidence in the police force.
Officials with a history of complaints or poor performance are being reassigned to less sensitive roles, such as postings in police lines, jail security, or station guards. The comprehensive reshuffle is aimed at bringing in more capable officers and ensuring accountability within the force.
Security plan outlined
Meanwhile, a special security plan has been formulated to protect buyers from street criminals in livestock markets in the federal capital. Around 1,200 officers and personnel have been deployed in six cattle markets.
They will take strict legal action against those who set up illegal cattle markets. The Islamabad DIG stated that strict action will be taken against those who violate SOPs. Markets are not permitted to be established anywhere except at designated locations.

US banks tiptoe toward cryptocurrencies,"US
Await more green lights from regulators, seek clarity around anti-money laundering rules, supervision
Big US banks are holding internal discussions about expanding into cryptocurrencies as they get stronger endorsements from regulators, but initial steps will be tentative, centring on pilot programmes, partnerships or limited crypto trading, according to four industry executives. Wall Street giants that had been largely blocked from many crypto activities by strict regulations are poised to grow quickly.
Yet the biggest lenders are still hesitant to be the first among rivals to expand too heavily into crypto in case they fall afoul of changing rules, said the four executives, who declined to be identified since they were discussing internal business plans.
If a major firm expands without issues, others will be fast followers to run small-scale pilot projects and weigh other business prospects, the executives said.
Jamie Dimon, CEO of the largest US bank, JPMorgan Chase, ruled out getting into custody – storing crypto assets for clients – or expanding significantly even if regulations ease.
US President Donald Trump vowed to become the first ""crypto president"" before he took office. He has since wooed the industry's elite at the White House, promised to boost the adoption of digital assets and said he aims to create a strategic bitcoin reserve.
While there are welcoming signs, banks are seeking even clearer guidelines from the government clarifying what they can do in crypto, more than half a dozen industry executives said.
Custody businesses to store and manage crypto assets are promising, bankers and executives said, but they have thin margins and potentially pose high risks.
Most banks are likely to enter custody businesses through partnerships with existing crypto firms, sources said.
Charles Schwab CEO Rick Wurster told Reuters earlier this month that the traffic lights from financial regulators were flashing ""pretty green"" for large firms to grow in crypto. The signals have reinforced Schwab's plans to offer spot crypto trading within a year, he said.
New regulators under Trump have also signalled more bank-friendly crypto policies. The US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency paved the way for lenders to engage in some crypto activities, such as custody, some stablecoin activities and participation in distributed ledger networks.
The Securities and Exchange Commission also scrapped earlier accounting guidance that made it expensive for banks to deal in crypto.
Bank of America could launch stablecoins, its CEO Brian Moynihan said earlier this year, and the US banking industry will embrace cryptocurrencies for payments if regulations permit them.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley wants to work with regulators to see how it can be a middleman for crypto-related transactions, CEO Ted Pick said earlier this year. The lender is also exploring adding crypto to its e-trade platform, a source said.
Some of the large banks are also exploring issuing a joint stablecoin, with the conversations in initial stages, another banking source said.
Big banks seek more clarity around anti-money laundering rules and supervision before diving deeper into crypto. They are also asking for consistent guidelines across banking and market regulators before launching new businesses in digital assets, whose values are volatile.
For now, banks are weighing their crypto prospects and running small-scale pilot programmes.
""While a much-improved environment, banks will continue to have concerns around anti-money laundering and regulatory compliance,"" said Matthew Biben, co-head of the global financial services group at law firm King & Spalding.
Shifting landscape
Banks want to understand if they can engage in crypto lending, or if they are allowed to become market makers for digital assets, one of the banking sources said.
The rules for traditional banking businesses are very well defined and there is complete clarity over what a bank is allowed to do and what is outside their ambit, similar well-defined guidelines are needed for digital assets too.
The working group on crypto under David Sacks, the Trump-appointed crypto czar, has no representation from banking regulators, which needs to be amended if the big banks are allowed to play any meaningful role in the business, two banking sources said.

Dark web fuels drug shift: ANF,"US
Law enforcement agencies are tightening controls on drug smuggling via courier and parcel services
The use of the dark web and social media platforms to procure drugs using cryptocurrency has reached alarming levels, posing new challenges for Pakistan's anti-narcotics efforts. Authorities report a growing influx of weed and cocaine from Western and African countries, alongside a troubling shift from plant-based substances to synthetic drugs.
The law enforcement agencies are tightening controls on drug smuggling via courier and parcel servicesroutes increasingly exploited by traffickers seeking to bypass conventional checkpoints. Over the past year, 33 drug trafficking groups, including a prominent Nigerian network, have been dismantled.
Smugglers are also adopting increasingly sophisticated methods to conceal narcotics, often hiding them in sports goods, surgical instruments, and textile shipmentstactics seen not only as criminal but as attempts to damage Pakistan's global reputation.
According to Brigadier Syed Imran Ali, Director Enforcement at the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) Headquarters Pakistan has maintained its poppy-free status since 2001, a milestone reaffirmed this year.
Speaking at a briefing in Karachi, Brigadier Ali noted that Pakistan's geographic location makes it a key transit route for international drug trafficking. He expressed concern over the rising use of the dark web and social media platforms for purchasing drugs through cryptocurrency, terming it a growing threat. Traffickers, he added, are increasingly shifting from plant-based substances to synthetic narcotics. Recent ANF operations have uncovered significant inflows of weed and cocaine from Western and African countries.
Brigadier Muhammad Umar Farooq, Regional Directorate Commander Sindh, stated that a significant aspect of drug smuggling involves the courier and parcel system, both internationally and domestically. While major courier offices are equipped with scanners and require documents such as copies of national identity cards and complete addresses of senders and recipients, traffickers are exploiting loopholes in neighborhood-level parcel handling. As a result, institutional measures are being further strengthened to counter drug smuggling through couriers and parcels.
Out of Pakistan's 240 million population, approximately 170 million are between the ages of 18 and 31. Protecting this vast youth demographic from the scourge of drugs is a national responsibility. While the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) continues its efforts to curb drug smuggling, there is a pressing need for widespread social awareness. Addressing this challenge requires collective action across all sectors of society.
Providing details of crackdowns conducted throughout 2024 and the current mid-year periodspanning roughly one and a half yearsANF officials stated that joint operations with various individuals and institutions resulted in the seizure of 452 tons of drugs. Of this, the ANF alone recovered over 244 tons, accounting for more than 58 per cent of all anti-drug operations.
At airports across the country, 436 suspects were arrested, and attempts to smuggle drugs through 373 parcels were foiled. Maritime operations led to the seizure of 19 containers. Efforts to smuggle drugs to Gulf countries were also thwarted, resulting in the arrest of 403 suspects and the seizure of 5,783 kilograms of narcotics.
In collaboration with international organisations, 44 maritime operations were conducted against drug trafficking networks, leading to the dismantling of 33 groups, including a Nigerian syndicate.
Attempts to malign Pakistan's reputation through drug smuggling concealed in sports goods, surgical instruments and textile products have been uncovered. Nationals from Afghanistan and Nigeria have been found to be more frequently involved in these operations. Meanwhile, Pakistan ranks fifth among the countries most affected by climate change. In line with environmental concerns, the ANF incinerates confiscated drugs in secure facilities rather than burning them in open fields.
The rising use of drugs in educational institutions is alarming. The ANF has conducted multiple operations around these institutions, seizing 1,420 kilograms of drugs. A total of 363 operations aimed at curbing drug spread were carried out, leading to the arrest of 421 suspects identified through intelligence as suppliers to students.
Since 2005, rehabilitation efforts have helped 30,000 drug addicts return to normal life. The ANF not only targets those involved in the drug trade but also actively pursues legal action to ensure their conviction. Following arrests, the ANF has achieved an impressive conviction rate of 85 per cent.

Norrie stuns Medvedev in French Open,"PK
He defeated the Russian seed 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5
Britain's Cameron Norrie ousted former world number one Daniil Medvedev in a marathon five-set first round match at the French Open on Tuesday.
Former US Open champion and five-time Grand Slam runner-up Medvedev was dumped out in the first round for the sixth time in Paris, losing 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5 in just under four hours.
British number one Norrie, ranked 81, threw his racquet in the air in delight as he claimed his first win in five meetings with the 11th-seeded Russian.
Norrie had battled back from a break down in the decider, surviving after Medvedev had served for the match at 5-4 in the fifth set.
""Disappointed to lose, that I didn't manage to serve it out,"" said Medvedev.
""It was a great fight. He played well. I didn't play good enough. So that's why I lost.""
Norrie said: ""Playing Daniil is not easy. It was always going to be a tricky match for me. It was just pure emotion at the end and pure instinct.
""I lost to him two weeks ago. He completely chopped me in Rome. In a Slam, beating him in five sets is impressive for me. I can take a lot of confidence.""
Norrie said his semi-final on clay in Geneva last week against 24-time Grand Slam winner Novak Djokovic had been ""really helpful"" in preparing for Roland Garros.
""I felt it was just a continuation of that match today. It was like playing the fourth set against Novak in the first set against Daniil.
""I managed to get it over the line, it was a crazy match.""
The 29-year-old Medvedev's best finish in Paris was the quarter-finals in 2021.
Norrie, also 29, plays the second round in Paris for the fifth time against Argentina's Federico Gomez who rallied past American Aleksandar Kovacevic 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-1.
""Massive forehand. Massive serve. I know on his day, he's very tough to beat,"" said Norrie of 144th-ranked Gomez. ""He must be playing well to beat Kovacevic on clay. It's a huge win.""
Fonseca thanks Kuerten
Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca began his French Open campaign with a 6-2 6-4 6-2 win over Hubert Hurkacz in front of a packed crowd on Court Seven and attributed the huge support to the popularity of compatriot and former champion Gustavo Kuerten.
All three of former world number one Kuerten's Grand Slam triumphs came at the French Open (1997, 2000 and 2001) and 18-year-old Fonseca said that he had made the tournament more popular with Brazilian tennis fans.
""I knew there is going to be a lot of Brazilians here in Paris, a lot of Brazilians living here and they come a lot,"" Fonseca told reporters after his win over 30th seed Hurkacz on Tuesday.
""I think because of Guga (Kuerten), because of the tradition, there is a lot of Brazilians.""
One of the rising stars of the men's tour, Fonseca shocked ninth seed Andrey Rublev on his Grand Slam main draw debut at the Australian Open in January and became the youngest Brazilian to win an ATP tournament at the Argentina Open the following month.
Fonseca said he wanted to focus on improving himself instead of the growing pressure brought on by rising expectations.
""Sometimes the pressure is going to come. It's normal. You need to deal with it,"" he added.
Fonseca may not enjoy the same level of support in the next round on Thursday as he faces Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert.

"Iran border to stay open 24/7 during Muharram, Arbaeen","US
Naqvi discusses illegal immigration with Momeni
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met with Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni in Tehran on Wednesday where both the countries made several important decisions to help pilgrims and improve border cooperation.
The two ministers agreed that the Pakistan-Iran border will remain open 24 hours a day during Muharram and Arbaeen to facilitate religious pilgrims. The Iranian government will also provide accommodation and meals in Mashhad for 5,000 Pakistani pilgrims.
To solve issues quickly, a hotline will be set up between the two countries. A special three-nation meeting involving Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq will be held in Mashhad before Arbaeen to plan better arrangements for pilgrims.
Both sides also agreed to increase the number of flights for pilgrims and discussed sending pilgrims by sea.
They also talked about working together to stop illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug smuggling.
Improving border security and cooperation between the two countries was also discussed.
Mohsin Naqvi thanked the Iranian government for supporting Pakistani pilgrims and assured full cooperation regarding the release of Iranian fishermen who accidentally entered Pakistani waters.
Senior officials from both countries were present at the meeting.

Prehistoric tools made of whale bones found in France,"US
.
Artifacts found at archeological sites in France and Spain along the Bay of Biscay shoreline show that humans have been crafting tools from whale bones since more than 20,000 years ago, illustrating anew the resourcefulness of prehistoric people.
The tools, primarily hunting implements such as projectile points, were fashioned from the bones of at least five species of large whales, the researchers said.
Bones from sperm whales were the most abundant, followed by fin whales, gray whales, right or bowhead whales — two species indistinguishable with the analytical method used in the study — and blue whales.
With seafaring capabilities by humans not developing until thousands of years later, the Ice Age hunter-gatherers who made these implements would have been unable to actually hunt whales for their resources in the Bay of Biscay, a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean.
""These whales were likely opportunistically acquired from stranded animals or drifted carcasses, rather than actively hunted,"" said biomolecular archaeologist Krista McGrath of the Autonomous University of Barcelona, co-lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Communications.

Military notes ­— perceptual battle between India and Pakistan,"PK
The 16-hour skirmish diminished India's role as a counterbalance to China
In a series from this week, we shall explore the various dimensions of the May 2025 India-Pakistan stand-off after the Pahalgam carnage on April 22, 2025.
First, what happened in the perceptual world? The aftermath of Pahalgam and Operation Bunyan Marsus (Iron Wall) should demonstrate 'strategic humility'. Miscalculations by Indian leaders – political and military – should never be forgiven in silence. In 'teaching Pakistan a lesson', India not only 'altered the regional equation', it also rehyphenated with Pakistan, something it loathed, after its hard-won Clinton-era de-hyphenation. And New Delhi unwittingly exposed itself to a parity with Islamabad that it vehemently denied under hubris, arrogance and over-confidence.
Rabid anchors like Arnab Goswami and military analysts like the froth-fuming Maj Gen Gagandeep Bakhshi and Major Gaurav Arya steered the debate about complex realities into loud nationalism, muting the voices of reason from the few and far between. They turned national strategy into a charade of slogans without substance. India, in doing so, lost its strategic narrative.
Intoxicated with its new-found economic relevance, India walked into the trap of 'buying and bullying into influence', only to lose both. It triggered the most dangerous regional escalation since Kargil without any investigation, without any shareable proof, without any satellite imagery, without any international inquiry and without remorse, just guided by 'nationalist theatrics', media jingoism and short-term political gains – all to abrogate Indus Water Treaty and humiliate Pakistan. And it failed.
A 'pauper' Pakistani response sent India suing for ceasefire, after being forced out of the skies, after targeted destruction on land, and a good drubbing in Kashmir. New Delhi 'mistook Pakistan's composure for collapse'. Islamabad's response was doctrinal and not theatrical. Pakistan's 'digital kill web' proved far more dangerous than terrorism, which India blames on Islamabad.
The 16-hour skirmish diminished India's role as a counterbalance to China, as a rising regional power and as a reliable partner. Instead of teaching a lesson to Pakistan, India was taught one – worth inclusion in the syllabi of all staff colleges and war courses.
From the skirmish, neither Pakistan emerged as a dwarf two-foot David, nor India as a loud-talking 10-foot Goliath. India was humbled by the unkindness of the event. Karachi did not fall, Islamabad remained steadfast, and Lahore kept pulsating, with daredevil Pakistanis eulogising their soldiers who were busy firing their deadly arsenal towards India from their fields, from their neighborhoods, and praying elders overseeing salvo after salvo. It was a national Bunyan Marsus.
Pakistan did not escalate; it equalised India's perceptual superiority. It emerged not as a weakened state, but an awakened country. Pakistan didn't blink, and stood its ground with dignity, restraint, precision and strategy.
Modi 'perceptually' had a bigger stick that now lies broken, and his power stands exposed not only to Pakistan, but to the admirers of 'shining India' worldwide. India, in public perception, lost its 'dominance' not through outright defeat, but through overreach, despite the 'theatrical illusion of victory' that Indian media continues to showcase for psychological conquest of its citizenry.
India's myth of conventional superiority, built and carefully managed for such an eventuality, lies in chaotic collapse before the public eye.
Pakistan's poverty, touted repeatedly over a berserk India media, is recognised by the world as its 'cool hardiness'. Islamabad emerged as a calm, articulate player and as a disciplined nuclear power, which can demonstrate restraint, resolve and resilience. And that its dwarfed defence spending, compared to New Delhi's $85 billion defence budget, still enables and equips its armed forces with doctrine, deterrence and determination to hold its nerve under fire.
Pakistan absorbed Operation Sindoor with a resolute defensive response and then responded with its own 'Bunyan Marsus', rewriting the rules of deterrence.
Consequentially, Pakistan gains more confidence and relevance, which is already buttressed by its geostrategic location at the crossroads of Karakoram, the Silk Road, South and Central Asia; and it being key to regional stability for 2.8 billion South Asians. The strategic map has shifted and with it the world's perspective. Pakistan once branded as a 'failing state', today emerges as a reliable strategic balancer.
This isn't just a strategic shift in the regional power dynamics, it is a psychological jolt and a rude awakening for Modi's Hindutva-laced, RSS dominated, bigoted brand.
Just when detractors thought Pakistan was sliding into a second fiddle status, Modi burnished its image by becoming Pakistan's unlikely brand ambassador, through his absurd persistence and stubborn obsession to turn Pakistan into a pliant state. From being overlooked to being overanalyzed and over-examined, Islamabad is back in global conversations especially among the dithering Arab world.
Second, India suffered doctrinal collapse. This brief war demonstrated India's 'doctrinal collapse', militarily as well as in the perceptual domains. Ajit Doval's sinister scheming to flush TTP, BLA and BRA with cash, incite synchronised uprising in KP and Balochistan, exploit Pakistan's many cleavages and turn Afghan borderlands and Pakistan into an inferno for Pakistan's military backfired squarely, roundly and embarrassingly. The operation, contrarily, jelled Pakistan's inner front like hell. India mistook Pakistan's doctrinal maturity as fragility.
Literature, at break-neck speed, is coming out with analysts reading, re-reading and analysing the 16 hours of combat that shaped South Asia and the world's military balance. Dassault Aviation's share prices plunged, whereas Chinese defense stocks AVIC, ALD Chengdu surged.
Modi's India miscalculated militarily, decided to ignore geopolitics, misread the doctrine, misjudged Pakistan's internal dynamics and resolve and overplayed its hand in trying to redefine South Asia's balance of power. A leaf from Israel's playbook did not match Chanakya Kotalia's script. India's doctrine of punitive retaliation through swift operations is broken operationally not just symbolically.
By denying truth to its own people and by constantly lying to unfathomable extents during this war, India lost any remaining credibility for its media, official and unofficial. Modi's strongman image took an irreparable hit, and his tattered ego is littered with strategic miscalculation, economic overreach, doctrinal unpreparedness and moral bankruptcy, exposing India's own multiple fault lines.
The dictum of the history is clear, New Delhi is not the victor in this round, Islamabad is. Bunyan Marsus was 'Pakistan's rendezvous with history' an existential moment of great peril, handled with dignity and precision. Allah be praised!

"Agha, Hasan star in Pak win over BD","CN
.
Skipper Salman Agha hit a career best knock and pacer Hasan Ali grabbed his first five wicket haul as Pakistan beat Bangladesh by 37 runs in the first T20 international in Lahore on Wednesday.
Agha struck a career-best 56 to guide Pakistan to 201-7 before Hasan took 5-30 dismissed the tourists for 164 in 19.2 overs at Gaddafi Stadium. The win gives the home team a 1-0 lead in the three-match series. Allrounder Shadab Khan, who also struck a quick 48, then dismissed rival skipper Litton Das for a 30-ball 48 to break a fighting 63-run stand for the third wicket that lifted Bangladesh from 37-2.
Litton hit three sixes and a boundary and had steadied the innings with Towhid Hridoy who scored 17, but the later batters could not capitalise on the platform.
Pacer Hasan ended Jaker Ali's knock of 36 (21 balls with three sixes and a boundary), Tanzim Hasan for one and Shoriful Islam for five to cap a successful return to international cricket after a year-long injury lay-off. Earlier, Agha struck a 34-ball 56, with eight fours and a six, while Hasan Nawaz's 22-ball 44 with four sixes helped Pakistan pass 200 after the hosts won the toss and chose to bat. The captain, whose previous T20 best of 51 not out came against New Zealand in March, added 48 for the third wicket with Mohammad Haris and 65 for the fourth with Nawaz.

ADB board meets on June 3 to approve $800m Pakistan package,"SA
The Indian move came after it failed to block the approval of the $1 billion worth second loan tranche by the IMF
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has postponed the approval of a $800 million financing package for Pakistan for five days on the request of India that sought time to evaluate the loan documents, exposing flaws in the lender's rule book that allows such extensions.
The government officials told The Express Tribune that the ADB board meeting had been convened for May 28th to approve the $300 million budget support loan and another $500 million in guarantees to obtain foreign commercial loans.
The meeting did not take place on Wednesday and Pakistan had been informed in advance. The meeting has been rescheduled to June 3, the government officials added.
When contacted, Economic Affairs Secretary Dr Kazim Niaz confirmed that the ADB board meeting was scheduled for May 28 but has been postponed for five days on the request of the Indian executive director.
The secretary said that under the ADB rules any director can seek a one-time extension on the date and India took the benefit of this rule. The ADB country office did not respond to a request for comment on the development.
The Indian move came after it failed to block the approval of the $1 billion worth second loan tranche by the International Monetary Fund. The postponement by the ADB underscores that the Pakistani representatives in the World Bank, the IMF, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the ADB will have to adopt a proactive approach to protect the country's economic interests.
After facing defeat at the hands of the armed forces in the battlefield, India has started lobbying against Islamabad's economic interests. The five-day postponement has not impacted Pakistan's external financing plans and the money is expected to flow in the central bank's accounts after the approval by the board on June 3rd.
Independent economic analysts say that the government should reduce its reliance on the foreign loans, particularly on budget support loans. The ADB's $800 million package is not meant for any development purposes and the money and guarantees will be used to build the foreign exchange reserves.
Dr Niaz said that there was no lapse on part of the federal government or its nominee in the board, as the ADB rules allowed the extension. He said that when India sought the postponement of the board meeting, the government took up the matter at the highest level in the ADB.
The management and almost all the board directors had supported the view point of Pakistan, which resulted in taking the next date for the board meeting, said the secretary.
Pakistan's view was that the international forums cannot be used for settling the political scores of the member countries, he added.
The government had reached an understanding with two foreign commercial banks for a $1 billion loan on the back of the ADB's guarantees due to its low credit rating. The final term sheet and loan disbursement are subject to the approval of the ADB's $500 million guarantee.
Pakistan can borrow up to $1.5 billion foreign commercial loan against the $500 million guarantee, said government sources.
Pakistan's gross reserves stand at $11.4 billion, which the government wants to increase to over $14 billion by the end of June. The reserves will rise on the back of better-than-expected remittances, $1 billion ADB-backed new commercial loan and the refinancing of Chinese loans, the sources said.
The ADB will charge a nominal upfront fee for giving the guarantee. Despite a recent rating upgrade, Pakistan's credit rating still remains low at B negative, which are two notches below the investment grade. Fitch upgraded Pakistan from a substantial default risk to a high risk of default rating.
For the current fiscal year, the government has budgeted $3.8 billion in foreign commercial loans but the disbursements remain low due to the low credit rating. China is expected to refinance the $3.7 billion commercial lending before the end of next month.
The ADB's $300 million policy loan is the second tranche under the Resource Mobilization programme, which the government wants to take for improving the tax collection by the Federal Board of Revenue. However, there has been criticism for taking loans for purposes, which do not require foreign funding.
Pakistan has met all the prior conditions for securing the second loan tranche from the ADB.
The ADB's local office spokesperson had been requested to comment about the change in schedule of the board meeting and whether the ADB can allow its platform to be used by the member countries for achieving their political objectives.
The people privy to the working of the ADB said that any member, including Pakistan, can request a delay for two working days to undertake more due diligence for any loan.

Musk says 'disappointed' by Trump mega-bill,"US
An excerpt was aired Tuesday evening with comments that put him at odds with Trump.
Billionaire Elon Musk, who has stepped back from his role of slashing US government spending by firing tens of thousands of people, has criticized President Donald Trump's signature spending bill.
The ""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act"" — which passed in the House of Representatives and now moves to the Senate — would usher into law Trump's vision for a new ""Golden Age,"" led by efforts to shrink social safety net programs to pay for a 10-year extension of his 2017 tax cuts.
But critics say it will decimate health care for the poorest Americans and cause the national debt to balloon.
""I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,"" Musk said in an interview with CBS News.
An excerpt was aired Tuesday evening with comments that put him at odds with Trump, who tasked Musk with cutting government spending as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.
The spending bill is the centerpiece of Trump's domestic policy agenda and could define his second term in the White House.
Independent analysts have warned it would increase the deficit by as much as $4 trillion over a decade.
""I think a bill can be big or it can be beautiful,"" Musk told CBS News, ""but I don't know if it can be both. My personal opinion."" The full interview will be aired Sunday.
In a separate interview with the Washington Post, Musk, the head of Tesla and SpaceX, looked back on his work leading the reforms, in which many civil servants lost their jobs with little or no warning.
""The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realized,"" he said. ""I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.""
Musk announced in late April he was stepping back from government to run his companies again.
He said in May that he did not achieve all his goals with DOGE even though tens of thousands of people were removed from government payrolls and several government departments were gutted or shut down altogether.

Taliban disavow 'self-styled jihad' in Pakistan,"SA
Senior leader says such individuals cannot be regarded as mujahideen
A senior Taliban commander said on Wednesday that militants who engage in combat in a foreign country without the amir's authorisation are not justified in doing so, adding that such individuals cannot be regarded as mujahideen or jihadis.
This was stated by Saeedullah Saeed, a senior commander at the Hazrat Hamza Military Academy, during a graduation ceremony for 400 police personnel in Kabul.
""Those who defy the orders of Amirul Momineen Mullah Hibatullah Akhund and go to fight beyond the borders of another country (without naming Pakistan) are not justified and are disobeying the amir's orders,"" Saeed said.
""Individuals who affiliate themselves with one group or another to engage in jihad in a foreign country are not considered mujahideen or jihadis,"" he added.
This marks the third time that Amirul Momineen Hibatullah Akhund has directed all followers and communicated to commanders along Pakistan's western border that any jihad undertaken without the decree of the Amir or the Council of Ulema is considered fasad (illegal or corrupt).
The message came following a drone strike in Janikhel, Bannu, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa on Tuesday, which killed over 70 militants. Post-strike investigations revealed that more than 30 of the casualties were Afghan nationals, a source added.
Following the incident, Islamabad sent a stern message to Kabul, warning that if cross-border recruitment was not halted, the repercussions would be more severe, the source added.
The message from Amirul Momineen was conveyed to all military commanders along the Pak-Afghan border. A recent Tashkeel (a large Taliban formation) was successfully thwarted, and several recruiters were arrested in the provinces of Khost, Paktika, and Paktiyacollectively known as Loya Paktiya or larger Paktiya, the stronghold of the Haqqani Network.
This was the second time such measures were implementedfirst after Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Asif visited Kabul, and now following the recent visit of Chinese and Pakistani delegations, the source said.
""A total of more than fifteen recruiters were arrested, including individuals who were part of the Tashkeel,"" a provincial source added.
According to the source, the message delivered by the senior commander at the Hazrat Hamza Military Academy was of a highly important nature, directed at all those who would be at the helm of affairs.
The message came at a time when a tripartite meeting between Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan is scheduled to be held in Kabul in July.
Is China a bonding force
Haq Nawaz Khan, a senior security analyst and journalist with The Washington Post, told The Express Tribune's Peshawar office that ""China is the bonding force behind easing tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, while regional realignment, development, and the success of CPEC projects are closely linked to the security of the region.""
Haq Nawaz Khan explained that multiple threats rooted in Afghanistan extend beyond the TTP, including groups such as Hafiz Gul Bahadur, ISKP and the Turkistan Islamic Party (formerly known as the East Turkistan Islamic Movement), which is known for its expertise in drone technology. He added that this group has reportedly supplied drones to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), whose union is also referred to as BRAS. Additionally, various Baloch nationalist forces, including the BLA and BLF, maintain links to Afghan soil.
The TIP was known for providing drone technology to the TTP. The BLF was also among the recipients whom Islamabad has asked to be restrained. TIP is also reportedly behind the supply of laser technology and thermal engineering systems to both TTP and Balochistan liberation forces, The Express Tribune has learned.
If China were not supporting the unusual alliance between Islamabad and Kabul, the Qandharis would have allied with Iran and others, while the Haqqani network would have aligned with the UAE and Saudi Arabia. However, Beijing has severed all such ties for now, he said.
Projects for Afghanistan
The source revealed that upcoming rail and road initiatives include a railroad connecting Hiratan to Parachinar and Kohat, which will link to the existing Chinese-backed Karachi to Peshawar route.
""During the Chinese negotiations, Mullah Hibatullah requested that the railroad also be extended to southern Afghanistan, linking Kandahar and Herat provinces, which were considered part of the project,"" the source added.
The existing Kabul-Jalalabad road via Mahipar will be replaced by a highway connecting various eastern provinces, while another highway will link Kandahar to Kabul, and a third will run from Kabul to Mazar-e-Sharif, the senior official said.

A costly addiction,"PK
This contradiction lies at the heart of Pakistan's tobacco control struggle.
Pakistan is paying a steep price for tobacco consumption. Each year, tobacco claims 164,000 lives and drains the economy of nearly Rs700 billion in healthcare costs and productivity losses. But, no matter how regrettable these numbers are, tobacco also contributes significantly to the national exchequer through taxes, creating a moral and fiscal dilemma for policymakers.
This contradiction lies at the heart of Pakistan's tobacco control struggle. On one hand, increased taxation is the most effective measure to reduce tobacco consumption -— especially among youth and low-income groups — and to prevent the onset of lifelong addiction. On the other hand, the tobacco industry remains one of the top contributors to FBR, particularly through Federal Excise Duty.
This makes the government understandably cautious about disrupting a major source of income amid financial constraints. However, the revenue generated from tobacco — while substantial — is dwarfed by the long-term economic toll of tobacco-related diseases. From cancer and heart disease to chronic respiratory illnesses, the burden on our already struggling public health system is immense.
As World No Tobacco Day approaches on May 31, WHO has rightly urged Pakistan to adopt urgent tax reforms that prioritise public health. This doesn't mean an overnight collapse of the industry, rather a structured increase in taxes across all tobacco products, without exemptions or loopholes. Gradual yet decisive reforms can reduce consumption, continue to generate revenue in the short term, and significantly reduce long-term health costs.
The goal should not be to kill an industry overnight, but to transition away from dependence on one that thrives off addiction. Part of the revenue generated through higher tobacco taxes can and should be ring-fenced for health and education spending, especially tobacco prevention programmes targeting youth.

RDA scam suspects in the NAB crosshairs,"US
Officials are accused of unlawfully issuing directives to banks for the release of CDRs
The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has summoned two retired officials in connection with the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) financial scandal.
The summons were issued for Thursday (today) following their nomination as suspects by the RDA administration.
The accused include former Director Asif Mehmood Janjua and retired Assistant Director Khawaja Arshad Javed. According to the NAB notice, both individuals are required to explain why they issued instructions to the bank regarding the issuance of Certificates of Deposit (CDRs), despite allegedly lacking the authority to do so.
The bureau has asked them to provide a detailed explanation for their actions, submit complete records related to the CDRs, and furnish the names and details of all recipients. The notice further warned that failure to appear or comply would result in legal action in accordance with the law.
This development marks a significant step in NAB's investigation into alleged financial irregularities within the RDA.
More details emerge of scam
Investigations have revealed that large sums of money were transferred to various companies, vendors, and individuals through Call Deposit Receipts (CDRs).
These transactions were traced with the help of bank records and a report compiled by RDA's probe committee, which has now been provided to the investigative authorities.
The companies and vendors involved in these transactions include MS Addad (Rs393.17million), Car Specialist Network (Rs11 million), Pothohar Associates (Rs74.26 million), SNK & Company (Rs324.46 million), Silver Stone (Rs339.4 million), and Smart Cubed (Rs309.77 million).
RDA's investigation is currently comparing these transactions with records from the relevant banks.
Meanwhile, a probe committee formed by RDA's Director-General Kanza Murtaza under Director State Management Nasir Shehzad Gondal has issued a report.
The committee noted significant negligence and carelessness in RDA's Finance Department and found that the bank involved failed to verify the transactions with authorities before processing them.
The committee concluded that the preparation of CDRs was an overstep of authority and illegal. As a result, the committee has recommended that the case be forwarded to the ACE and other relevant agencies to recover RDA funds and further investigate the irregularities.

Teenage Barca star Yamal signs new contract to 2031,"US
New deal makes him one of Barcelona's best paid players
Barcelona's teenage star Lamine Yamal signed a new contract until 2031 with the Catalan giants on Tuesday after a spectacular season.
The 17-year-old winger is already one of the club's key players and helped them land a domestic treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.
""Barcelona and Lamine Yamal have reached a deal to extend his contract to June 30, 2031,"" said the Catalan club in a statement.
""Lamine Yamal's renewal is a demonstration of the solidity of Barca's project. His emergence on to the world football scene is like few others, and it began with his debut on April 29, 2023, still at the age of 15.""
Spanish media reported the new deal makes him one of Barcelona's best paid players.
After triumphing at Euro 2024 with Spain last summer, Yamal scored 18 goals and provided 25 assists in 55 matches across all competitions during a sensational campaign.
Operating on the right flank and a prodigious dribbler, Yamal's skill and speed contributed greatly to Barca netting 102 league goals this season as they reclaimed the crown from rivals Real Madrid.
Yamal, who came through the club's feted La Masia youth academy and is often compared to all-time Barcelona great Lionel Messi, made his debut in 2023 under Xavi Hernandez at just 15.
By the end of the 2023-24 campaign he had emerged as the team's main attacking weapon, the bright spot in a poor campaign where Barca finished empty-handed.
Following his exploits at the Euros, Yamal fitted Flick's attacking style to perfection and adding more consistency, showed he has become one of the world's best players.
Yamal put in two brilliant Champions League semi-final performances against Inter Milan but his team were edged 7-6 on aggregate and must wait to end their European drought.
""I will keep my promise and I will bring (the Champions League trophy) to Barcelona, we will not stop until we get it,"" pledged Yamal after the game.
Despite his youth the winger has already played over 100 times for Barcelona.
Yamal, who turns 18 in July, follows team-mate Raphinha and coach Flick in signing contact extensions in the last few days.
Spanish media report his contract includes various bonuses for different achievements, including winning the Ballon d'Or, as well as a significant pay rise.
Yamal is a candidate to win the trophy for the world's best player this year.

City marks Youm-e-Takbeer,"US
Political, religious organisations pay tribute to armed forces, founders of nuclear programme
This year's Youm-e-Takbeer was celebrated with more pride and pomp owing to the success of the operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos.
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said that May 28 is a symbol of Pakistan's defence sovereignty and national dignity.
The CM said that Youm-e-Takbeer reflects national determination and the tireless efforts of our scientists. He said, ""Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto laid the foundation of Pakistan's nuclear programme after India's nuclear tests in 1974 and declared we will build the atomic bomb.""
At a ceremony hosted by MQM-P near its Bahadurabad centre, Chairman Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said May 28 marks the fulfilment of Pakistan's foundational promise. He commended Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, calling him ""a son of Karachi and the man who gave Pakistan an invincible defence.""
On appeal by Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Pakistan Ameer Engr Hafiz Naeemur Rahman, the JI Karachi chapter observed May 28 as Dr Abdul Qadeer Day on Wednesday. Camps were setup and banners were fastened in all union councils and towns to pay a rich tribute to the nuclear scientist.
The Pakistan Markazi Muslim League held three major rallies across the city, attracting large public participation. The processions passed through key neighbourhoods including Tower, Orangi, Korangi, and Sohrab Goth, culminating at Mazar-e-Quaid.
Pakistan Sunni Tehreek chief Shadab Raza Naqshbandi, addressing Fatah Mubeen seminars in several cities, said the 1998 nuclear tests restored strategic balance in South Asia. ""We honour Dr Khan as a national hero,"" he said.
Jamaat Ahle Sunnat Pakistan also held a convention in Lines Area, where Amir Allama Shah Abdul Haq Qadri highlighted the role of the nuclear scientists and armed forces. The event included expressions of solidarity with the people of Kashmir and Palestine.

Global warming likely to stay at historic levels,"US
UN says 70% chance that 2025-2029 average warming will top 1.5C
The United Nations warned on Wednesday there is a 70 percent chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 will exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius international benchmark.
The planet is therefore expected to remain at historic levels of warming after the two hottest years ever recorded in 2023 and 2024, according to an annual climate report published by the World Meteorological Organization, the UN's weather and climate agency.
""We have just experienced the 10 warmest years on record,"" said the WMO's deputy secretary-general Ko Barrett.
""Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet.""
The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels — and to 1.5C if possible.
The targets are calculated relative to the 1850-1900 average, before humanity began industrially burning coal, oil, and gas, which emits carbon dioxide (CO2) — the greenhouse gas largely responsible for climate change.
The more optimistic 1.5C target is one that growing numbers of climate scientists now consider impossible to achieve, as CO2 emissions are still increasing.
The WMO's latest projections are compiled by Britain's Met Office national weather service, based on forecasts from multiple global centres.
The agency forecasts that the global mean near-surface temperature for each year between 2025 and 2029 will be between 1.2C and 1.9C above the pre-industrial average.
It says there is a 70 percent chance that average warming across the 2025-2029 period will exceed 1.5C.
""This is entirely consistent with our proximity to passing 1.5C on a long-term basis in the late 2020s or early 2030s,"" said Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group at the University of Maynooth.
""I would expect in two to three years this probability to be 100 percent"" in the five-year outlook, he added.
The WMO says there is an 80 percent chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be warmer than the warmest year on record (2024).
To smooth out natural climate variations, several methods assess long-term warming, the WMO's climate services director Christopher Hewitt told a press conference.
One approach combines observations from the past 10 years with projections for the next decade.
This predicts that the 20-year average warming for 2015-2034 will be 1.44C.
There is no consensus yet on how best to assess long-term warming.

PBF urges budget relief for agriculture,"US
Demands GST cut on cotton sector, lower duties on agri-machinery and policy reforms
The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) has urged the government to take concrete measures in the upcoming federal budget to reduce the cost of agricultural cultivation, calling for immediate tax relief on fertilisers to ease the financial burden on farmers.
A PBF delegation, led by Chief Organiser Chaudhry Ahmad Jawad, held a detailed meeting with Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain to discuss the upcoming federal budget and advocate for targeted relief for the agricultural sector.
The delegation emphasised that the federal government still holds the authority to reduce the cost of production for farmers. ""Sustainable GDP growth is not possible without government support for agriculture,"" they stated. The delegation urged the government to eliminate the 18% GST on locally produced cotton and to reduce customs duties on imported machinery used in the cotton ginning sector.
""The government must take concrete steps to reduce the cost of cultivation. Fertiliser prices should also be brought down by offering tax relief,"" they added.
In response, Hussain expressed agreement with the forum's concerns and stated, ""The ministry is actively working on eliminating the 18% GST on local cotton, including lint and cottonseed."" He further noted that efforts are underway to resolve pending cotton cess liabilities from the textile sector to ensure the Central Cotton Committee does not face financial constraints.
""We are also considering limiting tax-free imports of yarn and fabric under the Export Facilitation Scheme to support local cotton,"" said the minister. ""This year, we are aiming to produce 10 million cotton bales locally, and we are making every effort to ensure that farmers receive relief in the upcoming budget.""
PBF also recommended that new research and seed varieties developed by the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) be implemented at the district level through local agriculture departments. ""At present, we are unaware of the latest research being conducted in Islamabad. The ministry should work with provincial governments to bridge this gap.""
PBF welcomed the government's decision to allow the import of cotton seeds and proposed that legislation be introduced to ensure local banks provide loans to the SME sector.

Will CIE lose its edge?,"US
Admits paper leaks, urges students to stay focused as investigations continue
Once regarded as a gold standard in academic assessment, Cambridge International Education (CIE) is now facing increasing scrutiny in Pakistan. Following a recent shift that allowed private schools to independently conduct O and A Level examinations - previously handled solely by the British Council - reports of paper leaks, and lack of accountability have cast a shadow over the system. Stakeholders are questioning whether the integrity and global standing of Cambridge qualifications in Pakistan are being compromised.
Until just two years ago, the British Council was the sole authority overseeing these exams in Pakistan. Now, over 20 private schools in Karachi and Islamabad are conducting the exams themselves. This decentralisation has raised serious concerns about transparency and security. Reports of exam paper leaks are on the rise, causing distress among thousands of students and their parents.
Recently, an AS-level Physics paper was reportedly leaked and widely circulated on social media before the scheduled exam. Similar claims have emerged regarding other subjects. As more schools gain the authority to conduct exams independently, the risk of compromised exam integrity appears to grow proportionally.
Cambridge International has acknowledged some of the leaks in a public Facebook statement, urging students to stay focused and promising investigations. However, the lack of transparency around these investigations - particularly the absence of shared findings or any disclosed disciplinary actions - has left stakeholders dissatisfied and concerned. Parents and students fear that ineffective preventive measures could lead to more leaks in the future.
The decision to let private schools conduct exams reportedly stemmed from a former official at the Federal Ministry of Education. However, the ministry now appears to be powerless in addressing the fallout, including the ongoing paper leak scandal.
While CIE administers the General Certificate of Education (GCE) O and A Levels in Pakistan, it's worth noting that these programmes were phased out in the UK in 1986 and have not been part of the official education system there for nearly four decades.
Another point of contention is the continued use of the outdated alphabetical grading system (A* to E), as opposed to the numerical system (1 to 9) now standard in the UK. Some education experts argue that this inconsistency places Pakistani students at a disadvantage when competing globally for academic and professional opportunities.
Pakistani parents spend an estimated Rs 30 billion annually on Cambridge exams. When papers are leaked and exams are not rescheduled, students are often graded based on predicted scores instead of their actual performance - undermining the entire purpose of standardised assessment.
As a result, Cambridge is not only losing its academic superiority in Pakistan but also facing growing criticism from students who feel that the organisation's standards are now limited to curriculum design. With exam execution resembling local board practices, the credibility and perceived value of Cambridge qualifications in Pakistan is diminishing.
When contacted by The Express Tribune, a Cambridge spokesperson said, ""Cambridge has strict security protocols in place to safeguard exam materials, and these protocols apply equally to our partner institutions and schools."" In response to questions about the outdated O-level system, the spokesperson added, ""The qualification is internationally recognised and accepted by leading universities worldwide. The exams offer students an opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and skills through written, oral, and practical assessments.""
Regarding the paper leaks, the spokesperson said: ""We conduct prompt and thorough investigations into all evidence to ensure fairness in results. However, we can not comment on specific allegations during the exam period in order to keep students focused on their exams.""

NEPRA decision on KE tariff alarms Power Division,"US
""This delay poses serious financial implications for the power sector and its subsidies.""
The Power Division has expressed serious concerns over the seven-year Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) decision recently issued by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) for K-Electric, warning it could have far-reaching financial and policy implications.
Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari has warned that such determinations could negatively impact investment confidence in future MYT periods.
In a statement issued on the social media platform 'X' on Wednesday, the minister said the ministry has observed some serious concerns regarding NEPRA's multiple decisions about K-Electric's licenses for generation, transmission, distribution and supply, adding that these decisions also touch upon the investment plan for the upcoming multi-year tariff period.
""These rulings have significant long-term effects on consumer tariffs and the federal government's subsidies within a uniform tariff regime."" He revealed that the ministry was planning to review the recently issued determinations related to transmission, distribution, and supply. Meanwhile, a reconsideration of the earlier generation tariff decision was awaiting NEPRA's attention, despite being submitted back in December 2024. ""This delay poses serious financial implications for the power sector and its subsidies.""
Additionally, he cautioned that if certain areas were not addressed, they could negatively impact consumers and the regulatory environment, potentially hindering Pakistan's efforts to encourage private participation in the distribution sector.

Korangi harbour to make $100m in 5 years,"US
Maritime ministry says modernisation project to create 3,000 jobs, elevate Pakistan's global seafood footprint
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs has launched an ambitious project to modernise Korangi Fish Harbour (KOFHA), aiming to generate over $100 million in direct and indirect economic activity over the next five years. The initiative, spearheaded by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, is part of Pakistan's broader strategy to unlock the potential of the blue economy.
According to an official statement issued on Wednesday, the project will revitalise KOFHA through strategic infrastructure upgrades, aimed at increasing seafood exports, creating jobs, and improving operational efficiency. The minister said the initiative is expected to create more than 3,000 jobs across construction, logistics, fish processing and fishing-related services, while enhancing seafood processing capacity by 50%.
""This strategic move will make a meaningful contribution to Pakistan's $375 billion GDP, strengthening the maritime economy and supporting long-term national growth,"" Chaudhry said.
A central feature of the project is the complete redesign of the fish auction hall, which will be equipped with modern facilities to enhance efficiency, hygiene, and transparency. The upgraded hall will comply with international food safety standards and export certification protocols, facilitating increased global seafood trade.
The minister also announced the addition of a floating jetty to the harbour's infrastructure, which will improve vessel handling, reduce turnaround time, and support a higher volume of fishing activity. This will be complemented by a comprehensive overhaul of the existing jetty, incorporating technology-driven solutions and accessibility improvements.
Sustainability is a key component of the project. The upgrades will include environmentally responsible practices to protect marine biodiversity and ensure the long-term viability of the fisheries sector.
Chaudhry said that upgrading the Korangi Fish Harbour into a model fisheries hub is a strategic step toward economic transformation. ""This is not just an infrastructure upgrade it represents a pledge to unlock Pakistan's full maritime potential,"" he said.

"Cattle markets buzz, but prices soar","US
Traders cite rising fodder, transport, and maintenance costs as reasons for hike
As Eidul Azha approaches, the cattle markets are setting up in different specified places of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), including Sangjhani, Sector I-15, Bharakahu, Lehtrar Road and Islamabad Expressway.
At I-15 cattle markets, Abdul Shakoor, who brought his animals from Arifwala, said: ""We are satisfied with the market setup, especially the availability of basic facilities like water and electricity."" He emphasised that water is crucial for maintaining the health and vitality of the animals when the temperature is at its peak.
Moin Khan, the manager of the Mandi, highlighted that the market spans over 1,000 kanals and is divided into blocks to streamline management. ""We have focused particularly on ensuring the availability of water, electricity, and proper security arrangements,"" he said. Each trader has been allotted around 150 to 200 square feet of space to conduct business in an organised way, he said, adding that additional measures have also been taken to ensure safety and prevent any untoward incidents.
The different sizes of cow, goat, and sheep are available in this mandi but prices are high as compared to last year.
Sardar Shah, a goat seller from Mianwali said that the prices of goat are between Rs50,000 and Rs350,000 according to their specifications. While Muhammad Imran, another seller, who brought their cows from Multan, offered prices Rs230,000 to Rs600,000 or their bulls depending on their weight and size. However, residents are enthusiastic about the market's setup, but got frustrated over the high prices of both small and big animals.
A customer, Abdul Manan, who was looking for a sacrificial animal, said: ""The market is impressive in scale, but the prices are shockingly high. A goat of average weight is being sold for Rs120,000, significantly more than what I paid last year for a similar one.""
On the other hand, traders argued that the cost of raising animals has increased, which has forced them to increase the prices. Sardar Shah explained that fodder, transport, and other essentials are expensive which affects the final price of the animals. Despite high prices, buyers are struggling to find suitable animals for the Islamic ritual. They are actively bargaining to negotiate better prices and remain hopeful of finding their desired animal in the large cattle markets, where animals of all sizes are available.

Karachi-Rohri track rehabilitation may commence this year,"US
.
The Senate Standing Committee on Railways was briefed on upcoming, ongoing, and pending railway projects, as well as the major challenges currently facing the Ministry of Railways.
The meeting, chaired by Senator Jam Saifullah Khan, was informed that a total of 38 projects worth Rs 260.085 billion were undertaken during the fiscal year 2024-25. Of these, six projects have been completed, while 32 have been carried forward to 2025-26.
While briefing the committee, the Chairman of Railways described the Main Line-1 (ML-1) project — spanning from Karachi to Rohri — as a ""lifeline"" for the Reko Diq and Thar coal projects, which are expected to commence this year, subject to the availability of funds.
He noted that the total estimated cost of ML-1 stands at Rs2,298.18 billion, and a proposal has been submitted for the allocation of Rs75 billion in the financial year 202526 to initiate the project.
The committee was further informed that 12 additional projects — covering track expansion, safety enhancements, rehabilitation, track replacement, feasibility studies, and upgraded security systems — require an allocation of Rs11.076 billion in the next fiscal year.

Robbed and murdered,"US
Economic desperation and organised crime further fuel the crisis.
Karachi is grappling with an alarming surge in violent street crimes, with citizens paying the ultimate price for resisting robberies. Since January 2025, at least 47 people have been killed in such incidents, a figure that starkly underscores the city's deteriorating law and order situation. While the police dispute that number — which was compiled by NGOs — their own data shows 33 fatalities, which is only slightly better.
The human cost of this crisis is harrowing. In May alone, a 10-year-old died in crossfire during a robbery in Landhi, and an 18-year-old was shot dead in Korangi's Zaman Town. In another incident, two young men were shot dead for resisting an attempt to steal their motorcycle.
Stories such as these are not uncommon in the world's megacities, but the raw number of such incidents makes Karachi stand out. The city's crime rate dwarfs many other megacities, and this is only made worse by the fact that many Karachiites treat street crimes as a fact of life and have so little confidence in the police's ability to deliver justice that they don't even report robberies.
To law enforcement's credit, citizens are 'only' advised to be cautious while commuting, shopping, or walking home, and to ""avoid resistance"" during robberies. Meanwhile, the judiciary remains unable to handle the sheer number of cases that are filed, and due to the backlog, even in 'open-and-shut cases', accused criminals are often able to easily secure bail.
Economic desperation and organised crime further fuel the crisis. Despite being the country's economic capital, Karachi has failed to provide enough jobs, housing and other services for its existing residents, meaning the size of the economic underclass continues to grow. And though there are other factors, Karachi's descent into lawlessness was primarily due to failures of governance at the political and bureaucratic levels. While policing is important, the only long-term solution is in the hands of legislators and policymakers.

Ready to forestall India's IWT threat: PM,"AE
Shehbaz says peace requires negotiations; Signals willingness to discuss trade; Showers praise on Field Marshal Munir
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated that Pakistan always wanted peace in the region and was willing to discuss all bilateral issues with India on the negotiation table if India showed sincerity of purpose and cooperation.
Addressing the second trilateral summit in Lachin city of Azerbaijan, the prime minister referred to the recent aggression of India and said that with Allah Almighty's infinite blessings and kindness, with the support of people of Pakistan, and friendly countries, and resolute response of the armed forces, they emerged victorious.
In his speech, the prime minister further said that Pakistan wanted peace in the region and that required talks on the table to discuss the issues that needed urgent attention and amicable solution like the issue of Kashmir which should be resolved according to the UNSC resolutions and as per aspiration of the people of Kashmir.
The prime minister said unfortunately, India tried to weaponise the Indus Waters Treaty which was a lifeline for the 240 million population of Pakistan that used the water for agriculture, drinking and other purposes.
""It is most unfortunate that India tried to threaten to stop the flow of water into Pakistan. This is not possible, this is never possible and will not be possible Insha'Allah. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,"" he emphatically maintained.
The prime minister said if India wanted to talk on countering terrorism with sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to them on this issue as well.
""We are the biggest victim of terrorism around the globe and lost 90,000 valuable lives and suffered $150 billion worth of economic losses over the last many decades. There can be no bigger manifestation of our commitment and intention to beat this menace for all times to come,"" he added.
If India showed serious and honest cooperation, he said Pakistan would be willing to discuss all the issues, including promotion of trade with India, on the negotiation table.
The prime minister also appreciated the role of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir who, he said, led the armed forces of Pakistan to fight with great bravery and the highest level of professional acumen while the entire nation was standing behind them.
The prime minister said that during the conflict with India, he found the Field Marshal as 'God-fearing, fearless, firm with iron resolve, patience and fortitude to face that aggression.'
He reiterated that during the recent conflict, India failed to bring out any credible evidences against Pakistan and rejected their sincere offer for a neutral and transparent investigation into so-called Pahalagam incident by any international body.
Azerbaijan's Independence Day
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday called for unity, peace and justice in the region while highlighting the deepening bonds among Pakistan, Azerbaijan, and Turkey, declaring the relationship as now ""three souls and one heart.""
In his address at the Independence Day Ceremony of the Republic of Azerbaijan in Lachin, PM Shehbaz praised the leadership and bravery of the Azerbaijani people, who under President Aliyev's ""visionary and dynamic leadership"" liberated the region of Karabakh after decades of occupation.
The addressing dignitaries also included President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkiye.
""It is a matter of great honor to be here today, celebrating both Azerbaijan's Independence Day and Pakistan's Youm-e-Takbeer - the day we became a nuclear power in 1998,"" the Prime Minister stated, underscoring the symbolic significance of May 28 for both nations.
In his address, the Prime Minister expressed heartfelt congratulations to the people of Azerbaijan and paid tribute to the sacrifices of their armed forces and martyrs. He emphasized the unwavering support that Pakistan and Turkey provided during Azerbaijan's struggle for territorial integrity.
""When Armenia attacked Azerbaijan, Pakistan and Turkey stood like a rock beside it. And today, when India attacked Pakistan, President Erdogan and President Aliyev stood like a formidable fortress beside us. This is true brotherhood,"" Shehbaz Sharif said.
The Prime Minister spoke candidly about recent hostilities between India and Pakistan. Referring to the April 22 incident in Pahalgam, Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, where 26 civilians were killed, he condemned India's immediate blame on Pakistan without evidence.
""Pakistan offered an international inquiry commission for a free and transparent probe, but instead, India launched a deadly attack that killed 36 innocent Pakistanis, including children,"" he revealed. ""We had no choice but to defend our nation.""
Shehbaz detailed Pakistan's military response, describing the downing of six Indian fighter jets - including four Rafales — and significant damage to Indian military installations. He praised the composure and leadership of Pakistan's armed forces, particularly Air Chief and Field Marshal COAS Asim Munir, for a swift and measured retaliation.
""At 9 a.m., Field Marshal Asim Munir informed me that India had requested a ceasefire. I said, Allah Almighty has granted us a glowing victory - we must now act wisely, not prolong the conflict.""
Sharif also turned attention to other global humanitarian crises, particularly in IIOJK and Gaza.
""The valley of Kashmir is red with the blood of freedom fighters. Despite tyranny and brutality, they stand firm in their pursuit of freedom — a right enshrined in UN Security Council resolutions,"" he said, reaffirming Pakistan's unwavering support.
Addressing the tragedy in Gaza, PM Shehbaz condemned the ongoing atrocities: ""Over 52,000 Palestinians — children, women, the elderly — have been martyred. Their blood stains the streets of Gaza. There is no modern precedent to this level of brutality.""
He called on the international community to awaken its conscience and echoed global praise for President Erdogan's vocal advocacy for the oppressed. ""Let our voices rise - in the name of God — to demand a ceasefire and justice for the people of Gaza.""
Describing the trilateral meeting between Pakistan, Turkey, and Azerbaijan as ""productive and inspiring,"" PM Shehbaz concluded his address with a call for regional unity and enduring friendship.
""Our flags today flutter high — as emblems of unity, hope, and strength,"" he said, adding, ""We will continue to stand with our brothers and sisters, whether in Karabakh, Kashmir, or Gaza. This is our shared commitment, our shared destiny.""

Iran may pause uranium enrichment,"US
The sources told Reuters that under this arrangement, Tehran would halt uranium enrichment for a year.
Iran may pause uranium enrichment if the US releases frozen Iranian funds and recognises Tehran's right to refine uranium for civilian use under a ""political deal"" that could lead to a broader nuclear accord, two Iranian official sources said.
The sources, close to the negotiating team, said on Wednesday a ""political understanding with the United States could be reached soon"" if Washington accepted Tehran's conditions. One of the sources said the matter ""has not been discussed yet"" during the talks with the United States.
The sources told Reuters that under this arrangement, Tehran would halt uranium enrichment for a year, ship part of its highly enriched stock abroad or convert it into fuel plates for civilian nuclear purposes.
A temporary pause to enrichment would be a way to overcome an impasse over clashing red lines after five rounds of talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme.
US officials have repeatedly said that any new nuclear deal with Iran — to replace a failed 2015 accord between Tehran and six world powers — must include a commitment to scrap enrichment, viewed as a potential pathway to developing nuclear bombs.
The Islamic Republic has repeatedly denied such intentions, saying it wants nuclear energy only for civilian purposes, and has publicly rejected Washington's demand to scrap enrichment as an attack on its national sovereignty.
In Washington, a US official told Reuters the proposal aired by the Iranian sources had not been brought to the negotiating table to date. The US State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this article.
Iran's semi-official Fars news agency said Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei denied Reuters report and said ""enrichment in Iran is a non-negotiable principle"". The Iranian sources said Tehran would not agree to dismantling of its nuclear programme or infrastructure or sealing of its nuclear installations as demanded by US President Donald Trump's administration.
Instead, they said, Trump must publicly recognise Iran's sovereign right to enrichment as a member of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and authorise a release of Iranian oil revenues frozen by sanctions, including $6 billion in Qatar. Reuters

"In world first, Mexican voters to elect all judges","US
Critics argue it will undermine the judiciary's independence and warn the participation of controversial candidates
Mexico is set to become the world's only country to let voters elect all of their judges, sparking sharp disagreement about whether the reforms will diminish or strengthen criminal influence over the courts.
The government says the unprecedented popular vote for judges and magistrates at all levels — including the Supreme Court — is needed to address rampant corruption and impunity.
Critics argue it will undermine the judiciary's independence and warn the participation of controversial candidates — such as a former lawyer for notorious drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman — means it is doomed to backfire.
On Sunday, voters will choose several thousand federal, district and local judges and magistrates. Another election for the remainder will be held in 2027.
Not just anybody can run for one of these jobs. Candidates must have a law degree, experience in legal affairs, what is termed ""a good reputation,"" and no criminal record.
Opponents, including judicial workers, have held a series of mass street protests in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the reforms.
""Justice is not something you vote for"" and it needs people with experience and specialized knowledge, said Olimpia Rojas Luviano, a 28-year-old lawyer.
But Maria del Rocio Morales, a judge who is standing to be a magistrate in the capital, said she was happy to take part.
""For the good of my city and my country, I will do it,"" she said.
President Claudia Sheinbaum has played down signs that many voters are unlikely to take part in the vote .
""People are very intelligent and know who they are going to vote for,"" the veteran left-winger said. AFP

K-P loses oil and gas royalty,"PK
Suffers revenue loss due to forced curtailment of hydrocarbon output at local fields
As liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies continue to arrive from Qatar, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has expressed strong reservations about the forced curtailment of domestic oil and gas production, which is resulting in a significant revenue loss to the provincial government in terms of royalty and windfall levy.
Local oil and gas exploration and production companies pay royalty and windfall levy along with other taxes, but these have now been compromised due to the forced reduction in hydrocarbon output from fields operated by different companies like Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and MOL.
The issue has also sparked concerns among the exploration firms, which took up the matter with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Now, the special assistant to the K-P chief minister on energy and power has raised the issue with the federal government.
At a meeting, he stated that the forced curtailment of gas supply from various fields in K-P not only caused production loss and potential damage to the reservoirs but also resulted in a significant revenue loss to the provincial government in terms of royalty and windfall levy.
He requested that a mechanism should be established to avoid such forced curtailment in future in the best interest of both the province and the federal government.
The federal and K-P governments agreed that it was a national issue and the Centre would resolve it through consultation with all stakeholders.
Oil and gas exploration companies were also facing the problem of circular debt due to the forced curtailment of gas supply, which led to the import of expensive LNG from Qatar. It caused an increase in the country's overall import bill.
On the other hand, the power producers were not willing to procure LNG as per their commitment, putting Pakistan State Oil (PSO) – a major LNG importer – in a difficult situation.
Owing to the reduction in indigenous oil and gas production, Attock Refinery Limited (ARL) has decided to close its main crude distillation unit till June 1, 2025.
This is a critical issue, which requires urgent attention of the authorities concerned, as it has not only severely impacted ARL, but is also going to dent the cash flow of exploration companies like state-owned giant OGDCL.
According to industry players, the previous Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) government had signed an LNG purchase agreement with Qatar without conducting the necessary due diligence concerning the demand for gas in Pakistan. It struck the deal in haste that severely hurt the energy sector in the form of accumulating circular debt.
The private sector has been struggling to import LNG for quite some time but bureaucratic and political hurdles did not allow it to happen. Now, the prices have gone higher, making imports unfeasible.
Pakistan has so far set up two LNG terminals but one of them is running at partial capacity due to mismanagement and mishandling of the LNG issue.
In a notice issued to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), ARL informed the bourse that the oil refinery had shut down its main crude distillation unit (having a capacity of 32,400 barrels per day) in the wake of very low crude stocks.
It said that the unit would remain closed till June 1, 2025, adding that Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) had faced high pressure on its system, which resulted in forced curtailment of gas production from local fields. It was also a reason behind the halt to oil and gas supplies.

Pakistan deplores Modi's 'inflammatory monologue',"US
Urges India to return to core principles of international order
Pakistan on Wednesday regretted 'another inflammatory monologue' delivered by Indian Prime Minister Modi, advising Indian government to cleanse its conscience, desist issuing threats and return to the core principles of international order, including respect for sovereign rights of others and its treaty obligations, as well as restraint in both language and action.
""It is regrettable, though not entirely unexpected, that the Indian prime minister has, once again, set aside the ongoing project of historical revisionism and the internal repression of minorities to deliver yet another inflammatory monologue.
His references to weaponising water, a shared, treaty-bound resource, reflect a troubling departure from international norms and a stark contrast between India's conduct in the region and its declared global ambitions,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a press statement.
It further said that a leadership truly in pursuit of international respect might first look inward, and seek to cleanse its conscience before issuing threats to others.
PM Modi in his remarks at a gathering in Gandhinagar, the other day, criticized provisions of Indus Waters Treaty saying that these were 'badly negotiated'. ""The treaty has merely been put on hold and they (Pakistan) are already sweating profusely,"" the Indian media quoted him as saying.
The Foreign Office in the statement said that the Indian government was linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion.
India is in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood.

India's 'new normal' a serious threat to peace,"GB
At UN, Pakistan warns of hitting back at India with 'greater ferocity' if attacked again
A senior Pakistani diplomat has warned India that it will respond with ""greater ferocity and resolve"" if attacked again as he drew attention of the UN Conference on Disarmament in Geneva to the recent hostilities between the two South Asian nations.
""South Asia does not need another crisis — It requires a future shaped by cooperation, not confrontation,"" Ambassador Bilal Ahmad, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN offices in Geneva, told the 65-member forum established by the international community to negotiate arms control and disarmament agreements, which began its session on Tuesday.
""If India chooses the path of aggression again, the consequences — and the responsibility — will lie entirely at its door,"" he said, warning, ""Pakistan will stand ready to meet any Indian aggression at every escalating level with greater ferocity and resolve"".
Pakistan, Ambassador Bilal Ahmad added, will adhere to the ceasefire, pointing out that its preference remains unchanged: constructive engagement, result-oriented dialogue, and the peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.
He said that India's illegal threat and use of force against a nuclear-armed neighbour, now in shape of the Indian leadership's revisionist posture — the so-called ""new normal — poses a serious threat to strategic stability in South Asia.
Indeed, India's missile, drone, and air strikes on Pakistani territory earlier this month were part of a larger pattern aimed at ""normalizing the idea that military strikes between nuclear-armed states are acceptable,"" the Pakistani envoy told delegates.
""India seeks to normalize the idea that military strikes between nuclear-armed states are acceptable; that military losses are tolerable if the political narrative can be managed; that phantom victories can be claimed while real setbacks are denied — even when exposed by international media.""

"Textile exporters sound alarm over tax, energy policies","US
Say 18% sales tax, peak-hour tariffs will dent Pakistan's competitiveness
Pakistan's leading garment and textile exporters have sounded alarm over the government's policies that they fear will cripple the vital export sectors, which will in turn lose a crucial opportunity to capture a larger pie of the global market.
The Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) has vehemently opposed any move to impose 18% sales tax on exporters operating under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). It warned that such a regressive tax measure would paralyse the garment export sector, stifle the essential cash flow and derail the chance for Pakistan to increase its presence in the global apparel market.
The association expressed concern over what it described as a deliberate campaign by vested interests within the textile sector to weaken the country's most dynamic and value-added industry.
PRGMEA Regional Chairman Dr Ayyazuddin stated that the EFS was not a luxury but a necessity for export-led growth, adding that the garment industry, being entirely export-oriented and positioned at the end of textile value chain, was already bearing the brunt of delayed refunds and multiple taxes.
""Exporters pay sales tax upfront and wait for months to receive refunds; they often face a three-month delay, which severely hampers their cash flow and operational capacity,"" Ayyazuddin elaborated.
He stressed that the imposition of additional taxes would prove disastrous as the garment industry was playing a critical role as Pakistan's biggest source of employment and foreign exchange, particularly at a time when global trade shifts were offering new opportunities.
He warned that any restriction or levy on imported inputs, which are essential as 79% of the global textile market uses synthetic filament yarn, would push international buyers to divert orders to Pakistan's competitors like Bangladesh, Vietnam or Cambodia.
Simultaneously, the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers Association (PHMA) called on the government to abolish the outdated peak and off-peak electricity tariff structure.
In a letter sent to top government officials, the PHMA highlighted that the peak-hour surcharge policy was introduced to curb consumption during critical power shortages. However, the energy scenario has changed significantly, with Pakistan now having a surplus generation capacity and even exploring electricity exports.
Under such circumstances, the PHMA argued, the rationale for maintaining peak and off-peak tariff differential has completely vanished.
PHMA Zonal Chairman Abdul Hameed noted that exporters in the hosiery and textile sector, operating 24/7 to meet global deadlines, were struggling with competitiveness challenges due to high electricity charges during peak hours. Fluctuating tariffs force industries to change production schedules, reducing efficiency and increasing overall costs, which weakens Pakistan's position internationally.
Hameed emphasised that the surplus power situation presents a clear opportunity for reform.

Youth at risk as hypertension cases climb,"PK
Dr Bashir Hanif stated that more than 52% of people in Pakistan are affected by hypertension
A cardiologist stressed that hypertension is increasingly affecting Pakistani youth, emphasising the need for regular monitoring and awareness as the World Health Organisation reports over 1 billion people worldwide are affected with estimates suggesting a rise to 1.5 billion by 2025.
In an exclusive conversation with a private news channel, renowned Heart Specialist Dr Bashir Hanif highlighted the significance of World Hypertension Day, observed annually on May 17 to raise public awareness and promote prevention and control of this disease.
Dr Hanif emphasised the importance of awareness and regular monitoring in combating hypertension, a growing health concern worldwide.
Hypertension is often referred to as the ""silent killer"" because it can gradually build up in the body without noticeable symptoms, ultimately leading to severe cardiovascular issues like myocardial infarction, stroke and heart failure, he mentioned.
According to Dr Bashir Hanif, around 42% of people in Pakistan are unaware of hypertension symptoms and lack disease awareness, highlighting a significant need for education and awareness efforts.
Dr Bashir Hanif stated that more than 52% of people in Pakistan are affected by hypertension, underscoring the widespread nature of this health issue in the country.
He further mentioned that according to a global health survey report, hypertension has been the leading cause of death and disability-adjusted life years worldwide since 1990. By 2025, the number of people with hypertension is expected to surge by 15-20%, reaching nearly 1.5 billion.

There is an opportunity in disaster for India to start talking to Pakistan
As the nation proudly celebrated Youm-e-Takbeer, it was highly indebted to the luminary nuclear scientists, the visionary political leadership and the resilient civil, military bureaucracy that underwent all odds for decades, but never compromised on its security and sovereignty.
The Chagai May 28, 1998 atomic tests were in response to India's provocative jingoism of 'Smiling Buddha', and surely Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr Samar Mubarakmand deserve our praise and salutation.
Likewise, former PM Nawaz Sharif's apt decision to call the Indian bluff blessed Pakistan with the desired deterrence to stand tall among the comity of nations. This nuclear threshold has come to guard Pakistan as New Delhi opted for aggression early this month, and the befitting response from our armed forces and the nation is more than enough to keep the Hindutva-dispensation well within its limits.
Pakistan, as the seventh nuclear power in the globe and the only one in the Islamic world, is a power to be reckoned with. Moreover, its impregnable defence exhibited its glory and the world, including India, today recognises its superiority in all forms and manifestations.
The lethal response in self-defence, after four days of Indian onslaught, not only surprised the pundits of doom in India but also made global strategists come out in praise of Pakistan as it never let loose interstate and diplomatic ethics. Now is the time to build on that treasure trove and let the nation unite on a single cardinal principle: no to submission, and no compromise on security.
There is an opportunity in disaster for India to start talking to Pakistan, and iron out the intricate differences on the diplomatic front. The two states have fought four wars: 1948, 1965, 1971 and 2025. More to it is the Kargil episode of 1999, and countless skirmishes, border clashes and intrusions.
But the outcome is single-pointer: the dispute of Kashmir is in need of being resolved. Now India's shenanigans such as abrogating Kashmir's special status and suspending IWT are self-defeating in the long run. As Islamabad has offered to talk, it's time to demonstrate leadership and bury the hatchet for a better tomorrow.

"Man arrested for killing sister, faking suicide scene","US
Police claim the suspect has confessed to the crime
Shadbagh police have arrested a man accused of murdering his sister and attempting to portray the crime scene as a suicide.
Initial reports had indicated that the young woman had taken her own life by slitting her wrist, prompting the police to arrive at the scene and take the body into custody.
However, officials grew suspicious after noticing signs of violence on the victim's face and neck.
Upon questioning, the victim's brother, who had been initially treated as a witness, confessed to the crime police officials said.
According to investigators, the suspect admitted to murdering his sister over the suspicion that she had stolen money from a cupboard in their home.
In an attempt to disguise the murder, the suspect allegedly cut his nails to evade responsibility for scratch marks on the victim's body and then cut her wrist. The police registered a murder case and shifted the body to a morgue for post-mortem.
Officials said investigations into the case were ongoing.
In another incident, the police in the Nadarabad area arrested a man for allegedly attempting to kill his father over a property dispute.
According to a spokesperson, the action was taken following a distress call received on the police helpline 15.
The suspect, identified as Mubashir, was apprehended with a pistol in his possession.
Initial investigations revealed that the suspect had threatened to kill his father and reportedly attempted to do so using the firearm during a heated argument over family property.
The police have registered a case against Mubashir and launched an investigation.

PML-N alleges misuse of Article 187,"RO
Submits additional pleas in reserved seats review case
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Wednesday submitted additional written arguments in the Supreme Court ahead of the hearing on its review petition against the July 12 verdict regarding reserved seats.
Filed through senior counsel Haris Azmat, the additional submissions argue that the use of Article 187 in the July 12 judgment was inconsistent with settled judicial principles.
The party contended that the SC had exercised its powers under Article 187 in a manner that deviated from established legal norms.
""The Detailed Reasoning in Paragraph No. 117, while granting relief to the PTI, has erroneously relied on Article 187 of the Constitution. The said findings are against the settled jurisprudence and hence liable to be reviewed,"" it stated.
The appeal also stated that the observations mentioned above were made without citing any judgment or past precedent from the SC to support them, which goes against its established jurisprudence.
The judgment also overlooked the fact that this was an appeal under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, challenging a judgment of the Peshawar High Court, not a public interest petition under Article 184(3).
Moreover, the petitioner was not given any chance or right to be heard on the issue of whether reserved seats could be granted to PTI, which was not made a party before the SC or in the earlier proceedings.
The appeal further argued that the detailed reasoning, in making the above observations, ignored the established jurisprudence of the SC, particularly regarding the limitations on the Court's powers under Article 187 of the Constitution.
It cited, for example, a ten-member bench judgment of the SC in Justice Qazi Faez Isa and another vs President of Pakistan, where the majority opinion in Paragraph No. 34 affirmed that no person, authority, tribunal, or court whether exercising executive or judicial powers can act against any person in violation of the law.
This principle, the appeal stressed, applies equally to SC when exercising its judicial authority, including under Article 187(1) of the Constitution.
While Article 187 allows the court to pass any order necessary to do complete justice between the parties, it cannot issue any order that contradicts fundamental rights, constitutional provisions, or applicable statutory law.
It was emphasised that the conclusions drawn in Paragraph No. 117 of the detailed judgement overlooked this consistent legal position. The powers under Article 187 can only be used between the parties before the Court and strictly in accordance with the Constitution and the law.
It contented that these powers cannot be invoked to reopen matters that have already been settled or to address issues not directly under consideration. The provision does not confer unlimited or unchecked authority on the court.
The submission emphasised that Article 187 does not grant the court unlimited powers, noting that the points on which the judgment was based were never part of the court record. It also claimed that none of the 80 SIC members personally appeared before the court.
It recalled that in its eight-judge detailed judgment, the court had emphasised that PTI's relief in this case stems from the court's concern for protecting the electorate's right to vote, which is guaranteed under Articles 17(2) and 19 of the Constitution.
""The procedural formality of first accepting PTI's application and then granting it the relief does not carry much weight where the Court's concern is the protection of the right of vote of the people (the electorate) guaranteed under Articles 17(2) and 19 of the Constitution, more than the right of any political partywhether it be SIC or PTI or any other party,"" the judgement had noted.
However, the PML-N's additional appeal argued that the above findings were ""so shocking and surprising that even some of the other members of the bench recorded their separate reasoning on the same,"" citing the judgment authored by Justice Amin ud Din Khan and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan.
Importantly, the PML-N maintained that SIC and PTI cannot be treated as the same political entity.
It urged the apex court to reconsider and revise its July 12 ruling.
The case will be heard today (Thursday) by an 11-member larger constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan.

Maryam's 'hawkish tone' muddles Centre's PTI talk offer,"PK
PTI still invited to talks despite Punjab CM's comparison with terror, India
While Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has drawn comparisons between Pakistan's chief adversary, terrorists and PTI – the country's largest political party – the federal government has insisted that its offer for dialogue with the party remains on the table.
According to Minister of State Barrister Akeel Malik, the government's priority was to steady the political ship, even as divergent voices within the PML-N continue to muddy the waters.
Though the PTI has seen its street muscle diminish over the last two years, its ability to rattle the PML-N government remains limited for now. However, a faction within the ruling party, seemingly led by Maryam Nawaz, appears unable to let go of the old playbook of PTI-bashing, showing a tin ear to voters' psychology.
As recent past shows, political mudslinging is a double-edged sword. During his time in power as prime minister, Imran Khan made PML-N his punching bag in nearly every speech, but the relentless attacks often backfired, drawing flak even from his own base, who urged him to rise above political pettiness.
Maryam appears to have taken a page out of Imran Khan's book, keeping her guns trained on the PTI. Even when the federal government appears to be making genuine efforts to lower the political temperature, PML-N leaders, including Maryam and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, continue to fan the flames.
Recently, during an address to students, Maryam drew parallels between terrorists, India and PTI. The comment snowballed online, with many misinterpreting it as the CM branding PTI a greater threat than India or terrorism.
However, it is pertinent to note that Maryam has, in the past, reportedly referred to Imran Khan as more dangerous than both terrorism and the coronavirus.
On the other hand, the federal government has left the door ajar for dialogue despite PTI's persistent refusal to step through it.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Barrister Akeel clarified that the chief minister had spoken in a ""specific context"" during her speech.
However, he added that PTI had previously acted against the country's interests more than once. ""Which political party goes against its own country by writing to the IMF, asking it to withhold loans? And PTI has shown no remorse for what it has done,"" he said.
""As far as the government is concerned, our doors are still open to PTI,"" he added. ""The committee formed to engage with PTI remains intact. All PTI has to do is express its desire in the National Assembly. However, they seemingly do not believe in political dialogue, nor do they appear interested in resolving anything.""
He denied any internal party rift on the issue of PTI.
When asked about the contradictory positions of the federal and provincial information ministries, where the federal minister praised PTI's social media for promoting the country's narrative while Punjab's Azma Bukhari accused it of undermining national interests, Akeel defended both stances.
He explained that while the entire country had come together to fight disinformation on digital platforms, some PTI social media activists continued to circulate AI-generated images to troll political leaders.
Former spokesperson of the Nawaz family, Muhammad Zubair, speaking to The Express Tribune, described the Maryam Nawaz-led group as the party's ""hawks"" in relation to PTI, while Shehbaz Sharif, true to his temperament, represented the reconciliatory faction.
He noted that the hawkish faction was deeply wary of PTI's enduring support base and sought to decisively neutralise the party. ""It's a reality that, for Maryam Nawaz, Imran Khan is more of a threat than Modi,"" he said. ""Shehbaz, by contrast, is not a hardliner.""
Zubair suggested that Maryam Nawaz ought to realise that PTI, in its current form, was not as potent. ""Why continue to call them out? If the country can reach a ceasefire with India, why not with a political rival?"" he asked.
""If I were Maryam's advisor, I would tell her to be indifferent toward PTI.""

Slavery disguised as freedom,"US
Freedom inside the minds of the American kids is to read Tom Clancy and watch Breaking Bad.
Growing up in Pakistan has its own benefits. One is devoid of a democratic society but is also free from the needs of a democratic society that has to obey lobbies inside the country and at the same time lie about people representative.
We indulged in rote learning inside Pakistan but once exposed to books authored by foreign authors, it didn't take a long time to understand the truth as it was. In fact, it is quite acceptable, rather fashionable, to value foreign everything in Pakistan. Imported stuff is good stuff.
In the United States, however, kids grow up with the mindset that anything American is the best. And it is not much different than kids growing up in Pakistan but as mentioned above, the Pakistani kids get to be exposed to foreign sources and realities. The American kids never get to learn that perhaps other countries make better cars, are better mathematicians, make better tools, speak multiple languages, and above all know the truth much better than them.
Freedom inside the minds of Pakistani teenagers and older youth is tantamount to experiencing realities other than the ones taught to them by their society. Freedom is not to memorise the lessons in the textbook or watch Jeeto Pakistan but rather to read Tom Clancy and to watch Breaking Bad.
Freedom inside the minds of the American kids is to read Tom Clancy and watch Breaking Bad. Similar consumption yet very opposite reasons. Freedom to the Americans is to continue to do what they have been doing since that is something people in other societies do not have access to.
The inability to experience outside sources of information and the treatment of domestic sources as the ultimate truth has created a society where men and women grow up with the fictitious notion that as Christians they must protect Israel. That idea has somehow become an American idea, more specifically, a Christian American idea.
The protection of Israel has been made to be a part of the American Christian life, a life that can only enrich itself from the sources of knowledge present at home, a life that not only is not much exposed to foreign sources but also refuses to value or acknowledge foreign sources. That recalcitrance is also part of the American belief system.
The protection of Israel has been made an important part of Jewish and Christian American lives. Kids grow up with this belief system without the ability or chance of venturing into other sources of knowledge that might question this idea. Americans are so deeply entrenched into the idea of theirs as the best knowledge that even educated people who come from other countries are told how their degrees are worthless from an American standpoint.
A Harvard student who strongly believes that Israel must be protected is treated above compared to an Australian, Pakistani or Indian student who knows the truth as it is instead of as it has been tailored for the American mindset.
Enter Israeli lobbies inside the United States. Their work has been tremendously criticised and rightfully so. However, what many miss is the fact that the work of the lobbies in coercing politicians to be eagerly pro-Israel is made easy by having a population that while growing up in America was trained to subscribe to this idea very aggressively.
It is not always the case that these lobbies coerce the politicians to go against their constituencies but rather their coercion is more about reminding the politicians about how the lobbies can stir up the sentiments among their constituencies as well as the general public, if the politicians show signs of having funny ideas such as criticising Israel for killing children or uttering words such as genocide and forgetting to utter words such as Holocaust.
For Palestine to be free, the Israeli lobbies inside the United States sure must be defeated but more important is the undoing of decades of mind control to which the American people were subjected. The work must start from there.

Passengers abandon trains for buses amid rail chaos,"US
Delays, derailments, cancellations push travellers away
Facing a surge in derailments, sudden train cancellations and long delays, a growing number of passengers have begun abandoning Pakistan Railways in favour of luxury bus services.
The shift in travel preferences has left the railways operating with reduced passenger numbers, often merging the bookings of two or three trains into one journey due to low occupancy.
According to official railway data, over the past month, multiple Up and Down trains, including major routes like Karachi, Faisalabad, and Rawalpindi, have been suspended without prior notice.
Notable among the cancelled services are Shah Hussain Business Express and the Shalimar Express. Affected passengers are being accommodated in other trains, such as the Green Line, which itself is frequently delayed.
Officials cite an aging railway infrastructure as a key factor. Many tracks, especially in smaller cities and remote regions, are over a century old. Lack of timely maintenance has led to an increase in accidents, derailments, and collisions with trolleys and other vehicles at unguarded crossings. The decaying state of the railway's physical assets has significantly eroded public trust in the service.
Adding to passenger frustration are the appalling conditions at railway stations. Waiting areas are overcrowded or nearly non-existent, many platforms are over 100 years old and lack adequate space for passengers and their families, and sanitation is a major issue.
Toilets are foul-smelling and often unusable, while food vendors charge exorbitant prices for poor-quality items. Despite repeated visits and surprise inspections by Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi and directives to improve services, conditions have barely improved.
Passenger Rehan Hashim, who was scheduled to travel to Karachi, told Express News:
""We were shocked to learn our Business Express was canceled. They shifted us to Green Line, which was four hours late. There was no proper waiting area, and the heat was unbearable. Rail travel used to be enjoyable, but now it's a humiliating experience despite paying thousands. Traveling by coach is far better.""
While Pakistan Railways claims that passenger numbers typically dip during pre-summer vacation months and expects traffic to pick up once schools close, passengers and analysts argue that service quality, not the season, is driving the decline.
Officials insist that food quality and station facilities are being upgraded in coordination with the Punjab Food Authority. Yet passengers report no visible improvements beyond short-term clean-up efforts following inspections.

Hussaiyn behind the camera,"US
Actor explores production with two upcoming projects
At a recent promotional event for the upcoming horror film Deemak held in Lahore, actor Sonya Hussaiyn surprised fans and industry insiders alike by announcing a significant shift in her career trajectory. The celebrated star revealed that she is increasingly moving away from acting to focus on film production and, potentially, direction.
""I've gotten into production now,"" Hussaiyn shared during a media interaction at the event. A video clip of her statement, posted on Tuesday, has since gone viral across social media platforms. ""I'm in the directorial team of Shaan, which is a very emotional film,"" she added.
Hussaiyn also disclosed that she's producing another film in the action genre. ""I want to do a lot of production and create films that have substance,"" she said, indicating a desire not just to participate in storytelling but to shape it from the ground up.
With this shift comes a noticeable change in how often fans can expect to see her on screen. ""I'm probably going to be onscreen a lot less,"" Hussaiyn stated.
However, audiences can still look forward to her lead role in Deemak, the horror-family drama directed by Rafay Rashdi. Speaking about the film, which is slated for release this Eidul Azha, Hussaiyn expressed enthusiasm for both the script and the cast. ""Having our industry's biggest stars in the film, like Javed Sheikh, Bushra Ansari, Samina Peerzada, and Faysal Quraishi, encouraged me to sign this film,"" she said. ""If they're in it, to me, it means that the story has substance.""
Hussaiyn also discussed the challenge of portraying a character under supernatural possession while maintaining a clear distinction from mental illness. ""There's a difference between having a mental illness and being possessed that I had to get across to my audience,"" she explained.
One particular scene left a lasting impression on everyone involved. ""There is a scene in the film where I am having fits as a jinn possesses me,"" she recalled. ""When I filmed that scene, there was pin-drop silence on set."" The crew's reaction confirmed the scene's eerie impact. ""I guess even everyone on set was slightly unsettled by it,"" she added.
This turn toward more meaningful storytelling aligns with Hussaiyn's growing interest in production. Last November, she produced her first film, Babli/Babar, a bold project directed by Kamran Faiq and written by Qurbe Abbas.

FIFA honours Shaheen Shah Afridi,"US
He featured with legends Messi, Neymar Jr., and Luka Modric
The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has paid a unique tribute to Pakistan's star fast bowler Shaheen Shah Afridi by featuring him alongside football legends in a recent social media post.
In an Instagram post shared by the official FIFA World Cup account, Afridi was seen alongside global football icons Lionel Messi, Neymar Jr., and Luka Modric — athletes all famously associated with the iconic number 10 jersey.
The caption simply read, ""The iconic,"" celebrating global sporting legends who have worn the legendary number.
According to sources, FIFA's intent behind the post was to engage Pakistani fans ahead of the upcoming FIFA World Cup.
Local digital teams are reportedly working on enhancing fan engagement through tailored social media campaigns in various countries, including Pakistan.
The tribute from FIFA reflects Afridi's growing influence and global recognition as an athlete. He now joins the ranks of legendary sports figures symbolically associated with the iconic number 10 jersey.
It is pertinent to mention that under Shaheen Afridi's captaincy, Lahore Qalandars clinched the title in the recently concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) season 10, defeating Quetta Gladiators by six wickets at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.
Chasing a target of 202, the Qalandars needed 13 runs in the final over. Sikandar Raza rose to the occasion, hitting a four and a six to seal the win with just one delivery remaining.
With this triumph, Shaheen further extended his record as the most successful captain in PSL history.
Already the only skipper to win back-to-back titles in 2022 and 2023, Afridi has now become the first captain to lift the PSL trophy three times.
At just 25 years old, he stands alone atop the list of PSL-winning captains. All other captains in the league's history have secured the title only once.

Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf's (PTI) central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram on Wednesday dismissed reports of ongoing negotiations with the government, saying dialogue ""does not work like this"".
Addressing a news conference, the party's central information secretary clarified that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan has denied initiating talks.
""You can't drive daggers of hatred into someone's chest and still expect goodwill in return,"" he added.
He further clarified that the negotiation committee had been constituted by Imran himself and that his participation was at his direction. ""No one can claim we didn't sit with them, we did so only on the founder's instructions.""
Criticising the ""rigged"" political landscape shaped by the February 9 polls, Akram asserted that the ""Form-47 government"" must stop its ""campaign of cruelty and repression"" against political opponents.
Taking a jibe at the judiciary amid PTI's legal woes, he alleged that verdicts could now be predicted based on the composition of the bench.
""Our lawyers already inform us what the judgment will be, the system stands naked,"" he said.
Vowing to resist until the very end, he said the PTI will fight ""till the last ball"". ""The world is watching. We will not surrender. We will not concede defeat.""
Waqas also demanded the repeal of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, calling it detrimental to the country. ""It has caused irreparable harm, everything is being dismantled.""
Commenting on the Al-Qadir Trust case, he reiterated that no financial benefit had accrued to either the PTI founder or his spouse, Bushra Bibi. ""The whole world knows he is not corrupt. Pakistan has been turned into a joke.""
""He is not even allowed to speak to his children or meet his sisters. Books are not being permitted. This government is haunted by his presence,"" the PTI leader said, calling it a ""regime of paranoia"".
He alleged that the Punjab Police was blocking political leaders from meeting Imran and that surveillance cameras had been installed, ""noting every move"".
""We are demanding the rule of law and constitutional supremacy. This path of tyranny must end.""
He also rubbished all speculation of a backdoor arrangement. ""The PTI founder does not want a deal. He said ten months ago he would rather spend his life in jail than enter a compromise.""
""He has not bowed and will not bow. Even Rana Sanaullah admitted this publicly.""
Citing an example, he said a young man named Raza Ali, imprisoned in Kot Lakhpat Jail for two years, had recently been granted bail by the Supreme Court. ""His ailing grandmother repeatedly told the court her grandson was innocent.""
""The person he was accused of injuring wasn't even on the list of the wounded,"" he said. ""This child spent two years behind bars for no reason.""
He said the party's legal team would soon present detailed information about all such unjustly imprisoned individuals. ""The Supreme Court must ensure its judgments are implemented.""

Atkinson ruled out of WI ODIs,"US
He sustained injury during one-off Test against Zimbabwe
England pacer Gus Atkinson has been ruled out of the three-match home ODI series against West Indies, scheduled to run from May 29 to June 3.
According to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), Atkinson sustained a hamstring injury during their one-off Test against Zimbabwe, which concluded on Saturday in Nottingham.
The 27-year-old, as a result, will undergo rehabilitation under the supervision of the England medical team, while no time frame was shared by the cricket board for his recovery.
""England and Surrey seamer Gus Atkinson has been ruled out of the upcoming Metro Bank One-Day Internationals against the West Indies due to a right hamstring strain,"" the ECB said in a statement.
""Atkinson sustained the injury during England's Rothesay Test victory over Zimbabwe at Trent Bridge last week.
""He will now undergo a period of rehabilitation under the supervision of the England medical team.""
Notably, the home side decided against making any changes to their squad for the ODI series against West Indies.
The aforementioned series holds significant importance for the former world champions as it will be the first assignment of newly-appointed captain Harry Brook, who succeeded Jos Buttler, stepped down from the role after England lost all three of their ICC Men's Champions Trophy 2025 group-stage matches.
The ODI series will be followed by three T20Is, slated to be played on June 6, 8 and 10 respectively.
England squad for West Indies ODIs: Harry Brook (Yorkshire) – Captain, Jofra Archer (Sussex), Tom Banton (Somerset), Jacob Bethell (Warwickshire), Jos Buttler (Lancashire), Brydon Carse (Durham), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Tom Hartley (Lancashire), Will Jacks (Surrey), Saqib Mahmood (Lancashire), Matthew Potts (Durham), Jamie Overton (Somerset), Adil Rashid (Yorkshire), Joe Root (Yorkshire) and Jamie Smith (Surrey).
