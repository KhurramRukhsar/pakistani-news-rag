Imran ready for ‘give and take’: Aleema,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316030-imran-ready-for-give-and-take-aleema,"ISLAMABAD/ PESHAWAR: PTI founder chairman Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan Tuesday expressed willingness for negotiations saying, “Don’t sit back and hide; come forward and talk”.
Talking to the media while heading to the Adiala jail to meet Imran and earlier chatting with the media outside the Islamabad High Court, she said, “We have no idea what you want from us; there have been two years now. Don’t be afraid of us. The PTI founder is ready for talks, ready for give and take”.
She said, “Don’t sit back, come forward and talk; sit with us, there will be no secret talks. We are receiving threats that our car will overturn and Imran Khan will be finished (in jail), but we are not afraid.”
She told the media persons that if Barrister Gohar Ali Khan had good news regarding Imran’s release, then it should also be shared with her, and he should be asked about other details. Aleema contended that Imran’s case was not being heard despite the acting chief justice’s promise to their three senior-most lawyers. “Don’t try to intimidate judges and our legislators. And don’t do things while sitting in the background,” she remarked.
Responding to Aleema Khan’s offer, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said it could be considered. Speaking in the Geo News programme “Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath”, he termed Aleema’s remarks “fragile effort”, saying her fresh offer could be “probed”. He, however, strongly slammed the language allegedly used against the state institutions by the social media warriors of the former ruling party, whether inside or outside the country. He said the PTI used to launch campaigns against the institutions with the blessings of their leadership. However, Asif said he did not see the matter resolving until clarity in the narrative of the former ruling party.
In a related development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the judges had taken oath that justice should be seen to be done. Talking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, he said the PTI founder’s case had been fixed for hearing on June 5 adding, “We expect that our case will be heard and a better response will be given”.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur made it clear that the shelling on the PPP workers was not done on his orders, but according to the red zone SOPs.
Talking to the media during his appearance in the Islamabad High Court, he said the PPP workers tried to enter the red zone on which they were shelled and that it was not done on his orders.
He said the JUI held five rallies in 15 months, for which they provided security, but they (PPP) were stopped while entering the red zone.
Our Peshawar Bureau adds: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi flayed Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur for his statement about weapons and said it amounted to open rebellion and a clear violation of the Constitution and law. “Ali Amin Gandapur’s rhetoric goes against national unity and constitutional principles, and is unacceptable,” he said in a statement. Kundi said the statements made against the state institutions were punishable by law and should be dealt with through immediate legal action. “A person who speaks against the state is not fit to represent the public,” said the governor while referring to the chief minister.
“It is unfortunate that the campaigns on social media targeting the victories of the army are being backed by the Chief Minister’s House,” Kundi alleged. The governor accused the chief minister of indulging in dirty politics for personal political gain, even on a sensitive national issue like the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
“The baton charge and shelling on peaceful protesters is the worst example of fascism,” said the governor while referring to the use of force against the PPP workers the previous day.

A deal was being sealed in Presidency when US Navy Seals raided Abbottabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316031-a-deal-was-being-sealed-in-presidency-when-us-navy-seals-raided-abbottabad,"ISLAMABAD: When the U.S. Navy SEALs raided Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, a power-sharing agreement was being signed at the Presidency between the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid (PML-Q), reveals a new book documenting significant events from Asif Ali Zardari’s previous term as president.
“The agreement was finalized around 1:30a.m. on May 2, precisely when U.S. Navy SEALs were infiltrating the country, raiding the compound, killing Osama bin Laden, and escaping with his body—announcing to the world that the most wanted terrorist had been hiding in a military cantonment in Pakistan,” writes Farhatullah Babar, who was then the spokesperson for President Asif Ali Zardari.
According to Babar, the President’s ADC, Squadron Leader Jalal, was likely the first to sense that something unusual had occurred when he learned from an air force source that a helicopter had crashed in Abbottabad. For him, a helicopter flying in the hilly area at night was suspicious. “He was the first among the President’s staff to learn about what had happened,” Babar noted.
Nevertheless, Jalal chose not to immediately inform the President, opting to double-check the information.
Meanwhile, the switchboard operator of the Army House called to inform that the army chief was on his way to the Presidency. U.S. President Obama had also called Zardari. It remains unclear whether Zardari’s meeting with the army chief had occurred by that time. The President stayed awake throughout the night, first due to the finalization of the power-sharing agreement with the PML-Q and then because of the Abbottabad incident.
As the Memo-gate scandal unfolded following Osama’s killing, leading to Hussain Haqqani’s resignation, Farhatullah Babar, author of The Zardari Presidency (2008–13), considered issuing a press release as the spokesperson. The decision of his removal was made during a meeting held at the Prime Minister’s House, attended by Gilani, Zardari, and Kayani. However, Babar discovered something alarming.
“I discovered that my Gmail account had just been hacked,” writes Babar. It wasn’t merely a case of hacking; the account was being misused. “During the few hours my account remained compromised, the hackers had already sent out fake messages. One such message claimed that in a private communication with a friend, I had acknowledged that the memo sent to Mike Mullen was genuine. Another falsely stated that I had told a friend the memo was indeed written at Zardari’s behest. The FIA was unable to trace the hacker,” Babar writes.
Recalling the Raymond Davis episode, Babar writes that the Americans were desperate to secure his release and fly him out as soon as possible. The reason behind this urgency remained shrouded in mystery. Zardari told Senator John Kerry, who was in Pakistan for this purpose, that since Davis wasn’t a diplomat, he couldn’t be granted immunity. Even if granted, it would be struck down by the court. He then showed pictures of religious parties demanding criminal prosecution of Raymond. Leaning towards Kerry, Zardari said, “I don’t want the mullahs to take it to the streets.”
There had to be an out-of-the-box solution, Zardari stated. When Kerry inquired about that, he replied: “We have to think about paying good compensation to the families of the victims under Islamic law.” At this, U.S. Ambassador Cameron Munter’s face lit up. “But it is not automatic. The process involved will take some time.” Munter slumped again. He was in a hurry to secure Davis’s release. Eventually, the release occurred through this formula.

Modi continues to fan anti-Pakistan hysteria,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316032-modi-continues-to-fan-anti-pakistan-hysteria,"KARACHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday intensified his criticism of Pakistan, declaring that what were once considered proxy wars are now part of a “well-thought-out strategy” by Islamabad, and warning that “if they are engaging in war, then the response will be accordingly.”
Speaking during celebrations marking 20 years of Indian Gujarat’s urban development in Gandhinagar, Modi invoked a narrative steeped in nationalism and historical grievance, asserting that India would respond with full force to what he described as deliberate acts of war from across the border.
“We can’t call this a proxy war as those who were killed after May 6 were given state honours in Pakistan. Pakistani flags were draped over their coffins, and their military saluted them. This proves that these terrorist activities are not just a proxy war — this is a deliberate war strategy on their part”, Modi said.
Citing Operation Sindoor, Modi claimed that nine identified terrorist bases were destroyed in 22 minutes with full camera documentation.
Modi linked current tensions to the historical legacy of Partition, stating that “during Partition, Maa Bharati was divided into two, and that very night, the first terror attack on Kashmir was launched by the mujahideen. Had they been eliminated then, these 75 years of suffering could have been avoided.”
He went on to lament how Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s vision of ‘reclaiming’ Azad Kashmir had not been followed through, adding omonously that: “No matter how strong or healthy the body is, even a single thorn can cause constant pain -- and we’ve decided that the thorn must be removed”.
Referring to India’s repeated military encounters with Pakistan, Modi asserted, “Whenever India and Pakistan went to war, our Indian Armed Forces defeated them in a way they would never forget. Realising they could never win a direct war against India, they turned to proxy warfare, providing military training and support to terrorists instead.”
In the midst of his aggressive posturing, the Indian prime minister also decided to preach ‘global wellbeing’, saying that “India has always advocated peace and stability”..
He also touched on water resource issues in Occupied Kashmir and the Indus Waters Treaty, which he claimed had been “put in abeyance”, accusing previous Indian governments of neglecting dam maintenance and water infrastructure.
Modi used the occasion also to frame Operation Sindoor as a national mission. “Operation Sindoor is not merely a military initiative but a responsibility shared by every Indian citizen.”
The speech also included broader economic commentary, with Modi highlighting India’s rise to what he says is the world’s fourth-largest economy.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has strongly condemned the Indian prime minister’s Monday’s remarks, describing them as a “hate-driven invocation of violence” that sets a “dangerous precedent... in a region already burdened by volatility.”
In a statement, the Foreign Office said the speech represented “reckless provocation, intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir.” “The international community must take serious note of India’s escalating rhetoric”, the statement said.

CII rejects child marriage restraint bill as contrary to Islam,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316033-cii-rejects-child-marriage-restraint-bill-as-contrary-to-islam,"ISLAMABAD: The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) on Tuesday rejected the Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025 which fixes minimum age for marriage at 18, terming the legislation passed by the National Assembly and Senate against Islam.
“The CII at its meeting termed the Child Marriage Restraint Bill which was moved by Sharmila Faruqui MNA in the National Assembly as un-Islamic,” an official statement issued by the CII media wing after the meeting said.
The participants of the meeting chaired by Dr. Raghib Hussain Naeemi maintained that clauses of the Child Marriage Restraint bill, 2025, fixing the age limit for marriage and declaring marriage below age of 18 as child abuse and punishment for committing the act, do not conform with the Islamic injunctions.
The CII meeting, while pointing out some problems in under-age marriages, also observed that the trend should be discouraged. “However, the CII meeting as a whole rejected the bill terming the same as un-Islamic,” the CII statement said. The meeting also noted that the bill was not referred to the CII to seek Council’s opinion and review.
Similarly, the CII meeting on Tuesday also termed that draft of a similar bill titled Child Marriage Restraining Bill, which was referred to the Council by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Government, clashes with the Islamic injunctions.
The CII also decided that Thalassemia screening before marriage should not be declared as compulsory rather it should be an option for both sides. “In light of Islamic teachings, no complications
should be involved in the process of Nikah,” the CII meeting observed stressing that an awareness campaign could be more effective instead.
The CII meeting also held discussions with regard to irresponsible reporting in media on courts’ decisions and expressed concern in this connection. In this regard, the CII members referred to irresponsible reporting on Lahore High Court’s decision on Khula.
On the issue of dowry, the CII meeting also declared that demanding dowry or forcing family of bride for the purpose was against Islamic teachings and injunctions. The CII called upon parents to take decision with regard to rituals, marriages, etc, in the light of Islamic teachings.
On a query from the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the CII declared that it should be discretion of a woman whether she wants to apply for domicile of his husband’s native district after marriage or keep the domicile which she got before marriage.
The meeting also constituted a committee to make the Auqaf department as more effective and dynamic. The committee would submit its recommendations after going through department’s performance and its administrative structure.
The CII meeting also formed another committee to prepare a comprehensive draft of Muslim Family Laws. The meeting also proposed amendment to clause 7 of the Muslim Family (Amendment) Bill, 2025. The meeting also declared that a divorced woman on completion of ‘Iddat Period” cannot claim ‘Nan Nufqa’. The CII also negated the concept of Matrimonial.

Serious irregularities found in KP’s Rs33bn free solar project,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316034-serious-irregularities-found-in-kp-s-rs33bn-free-solar-project,"PESHAWAR: Serious irregularities have been revealed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s Rs33 billion upcoming free solar project. Despite changing the solar specification, price per unit was kept at around Rs204,000. This has raised serious questions about transparency and fairness of the project. Experts claimed the new price should have been around Rs140,000 per unit.
Moreover, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Procurement Regulatory Authority has declared the tendering process as mis-procurement.
Interestingly, the project was divided into 20 packages, in which 13 companies participated. However, 18 packages received single bids and there was no competition. What’s more interesting is that another company, which submitted the lowest bid, offered rates that were 7pc lower for two packages in the Hazara Division.
The major specification changes included addition of all-in-one solution, which was later included in the PC-1 with a specific code. Sources claimed all-in-one solution was manufactured by only one company, customized, and that only one supplier was available in Pakistan. All the bidders, except one, have offered the same brand and model all–in–one solution.
Concerns arose when major changes were made to the solar package and an “all-in-one” unit was included, which contained a specific code. Surprisingly, this all-in-one unit is manufactured by only one company abroad and has only a single supplier available in Pakistan.
According to sources, a meeting of Standardisation Committee has been convened tomorrow to formally legalise inclusion of all-in-one unit, in what appears to be a fresh attempt to give legal cover to the matter.
Sources told this correspondent Chief Engineer (Renewable) Khurram Shehzad Durrani was part of the technical committee but was removed after he opposed “all-in-one” solar solution and raised valid concerns about the tender bids. Even though his concerns were later proven right when the bids were opened, he was sidelined — possibly because his objections were seen as a hurdle in getting the solution approved.
Meanwhile, the letter of KPPPRA No KP-PPRA/M&E/Advice/18-79/2024-25/169 issued on May 20, 2025, stated in the solar project case, no formal approval of PC-1 from PDWP has been obtained, nor has any anticipatory approval been granted. However, the procuring entity proceeded with the procurement process by opening the financial bids, which is not covered under KPPRA Act, 2012, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Procurement Rules, 2014, framed thereunder. Any deviation from any provision of this Act would lead the procuring entity towards mis-procurement, as enunciated under Section 2(1)(n) of KPPRA Act, 2012 and Rule 54 of KPPRA Rules, 2014. Similarly, the Provincial Development Working Party has already deferred the solar project in its meeting held on April 21, 2025, with the following observations:
The estimated per unit cost in the proposed PC-1 seems to be on the higher side as compared to prevailing market rates, and the department may re-evaluate estimated cost in the proposed PC-1. The eligibility criteria for the bidders framed in the proposed PQLD resulted in only 11 contractors qualifying for participation in the bidding process before approval of PC-1 by PDWP.
The solar specifications notified by C&W Department have not been given any weightage. The technical specifications must not be tailored to favour any particular vendor, manufacturer or party. The department may justify how the procurement process can be initiated before approval of PC-1, which includes detailed cost estimates and specifications. The limited participation in the bidding process raised serious concerns about fairness and transparency.
However, PEDO stated it has initiated the process strictly in accordance with Clause 22(3B), as it is explicitly mentioned a procuring entity (in this case, PEDO) may proceed with the procurement proceedings, except for the award of contract, within its competence. There has been no irregularity or wrongdoing in this process; everything has been done in accordance with the law. No contract has been awarded so far. Important decisions will be made in today’s meeting.
The spokesperson said the procurement process was conducted in light of Chief Minister’s directives to provide facilities to general public due to intense weather conditions. Under the bidding documents issued to the contractors, any cancellation of the process must be intimated two days before the bid opening, whereas the decision of PDWP was issued one day before submission. Furthermore, provincial government, during the progress review meeting on April 16, gave a clear timeline for approval of PC-1 supply within three months. The all-in-one solution was approved by technical committee of the project and further approved by CEO of PEDO. It is pertinent to mention the CM conducted the groundbreaking of the project on August 14, 2024, wherein the all-in-one solution, manufactured by GET Technology Lahore, was purchased and utilised for the purpose. He said all-in-one solution was included from the beginning, as it was mentioned in the NIT for pre-qualification of the contractors. Moreover, the PC-1 estimates are framed under MRS-2024, wherein there is no all-in-one solution in the MRS. However, under Section 27 of KPPRA Act, 2012, “Best Practices & Industry Standards”, the procuring entity is allowed at all times to use industry standards defined and codified by internationally recognised trade associations and professional bodies. A market assessment was also conducted in this regard.
The charge of Chief Engineer (Renewable/Private Power) was previously assigned to Director (Renewable & Private Power) Khurram Shehzad Durrani, on an OPS basis. He was transferred to World Bank PMO on a need basis in the same position and with other assignments. Furthermore, the officer was a member of the technical committee, and he never opposed all-in-one solution as advertised during pre-qualification, nor did he object to it at later stages.
Furthermore, the bidders were given the liberty to quote either all-in-one solution or a modular one under Section 27 of KPPRA Act, 2012.

Pakistani automakers follow just 18 of 200 global safety standards,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316035-pakistani-automakers-follow-just-18-of-200-global-safety-standards,"ISLAMABAD: Officials in a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Industry and Production revealed that vehicle manufacturing companies in Pakistan are following only 18 out of 200 international safety standards and 182 international standards are being completely ignored in the production of vehicles, while vehicle prices are higher than global standards.
The committee members expressed serious concerns over the production of unsafe vehicles and demanded immediate and strict action against companies that ignore global safety standards. Chairman of the committee, Syed Hafeezuddin, said that major traffic accidents are taking place in Pakistan and it is the responsibility of vehicle manufacturing companies to implement safety standards in vehicles. “Due to the decline in safety standards and quality in vehicles, we are not even able to export vehicles, while in our neighborhood, India and China have become major exporters of vehicles,” he added.
The Secretary of Industries and Production informed the committee that the facility of two airbags in cars continues to be provided. The chairman of the committee said that the three foreign companies are not complying with rules. Committee member Muhammad Ali Sarfaraz said that instead of giving more time to the companies that have installed plants in Pakistan for thirty to forty years and are still not following safety standards, action should be taken against them.

"Bleak legal, political prospects: Imran ready to meet US-based doctors",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316036-bleak-legal-political-prospects-imran-ready-to-meet-us-based-doctors,"ISLAMABAD: As Imran Khan’s legal and political fortunes remain uncertain, a group of US-based Pakistani doctors and businessmen is seeking a meeting with him at Adiala jail anytime this week, informed sources have revealed.
According to sources, Imran Khan is aware of the delegation’s presence in the country and, the group believes, is ready to meet them.
The specifics of the expected meeting remain unclear, but the visit is part of renewed efforts to re-engage through quiet diplomacy for a possible relief for Khan. PTI’s Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur, has reportedly been in contact with the group even before their arrival in Pakistan.
The delegation, which landed in the country last week, has yet to meet with any key officials in Islamabad. This visit marks a continuation of previous behind-the-scenes engagement by the same group, who earlier met with senior government figures and Imran Khan during a trip to Islamabad a few months ago.
Their return has raised speculation about potential efforts to explore a way forward for the embattled PTI leader, whose prospects for political and legal relief remain uncertain.
Progress has remained elusive as yet because of non-consistency in the PTI’s policy. It is believed that beyond private meetings, any breakthrough would require a significant shift in PTI’s public messaging, especially the aggressive tone adopted by its leader, social media teams and international chapters in the US and UK against the army and its top command.
Persistent criticism of the military establishment, online campaigns and lobbying efforts abroad have reportedly worsened tensions. The military has reiterated that it will not engage directly with political parties, calling instead for political forces to resolve matters among themselves.
Interestingly, within the PTI’s own ranks, some second-tier leaders now concede that the party’s confrontational stance has hampered chances for constructive engagement, there is no stop even at the level of jailed party leader.
Within the party there are calls for a more measured approach to secure some form of reprieve for Khan but the PTI has been told to prepare for a new phase of political agitation, which has been repeated again and again but did not work.

"Reserved seats case: Ruling applied to election symbol, not PTI’s existence, says SC",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316037-reserved-seats-case-ruling-applied-to-election-symbol-not-pti-s-existence-sc,"ISLAMABAD: The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) Tuesday questioned the maintainability of review petitions filed against the apex court judgment declaring that the PTI was entitled to the reserved seats of women and minorities in the national and provincial assemblies.
An 11-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court — headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan — heard live broadcast of the review petitions of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) against July 12, 2024 judgment in the reserved seats case.
Commencing his arguments, SIC counsel Faisal Siddiqui termed the review petitions non-maintainable, saying identifying flaws in the main decision was essential for a review petition.
Justice Mandokhail asked the counsel whether he supported or opposed the review and pointed out that 13 judges had said that the SIC was not entitled to the seats. Siddiqui told Justice Mandokhail that he partially supported his decision adding, “Sometimes, you win even when you lose.”
Siddiqui contended that since most of the judges on the current bench had not heard the main case, as six new judges had joined, he would present his arguments in detail, including the background of how the issue arose. The SIC counsel emphasized that 11 out of 13 judges had declared that the seats belonged to the PTI.
Justice Mazhar noted that the review petition was filed only against the majority decision. Siddiqi pointed out that interestingly, the review relied on Justice Mandokhail’s opinion. He listed seven main arguments, starting with the objection that if the PTI was not a party, how relief was granted.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether denial of election symbol was the decision of the Election Commission or Supreme Court, to which Siddiqui replied that it was the Election Commission’s decision. Siddiqui read aloud paragraphs from the majority decision. Justice Amin-ud-Din noted that no one objected to the facts.
Siddiqui explained that the Election Commission had rejected the PTI’s intra-party elections and therefore took away their election symbol, which started the dispute. Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan observed that those facts were not before the court.
He submitted that the Supreme Court upheld the Election Commission’s decision, which refused to recognize PTI as a political party and accept its candidates as PTI’s. As a result, Siddiqui added that the PTI candidates received different election symbols.
Justice Mussarat Hilali asked the SIC counsel if the decision had been challenged to which he replied that it was challenged by Salman Akram Raja, which was mentioned in the main decision.
Justice Mussarat noted that the Supreme Court only ruled on the election symbol and not the party’s existence. Faisal Siddiqui pointed out that 10 judges said the Election Commission had misinterpreted the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether the PTI had challenged misinterpretation. Siddiqi responded that Salman Akram Raja had challenged the returning officer’s decision, who had not accepted him as a PTI candidate.
Justice Amin-ud-Din observed that the PTI itself accepted that it was no longer a political party.
At this, Faisal Siddiqui mentioned that the SIC had filed the petition to obtain reserved seats, while PMLN, PPP, MQM, and JUI-F also filed petitions, requesting that the SIC should be denied the seats even though they had already received seats according to the proportional representation.
There are 78 disputed reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies and if these are allocated to other parties, the government will gain a two-thirds majority, making it a controversial supermajority.
Questioning the maintainability of the review petitions, Siddiqui referred to Article 63A and other review-related rulings, asserting that review could only happen where there was a mistake or flaw in the decision. He contended that the current review petitions were not maintainable.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, however, reiterated that under the rules, anyone feeling affected by a decision could seek review adding that Article 188 of the Constitution simply stated that the Supreme Court could review its own decisions.
Later, the court adjourned further proceedings until May 29, when Siddiqi will continue his arguments.

NA panel assails ‘disrespectful’ behaviour of KE CEO,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316038-na-panel-assails-disrespectful-behaviour-of-ke-ceo,"ISLAMABAD: A heated exchange in parliament on Tuesday ended with lawmakers expelling Moonis Alvi, Chief Executive Officer of K-Electric, from a National Assembly committee meeting for what they called “disrespectful and defiant behavior” toward elected representatives and decided to move a privilege motion against him.
The uproar occurred during a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Industries and Production, which had summoned Alvi to brief members on the progress of Covid-era industrial subsidies provided to Karachi’s industries. However, tensions flared before the agenda even began.
Alvi objected to the committee’s decision to allow online participation for representatives of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and other industrial bodies a facility not extended to him. “Why wasn’t I given this Zoom option?” he asked at the outset, triggering irritation among the members.
The situation escalated when committee members questioned why K-Electric had not withdrawn court cases related to the Covid subsidy. Alvi bluntly responded, “I cannot withdraw the cases,” further angering lawmakers who accused him of defying parliamentary authority. “This attitude toward parliamentarians is unacceptable,” said one MNA. “If this is how the CEO treats elected representatives, it is very clear how he must be treating the ordinary citizens?” MNA Syed Raza Ali Gillani refused to sit in the meeting as long as the K-Electric CEO remained present. Attempts by Alvi to apologise were flatly rejected by the committee and he was asked to leave the room.
The NA panel even refused to accept the chairman’s formal notice of displeasure and insisted on initiating a privilege motion against the KE CEO in the National Assembly. The committee, chaired by Syed Hafeezuddin, declared Alvi’s behavior unprofessional and disrespectful and moved to initiate a privilege motion.
In response to a query on the incident in committee’s proceedings, Spokesperson K-Electric stated, “K-Electric, as a private entity, holds complete respect for the parliament and its esteemed members. What transpired today was unfortunate. Such moments are a cause for pause and reflection for everyone working towards a better Pakistan.”
The NA committee also unanimously decided to table a report in the upcoming NA session opposing the closure of Utility Stores Corporation (USC) to save the jobs of hundreds of employees affected by the decision. It also issued a notice to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for failing to implement its recommendation to include the iron and steel sector in the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS), warning that continued delays are costing the country an estimated $1.5 billion in lost exports. The chairman expressed frustration over FBR’s inaction despite its clear directive to issue a statutory regulatory order (SRO) within two days. Lawmakers noted that FBR’s delay was negatively impacting the broader export sector.
“The FBR is not following our instructions, which is why we are compelled to issue this notice,” said the committee chairman. “Previously, a female officer represented the FBR, then Mr. Faisal kept attending. Today, another official is here, we will tolerate him too,” he added with visible exasperation.
Among the attendees were MNAs Shahid Usman, Kiran Imran Dar, Romina Khurshid Alam, Dr. Mahesh Kumar Malani, Abdul Hakeem Baloch, Dr. Mahreen Razzaq Bhutto, Naz Baloch, Muhammad Mobeen Arif, Muhammad Saad Ullah, Rana Atif, Muhammad Ali Sarfraz, Muhammad Arshad Sahi, and Syed Raza Ali Gillani, along with the Secretary of Industries, representatives from the FBR, MD USC and CEO of K-Electric.

K-Electric gets Nepra’s nod for 320MW renewable projects,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316039-k-electric-gets-nepra-s-nod-for-320mw-renewable-projects,"ISLAMABAD: K-Electric Ltd. won a key regulatory nod to fast-track 370 MW of renewable energy capacity, after the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) approved its bid evaluation reports for three major clean power projects—two solar PV farms in Balochistan and a hybrid project at Dhabeji—clearing the way for formal tariff filings under the country’s national energy framework.
The greenlit portfolio includes a 100 MW solar plant in Bela and a 50 MW installation in Winder, both awarded to Master Textile Mills Ltd.
Nepra also approved KE’s proposed 220 MW hybrid project at Dhabeji, which offers a flexible mix of solar, potential wind or storage solutions, and includes a 20pc capacity margin to enhance grid stability. The project fits squarely within the Indicative Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP) and Power Acquisition Plan (PAP), Pakistan’s primary planning tools for energy infrastructure.  To protect consumers, the Nepra ruled that any project delays—whether by KE or the developers—must not result in additional charges to end-users. This safeguard is to be hardcoded into project agreements.
Beyond renewables, the regulator reviewed KE’s transition roadmap to the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM)—a sweeping reform to liberalize Pakistan’s electricity sector. While hurdles remain, including legacy power purchase agreements and the need for a revamped capacity invoicing mechanism, NEPRA directed KE to align its operations with the central dispatch model and file a revised tariff petition reflecting these reforms.
Meanwhile, Nepra on Tuesday raised the average base tariff for K-Electric by Rs6.15 per unit — an 18.18% increase, setting it at Rs39.97/unit for fiscal year 2023-24 under a newly approved Multi-Year Tariff regime stretching to FY2030. The hike backs a Rs400 billion investment plan while cushioning against under-recovery risks to maintain power supply across Karachi.
Notably, the authority had earlier approved generation, transmission and distribution tariffs for the FY2024 to FY2030 control period.
According to Nepra’s determination issued on Tuesday, the new tariff structure includes Rs31.96/unit for power purchase excluding transmission charges, Rs2.86/unit for transmission cost, Rs3.31 for distribution cost, Rs2.28 for supply margin, and a negative Rs0.44 per unit adjustment on account of prior year adjustments. The decision said that the adjustments are vital for sustaining KEs Rs400 billion ($1.42 billion) investment plan over the next seven years duly approved by NEPRA. It also mentioned that ICE has successfully halved its line losses post-privatization and continues to address issues like illegal connections (kundas) that stem from unplanned urban sprawl. KE says its $700 million investment and reinvested profits have driven $4 billion in post-privatization upgrades, aligning returns with dollar-based benchmarks used by IPPs and IHVDC.

Interior ministry asked to implement ECBC in capital,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316042-interior-ministry-asked-to-implement-ecbc-in-capital,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Energy Minister Awais Leghari has approached Minister of Interior, seeking cooperation for enforcement of Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) in Islamabad. In a letter written on May 21 this month to Interior Minister, the energy minister said building sector remains one of largest consumers of energy in Pakistan, accounting for over 60 percent of total demand.
“A significant portion of this consumption stems from inefficient construction practices. Absence of mandatory energy efficiency standards are leading to heightened stress on national grid, particularly during peak summer months”, he said.
The Power Division argued active engagement by Ministry of Interior will serve as a model for other provincial and local governments and significantly contribute to national goals of energy conservation and climate resilience, it said.
Awais Leghari, earlier sent letters to all the chief ministers, Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and federal ministers for planning and science and technology. He urged them to implement ECBC in relevant building laws.

"Zilhaj moon not sighted, Eid to fall on June 7",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316044-zilhaj-moon-not-sighted-eid-to-fall-on-june-7,"ISLAMABAD: The Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee announced on Tuesday that the moon of Zilhaj 1446 AH was not sighted across Pakistan, and as such the first day of Zilhaj will fall on Thursday, May 29, while Eid-ul-Azha will be celebrated across the country on Saturday, June 7.
The announcement was made by Chairman Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee, Maulana Syed Abdul Khabeer Azad, following a meeting of the committee.
An official statement said the meetings of zonal and district Ruet-e-Hilal committees were held in their respective regions, including provincial capitals. No credible moon sighting reports were received from any part of the country.
Maulana Azad said most areas across the country were overcast and no testimony regarding the sighting of the Zilhaj moon was received and therefore with consensus, it was decided that Eid-ul-Azha will be observed on June 7.
On the occasion, Maulana Azad praised the unity of the Pakistani nation in standing shoulder to shoulder with the country’s armed forces and the government during a critical phase of national defence. “We are grateful to Allah Almighty for granting us a decisive victory in this just battle,” he said. “Pakistan has made it clear that not only is its defence unbreakable, but the nation itself is growing stronger with each challenge,” he remarked.
Maulana Azad also strongly condemned terrorism and extremism, stating that such actions had no place in Islam. “Islam does not preach fear and violence.” He supported the ongoing operations against terrorism and extremism being carried out by the country’s security forces. He also expressed solidarity with Palestinians.
Meanwhile, Zilhaj crescent was sighted in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Arafat Day will fall on June 5 and Eid-ul-Azha on June 6. Moon sighting committees observed the crescent of Zilhaj across the Arab world and other countries.
Oman also announced that May 28 will mark the first day of Zilhaj and Eid-ul-Azha will be observed on June 6. Besides Pakistan, Zilhaj moon was not sighted in Sultanate of Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia and May 29 will be the first day of Zilhaj there.

The silent storm: Unmasking the crisis of pregnancy loss in Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316009-the-silent-storm-unmasking-the-crisis-of-pregnancy-loss-in-pakistan,"In a society where a woman's worth is often measured by her ability to become a mother, miscarriage is far more than a physical loss-it is an emotional upheaval that fractures multiple dimensions of a woman's life. In Pakistan, this trauma is intensified by cultural stigma, societal expectations, and systemic shortcomings in healthcare, creating a reality where many women are forced to grieve in suffocating silence.
Over the years, in my clinical practice, I have witnessed the invisible wounds miscarriage leaves behind-the breakdown of mental well-being, the quiet torment of guilt, and the deep, unspoken despair. These are not fleeting emotions. They are enduring psychological burdens, often left unacknowledged, untreated, and hidden behind forced smiles and societal roles.
These deeply personal traumas reflect broader trends observed across global and regional research. Studies from both high- and middle-income countries report that approximately 55% of women experience symptoms of depression following miscarriage. Around 27% suffer from perinatal grief-a prolonged mourning process often misunderstood in many societies-and up to 18% report moderate to severe anxiety, frequently accompanied by insomnia and panic attacks. Among women facing recurrent miscarriages, the psychological impact is even more severe, with some studies indicating that over 70% are at risk of anxiety, and more than half may develop clinical depression.
But numbers alone cannot capture the full weight of this suffering. Miscarriage often becomes internalized as a personal failure. Many women are plagued by thoughts such as, ""There's something wrong with me,"" or ""I've failed as a woman."" These beliefs do not arise in isolation-they are shaped and reinforced by both subtle and overt messages from family members, community elders, and even healthcare providers.
This internalised grief extends its reach-into marriages, self-perception, and future parenthood. I have seen relationships unravel, not from a lack of love, but from a shared sorrow that remains unnamed and unspoken. Couples often grieve side by side, yet remain emotionally worlds apart. Some women are urged to ""move on"" within days, as if their pain were an inconvenience. Others are quietly cast aside-as though their loss has diminished their worth.
Outside the home, the scrutiny often intensifies. Extended families and communities frequently, though unintentionally, become amplifiers of grief. The damaging narrative of ""It was your fault"" attributes miscarriage to a woman's perceived negligence-whether due to diet, activity, spiritual shortcomings, or even the evil eye. I have sat with women whose grief was dismissed as superstition, their pain silenced by religious platitudes, or worse, met with indifference. In many households, miscarriage is not acknowledged as loss-it is treated as shame, something to be hidden. A 2022 study found that 65% of women who miscarried were advised to stay silent for fear of social judgment. The message is clear: conceal your sorrow, or risk being cast out.
This culture of silence is mirrored within our institutions. The very systems meant to offer care often deepen the wound. Pakistan continues to grapple with one of the highest infant mortality rates globally-51.5 deaths per 1,000 live births-making pregnancy loss tragically common. Yet even in this context, miscarriage is often met with clinical detachment rather than compassion. Women routinely recall being brushed aside by healthcare providers, offered hollow reassurances like ""It's God's will"" or ""These things happen."" While perhaps meant to console, such responses strip women of their right to grieve. They reinforce the notion that this pain is a solitary burden to be carried in silence. Mental health support-still largely absent from maternal care-remains an unmet, urgent need.
If you've read this far, then you, too, have walked a little way into this silence with me. What we are facing is not just a personal tragedy-it is a systemic failure cloaked in cultural quiet. And yet, I believe change is possible. I have seen it-in the brave words of a mother who breaks her silence, in the compassion of a young doctor who chooses to sit beside, not above.
To truly address this crisis, we must act on three critical fronts:
* First, we must humanise clinical encounters. Healthcare professionals need training not only in medical care but in trauma-informed communication. Rather than offering platitudes, providers should validate emotional suffering and allow space for grief. A simple phrase like ""Your grief is real, and it matters"" can shift the trajectory of healing. Let empathy replace efficiency in the consultation room.
* Second, we must reshape public narratives. Miscarriage must be acknowledged publicly as a medical event-not a moral failure, not divine punishment. Through media, mosque sermons, and community dialogues, we must dismantle harmful myths and replace them with compassion and truth. Storytelling is a powerful tool-television dramas, talk shows, and editorials can give voice to the silenced, challenge stigma, and foster understanding.
* Finally, we must institutionalize mental health support. Psychological care must be integrated into maternal health services. Every woman who experiences miscarriage should have access to trained counselors-within hospitals, through tele-health platforms, and in community settings. The frameworks exist; what we now need is collective will and political commitment.
This is about more than healthcare-it's about dignity, identity, and the kind of community we aspire to be. When a society learns to hold space for grief-through doctors who listen, families who stand beside rather than in judgment, and systems that meet sorrow with support-we don't just change how miscarriage is treated. We transform how loss is understood. And that changes everything.

"India, Pakistan to invest large sums in drones",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316014-india-pakistan-to-invest-large-sums-in-drones,"NEW DELHI/ISLAMABAD: The Indian and Pakistani militaries have deployed high-end fighter jets, conventional missiles and artillery during decades of clashes, but the four days of fighting in May marked the first time New Delhi and Islamabad utilised unmanned aerial vehicles at scale against each other.
The fighting halted after the US announced it brokered a ceasefire but the South Asian powers, which spent more than $96 billion on defence last year, are now locked in a drones arms race, according to Reuters’ interviews with 15 people, including security officials, industry executives and analysts in the two countries.
Two of them said they expect increased use of UAVs by the nuclear-armed neighbours because small-scale drone attacks can strike targets without risking personnel or provoking uncontrollable escalation. India plans to invest heavily in local industry and could spend as much as $470 million on UAVs over the next 12 to 24 months, roughly three times pre-conflict levels, said Smit Shah of Drone Federation India, which represents over 550 companies and regularly interacts with the government. The previously unreported forecast, which came as India this month approved roughly $4.6 billion in emergency military procurement funds, was corroborated by two other industry executives. The Indian military plans to use some of that additional funding on combat and surveillance drones, according to two Indian officials familiar with the matter.
Defence procurement in India tends to involve years of bureaucratic processes but officials are now calling drone makers in for trials and demonstrations at an unprecedented pace, said Vishal Saxena, a vice president at Indian UAV firm ideaForge Technology IDEF.NS. The Pakistan Air Force, meanwhile, is pushing to acquire more UAVs as it seeks to avoid risking its high-end aircraft, said a Pakistani source familiar with the matter.
Pakistan is likely to build on existing relationships to intensify collaboration with China and Turkey to advance domestic drone research and production capabilities, said Oishee Majumdar of defence intelligence firm Janes. Islamabad is relying on a collaboration between Pakistan’s National Aerospace Science and Technology Park and Turkish defence contractor Baykar that locally assembles the YIHA-III drone, the Pakistani source said, adding a unit could be produced domestically in between two to three days. Pakistan’s military declined to respond to Reuters’ questions. The Indian defence ministry and Baykar did not return requests for comment. India and Pakistan “appear to view drone strikes as a way to apply military pressure without immediately provoking large-scale escalation,” said King’s College London political scientist Walter Ladwig III. “UAVs allow leaders to demonstrate resolve, achieve visible effects, and manage domestic expectations — all without exposing expensive aircraft or pilots to danger,” he added.
Pakistan depended on Turkish-origin YIHA-III and Asisguard Songar drones, as well as the Shahpar-II UAV produced domestically by the state-owned Global Industrial & Defence Solutions conglomerate, according to two Pakistani sources. India also sent Israeli HAROP, Polish WARMATE and domestically-produced UAVs into Pakistani airspace, according to one Indian and two Pakistan sources. Some of them were also used for precision attacks on what two Indian officials described as military and militant infrastructure.
The two Pakistani security sources confirmed that India deployed a large number of the HAROPs — a long-range loitering munition drone manufactured by Israel Aerospace Industries. Such UAVs, also known as suicide drones, stay over a target before crashing down and detonating on impact. Pakistan set up decoy radars in some areas to draw in the HAROPs, or waited for their flight time to come towards its end, so that they fell below 3,000 feet and could be shot down, a third Pakistani source said.  Despite the loss of many drones, both sides are doubling down. “We’re talking about relatively cheap technology,” said Washington-based South Asia expert Michael Kugelman. “And while UAVs don’t have the shock and awe effect of missiles and fighter jets, they can still convey a sense of power and purpose for those that launch them.” Indian defence planners are likely to expand domestic development of loitering munitions UAVs, according to an Indian security source and Sameer Joshi of Indian UAV maker NewSpace, which is deepening its research and development on such drones. “Their ability to loiter, evade detection, and strike with precision marked a shift toward high-value, low-cost warfare with mass produced drones,” said Joshi, whose firm supplies the Indian military. And firms like ideaForge, which has supplied over 2,000 UAVs to the Indian security forces, are also investing on enhancing the ability of its drones to be less vulnerable to electronic warfare, said Saxena. Another vulnerability that is harder to address is the Indian drone program’s reliance on hard-to-replace components from China, an established military partner of Pakistan, four Indian dronemakers and officials said. India continues to depend on China-made magnets and lithium for UAV batteries, said Drone Federation India’s Shah. “Weaponization of the supply chain is also an issue,” said ideaForge’s Saxena on the possibility of Beijing shutting the tap on components in certain situations. For instance, Chinese restrictions on the sale of drones and components to Ukraine have weakened Kyiv’s ability to produce critical combat drones, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think-tank. A spokesperson for China’s Foreign Ministry said in response to Reuters’ questions that Beijing has always implemented export controls on dual-use items in accordance with domestic laws and regulations as well as its international obligations. “Diversification of supply chain is a medium to long term problem,” said Shah. “You can’t solve it in short term.”

ECP proposes amendment to Article 140A to ensure timely LG polls,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316015-ecp-proposes-amendment-to-article-140a-to-ensure-timely-lg-polls,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan on Tuesday proposed amendment to Article 140A to ensure holding of the local government elections on time.
Under this article, provincial governments have the authority to amend local government laws as they wish, which leads to delay in holding local government elections.
The proposal was aired by the Election Commission Secretary, Omar Hamid Khan, during his meeting with the delegation of Jamaat-e-Islami, which was visited the ECP Secretariat here, led by Liaquat Baloch. The visitors were briefed on their request regarding the Electronic Voting Machine (EVM), Biometric Verification Machine (BVM), Proportional Representation System in elections and delay in local government elections in Punjab province and the Federal Capital Territory of Islamabad.
According to the ECP spokesman, the secretary Election Commission told the delegation that an amendment to Article 140A is inevitable if political parties want to hold local government elections on time.
The delegation was also briefed on the legal aspects related to the use of (EVM) and (BVM) and was informed about the steps taken by the Election Commission. They were also told that the Election Commission is not against the use of technology in elections. However, it was emphasized that consensus and oversight of all stakeholders is necessary before using technology. Moreover, high-level testing is required before using technology on a full scale; similarly, the technology should be such that it is user-friendly and trusted by all political parties.
While briefing the delegation on proportional representation, it was informed that the responsibility of the Election Commission is to conduct elections in accordance with the constitution and law. Changing the electoral system is the prerogative of the parliament, so if the electoral system is changed in the constitution or law, the Election Commission will conduct elections accordingly.
In addition, on the date of local government elections in Punjab and Islamabad, the delegation was informed that no government is ready to conduct local government elections. After much effort, the delegation was told that the Election Commission has succeeded in conducting elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan (except Quetta) and cantonments. So far, the case of Quetta district is pending in the Balochistan High Court and the Election Commission has been bound under Section 219 of the Elections Act 2017 to conduct elections under the prevailing local government laws. Therefore, if any government changes the local government law, the Election Commission is bound to implement it. The delay of holding local government elections in Islamabad and Punjab is due to the fact that previous governments have amended the local government laws several times.
The delegation was told that whenever the Election Commission completes the delimitation, and when it is ready for the elections, the local government laws are changed. Moreover, the Election Commission has so far conducted delimitation in Punjab four times. Similarly, the Election Commission has conducted delimitation five times for the local government elections in Islamabad so far. The election schedule was also given, but due to amendments in the election laws, the elections could not be held.
The election programme for the Punjab elections was announced in April 2022. At which the Multan Bench of the Lahore High Court stayed the case and the case is still under hearing. It was pointed out that the provincial government is now preparing new legislation. And due to the delay in the elections, this case is scheduled for hearing in the Election Commission on May 29, 2025. The delegation was told that the the Supreme Court is also hearing this case on June 2 and the Election Commission is of the view that the legislative process is not completed until the election programme is announced. So the Election Commission will ensure the immediate holding of elections in Islamabad.
Ministry briefed committee on upcoming, ongoing, and pending projects and hurdles it was currently facing.

Regulation of infant formula milk removed from DRAP’s control,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316016-regulation-of-infant-formula-milk-removed-from-drap-s-control,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government has decided to strip Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) of authority over regulation of baby milk and general infant food, transferring the responsibility to provincial food departments.
This was informed by the DRAP officials to a senate committee on Tuesday. The decision was finalised after months of deliberations at the forums of Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and Board of Investment (BOI).
DRAP officials said they were set to implement the decision through amendments in the relevant laws, which have already been vetted by Law and Justice Division. The amendments were being submitted to Cabinet Committee for Legislative Cases (CCLC) for final approval, they said.
During a meeting of Senate Standing Committee on National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, DRAP officials briefed the members. They said under the DRAP Act, 2012 and Alternative Medicines and Health Products (Enlistment) Rules, 2014, baby milk and food were previously categorised as Health and OTC Products (non-drugs).
However, due to a dual regulatory frame work — where both DRAP and provincial food departments had overlapping jurisdiction — confusion and inefficiencies emerged in enforcement and oversight.
To resolve the matter, stakeholders concluded all baby milk and infant food products meant for general consumption would now be regulated by provincial food authorities. The DRAP would retain jurisdiction over baby milk and food products specifically formulated for medical needs.
The Senate Committee, following a detailed briefing, agreed to revisit the issue in a forthcoming in-camera session to discuss its broader implications on public health and consumer protection.
The meeting, chaired by Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, also addressed multiple critical issues plaguing Islamabad’s healthcare infrastructure. Health Minister Mustafa Kamal revealed plans for an imminent public-private partnership model to reduce pressure on public hospitals, which are reportedly serving up to ten times their intended capacity.
He maintained work on this model would begin within next 15 to 20 days, with involvement from nonprofit private healthcare institutions.
Mustafa Kamal confirmed preparations for laying the foundation of Jinnah Medical Complex in Islamabad — envisioned as one of largest research and teaching hospitals in the region.
Lawmakers raised serious concerns about condition of Federal Government Polyclinic Hospital, with Senators Masroor Ahmed and Hidayatullah describing it as “broken” and unfit to serve patients. Hidayatullah recounted how, despite being a senator, he had to queue up with patients and personally witnessed a lack of medicines and doctor availability.
Minister Kamal acknowledged immense burden faced by Islamabad’s two main hospitals and 30 Basic Health Units (BHUs), which serve not only city’s nearly 2.7 million residents, but also patients from Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Originally designed for 3,000 patients, these facilities are now seeing up to 30,000 visits daily. The minister said in addition to public-private partnership, new branches of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) were being constructed across Islamabad. He said previously underutilised Covid-era hospital buildings — such as a 266-bed facility — will be activated soon.
Chairman Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, expressed concern over lack of planning and vision in Islamabad’s health infrastructure. He questioned why, despite the capital’s growing population — exceeding 3 million — only two major public hospitals continue to serve the entire city.
He stressed the need for long-term solutions rather than temporary fixes. He emphasised available infrastructure, including 266-bed hospital built during Covid-19, must be fully utilised to ease the burden.
Senator Chishti recommended establishment of an additional large public hospital in Islamabad. “This city cannot be run on outdated models; we need expansion and reform”, he remarked.
The meeting also delved into deep-rooted issues with Pakistan Nursing Council (PNC), with Minister Kamal branding it a “mafia-like” institution, alleging it was mired in corruption, internal mismanagement and overreach.
He said he lacked legal authority to overhaul the institution, although he holds informal influence.
Members of the committee assured full support for legislative amendments to bring the Council under proper regulatory control. An in-camera briefing on this matter was also proposed.
The committee expressed displeasure over absence of Vice Chancellor of Health Services Academy, who had been formally summoned but failed to attend without providing an explanation and recommended referring the matter to the Privilege Committee.
Ministry briefed committee on upcoming, ongoing, and pending projects and hurdles it was currently facing.

"Settlement of Ukraine crisis requires elimination of root causes, not Western-driven ceasefire: Russian envoy",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316017-settlement-of-ukraine-crisis-requires-elimination-of-root-causes-not-western-driven-ceasefire-russian-envoy,"ISLAMABAD: Russian Ambassador to Pakistan Albert P. Khorev said on Tuesday that Russia has repeatedly emphasised that a lasting settlement to the Ukrainian crisis requires the elimination of root causes of the conflict, not a Western-driven ceasefire.
He maintained that Ukraine does not need a ceasefire to move closer to a peaceful settlement of the conflict but it “desires to regroup and rearm with the help of European military and financial assistance”.
Speaking to the media here, the Russian envoy referred to the statements from the leaders of France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and other European countries about the need to “militarise Europe and Ukraine to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia”.
Referring to Russian efforts to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, the envoy said that several significant steps have been taken in this regard since February this year.
He recounted that President Vladimir Putin and President Donald Trump spoke by telephone on March 18 and agreed that Russia would unilaterally suspend its strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure facilities for 30 days. During the moratorium period, from March 18 to April 17, the Kiev regime violated the agreement about 130 times, he maintained.
He questioned: “How does Ukraine plan to observe a full ceasefire for 30 days when, over the past three months, we have seen the Kiev regime’s complete unwillingness and reluctance to agree to a truce on a smaller scale?”
Albert P. Khorev maintained that lasting settlement to the Ukrainian crisis requires the elimination of root causes of the conflict, not a Western-driven ceasefire.
As early as June 14, 2024, he said, Russian President Vladimir Putin presented a concrete plan to achieve peace in Ukraine. The plan’s key elements are the “withdrawal of Ukrainian armed forces from the new Russian regions (Donetsk People’s Republic, Luhansk People’s Republic, Zaporozhzhye and Kherson Oblasts), the recognition of the new territorial realities, Kiev’s refusal to apply for NATO membership, the lifting of all Western sanctions against Russia, and the guarantee of the full rights of Russian-speaking Ukrainian citizens”.
About President Putin’s recent initiative to resume direct Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul, he said Ukraine, under considerable pressure from the US, ultimately accepted the initiative, albeit not immediately.
During the May 16 meeting, which lasted two hours, the Russian and Ukrainian sides presented their views for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. They also agreed to conduct a large-scale prisoner exchange under the “1000 for 1000” formula. The agreement was fully implemented from May 23 to 25. As a result, 880 captured Russian servicemen and 120 civilians returned home.
The parties also agreed to exchange detailed proposals for the terms of a potential future ceasefire. “We expect the negotiations to continue”. The ambassador appreciated the positive role of the US in facilitating the Russia-Ukraine negotiations in Istanbul on May 16.
Trump’s statement that Kiev’s desire to join NATO was one of the causes of the conflict shows that he understands its root causes. During a telephone conversation on May 19, President Putin personally thanked President Trump for his mediation efforts.
During the two-hour conversation, the Presidents noted that Russia was ready to engage with the Ukrainian side on drafting a memorandum regarding a potential future peace agreement. This would include outlining a range of provisions, such as the principles for settlement, the timeframe for a possible peace deal, and other matters, including a potential temporary ceasefire, should the necessary agreements be reached, the envoy said.
Earlier Ambassador Albert P. Khorev and Belarus ambassador Andrey Metelitsa, talking to the media, said that preparation to celebrate the Day of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) is underway which is observed annually on May 29.
It is an international economic integration organisation comprising five member states: Russia, Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.
Ministry briefed committee on upcoming, ongoing, and pending projects and hurdles it was currently facing.

PTI MNA squabbles with police after vehicle stopped near Adiala jail,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316018-pti-mna-squabbles-with-police-after-vehicle-stopped-near-adiala-jail,"RAWALPINDI: PTI MNA Ali Muhammad Khan and Naeem Haider Panjotha Advocate have had a bitter tiff with the police on Tuesday when they were stopped at the Dahgal checkpoint a few hundred meters from the Adiala Jail.
The PTI leaders were scheduled to meet with the PTI founder Imran Khan.
When the police stopped their vehicle, Ali Muhammad expressed his displeasure and questioned the legal basis for the police action.
“You have taken oath under the Constitution of Pakistan just as I have,” he said, addressing the officers.
“I have taken it as a Member of the National Assembly, and you as a police officer. You have no justification for stopping us. I am an MNA — how can you stop me?”
Khan further accused the police of acting under duress, stating, “Your silence shows that you are under pressure.”
The situation escalated when Khan confronted a plainclothes officer, asking him to show his identity and why he was not in uniform.
The officer identified himself as a District Field Commander (DFC). In response, Khan asked him to show any official orders from the Punjab government prohibiting their passage.
“Show us any order from the Punjab government against us. We are free citizens of Pakistan,” he asserted.
“What are you afraid of from us? Don’t you obey court orders? Time changes — you will be held accountable. Whether or not the meeting is allowed is the discretion of the jail administration. How can the Punjab Police stop anyone on the road? The names of six of our lawyers have been submitted for the meeting, including mine. Going to Adiala Jail is our right, but Punjab Police is stopping us,” he concluded.
Ministry briefed committee on upcoming, ongoing, and pending projects and hurdles it was currently facing.

Traffic cop killed in Karachi gun attack,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316019-traffic-cop-killed-in-karachi-gun-attack,"KARACHI: Armed men gunned down a traffic police constable in the Boat Basin area of the city late on Tuesday night.
Boat Basin police said motorcycle-borne suspects targeted 27-year-old Zain Ali, son of Ali, near the Mai Kolachi Phatak police post and escaped from the scene. The victim died on the spot.

Police Constable Ali was posted at the Sultanabad traffic police post. He was a resident of Kenmare and hailed from Mansehra. He had joined the police force two years ago. Investigation sources said it is early to confirm the motive behind the murder and they would investigate the incident from enmity and target killing aspects. Moreover, they said they were checking for the availability of CCTV footage to determine and identify the suspects. A case has been reported and investigations are underway.

Sharjeel cautions KP CM against using harsh anti-Bhutto language,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316020-sharjeel-cautions-kp-cm-against-using-harsh-anti-bhutto-language,"KARACHI: Sindh Senior Minister for Information Sharjeel Inam Memon has stated that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur should refrain from using harsh language against the people’s leader, Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Reacting to Gandapur’s statement, Memon, who is also Sindh’s minister for information, transport and mass transit, said on Tuesday that it is better not to provoke the sentiments of PPP workers, as the ideology and sacrifice of Shaheed Bhutto remain alive to this day. The PTI’s narrative, he said, is marked by loud rhetoric, falsehood and frequent U-turns.
Memon said the politics of Gandapur and the PTI are rooted in degradation, falsehood and baseless accusations. He added that Gandapur’s remarks about violence against PPP workers reflect political hypocrisy and self-deception.
The senior minister said justifying the shelling of workers under the pretext of Red Zone SOPs was an undemocratic and fascist act. When protesters are peaceful and exercising their fundamental political rights, using tear gas against them is not the implementation of any SOP’ it is evidence of an authoritarian mindset, he further remarked.
He said the PPP’s entry into the Red Zone was also a legitimate form of political expression. The use of force against it proves that the PTI’s so-called commitment to democracy extends only to serving its own interests. Those who had complete freedom to destroy containers in Islamabad yesterday are now acting as the guardians of the Red Zone’s boundaries, he said.
Memon maintained that those who speak against Shaheed Bhutto are themselves bound to a leader who has turned the country’s politics into a personal and divisive affair. Shaheed Bhutto was not condemned by history but by a dictatorship, the same dictatorship that enabled the PTI to come into power, he remarked.
He said the PTI founder faces dozens of charges involving financial, moral, and constitutional violations. If such serious offences, such as disrespecting national institutions, leaking state secrets, and inciting the public, are dismissed as “political revenge”, then the very definition of terrorism would need to be reconsidered, he stressed.
He said courts themselves have delivered their verdicts, and the narrative of innocence from behind bars is merely an attempt to portray political victimhood. PTI members are now accusing the very system that brought them to power, he said, adding that the PTI has no real narrative; its entire politics is a reflection of a failed movement, failed leadership, and failed political ethics.

SHC tells govt to make interim replacement if SBCA DG is not qualified for post,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315936-shc-tells-govt-to-make-interim-replacement-if-sbca-dg-is-not-qualified-for-post,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has directed the provincial government to make an interim arrangement if the present director general of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) is not qualified to meet the criteria for the post.
The direction came on a petition against the appointment of the SBCA director general. The petitioner, Tariq Mansoor, challenged the impugned notification of the appointment of the SBCA DG, a post which he said is purely a technical whereas the respondent is an officer of PSS (BS-20) having prima facie no required technical qualifications and education as per set criteria.
He submitted that the respondent has reportedly neither any required technical education, qualification nor any technical expertise as required therein the SBCA (Recruitment) Regulations, 2016, which is prima facie as well as ex-facie in blatant violation and willful negligence of mandatory provisions to be followed for the appointment to the subject post.
The petitioner said the SBCA is a specialized body, which looks after the entire province, its 32 districts and six divisions, almost entire buildings and their approvals, area town planning, permits, NOCs, demolition, construction of buildings, public sale projects’ approvals, change of land use, zoning regulations, dangerous buildings, heritage buildings conservations, high-rise buildings, which need technical expertise and qualification and registration for having a sound mechanism.
He requested the court to declare that the appointment of the SBCA chief is unlawful and in violation of the SBCA’s regulations. He also requested a review to ensure that all appointments, either to technical or non-technical posts, as well as in the master plan department be made in accordance with the law.
After the preliminary hearing of the petition, an SHC division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Faisal Kamal Alam issued notices to the SBCA and others and called their comments on May 30. The court also issued a notice to the Sindh government to make an interim arrangement if the present DG SBCA is not qualified for the post.

Lanjar orders law enforcers to prepare Eidul Azha contingency plan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315938-lanjar-orders-law-enforcers-to-prepare-eidul-azha-contingency-plan,"Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar has ordered law enforcing departments to prepare a contingency plan for the upcoming Eidul Azha, saying that measures such as strict implementation of the code of conduct should be made part of the contingency plan.
He said in the guidelines issued to the police on Monday that to implement the code of conduct regarding the sacrifice of animals, they should make all security measures impartial and take all stakeholders into confidence.
The Eidul Azha 2025 Contingency Plan should be prepared on a priority basis at the range, zone and district levels and sent for review so that the safety of the life and property of the people can be ensured, Lanjar said. He further said that all registered welfare and social institutions and organizations, religious schools, and other stakeholders should be bound by the contents and conditions of the code of conduct issued by the Sindh government. The process of scrutinizing written permits and other necessary documents regarding the movement and transfer should be made a part of the contingency plan.
The home minister said that under the Eid security plan, steps should be taken at all levels to implement the orders issued from time to time by the Central Command and Control Center established in the Central Police Office so that suspicious activities can be detected through monitoring and possible nefarious intentions can be thwarted in a timely manner, thereby ensuring peace and complete police control over the situation.
In addition, in this regard, measures such as the interconnection of the zonal district control rooms established in the city and the wireless control rooms of the police stations should also be made highly coordinated and effective.
He said the lists of all mosques, Imambargahs, Eidgahs, and other open places of Eid prayers in the province should be reviewed and later divided into categories to ensure the deployment of not only the relevant police but also the police commandos. The prepared plan should also cover the responsibilities of SSPs, SPs, SDPOs and SHOs in detail.
Lanjar said surveillance teams consisting of plainclothes personnel should also be formed at the police station level, whose deployment should be made possible in shopping centers, crowded public places, cattle markets, and designated parking lots and inside and around Eid prayer places.
Meanwhile, the home minister directed that the polio campaign process across Sindh, including Karachi, should be made extremely safe and extraordinary in every respect. Coordination with relevant institutions should be ensured during the polio campaign.
On the occasion of the polio campaign, all security measures should be made very solid by dividing the union councils into categories. The police commandos should be deployed in sensitive union councils to protect the polio drops staff, lady health workers and their teams.
Lanjar said a barrier strategy should be adopted during security measures. The overall measures of administering polio drops to children by going door to door should be made effective and successful. Measures such as police patrolling, snap checking, and blockades should be tightened in all districts. The district SSPs are required to supervise the security measures of the polio campaign.

Five workers faint as fire destroys goods at Landhi garments factory,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315939-five-workers-faint-as-fire-destroys-goods-at-landhi-garments-factory,"At least five workers fell unconscious after a fire broke out in a garments factory near Murtaza Chowrangi in the Landhi neighbourhood on Tuesday morning, destroying inventory worth millions of rupees.
The blaze erupted suddenly in a multi-storey factory located within the jurisdiction of the Awami Colony police station. The flames quickly intensified, prompting an immediate response from the police and rescue teams. The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122 teams were also called in to assist with the firefighting operation.
According to a fire brigade spokesperson, the fire started on the third floor of the factory, which housed a large store and the cutting department. Thick smoke rapidly filled the premises, causing at least five workers to fall unconscious due to inhalation. The victims—Adnan, Younus, Zeeshan, Ghulam Hussain, and Zubair—were shifted to a nearby hospital for medical treatment.
Firefighters used smoke injectors to ventilate the building and remove toxic fumes. After nearly three hours of continuous efforts, the fire was brought under control. However, by that time, a significant quantity of valuable goods and raw materials had already been destroyed. A fire brigade spokesperson stated that the fire apparently broke out due to a short circuit.

"Minor girl’s killing in crossfire sparks protest, public outcry in Korangi",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315940-minor-girl-s-killing-in-crossfire-sparks-protest-public-outcry-in-korangi,"The death of a ten-year-old girl in a crossfire between robbers and a citizen on Tuesday sparked widespread outrage and protests in Korangi.
The victim, Arfa, daughter of Waqar, was shot during a crossfire that erupted when two armed assailants attempted to snatch a motorcycle from a local resident near Kalu Chowk. The citizen resisted the robbery and opened fire, prompting the robbers to retaliate. Amid the exchange of bullets, Arfa was struck and later succumbed to her injuries.
News of the incident quickly spread, drawing a wave of anger from residents. Arfa’s grieving family staged a protest with her body, blocking a major thoroughfare in Korangi. They were soon joined by dozens of residents who decried the deteriorating law and order situation in the area.
Enraged protesters set tires ablaze and raised slogans against the District Korangi police, accusing them of negligence and repeated failure to protect citizens. The demonstration brought traffic to a standstill between Korangi No 4 and No 5, causing major disruption and chaos for commuters.
The protesters demanded immediate justice and refused to end the protest until the Governor of Sindh took notice of the incident. They also expressed frustration over what they described as a pattern of false promises by the authorities in previous similar cases.
Senior police officials eventually reached the protest site and assured the family and residents that those responsible would be apprehended and brought to justice. Following these assurances, the protest was called off peacefully. The body was later shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities before being handed over to the family for burial.
The police have registered a case and launched an investigation into the incident. No arrests had been reported as of the filing of this report.

"PEBS, Heidelberg Schloss Rotary Club join hands to screen 60,000 schoolchildren",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315941-pebs-heidelberg-schloss-rotary-club-join-hands-to-screen-60-000-schoolchildren,"The Pakistan Eye Bank Society (PEBS), in collaboration with the Rotary Club of Heidelberg Schloss, launched a 'School Eye Clinic' project on Tuesday to screen as many as 60,000 schoolchildren.
German Consul General in Karachi Dr Rudiger Lotz inaugurated the project at the PEBS Hospital in North Karachi. Sri Lankan Consul General in Karachi Jagath Abeywarna also attended the inaugural ceremony.
In his welcome address, Qazi Sajid Ali, president of the PEBS, recalled: ""We started in 1968 with the idea of acquiring corneas. Our first donations came from Sri Lanka. In those early days, we received only two to three eyes in a quarter, sometimes just a few in six months or even in a year.""
He said the Sri Lankan Consulate General and the PEBS had organised an event, where a delegation from the Sri Lanka Eye Bank Society brought with them 10 corneas, marking the 25,000th eye received in Pakistan from Sri Lanka. ""Of the 25,000 corneas donated by Sri Lanka, PEBS has been the largest recipient, having received and transplanted 16,000 corneas."" He lauded the role of philanthropists in helping establish and run the hospital, as well as expanding its services to include more specialties for underprivileged strata of society.
Giving an overview of the School Eye Clinic project, Dr Qazi Wasiq, medical director at the PEBS, said the Society and Rotary Club Heidelberg Schloss had joined hands to screen 60,000 students in one year with a programme to train teachers to detect eye defects and other health issues among students.
He said school managements were unable to provide eye and health checkups due to financial constraints. He added that basic health coverage was largely unavailable, especially in rural areas, where 60 percent of the population resides. He said teachers also lacked training to detect health issues among students.
Speaking at the event, the German consul general said: ""There is always that official level of bilateral relations, governmental, cultural, business, and so on. But besides that, there are private people and initiatives that bring people together to help and support one another. That is often far more important and no matter what you do at the official level, without this personal connection, it is hard to truly bring two nations closer.""
He said he had been in Pakistan for three years now and had always been impressed by the charitable work being done here. ""Of course, I believe the government is trying its best in sectors like health and education, but the resources are often limited for reasons we all understand,"" he added.
""Without the positive influence of charitable organisations, the health sector in Pakistan wouldn’t be what it is today. While it may still be far from where it needs to be to serve everyone, charity plays a crucial role.""
Dr Lotz lauded the Heidelberg Schloss Rotary Club for supporting the project and commended the PEBS for its outstanding work. Dr Tilman Krauch, president of the Rotary Club of Heidelberg-Schloss, also addressed the participants through video link.

Rs1.2 billion allocated for improving citrus yield: minister,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315946-rs1-2-billion-allocated-for-improving-citrus-yield-minister,"LAHORE:Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Ashiq Hussain has said the Punjab government is taking steps for the revival and promotion of citrus in the province.
The minister said this while speaking at a meeting held at Agriculture House here on Tuesday. The minister said increasing citrus production is among the priorities of the Punjab government, emphasising Kinnow, in particular, is a hallmark of Punjab. Due to climate change, citrus orchards are deteriorating and being affected by various diseases, leading to a decrease in fruit size and shelf life, especially of Kinnow. He agreed on several practical proposals including the establishment of a Citrus Park, linking the Kissan Card platform with citrus orchards, recruiting 100 agriculture interns in Agriculture Extension and 100 youth for the three-year project of citrus revival, and providing subsidies similar to the wheat support programme. He stressed the need to bring fruit nurseries under legal regulation by licensing and registering them.
He also instructed the Bank of Punjab to introduce a loan scheme for farmers managing citrus nurseries. He highlighted the need to enhance citrus exports and improve its value chain in line with international standards. Under the Chief Minister's Kissan Package, a significant amount of Rs1.2 billion has been allocated for citrus revival, aiming to establish certified nurseries, new orchards, and increase both production and exports, thereby strengthening the national economy.
He said the goal of the citrus revival programme is to use modern agricultural technology to produce certified citrus plants and provide technical guidance to farmers. He directed that a comprehensive strategy be devised to reduce post-harvest losses of citrus and that gardeners be given timely technical guidance on proper pruning. He added that funds are being provided to make the Citrus Research Institute Sargodha more active so that new techniques and improved seed varieties can enhance productivity.
A targeted programme for citrus revival will be launched on a large area in Sargodha. The minister appreciated the performance of the officers and staff of the Agriculture Extension Wing.  Secretary Agriculture Punjab, Iftikhar Ali Sahoo, stated that efforts are being made to ensure the availability of quality and affordable citrus plants. Deputy Convener Citrus Task Force Punjab, Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha, highlighted that Pakistan's annual citrus exports have declined from $200 million to $130 million.

Plant owners call for tax cut on packed milk,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315962-plant-owners-call-for-tax-cut-on-packed-milk,"Islamabad:Documentation of the economy is crucial not just for fiscal stability but also for tackling malnutrition and ensuring food safety, said Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director of SDPI, Dr Suleri was speaking at a focused policy dialogue on ‘Enabling dairy sector transformation through smart taxation’ organised here by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
Dr Suleri said that despite contributing significantly to economic activity, over 90% of Pakistan's dairy sector remains undocumented and untaxed. He emphasised that the current tax policy, particularly the 18% GST on packaged milk, disincentivises the formal sector and undermines both public health and economic development.
Dr. Umar Farooq also from SDPI revealed that the sales tax hike led to a 20% drop in packaged milk sales and closure of over 500 formal milk processing units, redirecting Rs1.3 trillion in revenue to the informal sector. “This is a fiscal miscalculation. Globally, milk is taxed at an average of just 6%. Pakistan’s 18% GST on packaged milk is a policy outlier that compromises health, nutrition, and livelihoods,” he stated.
Muhammad Nasir of FrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan, stressed the sector's socio-economic importance, especially in rural areas. Dairy acts as a social safety net, yet our productivity remains among the world’s lowest, he said. He also flagged Pakistan’s alarming 40% stunting rate and warned that increased taxation on packed milk could worsen national nutrition indicators.

Haider Hoti rejects Mines & Mineral Bill,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315990-haider-hoti-rejects-mines-mineral-bill,"TAKHTBAHI:  Rejecting the proposed Mines and Mineral Bill 2025, Awami National Party (ANP) leader and former chief minister Ameer Haider Hoti on Tuesday said that his party was the genuine representative of Pakhtuns and committed to safeguarding their rights.
Addressing a workers’ convention here, he said that the ANP had always prioritised constitutional and democratic principles and fought for provincial autonomy.Haider Hoti highlighted the ANP’s significant achievements during its previous term in government, stating that the party took concrete and historic steps to secure rightful autonomy for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “We strengthened the province economically and put it on the path to development. The elimination of terrorism from the region was made possible in the ANP’s tenure,” he maintained.
The ANP leader accused Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of widespread corruption and misgovernance during its 13-year rule. “Even PTI’s own speaker accused the provincial government of corruption worth over Rs500 billion,” Hoti stated. He also pointed to alleged embezzlement in high-profile projects such as Malam Jabba, the Bus Rapid Transit, Billion Tree Tsunami, the health card programme and the solarization of mosques.Calling on party workers to begin preparations for the upcoming elections, Hoti said the future belongs to ANP once again.
Haider Khan Hoti praised the 18th Constitutional Amendment as a landmark reform that strengthened federalism, expanded provincial autonomy, and reversed authoritarian-era amendments. “This amendment, passed unanimously by the National Assembly and Senate in 2010, reflected the principled stance of ANP leaders including Asfandyar Wali Khan, who played an active role in its drafting,” he added. He said the Mines and Minerals Bill was in violation of the 18th Amendment, as it seeks to centralize control over mineral resources that constitutionally belong to the provinces.

Tribunal halts Health Professional Allowance to non-teaching staff,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315995-tribunal-halts-health-professional-allowance-to-non-teaching-staff,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Medical Teaching Institution Appellate Tribunal has halted the payment of Health Professional Allowance to non-teaching staff by the Finance Department.
It declared that the allowance was being granted illegally and unconstitutionally without the approval of the provincial cabinet. The tribunal ruled that civil servants, MTI doctors, paramedical staff, and technicians were not entitled to the allowance unless approved by the cabinet.
The tribunal bench, headed by Chairman Justice (R) Abdul Shakoor and members Mansoor Tariq and Ghafoor Qureshi, issued this verdict while hearing appeals filed by Dr Zahoor Ahmad and Dr Muhammad Zahid.
The appellants, faculty members at Khyber Medical College, argued that they had been receiving the allowance, which was later discontinued.Recovery notices were issued on the grounds that they did not hold MBBS degrees. One appellant stated he holds a PhD and was receiving the allowance under a 2011 Finance Department notification approved by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor.
Subsequent notifications expanded the allowance payments to include Grade-21 doctors, paramedics, and nursing staff, including civil servants and MTI employees.The allowance was increased up to Rs 60,000 for doctors and set at Rs 42,000 per month for non-clinical institutional employees.
The tribunal’s 29-page verdict noted that a 2023 notification limited the allowance to MTI teaching faculty with MBBS degrees. Payments to the appellant continued until 2018. When asked to clarify under what authority the allowance was being paid to civil servants and MTI staff, the Finance Department failed to present any cabinet-approved documents and only referenced a Governor-approved notification.
The tribunal emphasized that, as per the provincial cabinet’s decision dated August 23, 2019, only teaching faculty of public sector medical colleges in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were eligible for allowance. Denying the allowance to the appellants, who are involved in teaching and research, violates both a Peshawar High Court judgment and cabinet policy.
During proceedings, it was revealed that various non-teaching MTI employees, including clinical, technical, and demonstrator staff, were receiving the allowance, despite not being involved in teaching. These employees also received salaries and fees, and thus, the tribunal held, were not entitled to the allowance from the exchequer.
The Finance Department paid billions of rupees as allowance to civil servant doctors, paramedics, nursing staff, and MTI employees without legal authority.When the tribunal requested records, Finance Department officials admitted they had no data on the funds disbursed to these employees.
The tribunal expressed serious concern over potential misuse of authority by the Finance Department, which issued the allowance payments without cabinet approval, violating both the Constitution and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rules of Business.
It ruled that the governor lacks the authority to make administrative or financial decisions, and that only the provincial cabinet, headed by the chief minister, could approve grants, allowances, and funds. The tribunal clarified that even the chief minister could not independently approve or disburse funds.
It nullified all Health Professional Allowance-related notifications issued by the Finance Department. It ordered an immediate halt to the allowance payments to all civil servants and non-teaching MTI employees. The tribunal criticized the silence of the Boards of Governors and Policy Boards of MTI hospitals, stating they failed to fulfill their responsibilities.

Governor accuses CM of indulging in dirty politics,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315996-governor-accuses-cm-of-indulging-in-dirty-politics,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Tuesday flayed Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur for his statement about weapons and said it amounted to open rebellion and was a clear violation of the Constitution and the law.
“Ali Amin Gandapur’s rhetoric goes against national unity and constitutional principles, and is unacceptable, said the governor in a statement.Kundi said that the statements made against the state institutions were punishable by law and should be dealt with through immediate legal action.
“A person who speaks against the state is not fit to represent the public, said the governor while referring to the chief minister.“It is unfortunate that campaigns on social media targeting the victories of the Pakistan Army are being backed by the Chief Minister’s House,” Kundi alleged.
The governor accused the chief minister of indulging in dirty politics for personal political gain, even on a sensitive national issue like the repatriation of Afghan refugees.“Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is currently in the grip of ‘Ali Baba and 40 thieves where corruption is at its peak, said the governor.
He lamented that there was no inquiry into the Rs 40 billion scandal in Kohistan. “Solar projects have become hubs of corruption, yet the government remains a silent spectator, said the governor.
Kundi alleged that Grade-4 jobs were being sold, and teachers’ recruitment tests were being conducted at ministers’ residences.“The baton charge and shelling on peaceful protesters is the worst example of fascism, said the governor while referring to the use of force against the PPP workers the previous day. “The attack on protestors reflects the government’s panic and failure”, said Kundi.The governor said such this government had lost constitutional and public legitimacy and had no justification to remain in power.

Kundi condemns use of force against peaceful protesters,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315997-kundi-condemns-use-of-force-against-peaceful-protesters,"PESHAWAR: Condemning the use of force against what he said peaceful protesters, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Tuesday lauded the political awareness and exemplary conduct of People’s Students Federation (PSF) and youth members during a peaceful protest held by the party. Speaking to a delegation of PSF workers led by Saad Waqas, the governor said that the protest was a democratic expression of political will and the participation of youth highlighted their readiness to lead the nation.
The meeting was also attended by party’s provincial president Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, provincial deputy general secretary Abrar Saeed Swati, MPA Arbab Zarak, former MPA Ziaullah Afridi, and divisional president Misbahuddin.
Governor Kundi strongly condemned the use of force against peaceful protesters, saying it was carried out at the behest of the party responsible for the May 9 attacks on national, military, and public properties. “The use of shelling and baton charge on our peaceful demonstrators in Peshawar shows the same mindset,” he added.
He praised the resilience of party leaders and workers, asserting that their actions proved the party remains active in the province and continues to fight for public rights.“While the ruling party’s protest camps were empty, the followers of Shaheed Bhutto were out in the streets raising their voices for the people,” the governor remarked.
He emphasized the need for accountability, saying that those who bravely faced police action should not be equated with those who stayed at home.He also supported an investigation into the incident, demanding to know how private individuals were allowed to use tear gas on protesters.

Youm-e-Takbir: Nuclear tests by Pakistan restored strategic balance in the region: AJK president,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315998-youm-e-takbir-nuclear-tests-by-pakistan-restored-strategic-balance-in-the-region-ajk-president,"ISLAMABAD: President Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry has said that the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan on May 28, 1998, restored the strategic balance in the region and made Pakistan’s defence impregnable.
In a special message on the occasion of Youm-e-Takbir, he commended the exceptional role played by the then prime minister Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in initiating nuclear programme. Barrister Chaudhry also highlighted Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s significant role in the development and advancement of Pakistan’s missile technology.
These initiatives had made Pakistan’s defence invincible, the AJK president said, adding no enemy can even dare to cast an evil eye on the country.
While emphasising on an early and amicable settlement of the Kashmir dispute, Barrister Chaudhry said: “Kashmir, a nuclear flashpoint between India and Pakistan, has a potential to trigger a nuclear war between the two countries”. Any incident, regardless of its size, can potentially escalate into a larger conflict between India and Pakistan that can potentially jeopardise peace of the whole world, he said, adding: “The key to peace in South Asia lies in a just and honourable settlement of the Kashmir issue”.
The AJK president said it was high time that the international community should play its due role in resolving the long-standing Kashmir issue in line with the UNSC resolutions.Terming Kashmiris the main stakeholders, he stressed the need for associating Kashmiri leadership in dialogue process to find out a lasting solution to the Kashmir issue.

"Pakistan-India Conflict 2025: Speakers at seminar stress unity, strategy after triumph",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316000-pakistan-india-conflict-2025-speakers-at-seminar-stress-unity-strategy-after-triumph,"PESHAWAR: As the dust settles after the recent military conflict between Pakistan and India, speakers at a one-day seminar held here on Tuesday called for national unity, strategic foresight, and coherent policy responses to strengthen the country both internally and externally, following the successful retaliation against India on May 10.
The seminar, titled “Pakistan-India Conflict 2025: Lessons Learnt,” was organized by the National University of Modern Languages (NUML), where academics, defense analysts, and media professionals shared their insights. The faculty members and students of the university attended the event.
Speakers highlighted Pakistan’s emergence as a resilient and dignified regional power after its remarkable victory against blatant Indian aggression.They emphasized the need to translate military achievements into lasting national strength through socio-political stability, economic resilience, and strategic vision.
Prof Dr Qibla Ayaz, former head of the Council of Islamic Ideology, was the chief guest and delivered the keynote address.Brig (R) Dr Saifur Rahman Malik, Regional Director of NUML, was the guest of honour, while Kinza Saher, lecturer at NUML, moderated the event.
Dr Abdul Rehman described the conflict as a turning point that stimulated unprecedented national cohesion.“Moments of crisis, when handled with wisdom, become the building blocks of national integration,” he noted, urging policymakers to capitalize on this momentum to foster unity.
Dr Qadir Baloch spoke about Pakistan’s operational strategy and lauded the armed forces for their disciplined and calculated response.The seminar also explored the information front of the conflict, where speakers argued that the battle for narrative supremacy was as crucial as physical engagement.Zahir Shah Shirazi criticized the Indian media’s war hysteria and disinformation tactics, describing it as “a cynical attempt to distort facts and promote hatred among their people.”
Lehaz Ali and Shams Mohmand lauded Pakistani media for playing a mature role during the conflict, helping to maintain global credibility and build domestic support.Dr Yousaf Ali addressed the myth of Pakistan’s fragility, asserting that it was dismantled by the successful retaliation against Indian aggression.
He said that India had made every effort to isolate Pakistan on the global stage and label it as a fragile state. However, the success Pakistan achieved this month in response to Indian aggression shattered all such efforts.
“The conflict exposed the flaws in international misperceptions about Pakistan, which emerged as a responsible and stronger regional power,” he said. “Pakistan has shown it can stand firm under pressure, both militarily and diplomatically,” he added.
Dr Raza Rehman Qazi outlined strategic lessons from the conflict, underlining the importance of maintaining robust alliances, particularly with China.“Enhanced military linkages with China played a vital counterbalancing role in the recent showdown,” he said.
Dr Zilakat Khan Malik assessed the economic costs of the conflict. “Victory comes at a price. The challenge now is to stabilize our economy, reform defense spending, and ensure sustainable growth,” he stressed.Dr. Hussain Shaheed Soherwordy spoke about the post-conflict challenges and the way forward, offering several suggestions for a brighter future.
In his keynote address, Dr Qibla Ayaz said that Pakistan’s path forward lay in transforming the recent success into a foundation for constructive nation-building.He recalled bitter memories of the 1971 war, when he was a 17-year-old boy. He noted that the recent triumph had instilled a sense of confidence and hope in every Pakistani.
Dr. Qibla Ayaz also lauded the management of NUML for taking the initiative to arrange the seminar on such a crucial topic.He expressed optimism that other universities in the province would follow suit, provided their financial difficulties were resolved in a timely and efficient manner.

Court grants bail to PPP leaders,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316001-court-grants-bail-to-ppp-leaders,"PESHAWAR: A local court on Tuesday granted bail before arrest to the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) provincial president Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, former provincial minister Ziaullah Afridi and Shah Zulqarnain in a case registered against them for staging a protest at Assembly Chowk and allegedly setting fire to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) camp.
Petitioners’ lawyers Gohar Rehman Khattak, Lajbar Khan, and Shakeel Ahmad Gilani informed the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge Asmatullah Wazir that their clients were political workers.
They pleaded that Syed Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha was the provincial president of the PPP and was leading a peaceful protest rally on the day. However, during the protest, on the instructions of the provincial government, police used baton charges against party workers.
They maintained that Ziaullah Afridi was a former provincial minister and PPP office-bearers and Shah Zulqarnain was also a political worker.They argued that every citizen had the right to organise peaceful protest, but this protest was disrupted by unjustified police action, including using baton-charge and teargas, which caused many members and workers to be hospitalised.
They later learned that a case had been registered against them at Cantt Police Station East.The lawyers contended that their clients were respectable citizens affiliated with a political party, and therefore, their pre-arrest bail should be granted.After arguments, the court granted the interim pre-arrest bail to all three petitioners and summoned the case record.

"Imran to be acquitted in all cases, hopes Saif",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316004-imran-to-be-acquitted-in-all-cases-hopes-saif,"PESHAWAR: Advisor to the Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations Barrister Dr Muhammad Ali Saif on Tuesday said that the decision to schedule the hearing of Imran Khan’s cases on June 5 was a welcome development.
In a statement issued after a protest outside the Islamabad High Court, he expressed the hope that Imran Khan would be honourably acquitted from all cases and released.Barrister Saif said that the 26th Constitutional Amendment had paralyzed the judicial system. He emphasized that the chains of this amendment must be broken to ensure immediate justice for Imran Khan. He said that Imran Khan’s release was not only essential in the fight against terrorism but also in the context of ongoing tensions with India, as the PTI founder was the most popular leader in the country and the only one capable of uniting the nation.
“Justice delayed is indeed justice denied. The unnecessary delays in the hearings indicate that these cases are baseless and fabricated. If there were any truth in them, the hearings would not have been postponed,” he added.
He added that Imran Khan is the most popular leader in the country. “If he cannot get justice, how can an ordinary citizen expect it? Imran Khan has served as the Prime Minister of Pakistan, and the treatment being meted out to him is unacceptable and goes against the principles of justice,” he added.
Barrister Saif also said that even in jail, Imran Khan was not being provided with the facilities he was entitled to. “The fake government is using every tactic to break him, but Imran Khan is not someone who can be broken, as he is fighting not for personal gain but for the nation’s cause,” he added.

Death of 4 kids in blast: Protest ends in N Waziristan after talks with govt,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316005-death-of-4-kids-in-blast-protest-ends-in-n-waziristan-after-talks-with-govt,"MIRANSHAH: The sit-in that had continued for eight days in Mir Ali, North Waziristan, ended on Tuesday after successful negotiations between the local administration and protest organizers.
The sit-in was held in response to a tragic incident on May 19 in the village of Hormuz, where an alleged bombing on a house claimed the lives of four children of the same family and injured five others, including a woman.

families, and local youth, demanding justice and accountability for the attack.According to Mufti Baitullah, the representative of the protesters, the government accepted all their key demands.

"Rail freight revival crucial to easing Karachi’s road congestion, say stakeholders",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315896-rail-freight-revival-crucial-to-easing-karachi-s-road-congestion-say-stakeholders,"KARACHI: Divisional Superintendent of Pakistan Railways Mehmoodur Rehman Lakho has said that Karachi handles 99 per cent of Pakistan’s cargo, which must be diverted from roads to railways. Otherwise, the city will continue to suffer from the deterioration of its road infrastructure caused by heavy outbound vehicles traversing its roads to reach upcountry destinations.
Speaking during a meeting at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Lakho said the purpose of his visit to the country’s largest chamber was to explore ways to revive and strengthen rail freight connectivity between Karachi and major industrial and commercial hubs across Pakistan. “Shifting to rail freight is not only economically beneficial but also environmentally responsible. Rail transport is three times more fuel-efficient than road freight, which helps reduce carbon emissions, saves foreign exchange on fuel imports and relieves pressure on highways,” he noted.
Lakho highlighted that the railways has taken significant steps to modernise its freight operations over the past decade. Between 2013 and 2015, over 1,400 new hopper wagons, 2,000 high-capacity flat wagons and 55 modern locomotives were added to the fleet. These additions have boosted payload capacity from an average of 20 tonnes to 60 tonnes per wagon, allowing each train to carry over 4,000 tonnes of cargo.
He expressed concern over the delayed implementation of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), originally envisioned as a game-changer for Pakistan’s rail infrastructure.
Without ML-1, the railways remains constrained in its ability to offer long-haul, high-speed cargo services across Karachi, Sukkur, Multan, and onwards to the northern regions.
Lakho also informed the gathering that Pakistan Railways is working on ambitious plans to revive international rail freight services connecting Karachi to Moscow via Iran, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan -- a corridor that could unlock new export markets for Pakistani goods, especially textiles and industrial products.
He added that the railways is exploring modern logistics models such as multimodal freight movement, dedicated industrial cargo trains for Karachi’s export-oriented sectors and the introduction of Roll-on/Roll-off (RoRo) wagons, which would allow loaded trucks to be transported directly by train, bypassing congested highways and reducing fuel and maintenance costs. He said the department is ready to collaborate with the KCCI and its members to identify freight priorities and launch pilot routes linking Karachi with Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Rawalpindi and Peshawar.
Chairman of the Businessmen Group (BMG) Zubair Motiwala welcomed the visit by railway officials, calling it a much-needed effort to bridge the gap between Pakistan Railways and the business community. He said the railways had historically served as the backbone of the country’s trade and industrial logistics. However, due to neglect, mismanagement and growing reliance on road transport, the sector had lost its significance. “As a result, logistics costs have soared, roads have deteriorated from overuse, and the entire supply chain has become more vulnerable to disruptions such as fuel shortages, political protests, and highway closures.”  Motiwala said Karachi’s industries, already grappling with slow inland movement of raw materials and finished goods, would benefit enormously from a strong and reliable freight rail network. He noted that freight trains are not only more cost-effective and timely but also safer and more resilient to external shocks than road transport. Karachi’s roads, he added, are choked with heavy trucks moving through densely populated areas, causing traffic congestion, pollution and road damage. Expanding and rehabilitating railway cargo services would significantly reduce the strain on urban infrastructure and improve logistics efficiency.
KCCI President Jawed Bilwani also emphasised the urgent need to revive rail cargo operations as a strategic priority for the country’s economy. He said that Karachi, as Pakistan’s industrial and commercial capital, lacks the road infrastructure to bear the logistics burden of the entire country. With hundreds of thousands of trucks entering and exiting the city daily, the road network is deteriorating rapidly, and frequent supply chain breakdowns occur due to traffic jams, strikes, and fuel-related disruptions.
Bilwani noted that countries that maintain low logistics costs -- particularly through rail -- achieve stronger industrial growth and export competitiveness. He called for dedicated cargo trains to and from Karachi’s industrial zones, which house many of the nation’s top exporters. He urged Pakistan Railways to explore operational models including the introduction of RoRo wagons to transport entire trucks by train, the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) for freight services as well as passengers, and the rationalisation of excessive charges on industrial rail crossings and private sidings.
Bilwani proposed the formation of a joint working committee between the KCCI and the railways to develop and oversee pilot freight services, align train schedules with port operations, resolve customs clearance challenges at dry ports, and ensure sustained engagement between public and private stakeholders.

"Ogra launches e-licensing platform to streamline oil, gas approvals",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315897-ogra-launches-e-licensing-platform-to-streamline-oil-gas-approvals,"ISLAMABAD: The oil and gas industry took a digital step forward on Tuesday as the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) launched a full-scale e-licensing system, enabling end-to-end online approvals for licenses in gas, LNG, CNG, LPG, refining, and oil marketing segments.
The new platform -- developed with the National IT Board -- is part of a broader push to modernise Pakistan’s regulatory infrastructure, slashing paperwork and processing times for midstream and downstream players. Companies can now apply, track and receive licence approvals entirely online, a move seen as pivotal in improving the ease of doing business and drawing in foreign and local investment.
“This launch marks a significant milestone in our journey towards digital governance,” said the spokesperson of Ogra in a news statement on Tuesday. “By cutting paperwork and enabling faster processing, we are not only improving convenience for applicants and investors, but also reinforcing confidence in Pakistan’s regulatory framework.”With energy demand rising and Pakistan keen to revamp its energy landscape, the e-licensing system is expected to ease bottlenecks that have long deterred investors.

Govt raises Rs772bn through T-bills’ auction; yields fall by 9-15 bps,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315898-govt-raises-rs772bn-through-t-bills-auction-yields-fall-by-9-15-bps,"KARACHI: The government raised Rs 772 billion from the auction of Market Treasury Bills on Tuesday, exceeding the Rs650 billion target, the auction result released by the State Bank of Pakistan showed.
“In today’s T-bill auction, huge participation of Rs3,235 billion was seen, with the government raising Rs772 billion as against the target of Rs650 billion and maturity of Rs818 billion,” said Topline Securities in a brief note.
The cut-off yield fell across all tenors, ranging from 9-15 basis points (bps). The one-month T-bill decreased by 15 bps to 11.09 per cent. The three-month paper yield also declined by 9bps to 11.14 per cent. The yield on the six-month T-bill was down 9bps at 11.18 per cent. The yield on the 12-month paper fell by 15bps to 11.19 per cent.
In the floating-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds’ auction, the government raised Rs187 billion (competitive and non-competitive) against a participation of Rs700 billion and a target of Rs200 billion.
This month, the SBP lowered its benchmark interest rate by 100bps to 11 per cent, marking the continuation of a series of rate cuts that reduced the rate from a record high of 22 percent after a brief hold in March. The policy rate has fallen by 11 percentage points since June 2024.
Markets and analysts are waiting to see what the SBP will decide on interest rates at its June 16 meeting. The inflation is predicted to be 3.0 per cent year-on-year (YoY) and 0.61 per cent month-on-month (MoM) in May.
Headline inflation eased to 0.3 per cent in April, down from 0.7 per cent in the previous month. Additionally, core inflation, which had remained around 9.0 per cent for several months, slowed to 8.0 per cent in April. This decline is largely due to a favourable base effect in the context of moderate demand conditions.

"China’s premier tells ASEAN, Gulf nations to remove trade barriers",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315899-china-s-premier-tells-asean-gulf-nations-to-remove-trade-barriers,"BEIJING: Chinese Premier Li Qiang on Tuesday urged Southeast Asian and Gulf countries to remove trade barriers and expand opening up amid rising protectionism, and said Beijing is confident it can stabilise its economy in the face of challenges.
Li was speaking at a dinner event during a leaders’ summit in Kuala Lumpur with countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council. “Facing rising protectionism and unilateralism in some places of the world, we must be committed to expanding opening up and removing barriers,” Li said, without naming any countries.
“Economic globalisation is currently experiencing an unprecedented major impact,” Li said, urging the countries to uphold a multilateral trading system with the World Trade Organisation at its core.
US President Donald Trump’s trade war is upending the global economy, with his administration and the Chinese government engaging in tit-for-tat tariff hikes before walking back most of the increases following negotiations.
Trade tensions with the US have fuelled concerns for China’s economy, which has been reliant on an export-driven recovery amid sluggish demand and deflationary pressures at home. Li said China’s economy has continued to recover and improve since the beginning of the year, and that Chinese exports have remained “resilient despite external pressure”. China’s fiscal expenditure will reach a record high this year and the government is directing more policy resources towards consumption to unleash demand potential, he added.

World Bank warns Pakistan’s rising tariffs are stifling exports,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315900-world-bank-warns-pakistan-s-rising-tariffs-are-stifling-exports,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s declining export performance, despite years of tariff protection, is threatening its competitiveness and long-term economic prospects, the World Bank has warned in its latest policy assessment.
Exports have shrunk to just over 10 per cent of GDP in 2024, down from more than 15 per cent in the 1990s -- one of the lowest shares in the region and among middle-income economies. In the report titled ‘From Inward to Outward: Pakistan’s Shift Towards Export-led Growth’, the World Bank said the slide reflects worsening constraints on businesses, compounded by recent policy shifts towards higher tariffs.
“Pakistan’s tariff structure -- characterised by high average protection rates, cascading import duties, and ad hoc exemptions -- has become a barrier to export-led growth,” the report said, noting that tariff rates have risen steadily since reaching their lowest levels in the early 2000s.
Pakistan’s goods exports rose 6.25 per cent year-on-year to $26.86 billion in the first 10 months of FY25, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) earlier this month.
The World Bank’s assessment highlighted structural weaknesses in Pakistan’s trade policy and recommended transferring tariff-setting authority from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to the National Tariff Board. It also proposed establishing a National Regulatory Delivery Office to streamline policy implementation and reduce red tape.
While the World Bank welcomed the launch of Uraan Pakistan -- the government’s five-year plan for reforms and economic growth -- in December 2024, it cautioned that tariff reforms must be accompanied by broader structural changes to make the economy more competitive.
The report also pointed to a challenging business climate marked by a misaligned exchange rate regime, high energy costs, regulatory complexity and limited access to credit. It warned that high import duties on raw materials and intermediate goods have further eroded firm productivity, sales and wages.
Pakistan’s exports face another major threat of now on-hold reciprocal tariffs of up to 29 per cent announced by US President Donald Trump. The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), a think tank affiliated with Planning Commission, has warned that the reciprocal tariff on Pakistan might cause a decline in exports to the US in the range of 20-25 per cent translating into an annual loss of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.

KSE-100 index up 112 points amid pre-budget speculations,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315901-kse-100-index-up-112-points-amid-pre-budget-speculations,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed slightly higher in a range-bound session on Tuesday amid speculations ahead of the federal budget.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 111.79 points, or 0.09 per cent, to 118,332.91 points, up from 118,221.12 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 118,807.92 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 118,143.68 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Ltd said stocks showed recovery amid speculations during the pre-budget session, with hopes for a real estate package in the federal budget driving interest in cement stocks.
Investor concerns over IMF disagreements on key budgetary targets, subsidies and rupee instability triggered mid-session pressure. However, government measures aimed at raising tax collection and easing the fiscal deficit played a catalytic role in the positive close at the PSX.
The KSE-30 index increased by 13.44 points or 0.04 per cent to 35,968.64 points from 35,955.2 points. Traded shares rose by 55 million shares to 690.389 million shares from 635.535 million shares. The trading value increased to Rs23.828 billion from Rs18.576 billion. Market capital expanded to Rs14.347 trillion against Rs14.325 trillion. Of the 459 companies active in the session, 211 closed in green, 210 in red, and 38 remained unchanged.
Naveed Nadeem, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the stock market saw a range-bound session, with the index moving within a confined band due to rollover pressures and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming budget.
Positive momentum was driven by notable contributions from MEBL, SYS, PKGP, PPL, and DGKC, which together added 223 points to the index.
The highest increase was recorded in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which rose by Rs2,206.95 to Rs24,276.48 per share, followed by Khyber Textile Mills Limited, which increased by Rs209.67 to Rs2,306.37 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs471.19 to Rs10,284.04 per share, Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs100 to Rs23,000 per share.
K-Electric Ltd remained the volume leader with 267.623 million shares, which closed higher by 17 paisas to Rs5.89 per share. WorldCall Telecom, with 31.561 million shares, followed it, which closed higher by 3 paisas to Rs1.3 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included PTCL, Telecard Limited, Dewan Cement, Ist Capital Sec, The Searle Company, Cres Star Ins, DGK Cement and Fauji Cement.   In the futures market, 318 companies recorded trading, 132 of which increased, 181 decreased and 5 remained unchanged.

Rupee falls for second straight day,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315902-rupee-falls-for-second-straight-day,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee declined against the US dollar for the second straight session in the interbank market on Tuesday. The rupee closed at 282.17 per dollar, compared with the previous close of 282.06.
The rupee also weakened in the open market, tracking a decline in the local currency’s value in the interbank market. Dealers said the rupee remained under pressure as importers and companies bought dollars to meet their obligations ahead of a public holiday.
The financial markets will remain closed on Wednesday for the Youm-e-Takbeer holiday. Dealers expect the local unit to trade range-bound against the dollar until the budget is unveiled. The evolving news flow surrounding the budget will determine the rupee’s future direction.
Reports indicate, citing the finance ministry, that the presentation of the federal budget for 2025-26 has been delayed from June 2 to June 10 due to disagreements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about key budgetary figures, including subsidy allocations.
A report published by Arif Habib Limited last week said that the upcoming budget is expected to emphasise fiscal discipline and reforms aimed at stabilising the economy while providing targeted relief. Pakistan’s gross domestic product growth is anticipated at 3.6 per cent in FY26 (up from 2.68 per cent), inflation is expected to increase to 6.29 per cent (from 4.63 per cent), and the current account deficit is projected at $1.5 billion (from a surplus of $1.6 billion).

"SAI calls for tax policy reforms, lower sales tax to spur growth",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315903-sai-calls-for-tax-policy-reforms-lower-sales-tax-to-spur-growth,"KARACHI: The SITE Association of Industry (SAI) has called for a clear institutional separation between tax policy formulation and tax administration to prevent conflicts of interest and align with international best practices.
Drawing comparisons with models in the UK and neighbouring countries, SAI proposed a structure where tax policy is handled by the Ministry of Finance, revenue distribution managed by an independent finance commission, and consumption taxes regulated by a dedicated council.
In its budget proposals, SAI President Ahmed Azeem Alvi and former president Riaz Uddin, who chairs the association’s taxation committee, stressed the need to transform the budget-making process into a strategic economic tool, rather than continuing it as a routine fiscal exercise.
Addressing systemic weaknesses in the taxation framework, SAI noted that Pakistan’s income tax base remains narrow -- just 9-10 per cent of GDP -- while the formal industrial sector bears a disproportionate tax burden. The association urged widening the tax net to include untaxed and under-taxed sectors, and recommended capping the maximum income tax rate on business income at 25 percent over the next three years. It also called for the abolition of the super tax, describing it as outdated and inequitable, and sought relief on inter-corporate and individual dividend taxation.
Alvi and Riaz expressed serious concern over amendments introduced through the Income Tax Ordinance IV of 2025, particularly to Sections 138(3A), 140(6A) and 175C. According to SAI, these changes confer excessive powers on tax authorities and violate Articles 4, 18 and 77 of the constitution. The association demanded their immediate withdrawal, warning that such measures could deter compliance, foster informality and erode investor confidence.
On sales tax reform, SAI highlighted longstanding issues stemming from overlapping federal and provincial jurisdictions. It proposed a harmonised General Sales Tax (GST) regime supported by a single compliance portal, allowing seamless cross-jurisdictional input tax adjustments. The association also called for expedited refund mechanisms, with refund payment orders (RPOs) to be issued within five working days and payments processed shortly thereafter.
SAI raised concerns over the current combined sales and further tax rate of 22 per cent, saying that it promotes tax evasion and hampers formalisation of the economy. A review of the rate structure was recommended to reduce distortions and incentivise registration.
The association urged the government to implement a gradual reduction in the sales tax rate, targeting 15 per cent over the next three years. It argued that this would reduce the cost of doing business for the formal sector and stimulate economic growth.
SAI also called for the abolition of the additional sales tax, which it claimed enables businesses to remain in the informal sector by avoiding registration and tax obligations. This, the association said, perpetuates a cycle of non-compliance that impedes formal economic development.
It further recommended maintaining sales tax exemptions on essential items such as basic foodstuffs, pharmaceuticals, and education-related goods, noting their importance in shielding vulnerable populations from inflationary pressures.
The association requested the restoration of zero-rating for export facilitation schemes and educational stationery, in line with assurances made by the finance minister during his June 2024 budget speech. It believes reinstating these exemptions will support the export sector and ease financial burdens on educational institutions. SAI proposed a reduced sales tax rate of 5.0 per cent on other essential and deserving items to further alleviate consumer hardship.
SAI also called for the removal of area-specific sales tax exemptions in the former tribal areas (Fata/Pata), arguing that such exemptions should end in pursuit of nationwide tax uniformity and broader fiscal reform.
Alvi and Riaz highlighted the need for comprehensive reforms in Pakistan Customs, citing outdated laws, tariff fragmentation, under-invoicing and weak enforcement. The association recommended revising the Customs Act to align with WTO and WCO standards, simplifying duty structures and introducing a unified valuation and appraisal system. It also proposed designating the port of entry as the sole point for revenue collection to prevent leakage and facilitate smoother inland goods movement.
On social welfare schemes, SAI criticised the management of employee welfare funds such as EOBI, PESSI/SESSI, WWF, and WPPF as inefficient and outdated. Largely funded by employers, these schemes offer little influence to contributors. SAI advocated for integration under a unified authority, governed centrally and supported by digital platforms, with tripartite representation from employers, employees, and regulators. It proposed that disbursements be made via mobile payment systems, and that healthcare and related services be outsourced to third-party providers.

Pakistan’s pink salt pavilion draws global attention at Osaka Expo 2025,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315904-pakistan-s-pink-salt-pavilion-draws-global-attention-at-osaka-expo-2025,"KARACHI: Pakistan has unveiled a striking pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka, drawing global attention with a design inspired by its distinctive pink rock salt and a message centred on sustainability, nature and international partnership.
Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday at the Expo site in Osaka, Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan described the pavilion as “a message of balance and renewal”, built around the theme ‘Universe in a Grain of Salt’. The concept is anchored in Pakistan’s iconic pink rock salt -- found exclusively in the country’s Salt Range -- and has become one of the most visited national displays at the event.
“Salt, in its purity and strength, represents our timeless connection to the earth,” Khan told the media. “Through it, we are sharing a vision of sustainability and nature-centric progress with the world.”
The minister said Pakistan’s presence at Expo 2025 was not just symbolic, but strategic, and intended to signal its aspirations for greater international collaboration in trade, investment and cultural exchange. “Pakistan cannot remain absent from global platforms like this,” he said. “This is where the world comes together to exchange ideas and address shared challenges.”
Designed with low-carbon materials and operated on full energy conservation, the Pakistan Pavilion aligns with Expo 2025’s overarching theme: ‘Designing Future Societies for Our Lives’. Its architectural references to salt crystals and natural textures are meant to evoke reflection on wellness, sustainability and Pakistan’s artisanal traditions.
Beyond the design, the pavilion will serve as a venue for a range of events over the coming months, including a Pakistan Food Festival, cultural performances, trade forums and National Day celebrations on August 14.
Khan also used the platform to highlight Pakistan’s economic strengths, encouraging Japanese and international investors to explore opportunities in sectors such as textiles, food and agriculture, minerals, digital services and clean energy.“We are at a turning point,” he said. “Pakistan is ready to engage more deeply with the region and the world, and Japan is a key part of that vision.”

"CM Murad inaugurates Sindh Startup Expo, urges greater industry-academia collaboration",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315906-cm-murad-inaugurates-sindh-startup-expo-urges-greater-industry-academia-collaboration,"KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday inaugurated the Sindh Innovative Startups Exhibition 2025 at the Federation House.
The event aimed to promote indigenous business ideas, foster industry-academia linkages, highlight emerging technologies, and support import substitution solutions. It also sought to encourage technology-driven economic development and strengthen the tech entrepreneurship ecosystem in the country.
Murad reaffirmed his government’s support for universities and their R&D initiatives, calling them the only sustainable path to creating a robust economic environment in Sindh by harnessing the potential of the youth in a constructive and productive manner.
He noted that Sindh allocates the highest level of funding to universities among all provinces.The chief minister commended the FPCCI’s leadership role as the apex trade and industry body, particularly in uniting industry, academia and government. He also urged the FPCCI to facilitate investment in the province’s technology startups through matchmaking efforts.
FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh said that the future of Pakistan’s economy lies in innovation, entrepreneurship, and knowledge-based collaboration. He emphasised that it was time for industry to embrace academia not just as a partner, but as a driver of future growth and competitiveness.
The FPCCI president also acknowledged the efforts of Chairman of the Sindh Higher Education Commission (HEC) Prof Dr Tariq Rafi for extending the impact of academia beyond the classroom and into the economy. He also praised Convener of FPCCI’s Central Standing Committee on Higher Education, Science and Technology Maheen Salman for conceptualising and executing the exhibition with clarity, energy and purpose.
FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon explained that around the world, industries lead innovation with support from universities, as they are best positioned to identify real-world needs and market-driven applications of technology.
Rafi noted that the exhibition marked a significant joint initiative by the Sindh HEC and FPCCI. He said previous efforts, such as the Sindh Research Support Programme and various events showcasing university-based innovations, were all geared towards offering local solutions to local industry. “Ultimately, our goal is to move universities towards greater self-reliance by transforming research into opportunity. Today’s exhibition is the manifestation of that vision,” he added.

SNGPL chief assures textile sector of priority gas supply,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315907-sngpl-chief-assures-textile-sector-of-priority-gas-supply,"LAHORE: Managing Director of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) Amer Tufail, during his visit to the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) office on Tuesday, assured the industry of resolving all gas-related issues on a priority basis.
He said that the export-oriented industry has always been given high priority in gas supply, and SNGPL will continue to fully facilitate and cooperate with the textile sector to meet its energy requirements. Amer also offered to lay a dedicated gas pipeline for mills that opt to operate round the clock to shield them from outages or pressure fluctuations.
The SNGPL chief informed APTMA that every effort is being made to ensure uninterrupted gas supply to the entire industrial sector, particularly export-driven units, including APTMA member mills. He said that all SNGPL field formations have been instructed to remain vigilant and responsive to the needs of exporters, without any delay.
Amer requested that APTMA notify him directly in the event of any non-cooperation or delays by SNGPL personnel. He assured that all concerns raised by APTMA would be sympathetically addressed and resolved on a priority basis.
Earlier, APTMA leadership expressed concern over the high gas tariff, describing it as unaffordable for exporters. They noted that gas consumption had plummeted to just 13 mmcfd, compared to a normal demand of 150 mmcfd prior to the tariff hike.

Australia face selection dilemma ahead of WTC final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315927-australia-face-selection-dilemma-ahead-of-wtc-final,"MELBOURNE: Australia head coach Andrew McDonald on Tuesday admitted that the final playing XI has not yet been decided and he is facing challenges in selecting the team for the ICC World Test Championship final against South Africa, scheduled to begin on June 11 at Lord’s.
As the defending champions eye back-to-back titles, the team management faces several key decisions, particularly regarding the top order and all-rounder roles. While experienced opener Usman Khawaja is confirmed to take his place at the top, the identity of his partner remains uncertain.
Sam Konstas and Marnus Labuschagne have emerged as potential candidates to open the innings, but McDonald hinted that in-form all-rounder Cameron Green could also be a surprise option for the role.
Green has been in stellar form in England’s County Championship Division 2, notching up three centuries for Gloucestershire over the past six weeks. Although he is unavailable to bowl as he continues recovering from back surgery, McDonald is confident in the 25-year-old’s adaptability with the bat. “I think he can bat anywhere. He could be three, five, six, or even open. He’s got the temperament and the skill set, especially the defensive game required higher up the order. He plays the short ball well and covers all bases.” McDonald said.
The uncertainty extends beyond the top order. Australia are also debating whether to include an all-rounder in the final XI. With Green ruled out of bowling duties, Beau Webster, who impressed during his Test outings against India and Sri Lanka earlier this year, is in contention. The 31-year-old could feature if conditions at Lord’s warrant an all-rounder’s inclusion.
“There’s an XI on a board, but it has dashes with multiple names in different positions. We have tried to assemble a 15-man squad that gives us all the options. Whether or not we go with an all-rounder depends on the pitch and conditions, which will then influence how we shape the batting order,” McDonald revealed.
The final decision will hinge on how much weight the selectors give to the need for a fifth bowling option. According to McDonald, clarity will be provided to players as the match draws nearer.
It is pertinent to mention that the ICC World Test championship final is set to take place on June 11, at the iconic Lord’s Cricket Ground in London between South Africa and defending champions Australia.

Suryakumar Yadav breaks Sachin Tendulkar’s IPL record,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315930-suryakumar-yadav-breaks-sachin-tendulkar-s-ipl-record,"MUMBAI: Suryakumar Yadav made history in Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 on Monday by surpassing legendary batter Sachin Tendulkar’s 15-year-old record for the most runs scored in a single season by a Mumbai Indians (MI) player.
In a crucial league-stage fixture against Punjab Kings, Suryakumar delivered yet another match-winning performance. The 34-year-old also scored over 25 runs in every league match this season, taking his overall tally to 619* runs—eclipsing Tendulkar’s 2010 mark of 618 runs.
Tendulkar had amassed his 618 runs at an average of 47.53 and a strike rate of 132.61 during IPL 2010. Suryakumar came close to breaking that record in 2023, finishing with 605 runs, but ultimately fell short.
With 619* runs and counting, Suryakumar now holds the record for the most runs in a single IPL season by a MI batter. Tendulkar still features twice in the franchise’s top five, also scoring 553 runs in the 2011 season.
Lendl Simmons is fourth on the list with 540 runs in 2015, followed by Rohit Sharma’s 538 runs in 2013. Additionally, he has become the first player in MI’s history to score 600 or more runs in multiple IPL seasons—achieving the feat first in 2023 and now again in 2025.
Currently third among the leading run-scorers in IPL 2025, Suryakumar has been instrumental in keeping MI in playoff contention with his consistent and composed performances under pressure.

Abbas Afridi inducted after Wasim Jr gets injured,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315931-abbas-afridi-inducted-after-wasim-jr-gets-injured,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s fast-bowling all-rounder Mohammad Wasim Jr has been ruled out of the upcoming three-match T20I series against Bangladesh, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed on Tuesday.
According to the cricket board, the 23-year-old picked up a side strain during the recently concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10 and was not able to recover in time. Earlier, sources had suggested that the doctors advised Mohammad Wasim Jr a one-week rest and thus, will undergo rehabilitation at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) here.
As a result, he has been replaced by Abbas Afridi, who was the joint second leading wicket-taker of the PSL 10 with 17 dismissals in 11 matches at a decent average of 23.52.
“Fast bowler Mohammad Abbas Afridi has replaced Mohammad Wasim Jnr in Pakistan’s T20I squad for the three-match T20I series against Bangladesh,” the PCB said in a statement.
“Wasim Jnr picked up a side strain during the HBL PSL and was not able to recover in time.” Abbas has thus far represented Pakistan in 20 T20Is and took 33 wickets in his budding career.

Balochistan grand serve for Pakistan tennis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315933-balochistan-grand-serve-for-pakistan-tennis,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) is gearing up to make history with the launch of the first-ever Balochistan Open Tennis Tournament, set to commence on May 28 at the prestigious PTF Complex courts in Islamabad.
Touted as one of the richest domestic tennis events ever held on Pakistani soil, the Balochistan Open marks a groundbreaking addition to the national tennis calendar. In an exclusive conversation with The News, Aisamul Haq Qureshi, President of the Pakistan Tennis Federation, confirmed that final preparations have been completed for what is expected to be a landmark tournament.
“We are about to start one of the most significant and financially rewarding domestic events in Pakistan’s tennis history,” Aisam stated. “The Balochistan Open is not just a tournament—it’s a movement to elevate tennis in Pakistan, and we hope to set a new precedent with this initiative.”
With prize money totaling Rs 1.5 million, and an estimated overall budget of Rs 3 million, the Balochistan Open promises both prestige and opportunity.  “This event holds great significance for the future of tennis in Pakistan,” Aisam said.
“It is designed to instill confidence among domestic players and to offer them a platform where they can compete at a higher level. Young players will benefit immensely by challenging seasoned professionals.”
Since assuming leadership of the PTF, Aisam—an internationally acclaimed tennis star—has been on a mission to expand the sport’s reach and increase its accessibility across Pakistan. His vision focuses on nurturing young talent and providing them with consistent exposure to top-level competition, both nationally and internationally.
“Tennis is a game of perseverance and discipline,” he explained. “Our youth need regular opportunities to test their skills and grow. Events like the Balochistan Open are stepping stones for future champions.”
Aisam’s long-term goal is ambitious yet clear: to make tennis the second most popular sport in Pakistan. Under his leadership, the PTF has launched a series of successful initiatives aimed at expanding the game’s footprint beyond major cities.
“We’ve taken the PTF Masters Series to cities like Faisalabad, Sialkot, and Peshawar, where hundreds of youngsters have had a chance to learn the fundamentals of the game. These efforts are about more than just events—they are about building a tennis culture and giving the youth a positive and healthy direction.”
The Balochistan Open stands not only as a celebration of athletic excellence but also as a powerful symbol of unity and growth. By naming the tournament after Balochistan, one of the country’s most underserved regions in sports, the PTF is signaling its commitment to inclusivity and national outreach. “This is a beginning,” Aisam concluded. “We are planting the seeds of a tennis revolution in Pakistan.”

India approves development of prototype advanced fighter jet,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315978-india-approves-development-of-prototype-advanced-fighter-jet,"NEW DELHI: India´s defence minister approved on Tuesday a programme to develop an advanced fighter jet prototype, the latest push to boost local arms production, nearly three weeks after a conflict with Pakistan.
India, one of the world´s largest arms importers, has made the modernisation of its forces a top priority in the face of tensions with Pakistan and China.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh approved the prototype of a 5th generation Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), the ministry said in a statement, calling it a “significant push towards enhancing India´s indigenous defence capabilities”.
India´s Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) -- a government agency under the Ministry of Defence responsible for aircraft design -- is “set to execute the programme through industry partnership”, it added.
“This is an important step...which will be a major milestone towards aatmanirbharta (“self-reliance”) in the aerospace sector”.India´s arms purchases have steadily risen to account for nearly 10 percent of all imports globally in 2019-23, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said last year.
The world´s most populous nation has deepened defence cooperation with Western countries in recent years, including the Quad alliance with the United States, Japan and Australia, as it slowly shifts away from its longstanding reliance on Russian military hardware.
India signed in April a multi-billion-dollar deal to purchase 26 Rafale fighter jets from France´s Dassault Aviation, adding to 36 already acquired, and replacing Russian MiG-29K jets.But Singh has also promised at least $100 billion in fresh domestic military hardware contracts by 2033 to spur local arms production.
This decade India has opened an expansive new helicopter factory, launched its first homemade aircraft carrier, warships and submarines, and conducted a successful long-range hypersonic missile test.

Trump administration halts scheduling of new student visa appointments,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315979-trump-administration-halts-scheduling-of-new-student-visa-appointments,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump’s administration has ordered its missions abroad to stop scheduling new appointments for student and exchange visitor visa applicants as the State Department prepares to expand social media vetting of foreign students, according to an internal cable seen by Reuters on Tuesday.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in the cable that the department plans to issue updated guidance on social media vetting of student and exchange visitor applicants after a review is completed and advised consular sections to halt the scheduling of such visa appointments.
The move comes as the Trump administration has sought to ramp up deportations and revoke student visas as part of its wide-ranging efforts to fulfill his hardline immigration agenda. In the cable, first reported by Politico, Rubio said appointments that have already been scheduled can proceed under the current guidelines, but available appointments not already taken should be pulled down.
The US State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “The Department is conducting a review of existing operations and processes for screening and vetting of student and exchange visitor (F, M, J) visa applicants, and based on that review, plans to issue guidance on expanded social media vetting for all such applicants,” the cable said.

EU approves 150-billion-euro loan scheme to rearm,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315980-eu-approves-150-billion-euro-loan-scheme-to-rearm,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: EU countries on Tuesday formally approved a new 150-billion-euro loan programme to help rearm in the face of Russia and worries over US reliability, according to the Polish presidency of the bloc.
The SAFE borrowing scheme backed by the EU´s central budget was proposed by Brussels in March as the bloc rushes to boost its defences. Finalised by member states earlier this month, the text received final approval at a meeting of Europe ministers in Brussels, with 26 countries voting for and one abstention, the presidency said.
EU countries had haggled at length over what the money could be spent on and how countries outside the bloc can access the funds. In the end, the agreement stuck to the original proposal allowing 35 percent of the value of the weapons to come from manufacturers beyond the bloc and Ukraine.
France´s Europe minister Benjamin Haddad called SAFE “a major step forward” that asserts “a very clear principle of European preference to support our industries, reduce our dependencies including from the United States, and invest in Europe´s strategic autonomy.”
“But it is just one step -- and we will need to go further,” Haddad told reporters in Brussels. The borrowing programme is part of a package of measures including loosening budget rules that Brussels says could potentially unlock 800 billion euros of defence spending.

Webb telescope captures deep view of ancient galaxies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315981-webb-telescope-captures-deep-view-of-ancient-galaxies,"PARIS: The James Webb space telescope´s deepest view of a single target yet depicts spinning arcs of light that are galaxies from the universe´s distant past, the European Space Agency said on Tuesday.
The new image took the world´s most powerful telescope more than 120 hours to capture, making it the longest Webb has ever focused on a single target. It is also “Webb´s deepest gaze on a single target to date”, the European Space Agency (ESA) said in a statement, making the image one of the deepest ever captured of the cosmos.
At the bright centre of the image is a massive cluster of galaxies called Abell S1063, which is 4.5 billion light years from Earth. But it is not the true target. Such huge celestial objects can bend the light of things behind them, creating a kind of magnifying glass called a gravitational lens.
Therefore the “warped arcs” spinning around the Abell S1063 are what really interest scientists, the ESA said in a statement. Because looking into distant space also means looking back in time, scientists hope to learn how the first galaxies formed during a period known as the Cosmic Dawn, when the universe was only a few million years old.

US government seeks to cut remaining federal ties with Harvard,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315982-us-government-seeks-to-cut-remaining-federal-ties-with-harvard,"WASHINGTON: The US government intends to cancel all remaining financial contracts with Harvard, a senior official said on Tuesday, in President Donald Trump´s latest attempt to force the prestigious university to submit to unprecedented oversight.
The administration “will send a letter to federal agencies today asking them to identify any contracts with Harvard, and whether they can be canceled or redirected elsewhere,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The ending of contracts -- estimated by US media to be worth $100 million -- would mark the severance of business ties between the government and an institution that is both the country´s oldest university and a global research powerhouse.
Amid a broad push to amass power in the White House, Trump has singled out Harvard for particularly fierce punishment. His administration accuses the Cambridge, Massachusetts university of permitting anti-Semitism and pervasive liberal bias.
Harvard has rejected orders to allow a series of extraordinary measures, including an audit of political leanings on campus and a ban on students deemed to be “hostile to the American values.”
In the last few weeks, the elite educational bastion has seen billions of dollars in federal grants frozen and an attempt -- paused last Friday by a court ruling -- to end its ability to host foreign students.
The university is fighting back, arguing that the Trump attacks are unconstitutional and would cripple its ability to function. On Monday, Trump vowed he would prevail in the increasingly public struggle.
In a social media post he claimed that foreign students at Harvard included “radicalized lunatics, troublemakers.” Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard´s ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
She had threatened last month to block international students at the school unless it turned over records on visa holders´ “illegal and violent activities.” But a judge quickly suspended the move after the university sued to “stop the government´s arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and unconstitutional action.”
There will be an injunction hearing on Thursday, a court filing showed. Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement that the attempted foreign students ban “imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.”
In addition to undermining the independence of storied US universities -- which attract top students from around the world and produce much of the country´s lucrative scientific research -- Trump has sought to dismantle the government´s traditional soft power tools, including humanitarian aid and the Voice of America radio network.

Iran president in Oman as nuclear talks progress,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315983-iran-president-in-oman-as-nuclear-talks-progress,"MUSCAT, Oman: Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Tuesday began a two-day visit to Oman, which is mediating ongoing nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington.
Pezeshkian travelled to Muscat looking to promote “peace and stability”, he said, two days after US President Donald Trump described the latest negotiations as “very, very good”. “We hope to engage in dialogue to reach a shared perspective and a common voice on promoting peace and stability in the region,” Pezeshkian said in a televised speech before leaving Tehran.
Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei confirmed on Monday that the visit would address the ongoing nuclear talks. A statement from Iran´s presidency said Pezeshkian met Sultan Haitham bin Tariq and told him Tehran appreciated Oman´s help in the talks, “and we hope that this process will lead to positive results”.
Oman, Iran´s neighbour across a narrow strip of sea, has since April facilitated five rounds of talks between Tehran and Washington, which do not have diplomatic relations. “I think we could have some good news on the Iran front,” he said, adding that an announcement could come “over the next two days”. The United States is seeking to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons -- which Tehran denies seeking -- as the Iranians seek relief from crippling sanctions.

Trump says Putin ‘playing with fire’ as sanctions pressure grows,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315984-trump-says-putin-playing-with-fire-as-sanctions-pressure-grows,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump warned Vladimir Putin on Tuesday that he was “playing with fire,” taking a fresh jab at his Russian counterpart as Washington weighs new sanctions against Moscow over the Ukraine war.
Trump´s latest broadside showed his frustration with stalled ceasefire talks and comes two days after he called the Kremlin leader “absolutely CRAZY” following a major drone attack on Ukraine.
Moscow, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, insisted it was responding to escalating Ukrainian strikes on its own civilians and accused Kyiv of trying to “disrupt” peace efforts. Diplomatic efforts to end the war have intensified in recent weeks but Putin has been accused of stalling peace talks.
“What Vladimir Putin doesn´t realize is that if it weren´t for me, lots of really bad things would have already happened to Russia, and I mean REALLY BAD. He´s playing with fire!” Trump said on his Truth Social network.
Trump did not specify the “really bad” things he said he had protected Russia from, or make any specific threats. But the Wall Street Journal and CNN both reported that the Republican was now considering fresh sanctions as early as this week.
Trump told reporters on Sunday he was “absolutely” weighing such a move. The White House said Trump was keeping “all options” open. “This war is Joe Biden´s fault, and President Trump has been clear he wants to see a negotiated peace deal. President Trump has also smartly kept all options on the table,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told AFP in a statement.
Biden, Trump´s Democratic predecessor, imposed sweeping sanctions after Russia´s invasion. Trump has so far avoided what he says could be “devastating” sanctions on Russian banks. But Trump´s recent rebukes mark a sharp change from his previous attitude towards Putin, whom he often speaks of with admiration. His frustration at his failure to end a war he said he could solve within 24 hours boiled over at the weekend after Russia´s drone barrage killed at least 13 people.

"US no longer recommends Covid shots for children, pregnant women",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315985-us-no-longer-recommends-covid-shots-for-children-pregnant-women,"WASHINGTON: The US will no longer recommend Covid-19 vaccines for children and healthy pregnant women, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr announced on Tuesday, calling it a “common sense” decision grounded in sound science.
The change follows last week´s announcement by Food and Drug Administration officials that they would limit approval of Covid shots -- a critical tool in ending the pandemic -- to adults aged 65 and older, as well as younger individuals with underlying health conditions.
Trump administration officials have framed the shift as bringing the US into closer alignment with countries like Britain, Germany and France where annual boosters are recommended only for the elderly and immunocompromised.
But it comes as Kennedy - who has long promoted misinformation about vaccines in general and the Covid shots in particular - pushes to overhaul federal public health policy. “I couldn´t be more pleased to announce that as of today, the Covid vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention) recommended immunization schedule,” he said in a video posted to X.
FDA officials also said vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct new clinical trials -- including comparisons against a saline placebo -- if they wish to retain approval for use in healthy people under 65.
These recent changes have drawn criticism. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist at Johns Hopkins University, told AFP last week that while the new approach matched that taken by other countries, “I do think, however, that the initial Covid-19 vaccine series should be part of routine childhood immunization.”
Paul Offit, a top vaccine expert at the Children´s Hospital of Philadelphia, warned the change could restrict access for people who still want boosters, particularly under the US´s privatised health care system, where insurers may decline coverage.
The reversal on pregnant women marks a major departure from previous CDC guidance. As of Tuesday morning, the agency´s website -- which had yet to reflect Kennedy´s announcement -- still stated that pregnant women are among people for whom it is “especially important” to receive the vaccine. “If you are pregnant or were recently pregnant, you are more likely to get very sick from Covid-19 compared to those who are not pregnant,” it says.

Huge explosion at China chemical plant kills five,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315986-huge-explosion-at-china-chemical-plant-kills-five,"BEIJING: An explosion at a chemical plant in eastern China on Tuesday killed at least five people, with six more still missing, state media said.
The blast occurred at the Youdao Chemical plant at around 12 pm (0400 GMT) in Gaomi, a town in Shandong province around 450-kms southeast of the capital Beijing, according to Xinhua news agency. Videos broadcast by the Beijing newspaper Xinjingbao showed a gigantic column of grey smoke rising into the sky, a fire in an industrial zone and shop windows apparently blown out by the explosion.
The disaster “left five people dead, six missing and 19 lightly injured”, Xinhua said citing local officials. Clips also showed debris strewn across a road, a car with a smashed windscreen, and dark orange flames devouring installations in the background.
Emergency services dispatched 55 vehicles and 232 first responders to the scene, the national Ministry of Emergency Management said in a statement. Youdao Chemical manufactures “low-toxicity” pesticides and employs around 300 people on a site of 47 hectares, according to the Chinese online media The Paper.
Industrial accidents occur regularly in China, where safety standards in its countless factories are sometimes not respected. In 2015, explosions at warehouses containing flammable chemicals in the port city of Tianjin killed over 170 people and injured 700 others.

King Charles expresses love for ‘strong and free’ Canada,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315987-king-charles-expresses-love-for-strong-and-free-canada,"OTTAWA: King Charles, speaking during a brief symbolic visit to show support for Canada at a time it has faced annexation threats from US President Donald Trump, on Tuesday expressed his love for the country, which he described as “strong and free.”
Charles, Canada’s head of state, is the first British monarch in almost 70 years to preside over the opening of the Canadian parliament. In a speech in the Senate, Charles referred to “the country that Canadians and I love so much” but did not mention Trump, who has imposed tariffs on Canadian exports and muses about turning Canada into the 51st US state.
“The True North is indeed strong and free,” Charles said, referring to Canada’s national anthem. The speech outlining the government’s plans was largely written by officials working for Prime Minister Mark Carney. But Charles was responsible for the comments about Canada.
“Every time I come to Canada ... a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream – and from there straight to my heart,” said the monarch, accompanied by his wife Queen Camilla. “Canada has continued to set an example to the world in her conduct and values, as a force for good.”
The 76-year-old king, who is undergoing cancer treatment, later left Canada after a visit that barely lasted 24 hours. Charles, who joked and laughed with Carney before the speech, wore the Order of Canada around his neck. Canada is one of 15 countries where he is monarch. He and Camilla were driven to the Senate in a horse-drawn carriage, escorted by 28 riders from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and cheered on by flag-waving onlookers.
