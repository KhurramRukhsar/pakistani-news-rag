What is bunker buster bomb?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323041-what-is-bunker-buster-bomb,"ISLAMABAD: The B-2 stealth bomber of the United States is presently the sole aircraft capable of deploying the GBU-57 bunker buster bombs, which are thought to be the only means of taking out the Fordow fuel enrichment facility in Tehran.
The Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant is a site considered vital to Iran’s nuclear efforts, located deep within a mountain near Tehran. The United States is the only country to possess these bunker buster bombs, which it delivers using B-2 bombers.
The term “bunker buster” generally refers to bombs made for obliterating targets situated far below the surface that standard bombs cannot reach. The GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator has a mass of approximately 30,000 pounds (13,600 kg) and contains a 2,700 kg (6,000-pound) warhead. This precision-guided weapon is constructed from durable steel and is designed to penetrate as deep as 200 feet (61 meters) underground before detonating. In contrast, the Israeli military operates GBU-28 laser-guided bombs, which can only penetrate around 20 feet of concrete.
The production cost for a GBU-57 bunker buster bomb worth roughly $3.5 million (around 970 million Pakistani rupees). Reports indicate that the total expenses related to the research and development of the GBU-57 program range between $400 million and $500 million. The B-2 Spirit, an American stealth bomber, can carry a pair of bunker buster bombs simultaneously. According to the US Air Force, it is possible to drop multiple bombs one after the other, either from the same aircraft or different ones, enabling each strike to penetrate further and enhance the overall effectiveness.
Iran’s Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant, positioned roughly 95 km (60 miles) southwest of Tehran, is embedded into a mountain’s side, reportedly up to 80-90 meters (260-300 feet) below ground, making it resilient against aerial attacks and bunker buster strikes. It is believed that construction of the Fordow facility started around 2006, and it became operational in 2009, which is also the year Iran publicly acknowledged its existence.
The Fordow site is said to be protected by surface-to-air missile systems from Iran and Russia, though it has been suggested that those defenses may already have been targeted during ongoing Israeli airstrikes. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has portrayed the campaign as an effort to dismantle Iran’s missile and nuclear capacities, viewing them as a significant threat to existence. Officials have acknowledged that Fordow is a primary target.

US military arsenal in Middle East,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323042-us-military-arsenal-in-middle-east,"ISLAMABAD: From navy warships to nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, the United States is enhancing its military presence in the Middle East due to the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel.
Last week, the Pentagon directed two destroyer warships in the Mediterranean to get nearer to Israel. Reports indicate that the USS Sullivans Destroyer has also arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean this week, alongside the USS Thomas Hudner Destroyer, for continued defence operations, while the Arleigh Burke destroyer has exited the area, according to a US official. On Tuesday, the US transferred twelve F-16 fighter jets from a base in Italy to Prince Sultan in Saudi Arabia. Additionally, the US has been relocating fighter jets, such as F-35s and F-22 Raptors, to its military installations in the Middle East. The US Air Force sent an extra 21 refueling planes and fighter jets to key positions across Europe, including locations in England, Spain, Germany, and Greece. It remains uncertain if these US movements are directly related to the conflict; however, one expert indicated that the flights of tanker aircraft were “very unusual,” as reported by the BBC.
While the American destroyers are currently intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles aimed at Israel, the USS Carl Vinson nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is also stationed in the Arabian Sea, accompanied by four warships in its strike group.
Furthermore, the USS Nimitz nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is making its way west from the Indo-Pacific towards the Middle East. MarineTraffic, a ship-tracking platform, reported that the USS Nimitz’s last known position was in the Malacca Strait on its route to Singapore early Tuesday. Additionally, the USS Gerald R Ford — another nuclear-powered carrier — is also proceeding towards the European theater of operations within a week. The presence of this aircraft carrier, along with its supporting warships, will provide President Donald Trump with the option of deploying a third carrier group in the area if necessary, according to a western news agency.
These nuclear-powered aircraft carriers are equipped with several fighter jets and are supported by guided missile destroyers. Nimitz-class carriers are the largest vessels in the Navy, stretching nearly 1,100 feet from bow to stern.
Besides this, American destroyers are also located in the Red Sea, while others are stationed in the Western Mediterranean and taking part in exercises in the Baltic Sea. Last year, the US had deployed several Patriot air defense systems to the Middle East, including two transferred from the Indo-Pacific region. In October of last year, the US sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, along with about 100 troops, to Israel to assist in intercepting missiles launched by Iran and its proxies.
There are at least 19 sites in the Middle East where the US has established its military bases. Among them 11 are temporary US bases and eight of them are permanent US bases.
Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are the Middle Eastern countries where the USA has established their military bases. Among these countries Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Turkey and UAE are the ones where the USA has established its permanent military bases. As of mid-2025, there are about 40,000 to 50,000 US troops in the Middle East, comprising personnel stationed in both large, permanent bases and smaller forward sites across the region. The countries with the most US troops include Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. These installations serve as critical hubs for air and naval operations, regional logistics, intelligence gathering and force projection.

Bill binding gazetted officials to declare assets passed by Senate,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323043-bill-binding-gazetted-officials-to-declare-assets-passed-by-senate,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate passed the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill, 2025, during the budget session on Thursday, making it mandatory for civil servants from BPS-17 to BPS-22 to publicly declare their domestic and foreign assets, including those of immediate family members. These declarations will be uploaded on departmental websites to ensure transparency. Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar informed the House that the bill had already been passed by the National Assembly and was part of Pakistan’s commitment to international bodies like Transparency International and Amnesty International to curb corruption and improve governance.
The bill strengthens the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964 and aligns with the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will oversee the digital asset disclosure system, while the Establishment Division will conduct risk-based audits. The Senate also took up two amendments to the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) aimed at abolishing the death penalty for two controversial offences:
1. Section 354-A (Public stripping of women): The maximum punishment will now be life imprisonment with property forfeiture and fine, replacing the death penalty imposed in 1983 under General Ziaul Haq. The offence remains non-bailable, non-compoundable, and arrestable without a warrant.
2. Section 402-C (Harbouring hijackers): Now punishable by life imprisonment and fine, the death sentence clause has been removed. The law minister noted the disproportionate severity of the punishment and clarified that “intent to commit the crime” is crucial.
Opposition leader Shibli Faraz supported a broader review of criminal laws, which the law minister agreed should be handled by the relevant committee. Meanwhile, controversy erupted over the sudden presentation of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Bill, 2025, by PMLN Senator Khalil Tahir Sandhu. Opposition parties, particularly PTI, condemned its inclusion during a non-private members’ day amid budget proceedings. The proposed amendment seeks to cap spending in bar elections, limit candidacy to practicing lawyers, and maintain a 15-year experience requirement. The opposition alleged the bill was introduced with malicious intent to influence upcoming bar council elections, calling its procedure unprecedented and non-transparent. Despite the legislative activity, lawmakers on both sides stressed the need for greater budget allocations for education and health. The Senate will reconvene on Friday and is expected to be prorogued following passage of the budget recommendations.

5 bidders join race to buy PIA in revived privatisation push,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323044-5-bidders-join-race-to-buy-pia-in-revived-privatisation-push,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s second attempt to privatise its loss-making national carrier, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL), drew interest from eight potential buyers, with five parties submitting their Statements of Qualification (SOQs) by Thursday’s deadline, the Privatization Commission said.
The government had invited Expressions of Interest (EOIs) for the sale of 51 to 100 percent shares of PIACL along with management control. The latest push for privatization comes amid ongoing fiscal pressure and efforts to reform state-owned enterprises.
Among the five parties that submitted SOQs are a consortium led by Lucky Cement Limited, comprising Hub Power Holdings, Kohat Cement, and Metro Ventures; another consortium featuring Arif Habib Corporation, Fatima Fertilizer, The City School, and Lake City Holdings; Airblue Limited; Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited and a group involving Augment Securities, Serene Air, Bahria Foundation, Mega C&S Holding, and Equitas Capital LLC.
While eight groups initially expressed interest in acquiring the national airline, three — including the AKD Group, Habib Rafiq Engineering, and Sardar Ashraf D Baluch Private Limited — did not submit qualification documents by the final date.
The Privatization Commission will now review the SOQs based on predefined eligibility criteria. Shortlisted bidders will be granted access to a virtual data room for due diligence ahead of the bidding phase.

‘100% the same’: Pakistan’s unwavering support for Iran after Trump-Munir meeting,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323045-100pc-the-same-pakistan-s-unwavering-support-for-iran-after-trump-munir-meeting,"ISLAMABAD: Despite intense speculation following a high-profile luncheon meeting between Field Marshal Asim Munir and US President Donald Trump at the White House on Wednesday, Pakistan’s position in support of Iran amid its ongoing conflict with Israel remains “100 percent the same”, a well-placed source told this correspondent.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the source - who is privy to what was discussed in the White House meeting - emphasised Pakistan’s consistent stance. “We are the only one who are trying to do something for them [Iran],” he asserted, in response to two questions posed by this correspondent: whether Pakistan’s stance on the Iran-Israel conflict has changed after the Trump meeting with Field Marshal, and whether Pakistan will continue its support for Iran like before. His response was emphatic: “100 percent the same.” The Trump-Munir meeting, which concluded with generous praise from the US President for the Pakistani Field Marshal, sparked a wave of disappointment among certain quarters in Pakistan, particularly among PTI supporters. The development has not only rattled New Delhi, but also infuriated PTI’s online base, many of whom took to social media to attack both Trump and the Pakistani military leadership. A PTI leader, who has been close to the party founder and is currently absconding, was among those leading the charge to float conspiracy theories suggesting that Pakistan’s policy on the Iran-Israel front may be shifting under US pressure. However, such speculations were laid to rest on Thursday when Pakistan’s Foreign Office unequivocally reiterated the country’s longstanding position.
According to a report by APP, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan condemned what he described as “unjustified and illegitimate aggression” by Israel against Iran. He urged the international community and the United Nations to act decisively to stop Israeli military actions and hold it accountable for its violations of international law.
Khan further affirmed that Pakistan “stood in resolute solidarity with the people of Iran” and strongly denounced Israel’s “blatant provocations”, warning that these actions pose a serious threat to peace and stability in the region and beyond.
The reaffirmation from the Foreign Office serves as a direct rebuttal to those casting doubts over Pakistan’s foreign policy direction. Despite the geopolitical tremors generated by the Trump-Munir meeting, Islamabad appears steadfast in its regional commitments, particularly its support for Iran in the face of Israeli attack.

"Pakistan eyes EV boom, funds subsidies through new car levies",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323046-pakistan-eyes-ev-boom-funds-subsidies-through-new-car-levies,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan plans to ramp up electric vehicle (EV) production to 2.2 million units over the next five years — mostly electric motorcycles — as part of its global climate commitments. But to fund these ambitious subsidies, the government is turning to new levies on conventional car buyers, a move that took lawmakers by surprise on Wednesday.
The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance learned during its session that a tiered levy structure will be introduced: 1 percent on the buyer of new vehicles up to 1300cc, 2 percent for 1301–1800cc, and 3 percent for cars above 1800cc. Committee members were stunned to hear these levies were not included in the official Finance Bill 2025-26.
“The levy detail is missing from the bill,” observed Committee Chairman Naveed Qamar. A law ministry official responded that it was “an omission.”
The committee also approved the government’s proposal to impose a 10 percent sales tax on solar equipment, in a policy reversal that committee Chairman Naveed Qamar says originated from the National Assembly, not the Senate. “It was our recommendation, not the Senate,” Qamar clarified, despite earlier efforts to shield renewable energy from taxation.
FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial said the sales tax would only be implemented once approved by parliament. He added that efforts are also underway to expand the sales tax net — non-registered individuals will be forced to register or risk having their bank accounts frozen. “A non-registered person will not be able to operate a bank account,” he warned. Once registered, the account will be restored within 48 hours.
Langrial said the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) would identify non-registered businesses using data such as electricity consumption and income tax filings, starting with industrial units, especially in Karachi.
In a parallel effort to rein in mounting power sector circular debt, the Power Division said that Rs1.275 trillion is being borrowed from commercial banks at 0.9 percent below the 3-month KIBOR. The funds will be used to retire liabilities of IPPs and the Power Holding Company over six years and Rs683 billion will immediately cover PHC dues, with Rs323 billion repaid annually. This debt retirement and financing will be met through Rs3.23/unit Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) from consumers in their bills — exempting lifeline electricity consumers. “This is an IMF condition, and we must fulfill it,” said the power secretary.
Additionally, officials from the Petroleum Division said a carbon levy of Rs2.5/litre on petroleum products will be starting July 1, doubling to Rs5 next year. The levy will extend to furnace oil, which continues to be used in Independent Power Producers’ plants despite being phased out from public facilities. The petroleum levy currently stands at Rs77/litre on petrol and Rs78/litre on diesel, and the government plans to raise the cap to Rs90/litre.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, addressing the committee, firmly stated that “the era of tax exemptions and amnesties is over.” He emphasized the need to bring more people into the tax net, stressing enforcement over leniency. “We must now ensure compliance, not continue offering carrots,” he concluded.

"Trump, Field Marshal Asim Munir stress resolution of Iran-Israel conflict: ISPR",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323047-trump-field-marshal-asim-munir-stress-resolution-of-iran-israel-conflict-ispr,"RAWALPINDI: In a rare high-level meeting, United States President Donald Trump and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir exchanged views in detail on the prevailing tensions between Iran and Israel, with both leaders emphasizing the importance of resolution of the conflict.
Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency and emerging technologies, says an Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) statement.
President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests.
The development came as the two leaders met over lunch at the White House Cabinet Room on Wednesday with the US president being accompanied by Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and US Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs Steve Witkoff, whereas Field Marshal Munir was joined by Pakistan’s national security adviser.
During the meeting, the COAS conveyed the deep appreciation of the Government and people of Pakistan for President Trump’s constructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis. He acknowledged President Trump’s statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community. President Trump, in turn, lauded Pakistan’s ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counter-terrorism cooperation between the two states. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counter-terrorism.
President Trump commended Field Marshal Asim Munir’s leadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics.
In a gesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir extended an invitation to President Trump, on behalf of the Government of Pakistan, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date.
Although, initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue.
The engagement marks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity, concluded the ISPR statement.
In another statement, the ISPR said that Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir met with Ms Saima Saleem, part of Pakistan’s representative mission to the United Nations. The COAS held a warm and inspiring meeting with Saima Saleem, who despite being visually impaired, has made a remarkable mark in international diplomacy through her resolve and dedication. He lauded her exceptional talent, unwavering dedication and outstanding contributions to promoting Pakistan’s interests at the UN.
The COAS expressed admiration for Saima Saleem’s resilience and determination, which serve as a shining example for the nation, particularly for individuals with disabilities. He reaffirmed the Pakistan Army’s commitment to supporting and empowering individuals with disabilities, enabling them to contribute to national development.
Saima Saleem briefed the COAS on her work at the UN, highlighting key issues and challenges facing Pakistan. The COAS appreciated her efforts in promoting Pakistan’s stance on regional and global issues including threat of state-sponsored terrorism by India which is the root cause of destabilisation in the region. The meeting is a testament to the recognition of unmatched potential of Pakistanis exceptional talent and dedication, regardless of physical ability.
Saima Saleem also shared her literary work with the COAS.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif Thursday termed the meeting between US President Donald Trump and Field Martial Asim Munir a milestone in the Pak-US relations.
“There is no precedent before of US president’s invitation to the Pakistan Army chief and a meeting between two such leaders. This is the most important turn in the 78 years history of relations,” he posted on X.
Asif pointed out that the way international and regional issues came under discussion reflected Pakistan’s importance. “Pakistan’s importance to help resolve issues has been highlighted and accepted,” the minister said, adding that the meeting also highlighted Pak-India disputes.
Asif further observed that it was also success of hybrid model of rule. “This reflects restoration of economy, defeat of India, and further improvement in relations with the United States with dignity,” he said.
He further mentioned that all such revolutionary changes were made possible due to the exemplary cooperation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir and best relations between Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“May Almighty Allah enable us to serve the nation while living above all personal and party interests,” he said.
Meanwhile, talking to reporters outside the Parliament House, Asif hailed the meeting between Field Marshal Asim Munir and US President Donald Trump as a significant diplomatic success.
The minister highlighted that this was the first time an army chief had been invited to lunch, underscoring the importance of the meeting. Asif emphasized that discussions on international and regional issues showcased Pakistan’s potential for resolving key problems, particularly in the context of Pak-India tensions.

Senate panel opposes Rs2.5 per litre carbon levy on fuel,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323048-senate-panel-opposes-rs2-5-litre-carbon-levy-on-fuel,"ISLAMABAD: The FBR on Thursday informed the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue that the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax on International Platforms was proposed in the Finance Bill 2025-26, following the pattern of India, as New Delhi imposes digital tax on goods and services supplied digitally as an Equalization Levy.
Foreign vendors providing e-commerce goods or services will be taxed at a rate of 5 percent for income tax under the proposed Finance Bill. Chairman FBR stated that the tax has been imposed on digital platforms providing services without retaining physical footprint. The committee granted its clearance for the proposed tax. However, the Senate panel opposed the imposition of Rs2.5 per litre carbon Levy on petrol, diesel, and furnace oil in the budget. The meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue was presided over by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla. The Senate panel finalized its recommendations and now an internal meeting of the panel is scheduled to be held on Friday (today) to finalize its report for tabling before the Upper House of parliament for seeking approval and forwarding to the National Assembly next week. Chairman FBR Rashid Mahmood Langrial opposed the special treatment for the banking
sector under the Seventh Schedule of the Income Tax Ordinance and recommended that it should be abolished in totality. Why special treatment for the banking sector, he questioned, and added that these banks should be treated like other companies. This triggered a heated debate during the Senate Standing Committee on Finance meeting. The FBR has proposed in the Finance Bill 2025-26 that banks can only claim provisions for non-performing loans as expenses if they are classified as “loss” under the State Bank’s Prudential Regulations. “Why the banks be given totally different tax treatment as compared to other registered companies,” the FBR chairman questioned. Tax laws cannot be dictated to the government by any particular sector, he added. The panel chairman recommended deletion of Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Act keeping in view government policy for not granting or extending tax exemptions. The committee was also briefed on the exemptions provided to businesses located in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the newly merged districts. It was informed that the exemptions for cinema operators have been limited till 2030. However, the FBR has extended the facility till 2026. Discussing the power sector’s initiative for payment of circular debt through refinancing, NEPRA officials stated that, as of now, Rs3.23 per unit is being charged to consumers. However, NEPRA proposed removal of 10pc cap limit, as it would help in obtaining necessary refinancing needed for the payment of circular debt.

How Field Marshal’s meeting with Trump was arranged,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323049-how-field-marshal-s-meeting-with-trump-was-arranged,"LONDON: US President Donald Trump’s luncheon meeting with Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the White House, followed by a visit to the Oval Office, has caused an earthquake both inside and outside of Pakistan for its timing, significance and the intensity for several reasons.
Field Marshal Asim Munir’s meeting with Donald Trump and his entire cabinet, scheduled for an hour bust lasting over two hours, is seen as extraordinary, historic and rare.
Several individuals worked behind the scenes to organise this meeting, boosting relations between the two important countries – with a huge impact on the region, global significance and Pakistan’s internal politics with regards to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) at home and abroad. This correspondent spoke to three credible sources who are familiar with the background developments.
The work on the meeting started nearly 3 weeks ago when a senior intelligence Major General rank officer arrived in Washington and held meetings with senior and important officials in the Trump administration, a source confirmed. The grounds for meetings were set with the Major General’s meetings but the actual meeting would not have been possible without the decisive intervention of Steve Witkoff, President Trump’s US Middle East Envoy and his staunch ally, who was present during the Field Marshal’s meeting with President Trump. Others in the exclusive meeting were Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio and Pakistan’s National Security Advisor General Asim Malik.
Knowledgeable sources said that US Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff was requested for the meeting by a credible Middle Eastern-based Pakistani businessman who has closer ties to Witkoff as well as with Middle Eastern royal families. There were several back and forth calls and presentations before the meeting between the two powerful figures was finalised, said the source who had shared in advance with this reporter that the meeting would happen. This was at least 36 hours before the meeting was announced on Wednesday.
The Pakistani army intelligence officer took several trips to Washington DC where he met the US officials and members of Pakistani diaspora considered close to the Trump administration. The purpose of these meetings was not just the Field Marsha’s visit but also to deal with the campaigns run by supporters of former PM Imran Khan with help from a group of US Senators.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was in UAE before travelling to the US on invitation of the Centcom. According to the previous schedule he was to attend meetings with the Centcom and Pentagon officials but the whole programme was rescheduled just a few hours before General Asim Munir landed in Washington and met President Trump on the third day of his visit in an unprecedented display of backdoor diplomacy.
The US-Pakistan closeness didn’t happen overnight. The relations were full of awkward anticipation and the fear of the unknown only a few months before Donlad Trump was elected with a thumping win. There were fears that he would call for the release of Imran Khan and may go an extra mile intervening in Pakistan affairs but the opposite happened – to the pleasure of the powers that be in Pakistan.
On January 15, 2025, this correspondent had reported exclusively that a Texas hedge fund manager and a business partner of the Trump family has praised Pakistan’s sacrifices in the war against terrorism, advising President-elect Donald Trump to make Pakistan-American relations stronger than before.
Two weeks later, he was in Islamabad meeting Pakistani leaders including Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and said that President Donald Trump’s aide Richard Grenell “may have been misled” over his support for the release of PTI founder chairman Imran Khan’s campaign by a lobby working in the United States.
This was followed by close meetings between the officials and informal lobbyists of the two countries, bringing them closer over the crypto currency as well as the rare minerals in Pakistan and the wider trade cooperation.
The next clear sign of growing ties came when India attacked Pakistan and President Trump clearly stayed neutral and called on both countries to step back, winning praise from millions of Pakistanis and getting attacked by PM Modi’s govt and his support base.
The source said that COAS Asim Munir and Trump’s teams discussed forging a strategic alliance around minerals, crypto partnership, oil and gas exploration, mining opportunities, data centres, bitcoin mining, real estate development and exports improvements for Pakistan.
He said: “Pakistan has revamped its Foreign policy. It’s a new era for Pakistan. This is new economic diplomacy. The relations are geared towards economic cooperation with each other.”
The meeting is seen as an unprecedented development as no previous Chief of Army Staff in Pakistan’s history has ever held a meeting of this magnitude with a sitting US President at the White House. This historic engagement marks a defining moment in the history of Pakistan–U.S. relations and reflects a new level of recognition of Pakistan’s military leadership on the global stage.
Previously, General Pervez Musharraf met US Presidents during his tenure but as President of Pakistan, not as Army Chief; General Raheel Sharif (2015) and General Qamar Javed Bajwa (2022) visited Washington for defense-focused engagements but did not meet with the US President at the White House, nor in the presence of the full Cabinet, and certainly not in a solo diplomatic capacity.
Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir is the first military leader in Pakistan’s history to meet the US President at the White House in this capacity. No civilian government delegation accompanied him, making this a uniquely solo military-level engagement. The engagement included a formal lunch with President Trump and meetings with members of the US Cabinet, reflecting the seriousness of the dialogue and the depth of bilateral strategic alignment. While previous Pakistan Army Chiefs have visited Washington for military-to-military engagements, none have ever held such a high-level political meeting at the White House, particularly without a parallel civilian government presence.
At the Cabinet Room meeting, Trump showered praise on Field Marshal Asim Munir and called him a visionary leader and a friend, said the source. Trump thanked Asim Munir for helping the US and allies counterterrorism.
After the meeting, Trump said he was honoured to meet Asim Munir and that they had discussed Iran, which he said Pakistan knew better than most. Trump told reporters he had thanked Asim Munir for ending the war with India, for which he also praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“Two very smart people decided not to keep going with that war; that could have been a nuclear war,” Trump told reporters.

"Fazl urges govt to stand with Gaza, Iran",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323050-fazl-urges-govt-to-stand-with-gaza-iran,"ISLAMABAD: JUIF chief Fazlur Rehman Thursday emphasized that Pakistan should openly stand with the people of Gaza and Iran.
He was talking to the media after attending the budget debate in the National Assembly.
When asked by the media about the meeting between US President Trump and Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “As a political worker, I can say that America desired a ceasefire between Pakistan and India and now it might have emphasized a ceasefire between Iran and Israel but it would never call an end to attacks in Gaza.”
Speaking in the National Assembly, he categorically rejected the budget saying the public had not termed it good. He said how he could be expected to praise the budget document when it had drawn criticism from every section of the society.
He pointed out that Pakistan even saw times when its GDP growth went negative.
He also asked whether the establishment was limited to its responsibilities and not controlling politics and parliament. Unfortunately, lawlessness and terrorism are being used as a political tool, he said.
Fazl charged that the government was getting anti-Shariah bills passed by parliament at the behest of liberal elite of the society and NGOs. He also invited supporters and movers of such legislation for a debate.
He said that the federal budget was prepared by the IMF and not by the Government of Pakistan. He urged the government to stop victimizing the political opponents.
Malik Aamir Dogar of PTI reiterated his party’s demand for the release of PTI founder Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Shah Mehmood Qureshi and party’s other leaders. He also demanded the creation of South Punjab as a separate province and operationalizing its secretariat. Aamir Dogar also asked the government to fix the minimum wage at Rs50,000 per month. Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, while giving the floor to Aamir Dogar, said the opposition members had already been given excess time of five hours during the budget debate.
According to him, the prime minister and foreign minister had not given any categorical statement against the attack on Iran.
Meanwhile, Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq met with Fazl at the Parliament House. During the meeting, a detailed discussion was held on the overall political situation of the country, federal budget for next fiscal year and the emerging regional scenario in the light of Iran-Israel conflict, the National Assembly Secretariat in a statement said.
Governor Balochistan Jaffar Khan Mandokhail was also present during the meeting.
Fazl expressed deep concern over the Iran-Israel war, stating that in the current situation, the entire Muslim Ummah must demonstrate unity, solidarity, and foresight to ensure that efforts for peace in the region are not undermined. He emphasized that Pakistan should further intensify its diplomatic efforts to play a reconciliatory role in the Muslim world.
Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said, “Pakistan has openly condemned Israeli aggression and reiterated its friendship and solidarity with Iran. We have effectively presented our stance on Palestine and Iran at all international forums, and the parliament stands in complete support of this position,” he said.
He further said all political parties must speak with one voice in the national interest to strengthen Pakistan’s foreign policy on the global stage. The meeting also included discussions on the Federal Budget 2025-26.

"Aseefa calls budget IMF-centric, stresses people-first economic vision",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323051-aseefa-calls-budget-imf-centric-stresses-people-first-economic-vision,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Aseefa Bhutto Zardari on Thursday criticised the federal budget for being another “document of missed opportunities” aimed at pleasing the IMF, rather than addressing the genuine needs of the Pakistani people.
“I urge this House: do not let this budget ignore the soul of our people,” she said during the National Assembly’s budget debate, calling for a people-centric, pro-federation, and pro-women financial document.
She argued that budgets are not just financial tools but political statements that reveal the government’s priorities. “Economic growth means little if it doesn’t raise the dignity of the people. GDP and forex reserves don’t matter if millions remain hungry and out of school,” she added. Aseefa lamented that austerity is imposed on the poor, while the elite continues to enjoy luxuries. She called for increased investment in education and health, stressing that education is not a privilege but a human right, and must be treated as a national emergency.
While welcoming the 21pc increase in Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) allocations, she recommended linking the programme to female literacy and health insurance, arguing that no economic plan could succeed without women’s inclusion in policymaking and leadership. Her critique was accompanied by a personal grievance — Aseefa said her own constituency is suffering from 15-hour-long daily power outages.
Also addressing the House, Federal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal underscored the urgent need for a national policy on population control, aiming to bring down the birth rate from 3.5pc to 2pc by 2030. He said 68pc of diseases are waterborne, pointing to cancer and malnutrition as direct consequences of unsafe drinking water, and called for installing water treatment plants nationwide. Kamal noted that Pakistan ranks among the highest globally for Hepatitis C and raised alarm over the poor state of public hospitals.
Saad Waseem Sheikh, Parliamentary Secretary for Finance and Revenue, praised the government’s economic team for presenting a balanced budget, citing improved macroeconomic indicators. He urged for greater youth-focused allocations and recommended removing the GST on solar panels, especially for the farming community. He described the PMLN’s legacy as reviving the economy and restoring public trust in economic institutions, claiming the country is “on the right track toward a prosperous future.”
PMLN’s Naseer Abbas Sidhu supported the budget as a step toward economic reform and national sovereignty, highlighting the government’s efforts to curtail spending, reduce subsidies, and raise the tax-to-GDP ratio to 11pc.

SC can reverse any unconstitutional decision: Justice Amin,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323052-sc-can-reverse-any-unconstitutional-decision-justice-amin,"ISLAMABAD: Heading an 11-member bench, Justice Aminuddin Khan Thursday remarked that the Supreme Court was bound by the Constitution and could reverse any unconstitutional decision.
This observation from the apex court judge came during the hearing of review petitions filed by the ECP, PMLN and PPPP against the apex court’s July 12, 2024 judgment in the reserved seats case.
The court adjourned the hearing for today (Friday) rejecting the PTI counsel’s request to adjourn the proceedings until Monday.
Earlier, Salman Akram Raja told the court that he would highlight the points mentioned in the 2-judge and 8-judge rulings. Justice Mandokhail questioned which fundamental rights were affected in the case. While Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan asked if the court could fill a political vacuum and if a party made mistakes in its application, could the court correct them? Raja responded that the current situation was not created by the PTI, but obstacles were placed before them. “If a wall was torn down, the question should be who built the wall, not why it was torn down,” Raja told the bench.
Justice Amin responded that the court was giving full opportunity for hearing, but that didn’t mean the lawyer could say anything. “You built the wall by coming to the court under the banner of Sunni Ittehad Council,” Justice Aminuddin Khan told Raja. “Prepare for the next election,” Justice Naeem told Raja. Raja replied that if the current situation continued, the future elections will also be like this. At this, Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that the Supreme Court was bound by the Constitution, and if any decision was unconstitutional, the court could reverse it. “In my view, the majority decision in the reserved seats case on July 12, 2024 was not unconstitutional,” Raja replied. At the outset of hearing, Justice Jamal Mandokhail observed that in every era, some party benefits from the system, but it is the job of political parties — not of judges — to bring reforms, emphasizing that he still stood by his decision. Justice Amin asked Raja if his position was that the Election Commission acted unfairly. Salman Akram Raja replied that injustice was not just done against him but also against the public. Raja explained that he wanted to clarify why PTI’s name was not listed with 41 candidates, stating that the Punjab Election Commissioner had decided not to accept the PTI’s nomination papers. This prompted Justice Mandokhail to point out that the decisions on the nomination papers were made by Returning Officers (ROs), not the Election Commission. Raja argued that ROs were influenced to reject the papers, creating uncertainty.
Justice Mandokhail observed that serious political parties knew how to handle such situations. He also noted that during the main case, they kept asking as to where the PTI was to which Raja submitted that they came late but with the right stance. Justice Mandokhail, however, disagreed saying they not only came late but also did not follow the proper legal route, and only came to claim seats through the Sunni Ittehad Council. “The court had ensured full justice before the election, but the facts being presented in these review petitions were not presented at that time,” Justice Mandokhail remarked. Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and two other benches had ruled in favor of PTI in 99.9% of nomination cases. Raja, however, contended that the real stakeholder in this case were the people of Pakistan. Justice Amin remarked that the court should at least know under what jurisdiction it was operating. “This case was not just between the court and the parties but involved violation of democratic rights of the public. However, these points were not presented earlier,” he said. Justice Mussarat reiterated her complaint that she had asked about the vote not being treated as a fundamental right, but instead of a court response, an answer was posted on the social media from a fake ID.

Task to finalise increased gas sale price outsourced,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323053-task-to-finalise-increased-gas-sale-price-outsourced,"ISLAMABAD: In a rare development, the top authorities of the Petroleum Division have outsourced to KPMG, a reputable audit firm, to determine which domestic categories will face a hike in sale gas price from July 1, 2025.
“This is for the first time that the task of increasing the sale gas price has been given to KPMG. The audit firm would suggest to the government which domestic consumers should face an increase in the sale gas price,” a senior official of the Energy Ministry told The News.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on May 20, 2025 determined for Financial Year 2025-26 the hike in gas price for consumers of Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) the prescribed price of Rs1895.5 per MMBtu for gas consumers of all categories’ because of the increase in usage of RLNG. However, the regulator decreased the gas price for consumers of Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) by Rs103.95 per MMBtu to the prescribed Rs1,658.55 per MMBtu for all consumers.
Under the IMF diktat, the government has to enforce the hike in gas sale price for all consumers across the country ensuring zero shortfall of the Sui gas companies. Sui Northern is facing a shortfall of Rs40 billion, but Sui Southern is in surplus. The government needs to take the required decision for new sale gas price till June 28, 2024 as the said date is the deadline.
The KPMG would soon finalise its recommendation for the government for a hike in sale gas price. The decision would be approved first in ECC and then it will be rectified by the prime minister.
Right now, the cross-subsidy of Rs140 billion is being extended by industrial, commercial, captive power plants, bulk, CNG and high-end domestic consumers to the protected and first four slabs of unprotected gas consumers.

Trump’s reception for COAS Asim outrages India: report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323055-trump-s-reception-for-coas-asim-outrages-india-report,"India had hoped for a breakthrough at the G7 summit in Canada. Indian politicians and diplomats had spent much of the past month lobbying foreign governments to isolate Pakistan after its latest conflict with India, which ended on May 10th, reports Economist.
The report says America was a particular focus: Donald Trump had upset India by praising both sides, unilaterally claiming to have brokered a ceasefire and then offering to mediate in a dispute over Kashmir, despite Indian objections. Indian officials were also seeking a trade deal with America and hoped that a meeting in Calgary between Mr Trump and Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, would help on both fronts.
It did not go according to plan. Not only did Mr Trump leave the summit early, without meeting Mr Modi. Two days later, on June 18, America’s president hosted Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal Asim Munir, for lunch at the White House. Mr Trump and Mr Modi spoke by phone the day before, allowing India’s leader to assert that the recent conflict ended at Pakistan’s request and to reaffirm his objections to mediation on Kashmir. But Modi declined Trump’s invitation to “stop by” Washington on the way home. Field Marshal Munir’s preferential treatment is a setback for India. Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, India’s foreign minister, recently drew a direct link between what he called the field marshal’s “extreme religious outlook” and a terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22. And Modi has spent much of the past decade forging closer ties with America. The White House said it invited Field Marshal Asim Munir after he called for Mr Trump to be nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for ending the conflict with India. But they discussed Iran too. Pakistan has often offered Iran diplomatic support and has condemned Israel’s current attacks on it, so American officials could be anxious to gauge potential Pakistani responses should America become more directly involved. Pakistan’s foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, denied on June 16 that his country would carry out a nuclear strike on Israel if it attacked Iran with atomic weapons.
Recent Senate hearings suggested further reasons for Field Marshal Asim Munir’s visit. On June 10 the commander of America’s Central Command, General Michael Kurilla, described Pakistan as a “phenomenal” counter-terrorism partner. He told the Senate Armed Services Committee that Pakistani forces had targeted leaders of ISIS-Khorasan, an offshoot of the group that set up a “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria in 2014. On the same day S. Paul Kapur, the nominee to be the State Department’s top South Asia official, told another Senate hearing that his approach to Pakistan would be to “pursue security co-operation” while seeking trade and investment opportunities.
Why have India’s efforts fallen short? They appear to have relied too much on the relationship forged between Modi and Trump during his first term. Trump is now more transactional, unpredictable and dismissive of his own staff’s advice. Despite talk of warming relations, America has not spared India from its trade and immigration offensives. While American officials see India as a counterweight to China, they also want to prevent Pakistan moving deeper into China’s orbit. And Pakistan has sought to cultivate ties with Trump family members, partly by presenting itself as a cryptocurrency hub.
But India has been frustrated elsewhere too, notably in the European Union, which called for restraint from both sides during the conflict and continues to advocate direct talks between them, despite Jaishankar urging it to view Pakistan as “Terroristan”.
One problem is that India has yet to provide sufficient evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the April 22 attack. Some governments have also been unnerved by India’s vow to respond to any more such attacks with further military strikes on Pakistan. And Western officials are wary of jeopardising counter-terrorism co-operation with Pakistan.
The concern now for India is that it may struggle to win support to penalise Pakistan through international bodies. If so, India may focus more on unilateral actions. That could include an effort to renegotiate a 65-year-old river-sharing treaty. But it may also entail covert operations against militants inside Pakistan. And the next time a terrorist attack on India is linked to Pakistan, there will not be many Indian voices calling for peaceful, diplomatic counter-measures.

"Relieved Pakistanis recall ‘horrifying nights’ as Israel, Iran trade strikes",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323025-relieved-pakistanis-recall-horrifying-nights-as-israel-iran-trade-strikes,"TAFTAN: Mohammad Hassan anxiously returned to Pakistan from neighbouring Iran this week after witnessing drones, missiles, and explosions tear through Tehran´s sky during what he called long, “horrifying nights”.
The 35-year-old University of Tehran student is one of about 3,000 Pakistanis who, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have returned home since Israel launched its aerial war against its long-time enemy last week. Governments around the world are scrambling to evacuate their nationals caught up in the rapidly spiralling conflict as Israel and Iran trade missile and drone strikes. “I was in the city centre where most of the strikes took place and even one of the student dormitories was attacked and luckily no one was dead, but students were injured,” Hassan said.
There are more than 500 Pakistani students at his university alone, he said, all of them on their way “back home”. “Those days and nights were very horrifying... hearing sirens, the wailing, the danger of being hit by missiles. As one peeped out the window in the night, you could see drones, missiles with fire tails,” he told AFP. Pakistan and Iran have a shaky diplomatic relationship. They bombed each other´s territory little more than a year ago, both claiming to target rebels using their neighbour´s land to launch attacks. Yet they have never suspended trade, tourism and academic ties. Iranian consulates across Pakistan have stepped up efforts to promote their universities. Between 25 million and 35 million Pakistanis also hope to make at least one pilgrimage in their lifetime to holy sites in Iran, foremost among them the sacred city of Qom. Mohammad Khalil, a 41-year-old petroleum engineer, left Tehran three days ago, the capital of the Islamic Republic looking like a ghost town as residents sheltered indoors and families fled. “In the last two days, I saw people moving out of the city in different vehicles with necessary commodities,” Khalil said.
Abdul Ghani Khan sells medical equipment in his hometown of Peshawar in northwest Pakistan and travels to Iran regularly for supplies. He had been in Tehran for a week when the first Israeli missiles fell on Friday. Iran and Israel have traded heavy missile fire in the days since, raising fears of a wider regional conflict. Pakistan is in a difficult position as the only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons. It, like Iran, does not recognise Israel but is also a major ally of the United States. Khan had to make the journey home by road because the airspace is now closed. Pakistan has also shut its border crossings with Iran to all except Pakistanis wanting to return home. “We saw drones, red lights of anti-aircraft guns and I spotted one building catch fire,” Khan said. Mohammad Asif, a lawyer from Lahore in Pakistan´s east, heard about the air strikes while on a pilgrimage in Qom. He wasn’t initially afraid and continued his pilgrimage to Mashhad in Iran´s northeast, home to the golden-domed Imam Reza shrine.
That was until Israeli strikes hit the airport in Mashhad, nearly 1,000 kilometres from the Pakistani border. Samreen Ali was also in Mashhad but, like Asif, cut her trip short and returned with her husband and 15-year-old son. She was praying in a mosque in Mashhad when Israel struck the city. Ali said she had visited Iran nine times before on pilgrimages and never imagined witnessing war there. “I was offering prayer when I heard two explosions,” she told AFP. She then noticed she wasn´t receiving messages on her phone and assumed that “communication was being restricted... because of the war”. Syed Saqib, 46, was in Qom and had to travel 500 kilometres by bus southeast to Yazd. “We had to take alternative routes, spend an entire night waiting at a bus terminal,” Saqib said. They then boarded buses to Zahedan, a city near the border with Balochistan. A relieved Saqib recalled making the border crossing at Taftan, surrounded by families carrying heavy luggage.

"PTI urges OIC, global community to counter Israel-India nexus",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323026-pti-urges-oic-global-community-to-counter-israel-india-nexus,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram Thursday stressed the need for the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and other peace-loving nations to play their proactive role in breaking Israel-India nexus.
“Nations such as China may play a more assertive and proactive role in breaking the evil nexus and countering the dangerous alliance between the supremacist Indian regime and the Zionist Israeli government,” he stated in a statement issued here.
He warned that these notorious states posed a persistent threat to the global peace and stability, and that they must be confronted collectively to ensure a secure and harmonious world order.
Waqas Akram alerted that the war-mongering and fascist regimes of India and Israel were aggressively pursuing expansionist and imperialist agendas by unleashing genocidal violence, showing little regard for humanity or adherence to international law.
He also stressed that the evil nexus was laid bare during the recent Indo-Pak war, when Israel openly and fully backed the Hindutva regime. However, he noted it were the Indian forces that bit the dust, as the Pakistan Army, especially the Air Force, inflicted a humiliating drubbing on them.
The PTI spokesman underlined that Pakistan, as the sole nuclear power in the Muslim world, should take the Parliament into confidence regarding its policy on the Israel-Iran conflict, and must play a leading role in uniting Muslim countries and engaging the international community to put an end to the unchecked, unprovoked and brutal Israeli aggression against Iran.
He urged the OIC to develop a unified and resolute strategy to rein in the unbridled, oppressive Israeli state, stressing that this was a “now or never” moment, where silence and an apologetic approach were no longer viable options.
Waqas recalled that India has been committing war crimes in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) for over 70 years, while the Zionist regime has been carrying out the massacre of helpless Palestinians for decades. Unfortunately, he added that neither the OIC nor the United Nations has taken any meaningful action to stop the bloodshed.
He lamented that the Muslim world’s silence and the UN’s inaction had only emboldened these terrorist states to intensify their activities in pursuit of their nefarious designs, without any fear of accountability or consequences.
However, the PTI spokesman stressed that Pakistan must urge OIC member states to set aside their trivial differences and build a broader consensus to confront the unbridled aggression of the belligerent Israeli state, which has been martyring Palestinians with impunity and has now launched an unprovoked attack on Iran.
Waqas said that the government must recognise the gravity of the situation, put its own house in order, and immediately end its ongoing policy of political vendetta and retribution.
He again demanded the immediate release of PTI founder chairman Imran Khan, along with other political prisoners who were unlawfully detained and languishing in jail under fabricated, baseless and politically-motivated charges.
Waqas blasted the regime, alleging the rulers have wrecked all state institutions and reduced them to powerless and dysfunctional entities by appointing compromised and blue-eyed individuals to top positions.

"President visits naval headquarters, lauds PN’s response to Indian aggression",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323027-president-visits-naval-headquarters-lauds-pn-s-response-to-indian-aggression,"ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Thursday visited the Naval Headquarters and lauded the Pakistan Navy’s resolute response, unwavering determination, and successful efforts in thwarting the hostile designs of Indian Navy.
Upon arrival, the president was received by Chief of the Naval Staff, Admiral Naveed Ashraf, and was presented a Guard of Honour by a smartly turned-out naval contingent.
The president also laid a floral wreath at the Shuhada Monument and was later introduced to the Principal Staff Officers at Naval Headquarters. President Asif Ali Zardari held a meeting with Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, where the naval chief apprised the president of matters pertaining to regional maritime security and operational readiness of Pakistan Navy.
Later, the president was given a detailed briefing on Pakistan Navy’s strategy to ensure impregnable deterrence demonstrated during Marka-e-Haq. The president expressed deep satisfaction over Pakistan Navy’s high level of operational preparedness and felicitated it on successfully defending the maritime frontiers of the motherland against Indian aggression.

ANF seizes Rs396m drugs across country,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323028-anf-seizes-rs396m-drugs-across-country,"LAHORE: In a fresh wave of anti-narcotics operations, the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) has carried out multiple successful raids across the country, seizing over 362 kilograms of illegal drugs and arresting three suspects involved in trafficking activities.
The seized contraband including ice, heroin, morphine and marijuana is estimated to be worth more than Rs396.7 million in the local market. The ANF launched coordinated actions in various cities targeting both international and domestic drug smuggling operations.
At the Islamabad International Airport, a passenger attempting to travel to Qatar was caught with 680 grams of ice concealed in his luggage. He was immediately arrested. At Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport, ANF officials intercepted a suspicious parcel intended for Bahrain and recovered 500 grams of crystal meth. In another operation, the agency tracked a courier parcel at a private office in Multan. Upon inspection, the package, which had arrived from Thailand and was to be delivered in Layyah was found to contain 7.002 kilograms of marijuana. In Lahore, near the BRB Canal, two motorcyclists were intercepted and found carrying two kilograms of ice.
In a significant bust in Loralai, Balochistan, ANF personnel discovered a massive haul of drugs hidden in a residential area near Dera Ghazi Khan Road. The cache included 148 kilograms of morphine and 204 kilograms of heroin, allegedly stored for future smuggling.
All the cases have been registered under the Control of Narcotic Substances (CNS) Act, and further investigations are ongoing to trace the networks behind these smuggling attempts. The ANF has reaffirmed its commitment to curbing drug trafficking and dismantling the organized crime networks that fuel the illegal narcotics trade.

KSrelief concludes series of eye treatment camps across Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323030-ksrelief-concludes-series-of-eye-treatment-camps-across-pakistan,"ISLAMABAD: The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre (KSrelief) has concluded series of eye treatment camps across Pakistan under “Noor Saudi Volunteer Initiative – 2025”.
According to the Saudi mission the KSrelief has successfully wrapped up a series of eleven comprehensive eye care camps conducted throughout Pakistan under the umbrella of the “Noor Saudi Volunteer Program 2025”.
In collaboration with Al-Basar International Foundation and Al-Ibrahim Eye Hospital in Karachi, this initiative aimed to bring essential ophthalmic services to underserved communities, especially those facing financial hardship or living in areas with limited access to specialized medical care.
Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmad Al-Malkiy has congratulated the organizers of the completion of the noble cause like their other activities. The eye camps were strategically organized across various regions, including urban and remote areas of Sindh, Balochistan, Punjab, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK).
Designed to proactively identify and treat preventable eye conditions, the outreach program focused on early diagnosis, surgical intervention, and vision restoration to improve health outcomes and quality of life.
During the implementation of the project, a total of 43,294 patients underwent eye examinations, with more than 4,484 surgeries carried out to address cataracts and other vision-impairing conditions.
Furthermore, 11,050 corrective eyeglasses were distributed, along with essential medications prescribed on-site by professional medical staff. The initiative had a meaningful impact across a wide geographic area, delivering sight-saving services to communities in Karachi, Matli, Kundairo, Shikarpur, Hyderabad, Naseerabad, Kharan, Khuzdar, Jhelum, and Rawalakot.
These locations were specifically chosen to maximize reach and benefit residents with little to no access to ophthalmologic care. This humanitarian project underscores the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s unwavering support for global health efforts and its ongoing commitment to combat preventable blindness.
By extending free, high-quality eye care to thousands of individuals, KSrelief continues to champion the cause of vision health and offer renewed hope to those most in need.

Larkana Division police rewarded for action against riverine dacoits,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323036-larkana-division-police-rewarded-for-action-against-riverine-dacoits,"KARACHI: An award and certificate distribution ceremony was held at the Saleem Wahidi Auditorium, Driving Licence Branch, Clifton, on Thursday to honour the Ghazi police officers and youths who took action against criminal gangs in the riverine areas of Larkana Division’s Kashmore and Shikarpur districts.
Sindh police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon, who was the special guest, handed over CC1 commendation certificates, basic salaries and cash prizes to 91 police officials.
“I believe if the number of those receiving the award today is 90, tomorrow it will reach 900,” said IG Memon. “I hope Larkana Division will always keep the Sindh police’s head held high, and will add more to their name and prestige.”
He said that under the leadership of Larkana Range DIG Nasir Aftab, SP Shahzeb Chachar in District Shikarpur and SP Zubair Nazir in District Kashmore showed exceptional performance against crime. “For that I’m grateful to them.”
He also said the award ceremony was due to the martyrs. “The Sindh police are known for their bravery. I’m also thankful to the Sindh government for taking special care of policemen through these events, and increasing the funds allocated for policemen and martyrs’ families.”
Memon said people’s protection is their first priority, and friendship with people is the second priority, but protecting people’s lives and properties is the Sindh police’s responsibility after Allah Almighty. “Reduction in kidnappings is the result of your hard work day and night, for which I congratulate you.”
DIG Aftab said on the occasion that over the past year, the Kashmore police engaged in 215 encounters with criminals, and the Shikarpur police engaged in 144 encounters.
He said notorious dacoits Noor Hasan Badani, Hakeem Tart Jatoi and Elahi Ahmed Gorani were killed in such encounters. The government had announced Rs5 million, Rs2 million and Rs1 million respectively for their arrest, he added.
He also said that seven suspects, including Sher Muhammad, the alleged murderer of journalist Jan Muhammad Mehr, were killed, and six were arrested.
Over the past year, 73 robbers were killed in police encounters and raids, 289 criminals were arrested and 344 weapons were recovered from their possession, he added. The officer said that 362 people were saved from being kidnapped through honey trap.
“I’m thankful to the IG for organising this event. I can assure you that this welcome, encouragement and appreciation will raise the morale of the youth, and they will work harder. The Larkana Division police are brave. They’re never afraid of any enemy, and will never be afraid.”

Homeland insecurity: Expelled Afghans seek swift return to Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323037-homeland-insecurity-expelled-afghans-seek-swift-return-to-pakistan,"PESHAWAR: Pakistan says it has expelled more than a million Afghans in the past two years, yet many have quickly attempted to return -- preferring to take their chances dodging the law than struggle for existence in a homeland some had never even seen before.
“Going back there would be sentencing my family to death,” said Hayatullah, a 46-year-old Afghan deported via the Torkham border crossing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in early 2024.
Since April and a renewed deportation drive, some 200,000 Afghans have spilled over the two main border crossings from Pakistan, entering on trucks loaded with hastily packed belongings.
But they carry little hope of starting over in the impoverished country, where girls are banned from school after primary level.
Hayatullah, a pseudonym, returned to Pakistan a month after being deported, travelling around 800 kilometres south to the Chaman border crossing in Balochistan, because for him, life in Afghanistan “had come to a standstill”.
He crossed the Chaman frontier, “like all the day labourers who regularly travel across the border to work on the other side”. His wife and three children -- including daughters, aged 16 and 18, who would be denied education in Afghanistan -- had managed to avoid arrest and deportation.
Hayatullah moved the family to Peshawar. “Compared to Islamabad, the police here don´t harass us as much,” he said. The only province governed by the opposition party of former prime minister Imran Khan -- who is now in prison and in open conflict with the federal government -- Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is considered a refuge of relative security for Afghans.
Samad Khan, a 38-year-old Afghan who also spoke using a pseudonym, also chose to relocate his family to Peshawar. Born in Lahore city, he set foot in Afghanistan for the first time on April 22 -- the day he was deported. “We have no relatives in Afghanistan, and there´s no sign of life. There´s no work, no income, and the Taliban are extremely strict,” he said.
At first, he tried to find work in a country where 85 percent of the population lives on less than one dollar a day, but after a few weeks he instead found a way back to Pakistan. “I paid Rs50,000 to an Afghan truck driver,” he said, using one of his Pakistani employees´ ID cards to cross the border.
He rushed back to Lahore to bundle his belongings and wife and two children -- who had been left behind -- into a vehicle, and moved to Peshawar. “I started a second-hand shoe business with the support of a friend. The police here don´t harass us like they do in Lahore, and the overall environment is much better,” he told AFP.
It’s hard to say how many Afghans have returned, as data is scarce.
Government sources claim that hundreds of thousands of Afghans are already back and settled in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -- figures that cannot be independently verified.
Migrant rights defenders in Pakistan say they´ve heard of such returns, but insist the numbers are limited. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) told AFP that “some Afghans who were returned have subsequently chosen to remigrate to Pakistan”.
“When individuals return to areas with limited access to basic services and livelihood opportunities, reintegration can be challenging,” said Avand Azeez Agha, communications officer for the UN agency in Kabul. They might move on again, he said, “as people seek sustainable opportunities”.

"‘Society, successive govts consistently overlook intellectual property rights’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322997-society-successive-govts-consistently-overlook-intellectual-property-rights,"Sindh Information Minister Sharjeel Memon on Thursday lamented that both society and successive governments have consistently overlooked the critical issue of intellectual property rights.
Memon was speaking as the chief guest during the opening ceremony of the Pakistan International Film Festival (PIFF) at the Karachi Film School, where he was warmly welcomed by PIFF President Sultana Siddiqui, the organisers, and prominent figures from the media and entertainment industry.
Films from several countries, including Pakistan, China and Germany, will be screened at the festival. An important dialogue on intellectual property rights in the film industry was also held.
The minister said that existing laws concerning intellectual property rights must be enforced more strictly. When the copyrights of creative works are not protected, they are easily stolen, which demoralises artistes and creators, he added.
He said intellectual property rights should be included in the curriculum to raise awareness among children and youth about the importance of protecting ideas and creative works. The Sindh government began efforts last year to support film-making, and film-makers are being encouraged to promote Pakistan’s national narrative across the globe, he added.
He also said that more than 100 films are being produced in India on the Pakistan-India war to reinforce a false narrative, but India can only win such wars in films, and not in reality.
The Indian media has consistently propagated false narratives in an aggressive manner, while Pakistanis need to promote the true narrative of their country across the world, he added. Sultana said the youth need to be trained in new technologies and the field of film-making so that they can fully express their creative talents.
She said the participation of key industry figures in the film society is encouraging, and through films, we can present our national narrative to the world. She also praised the Pakistani media for showing commendable restraint during the recent Pakistan-India tensions. PIFF Director Misbah Khalid said their goal is to provide opportunities to the youth. He appealed to the government to support their efforts.
Intellectual Property Organisation (IPO) of Pakistan Chairman Farukh Amil said Pakistan is a multicultural and multi-artistic country, and the PIFF is an excellent platform to showcase our cultural identity.
Amil emphasised that awareness about copyrights is crucial for those involved in the fine arts, and the IPO is working on amendments to the relevant laws in this regard. Referring to the Lal Shahbaz Qalandar festival, and the handicrafts showcased there, he said that such cultural heritage should also be granted copyright protection. With the rise of AI and digital technologies, the importance of ownership rights for artistic works has increased more than ever before, he added. AMI Music CEO Hameed Riaz said that although films and songs are being produced in Pakistan, insufficient attention is being given to copyrights, which is harming our artistes.

Health experts alarmed as Congo virus claims two lives in Karachi in as many days,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322998-health-experts-alarmed-as-congo-virus-claims-two-lives-in-karachi-in-as-many-days,"Two men have died of the deadly Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) in Karachi in the past 48 hours, raising alarm among health authorities and infectious disease specialists amid fears of post-Eid outbreak patterns linked to the cattle trade.
The latest victim, a 26-year-old resident of Ibrahim Hyderi, died on Wednesday at the Infectious Diseases Hospital Karachi. According to Dr Abdul Wahid Rajput, the patient was brought in from Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in a semi-conscious state with high-grade fever and symptoms of internal bleeding.
“He was bleeding from multiple sites and had all classic signs of CCHF. We did everything possible, but his condition rapidly deteriorated,” he said. This was the second death in as many days. A 42-year-old man from District Malir had earlier tested positive for Congo virus on June 16 and died the following day during treatment, making him the first confirmed fatality from the virus in Sindh this year.
Both cases have been reported in areas with high livestock interaction, fuelling concern among experts about zoonotic transmission linked to the Eidul Azha cattle movement. CCHF, a tick-borne viral disease commonly found in livestock, particularly cattle and goats, is often transmitted to humans through close contact with infected animals or their blood. With Karachi being a major hub for the sale and slaughter of sacrificial animals during Eid, medical professionals have repeatedly warned about the heightened risk of Congo virus cases during and after the festival.
“Infection rates tend to spike during Eidul Azha when people from urban settings, often unaware of proper animal handling protocols, come in contact with potentially infected livestock,” said Dr Rajput, cautioning that the situation could worsen without preventive steps. Last year, several cases of CCHF were also reported from across Balochistan and Sindh, prompting the World Health Organisation (WHO) and provincial health departments to issue precautionary guidelines. However, experts say limited public awareness, inadequate tick control measures, and a lack of personal protective gear for animal handlers remain major hurdles in curbing the spread.
Doctors have urged the public, especially those visiting or working in cattle markets, to wear gloves and protective clothing and immediately seek medical help if symptoms such as sudden fever, body aches or unexplained bleeding appear. Early diagnosis and isolation are critical, as CCHF has a high fatality rate and can also spread from human to human through contact with bodily fluids.

Three missing Hindu girls recovered from Karachi,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322999-three-missing-hindu-girls-recovered-from-karachi,"Three underage Hindu girls who had mysteriously gone missing from Shahdadpur recently have been recovered from Karachi.
Officials said on Thursday that Dr Lal Chand Ukrani, special assistant to the chief minister of Sindh on minority affairs, had taken serious notice of the incident and directed law enforcement agencies to ensure immediate recovery of the girls – -- Sheena, Jiya, and Diya.
Upon receiving reports of disappearance of the girls, Dr Ukrani had contacted the Sindh inspector general of police and ordered the formation of special teams for the swift recovery of the girls. Following his directive, the police successfully located and rescued the girls from Karachi.
Dr Ukrani stated that he had immediately informed the central president of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Ladies Wing, Faryal Talpur, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar about the situation.
In response, the top leadership of the PPP and the chief minister issued urgent orders to ensure the recovery of the missing girls. He added that the timely and safe recovery of the girls had been deeply appreciated by the minority community, who expressed heartfelt gratitude to the PPP leadership and the Sindh government for their tireless efforts and prompt actions.
Dr Ukrani emphasized that this incident is a serious violation of human rights and contributes to a growing sense of insecurity among minorities, something that is unacceptable in any civilized society. He reiterated that the PPP is committed to ensuring the protection of the life, property, and dignity of all minorities in Sindh and that their issues are being addressed on a priority basis.
He further asserted that this matter will not be overlooked and those found involved will face strict legal consequences. The special assistant also mentioned that the provincial government has already taken concrete steps for minority protection, including strengthening the Ministry of Minority Affairs and involving minority representatives in key decision-making processes.

"Woman, minor girl killed as dumper overturns onto SUV",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323000-woman-minor-girl-killed-as-dumper-overturns-onto-suv,"A tragic road accident on Rashid Minhas Road claimed the lives of a woman and a young girl early on Thursday morning when a speeding dumper loaded with gravel and sand overturned and crashed onto a double cabin vehicle.
Another woman and the vehicle’s driver were also injured in the incident. According to police, the accident occurred near the COD area within the jurisdiction of the Sharea Faisal police station.
The dumper lost control, mounted the footpath, and fell onto the passing double-cabin vehicle, crushing the vehicle under the weight of the dumper and its load. Following the accident, police, Rangers and volunteers from welfare organisations reached the scene. The road from the Millennium Mall toward Sharea Faisal was closed, leading to severe traffic congestion in the surrounding areas.
One woman was rescued in a critical condition and was first taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and later shifted to a private hospital on Stadium Road. Cranes and lifters were used to remove the dumper and debris, after which the bodies of a woman and a girl were recovered. The deceased were identified as 55-year-old Shaheena Naeem and seven-year-old Ayesha, daughter of Khurram. The injured woman was identified as 30-year-old Anum. All victims belonged to the same family and were residents of Scheme 33.
During the rescue operation, relatives of the victims clashed with media personnel and bystanders recording videos. One citizen was reportedly beaten and injured. Police confirmed that the dumper driver fled the scene.

JI demands compensation for fire-affected shopkeepers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323001-ji-demands-compensation-for-fire-affected-shopkeepers,"Karachi Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) emir Monem Zafar has visited shopkeepers affected by fires at Millennium Mall and Amir Electronics Market and demanded immediate compensation for them.
He demanded of the Pakistan Peoples Party government in Sindh and the KMC to provide the much needed help so the victims could restore their businesses. Owners of affected shops said the JI was only the party whose representative visited the site and met them. The JI leader expressed his grave concern over the Sindh government's “policy to give the cold shoulder” to the affected people.
He said some shopkeepers, including brave women, attempted to save some of their goods while staking their own lives, but the fire brigade and rescuers couldn't respond on time as usual.
Earlier, Electronic Market Association head Rizwan Irfan, traders leader Aslam Khan, Habib Patel and others briefed the JI leader about the blazes and the losses that resulted from them. Zafar assured the traders of full cooperation on part of the JI.

Murad urges public to follow noble path laid down by Sufi saints,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323003-murad-urges-public-to-follow-noble-path-laid-down-by-sufi-saints,"Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Thursday described Sufi saint Abdullah Shah Ghazi as a shining beacon of spirituality. He stressed that Sufi saints’ teachings promote humanity, brotherhood and service to others.
Talking to the media after visiting Abdullah Shah Ghazi’s shrine to participate in the closing rituals of the Sufi saint’s three-day Urs celebrations, Shah said: “The shrine offers every visitor respect, peace and blessings. The message of love and tolerance from the Sufi tradition continues to serve as a guiding light for society today.”
Earlier, he offered prayers, laid a ceremonial cloth (chador) and distributed clothes among the needy. The Sindh government ensured comprehensive arrangements for visitors’ comfort and convenience.
Auqaf Minister Riaz Hussain Shah Sheerazi briefed the CM on the management of and facilities provided during the event. Shah also appreciated the efforts made to preserve and promote the spiritual heritage of Sindh’s shrines.
He prayed for the nation’s security, progress and prosperity, and urged the public to follow the noble path laid down by Sufi saints. He also highlighted the importance of unity and tolerance in today’s world, reflecting the enduring legacy of Abdullah Shah Ghazi and other spiritual luminaries of Sindh.
Abdullah Shah Ghazi is a revered figure known for his bravery and dedication to Islam. He is also a descendant of Imam Hassan (RA). The event attracted thousands of devotees from across the region, marking a significant spiritual occasion in Sindh’s cultural calendar.
Responding to a question, the CM said: “The opposition’s job is to criticise, but I never take it personally. However, criticism should not be an excuse for rudeness or disrespectful behaviour. We must always maintain mutual respect.”
He said the opposition should also care about Sindh’s Sufis, as they represent our culture and traditions. “Their teachings promote brotherhood and love among us.” Replying to a query about India’s aggression, he said: “India launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, but within a few days India realised the consequences. When the entire nation stands behind their armed forces, oppressors inevitably face their fate. When everyone plays their part, success is certain. This spirit has guided us in protecting our country.”
He also said Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari presented Pakistan’s stance effectively before the international media, following which the government sent him to lead a diplomatic delegation. “Due to his diplomacy, the world’s perspective on Pakistan has changed, which is a matter of great pride for us.”
Talking about the meeting between Field Marshal Asim Munir and Donald Trump, the CM said that it has also yielded positive results, strengthening Pakistan’s foreign policy. He announced that Bilawal would arrive in Karachi, and would be accorded a grand welcome. “I urge all Pakistanis who love their country to come to the airport and greet him. Because of him the world’s viewpoint about Pakistan has truly transformed, and we’re proud of him.”

Man jailed for killing policeman while attempting to evade arrest,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323004-man-jailed-for-killing-policeman-while-attempting-to-evade-arrest,"A model court has awarded a collective sentence of 12 years in prison to an alleged drug peddler for killing a policeman in an attempt to flee arrest in 2021.
Shah Asad was found guilty of killing Constable Mir Muhammad by dragging him with his car in a bid to escape as police attempted to arrest him in the Defence Housing Authority. Additional Sessions Judge Abdul Hafeez Lashari of the Model Criminal Trial Court (South) observed that while the prosecution established that the act of Asad resulted in the death of the constable, certain mitigating circumstances arose from the overall evidence that deserved judicial consideration.
""The most significant mitigating aspect is the lack of direct intent to kill,"" he noted, adding that as per the prosecution witnesses, the accused reversed his vehicle in a rash and reckless manner in an attempt to flee the scene.
""There is no evidence or statement suggesting that the accused deliberately targeted the deceased or had any personal motive or pre-existing enmity with him. The CCTV footage further supports that PC Mir Muhammad was standing and talking on the phone and was not in active attempt to stop the accused from fleeing. This appears to be a consequence of reckless reversal, not a deliberate and aimed act of murder,"" the judge said.
The court sentenced the convict to eight-year imprisonment and ordered him to pay diyat of Rs8.1 million to the legal heirs of the deceased constable for the offence punishable under the Section 320 (qatl-i-khata by rash or negligent driving) of the Pakistan Penal Code
It awarded two-year imprisonment to the accused for offence punishable under the Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the PPC and another two years imprisonment for offence punishable under the Section 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees).
He was also ordered to pay a fine of Rs100,000 or undergo additional imprisonment. The high court, however, acquitted the accused in a separate case pertaining to the recovery of ice.   According to State Prosecutor Shakeel Ahmed Abbasi, on January 18, 2021, the Gizri police arrested Nawaz after 150 grammes of ice was recovered from his possession. He said that during interrogation, the accused confessed to the crime and expressed willingness to help police arrest alleged drug supplier, Asad.
Subsequently, a police team accompanied the accused to Touheed Commercial Street No. 26, in DHA, where he called his supplier to meet him, the prosecutor said, adding that the alleged drug peddler arrived in a car, but upon seeing the police, attempted to flee by reversing at high speed in a reckless and negligent manner. He struck Constable Mir Muhammad and dragged him for some distance, causing serious injuries to him.
Abbasi said that the suspect's car was also severely damaged, due to which he tried to escape on foot but was apprehended by the police. The constable succumbed to his injuries while being transported to hospital.
The police recovered 200 grammes of crystal meth (commonly known as ice) from the suspect’s vehicle, the prosecutor added. The defence counsel said that the accused was innocent and had falsely been implicated in the case by the police.

"SHC grants bail to businessman, guard in DHA assault case",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323007-shc-grants-bail-to-businessman-guard-in-dha-assault-case,"The Sindh High Court on Thursday granted bail to a businessman and his guard in the DHA assault case, observing that the trial court would be competent to cancel their bail if they misused the concession.
Mohammad Salman Farooqui and Awais Hashmi were arrested for beating and threatening a motorcyclist, Dheeraj, in the presence of his sister in the DHA area when his motorcycle hit the vehicle of Farooqui.
According to the prosecution, eyewitnesses’ account and a viral video show that Farooqui and his guard beat up and threatened the motorcyclist after a minor collision between Farooqui’s Land Cruiser and the motorcycle while holding him at gunpoint.
The video shows that the victim’s sister requested the attackers not to beat his brother but the assailants continued the assault and pushed her away. The complainant, Muhammad Saleem, who witnessed the incident on May 31 near Ittehad Commercial, said that the victim was illegally confined inside the vehicle, abused, and threatened. He filed the report as a concerned citizen and urged authorities to take legal action.
The complainant however filed a statement in the court, stating that he would have no objection if the applicants were granted bail. The victim also filed his statement submitting that the instant FIR was lodged without his consent and an affidavit of no objection certificate was also filed by him with his own free will without any pressure, coercion or threats.
A single bench headed by Justice Arshad Hussain Khan, after perusal of the statements of the complainant, victim and no objection affidavit, observed that the case of applicants calls for further inquiry under the CrPC.
The court further observed that the record shows that applicants are not previous convicts or hardened criminals; besides, they had been behind bars since their arrest and were no more required for any investigation.
The high court observed that the prosecution has not claimed any exceptional circumstances which could justify keeping them behind bars for an indefinite period pending determination of their guilt.
The court taking in view of the affidavits and statements filed by complainant and the victim granted bail to the applicants for a surety of Rs100,000 each. It however made it clear that any observation in the order shall be tentative in nature and shall not affect the determination of the facts at the trial or influence the trial court in reaching its decision on merits of the case.
The high court also made it clear that if, during the proceedings, the applicants misuse the bail, the trial court would be competent to cancel their bail without making any reference to the court.
The additional district and sessions court (South) had earlier dismissed the bail of the applicants, observing that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the applicants/accused would influence the investigation and possibly tamper with evidence because the influence and power of the main accused presented a real and not a speculative threat to the course of justice.

"Sindh completes 1,450 development schemes, opposes federal tax on solar systems",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323008-sindh-completes-1-450-development-schemes-opposes-federal-tax-on-solar-systems,"Sindh Minister for Energy, Development, and Planning, Syed Nasir Hussain Shah has announced that Sindh is the only province in Pakistan to has successfully completed 1,450 development schemes.
Addressing a press conference on Thursday, Shah strongly criticised the federal government for failing to allocate any major development projects for Karachi since 2013. He emphasised the city’s vital role in the national economy and said its problems are consistently neglected. “Karachi makes a major contribution to the national economy, yet its problems are often ignored while people only shed crocodile tears,” he remarked, noting that thousands of people continue to migrate to the city every day.
He credited former president Asif Ali Zardari for significant contributions to Karachi's development, citing even former mayor Mustafa Kamal’s acknowledgment of Zardari’s efforts as now being a part of the city's documented history.
Reaffirming the Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) commitment to inclusive governance, Shah said the party was working to serve the people of Sindh without discrimination, following the vision of Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. He further highlighted the support of Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, under whom several mega development projects had been added to the next fiscal year’s budget.
Speaking about the PPP’s performance, Shah claimed that the party’s governance model had increased its popularity, predicting that the public would vote exclusively for PPP in the 2029 general elections.
Shifting focus to energy issues, Shah voiced strong opposition to the proposed federal tax on solar systems, calling for it to be reduced to zero. “This tax must be brought down to zero percent,” he asserted. He also criticised the inefficiencies of K-Electric and condemned unannounced load-shedding by HESCO and SEPCO. According to Shah, overbilling and average billing had become routine practices by these power companies, exacerbating the public’s hardship. He assured that the Sindh government was taking all necessary steps to protect citizens from excessive billing, power outages, and energy mismanagement.

The government also confirmed the completion of phase one of the Chief Minister’s Youth Internship Programme, which benefitted 6,000 interns with a monthly stipend of Rs25,000. Phase two will expand the programme to 10,000 interns, with stipends increased to Rs60,000.
In a landmark move, Punjab has also launched its first-ever Sports Endowment Fund, offering monthly financial support of Rs30,000, Rs50,000, and Rs70,000 to athletes based on performance tiers. A Self-Sustaining System is being introduced to resolve long-standing salary issues for sports department employees.
Among the major infrastructure projects announced:Punjab Stadium will be upgraded to increase seating capacity from 6,000 to 10,000. A 102-room hotel/hostel will be constructed at Nishtar Park Sports Complex at a cost of Rs800 million.
New facilities include an Indoor Sports Arena (table tennis, snooker, board games, indoor rowing), revival of the International Boxing Arena, and construction of a baseball ground in the provincial capital. Velodrome, swimming pool, and indoor volleyball complex rehabilitation projects are underway.
Padel tennis courts will be built in Lahore, Multan, and Sialkot, while multipurpose sports facilities are planned along Rahimyar Khan, Muridke, and Narowal Road.
Khokhar also emphasised the revival of traditional sports like kabaddi, aiming to reconnect youth with cultural heritage. “Our goal is not just to build infrastructure but to ensure its sustainable and autonomous management,” he said, reaffirming the government’s commitment to equitable sports access across all districts.

Senate body on finance recommends FAPUASA demands on higher education,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322938-senate-body-on-finance-recommends-fapuasa-demands-on-higher-education,"Islamabad:The Senate Standing Committee on Finance has recommended demands made by Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) for enhancing recurring grant and continuation of 25% Tax Rebate in the Higher Education Budget in Fiscal 2005-26.
A delegation headed by its President Dr Mazhar Iqbal attended a meeting of the Committee here Thursday.  The Committee was chaired by PPP Senator Saleem Mandviwalla and attended by Federal Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani, Chairperson FBR Rashid Mehmood Langrial along with other members of the Standing Committee.
The FAPUASA delegation was invited to share its views on the Federal higher education budget and the continuation of the 25% tax rebate for university teachers and researchers.
FAPUASA representatives strongly reiterated the need to enhance the Higher Education recurring grant to at least Rs86 billion, in line with HEC's current request and gradually raise it to Rs200 billion to ensure higher education receives a fair and sustainable share in the national budget.
The delegation asserted that this rebate is an essential incentive to retain top academic talent, attract young scholars to the profession and prevent brain drain from Pakistan’s universities. Removing this rebate, they argued, would undermine academic motivation and weaken the research capacity of the country.
According to a FAPUASA statement, the Finance Committee acknowledged the concerns presented by the faculty and recommended the demands unanimously. FAPUASA delegation thanked the committee for providing a platform and opportunity for raising the academia's concerns at the parliamentary level.
To further build support for its demands, the FAPUASA delegation continued its parliamentary engagements into the second day. The delegation in the last two days met with several MNAs and Senators of PPP, PML-N, MQM and presented its viewpoint seeking their support on the key issues. They extended full support to the academic community and assured the delegation that they would raise their concerns in Parliament.

"Israeli offensive aims to undermine Iran’s potential, overshadow Gaza: experts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322941-israeli-offensive-aims-to-undermine-iran-s-potential-overshadow-gaza-experts,"Islamabad:The recent unprovoked Israeli offensive on Iran is not an isolated event but a reflection of deeper, long-standing strategic fault lines and geopolitical dynamics, insist experts.
They insisted during a discussion here that while Israel, backed by the US, sought to neutralise Iran’s potential and regional relevance, Iran was asserting its strategic autonomy and ideological stance.
The experts said the unfolding escalation not only risked further destabilising the region but also strategically diverted international focus from the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
They emphasised that amid those tensions, Pakistan must maintain its tactful and diplomatically prudent approach, given its historical ties with Iran and evolving regional alignments. The event, titled “Israeli Aggression on Iran and the Dynamics of the Middle East,” was organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) here.
IPS chairman Khalid Rahman said the attack on Iran and subsequent escalation were not merely a regional flashpoint but also served as a deliberate distraction from the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza, said Khalid Rahman.

‘MRV enables climate investment and finance readiness’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322942-mrv-enables-climate-investment-and-finance-readiness,"Islamabad:Dr Irfan Yousuf, CEO, Climate Action and Policy Initiative, has described Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) as an enabler for climate investment and finance readiness.
Dr Yousuf was delivering keynote address at 2-day workshop on ""Enhancing carbon market readiness in Pakistan,"" organised here by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI). Dr Yousuf emphasised that robust MRV systems form the backbone of transparent climate action financing and are essential for building trust, credibility and investor confidence.
MRV not only tracks greenhouse gas emissions but also supports planning, accountability, and compliance. Countries with strong MRV frameworks can better absorb and mobilise climate finance,” Dr. Irfan remarked. He explained that the MRV process begins with data collection on emissions or mitigation activities, followed by reporting in standardised formats and finally independent verification to ensure accuracy and reliability. He cited the Ghana Integrated MRV System as a model that successfully aligned emissions tracking with decision-making, finance mobilisation, and investor engagement.
Dr Sajid Amin Javed, Deputy Executive Director (Research), SDPI, emphasised that carbon markets are rapidly emerging as a key tool for climate finance, backed by both national ownership and global momentum. Pakistan must embed carbon policy into its broader fiscal strategy, he stressed. We need to adopt a futuristic approach to climate financing, as traditional avenues will shrink over time.

‘Pakistan’s position on IWT needs to be based on international principles’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322945-pakistan-s-position-on-iwt-needs-to-be-based-on-international-principles,"Islamabad:Sardar Masood Khan, President, Centre for Law and Security (CLAS) underlined that India carefully timed its actions, building a cascade of dams that give it strategic advantage, so Pakistan’s legal position needs to be firmly grounded in international principles.
Mr Masood was speaking at a seminar on “Weaponising water: the Indus Waters Treaty and future of regional stability” jointly organised here by Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI) and Centre for Law and Security (CLAS).
Mr Masood pointed out potential obstacles in bringing India to arbitration, including provisions in the Vienna Convention and India’s ability to avoid ICJ jurisdiction on issues related to Commonwealth nations. He recommended Pakistan to apply pressure through the World Bank, UN Security Council and key powers like the P5. He called for an assertive international campaign, while also urging Pakistan to maximise domestic water efficiency. Ultimately, Pakistan must choose between maintaining the status quo or pursuing a high-risk, proactive approach to safeguard its water future.
Shafqat Kakakhel, Chairperson, BoG, SDPI, highlighted the crucial link between Kashmir and water, emphasising that Pakistan’s rivers flow through the disputed region. He reminded that Indus Water Treaty (IWT) was not a water-sharing agreement but a river division arrangement heavily influenced by Indian demands. India, he claimed, enjoys uncontested control over the eastern rivers, while seeking to maximise its use of the western ones while ignoring Treaty constraints.
He dismissed the claim that Pakistan opposes all Indian projects and pointed to India’s non-compliance with the Court of Arbitration’s decisions. He recommended activating Article IX of the Treaty to initiate formal dispute resolution and appropriately raising the issue in the UN Security Council. He emphasised preserving the IWT as a legal shield for Pakistan’s water security and promoting sustained international diplomacy.

Power supply disconnection to Fata Secretariat resented,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322957-power-supply-disconnection-to-fata-secretariat-resented,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) has disconnected the power supply to the Fata Secretariat despite payment of outstanding dues amounting to over Rs 10.2 million.
A press release on Thursday said the power disconnection had brought the functioning of several departments, including the Department of Information, to a halt.
The Fata Secretariat, located on Warsak Road and housing key offices such as the Secretary and Director General of the Department of Information and Public Relations, along with various other important departments and officials, was disconnected from the power grid by Pesco on Wednesday evening.
This action was taken even though the Secretary of the Department of Information and Public Relations, who also serves as the Secretary of Administration of the Fata Secretariat, had deposited payment of over Rs10.2 million in electricity dues on June 17.
As a result of the disconnection, the operations of departments like the Department of Information and Public Relations, the Department of Minerals and Mineral Development, and the Directorate General of Health were disrupted, causing severe inconvenience to both the public and applicants seeking services from these offices.
When officials of the Fata Secretariat contacted Pesco over the disconnection, they were informed that outstanding dues were still pending against the office of the Director General of Health, from the time when it used to be located at the Health Secretariat on Khyber Road.Officials of the government departments housed in the Fata Secretariat flayed the action, terming Pesco’s move illegal, and demanding action against those responsible for that.

Saif blasts Maryam for naming projects after Nawaz,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322962-saif-blasts-maryam-for-naming-projects-after-nawaz,"PESHAWAR: Advisor to Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations Barrister Dr Muhammad Ali Saif on Thursday criticised Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for naming public projects after herself and her father, former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
In a statement issued here, Dr Saif questioned, “How can individuals who have not been elected by the people lay claim to public projects in their own names?” “Imran Khan rightly had said that not only are these individuals uneducated, but they also make no effort to learn. They have no right to associate even the London flats with their names, as those too were purchased with money stolen from the public through tax evasion,” he added
Dr Saif emphasized that public projects require genuine public mandate and a proven history of public service to be rightfully associated with anyone’s name. He said that the nation was well aware that both Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz came into power through fraudulent Form-47s. “The real hero of the nation is Imran Khan, who has brought international recognition to Pakistan,” he said. “What have Nawaz Sharif or Maryam Nawaz done that the nation can be proud of?”
He maintained that the people of Pakistan decisively rejected Nawaz Sharif in the general elections of February 8, 2024. “Despite the unlawful imprisonment of PTI leaders, Dr. Yasmin Rashid defeated Nawaz Sharif. His presence in the assembly today is due to fake Form-47s,” he added.

Reply sought in petition against video sharing by Swabi DC,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322964-reply-sought-in-petition-against-video-sharing-by-swabi-dc,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday sought a reply from the director of the Performance Management Reforms Unit (PMRU) regarding a petition filed against the Swabi deputy commissioner for sharing a video of an event at Women University, Swabi, on social media.
A bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal heard the petition filed by Muhammad Hamdan advocate.The petitioner informed the court that DC of Swabi had recorded videos at various programmes and shared them on TikTok using his personal account instead of an official government platform.
He pleaded that while the government had permitted the use of social media for official communication, officials were now creating TikTok videos and sharing them without prior approval, which affected the privacy of many people.
Justice Syed Arshad Ali inquired, “Where was the TikTok video recorded?” The court was informed that the DC attended a ceremony at Women University, Swabi, and recorded a video there, which was then shared on his personal account without the consent of the participants. Female students from the university were seen in the video.
The lawyer argued that government officials were only permitted to use official websites and platforms. At this point, Justice Arshad Ali asked whether any representative from the relevant department was present.
The additional advocate general responded that no one from the department was present.Justice Arshad Ali remarked, “What are they doing? They’ve created personal pages for self-promotion. They’re using social media to promote themselves.” The court then directed that a relevant officer be summoned and adjourned the hearing for a break.
After the break, the deputy director of PMRU appeared before the court.Justice Arshad Ali asked him whether the department had issued a notification on the basis of which every officer had now created a personal account and was sharing various content.
The court directed PMRU to establish Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and submit a detailed report.Justice Arshad Ali also mentioned a recent case in which a district police officer used inappropriate language about civil judges. He said that official work should only be conducted through official accounts, and this must be included in the SOPs. “We are monitoring everything,” he added.
The court remarked that sensitive content such as videos of university female students should not be shared on social media. The court directed PMRU to submit its report within 10 days and adjourned further hearing until July 10, 2025.

PHC upholds convict’s death penalty,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322965-phc-upholds-convict-s-death-penalty,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court on Thursday upheld the death sentence of a convict, who had murdered one of his paternal aunts and injured the other in Yar Hussain, Swabi, over a property dispute.
The convict’s appeal against the sentence was dismissed and the decision of the sessions court was maintained.The appeal was heard by a two-member bench comprising Justice Sahibzada Asadullah and Justice Abdul Fayyaz while Syed Mubashir Shah represented the complainant.
During the hearing, the convict Haris’s lawyer argued that his client had been accused of killing one aunt with an axe and injuring the other. He said that the trial court had sentenced his client to death, but several aspects of the case were overlooked.
The lawyer pleaded if those had been considered, they could have benefited the accused. He prayed the court to annul the sentence.The complainant’s lawyer Mubashir Shah informed the court that accused Haris had attacked his two unmarried aunts, Bakht Zari and Sabt Zari, with an axe, killing one and injuring the other in the jurisdiction of Yar Hussain Police Station, Swabi, in 2021.
He argued that the accused was arrested by the police and then the sessions court had sentenced him to death and imposed a fine of Rs1 million, against which he had filed an appeal in the high court.
The lawyer pleaded that the injured woman directly named the accused in the FIR, and the incident occurred inside the house. He added that the witness statements were consistent, a blood-stained axe was recovered from the accused, and the motive behind the crime was also established, thus, there was no possibility of a false accusation.

Water crisis worsens in Razmak,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322966-water-crisis-worsens-in-razmak,"MIRANSHAH: The picturesque tourist destination of Razmak is facing a severe clean water crisis and the residents have no other option but to travel several kilometers daily to fetch water from distant mountain sources.
The residents expressed deep concern over the worsening situation, stating that despite Razmak’s natural beauty and tourism potential, basic necessities such as clean drinking water remain unavailable. “We are compelled to carry water from far-off areas and many families have already migrated to Mir Ali due to the hardship,” said one of the local residents.
The water shortage has reached alarming levels, with locals urging the elected representatives to take immediate and effective measures. They demand the government prioritise the provision of clean drinking water and improve essential infrastructure in the area.
The residents warned that if the issue remains unresolved, more families may be forced to leave the region, undermining both the local population’s welfare and Razmak’s appeal as a tourist destination.

Businessman sees bid to derail commercial project,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322968-businessman-sees-bid-to-derail-commercial-project,"PESHAWAR: A businessman from Takht Bhai town in Mardan district has alleged an attempt is being made to sabotage a commercial project in Peshawar Cantonment, which he had envisioned nearly two years ago.
Habibullah Khan, son of Munawwar Khan, addressed a press conference at the Peshawar Press Club to highlight an ongoing dispute threatening his mega commercial project, The Capstan Mall, in Peshawar Saddar.
He stated that he had legally signed an agreement last year with Dr Muhammad Umair Akram to acquire seven kanals of land for launching a large-scale commercial venture aimed at offering business opportunities. He said he had lawfully vacated the land by compensating the tenants.
However, after 22 months of groundwork and near-finalization of the project, the former landowner-who has already received 50 per cent of the agreed payment-had allegedly started making excuses to back out of the agreement. The businessman claimed that the owner suddenly issued an “irresponsible” statement to the media, declaring the cancellation of a special power of attorney, even though no power of attorney had been granted, only a formal agreement.
Habibullah Khan emphasized that the project had complied with all legal requirements under the Peshawar Cantonment Board’s bylaws. He expressed hope that The Capstan Mall would create employment, provide commercial relief, and generate significant revenue for the Cantonment Board.
He accused the former owner of colluding with various mafias to sabotage the project and urged him to return to the negotiation table, receive the remaining payment as per the agreement, and honour the original deal.
The businessman warned the public against entering into any new agreements with Dr Umair Akram for the project, asserting that he had already invested millions of rupees under a legal contract

"140 S&T researchers, innovators awarded",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322969-140-s-t-researchers-innovators-awarded,"PESHAWAR: To promote science and technology, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government honoured 140 outstanding young researchers at a grand science and technology awards ceremony here on Thursday.
Directorate General of Science and Technology (DGST) had arranged the event, marking a milestone in the province’s journey toward fostering a dynamic research culture, said official communique.
Senior government officials, university representatives, researchers, and aspiring scientists participated in the event.Dr Shafqat Ayaz, special assistant to the Chief Minister on ST&IT participated as chief guest, who also presented the awards to the recipients. Among the distinguished guests were Secretary for Science, Technology and IT (ST&IT), Amjad Ali Khan, Director General DGST, Sajjid Shah and Managing Director IT Board.
A total of 54 awards were distributed under two of DGST’s flagship programmes: the Undergraduate Research Support (UGRS) Programme and the Masters Interdisciplinary Research Programme.
Through these initiatives, financial support was extended to students from more than 30 universities across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, underscoring the province’s growing commitment to academic research and applied innovation.
Under the UGRS Programme, 80 final-year undergraduate research projects received grants of Rs150,000 each. The initiative is aimed at encouraging bachelor level students to explore practical locally relevant research topics and bring new ideas in the scheme. Sixty postgraduate students were awarded Rs600,000 each under the Masters Interdisciplinary Research Programme to conduct high-impact, interdisciplinary research.
The master’s programme aligns closely with the province’s 11 Strategic Thrust Areas - eight resource-based sectors (such as gemstones, fruits and vegetables, honey production, herbs and medicinal plants, fisheries, the urban environment, micro-hydro energy, and archaeology) and three high-tech “moonshot” domains: Advanced Materials, Biomedicine, and Space Sciences. Each selected scholar is expected to make a novel scientific contribution during their one-year project.
Dr Shafqat Ayaz applauded the students and the DGST team for their efforts in laying the foundation for a robust research ecosystem. “We are witnessing the rise of a research culture in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These young minds are not just scholars; they are builders of a better, tech-driven future for our people,” he remarked.

Youth role in peace building underlined,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322970-youth-role-in-peace-building-underlined,"MINGORA: The experts at a seminar on Thursday said that youth could play a vital role in fostering peace across the country.
“Over 64 percent of Pakistan’s population is under the age of 30. Young people represent a vital demographic force that can challenge violence, promote dialogue and rebuild fractured communities,” Dr Mahboob Ali, an academic and peace advocate, told the seminar.
The seminar on “The Role of Pakistani Youth in Peacebuilding” was held at the Muslim Law College, Swat. The session, led by Dr Mahboob Ali, gathered an enthusiastic audience of law students and faculty members who explored the crucial role of youth in shaping a peaceful and inclusive Pakistan.
Dr Ali outlined the country’s persistent peace challenges, including sectarian conflicts, religious extremism, political instability, and regional tensions. Despite these, he stressed the opportunity youth have to act as positive agents of change, particularly due to their openness, social media influence, and grassroots activism.
The seminar covered key areas where youth can contribute to peacebuilding, such as education, interfaith dialogue, community service, digital advocacy, political participation, and cultural expression. Initiatives like campus peace clubs, anti-hate digital campaigns, and youth parliaments were cited as examples of meaningful engagement.
Participants also learned from real-life success stories, including those of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, activist Jibran Nasir and the Swat Youth Front. These case studies illustrated how young individuals and collectives are actively working to restore harmony in conflict-affected areas.
However, Dr Ali acknowledged significant challenges faced by youth peacebuilders, including limited platforms, lack of institutional support, exposure to misinformation, and the risk of radicalization. He called for a National Youth Peace Policy, stronger government-NGO collaboration, and the integration of peace education at all levels to support youth-led peace initiatives.Concluding the session, Dr Ali urged students to play an active role in building peace: “Youth must reject violence, promote tolerance, and become ambassadors of dialogue and unity.”

ST PETERSBURG INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC FORUM: Pakistan discusses mining sector reforms at SPIEF 2025,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322889-st-petersburg-international-economic-forum-pakistan-discusses-mining-sector-reforms-at-spief-2025,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik presented Pakistan’s mining sector reforms at a high-level panel titled ‘The Responsibility of World Leaders for Mineral Reserves and Production for the Sustainable Development of the Global Economy’ during the St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) 2025.
According to a press release issued from St Petersburg, Russia, the minister highlighted the launch of Pakistan’s Mining Framework Policy and the completion of the Reko Diq mine feasibility study as key milestones in creating an investor-friendly environment for sustainable mineral development. He also underscored the success of the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum, held in Islamabad in April 2025.
“Pakistan has undertaken comprehensive reforms under the leadership of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif to position itself as an attractive destination for mining investment,” Malik said. “Our new policy framework offers unprecedented opportunities in copper, gold and critical minerals, while ensuring environmental stewardship and community benefits.”
He added that Pakistan had harmonised its legal framework in consultation with a global legal firm, paving the way to unlock the country’s vast mineral wealth through responsible and sustainable development. “Our resources go beyond copper and gold -- Pakistan also holds significant reserves of lithium and other rare earth elements,” he said.
Malik noted that these reforms were successfully introduced at the ‘Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025’, which attracted strong participation from global mining leaders. He extended a formal invitation to international investors to take part in the next edition of the forum.
According to the statement, multiple international mining companies have expressed keen interest in participating, reflecting growing confidence in Pakistan’s reformed mining landscape.

SBP forex reserves rise by $46m to $11.72bn,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322890-sbp-forex-reserves-rise-by-46m-to-11-72bn,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $46 million to $11.722 billion in the week ending June 13, the central bank said on Thursday.
The country’s total liquid foreign reserves rose by $130 million to $17.005 billion. The reserves of commercial banks increased by $83 million to $5.283 billion. The SBP’s reserves continued to increase due to a current account surplus. Inflows from the International Monetary Fund, rollovers from friendly nations, and the SBP’s dollar buying from the market also played a crucial role in bolstering forex reserves.
Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $1.8 billion during the 11 months of the fiscal year ending in June, in contrast to a deficit of $1.6 billion in the same period last year. However, the country’s current account turned into a $103 million deficit in May from a $47 million surplus in April, driven by higher imports and a decline in exports. The deficit came at $235 million in May 2024.
The SBP forecasts the current account to remain in surplus for fiscal year 2025. However, due to an uncertain global trade environment and a projected strong demand for imports, the current account is expected to shift to a moderate deficit in fiscal year 2026. Despite weak net financial inflows so far, the SBP anticipates that its foreign exchange reserves will increase to approximately $14 billion by the end of June 2025.
Pakistan on Wednesday signed a $1 billion financing for a five-year multi-tranche facility with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). According to the SBP, the total repayment for FY25 amounted to $25.8 billion, most of which has already been paid or rolled over. The remaining $400 million is set to be settled within the next two weeks, with some inflows anticipated this month. It also expects remittances for FY25 to reach $38 billion, an increase from $31.3 billion in the previous year.

"Oil, war and tariffs tear up markets’ central bank roadmap",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322891-oil-war-and-tariffs-tear-up-markets-central-bank-roadmap,"LONDON: Investor unease about an increasingly uncertain environment is rising, as Norway’s shock rate cut on Thursday highlights how US tariffs, Middle East conflict and a shaky dollar make global monetary policy and inflation even harder to predict.
Norway’s crown slid roughly 1.0 per cent against the dollar and the euro, in a sign of how unexpected the move was. And Switzerland, which cut borrowing costs to zero per cent on Thursday, confounded some expectations among traders for a return to negative rates in the deflation-hit nation, as its central bank warned of a cloudy global outlook.
Just a day earlier the US Federal Reserve kept rates on hold and chair Jerome Powell said “no one” had conviction on the rate path ahead.The conclusion for markets: monetary policy uncertainty is one more headwind to navigate against a backdrop of geopolitical and trade risks.
Global stocks pulled away from recent peaks, a gauge of expected volatility in European equities touched a two-month high as stocks across the region fell and government bonds, usually geopolitical risk havens, sold off.
“We’re at a moment of considerable policy and macro uncertainty,” said BlueBay chief investment officer at RBC Global Asset Management Mark Dowding.“We can’t see a clear trend on interest rates,” he added, which meant he was holding back from active market bets across the group’s investment portfolios.
Volatility was set to rise, some investors said, because a choppy dollar and oil prices whipped around by geopolitics meant that central banks were far less able to provide markets and investors a clear route map for the future.
“You cannot just take your cues from the central banks anymore as they are facing a harder job of reading the economy themselves,” TS Lombard director of European and global macro Davide Oneglia said.
BROKEN MODELS
Rate-cutting European central banks are not just diverging from the Fed, which is grappling with the inflationary risks of US President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
They are also struggling to navigate a new era where the dollar, the lynchpin of world trade, commodity prices and asset valuations, has turned weaker and more volatile under trade war stress and government debt anxiety.
“That’s a massive, massive fundamental shift in global markets that everyone is trying to assess,” Monex Europe head of Macro Research Nick Rees said.“All of those standard economic rules of thumb we use for forecasting are completely broken right now.”
The dollar is down almost 9.0 per cent against other major currencies this year but has risen following the outbreak of a war between Israel and Iran.European Central Bank policymaker Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday the ECB might have to adapt its rate cut plans if oil price volatility was long-lasting.
The new status quo in markets could well be an era of central bank surprises that create rapid shifts in the market narrative, asset pricing and volatility trends, analysts said.
“We’re getting into this next cycle in which variables are much more volatile, because, rather than (monetary policy) being just easily predictable,
events just take over and policy and human factors, as we now know with Donald Trump, play an important role,” Oneglia said.Norway’s surprise cut came because the crown was a “runaway top currency” of the trade-war era, added Societe Generale’s head of FX strategy Kit Juckes.
With investors chasing around the world to identify stores of wealth that are not US dollars, meanwhile, the Swiss franc has soared, cutting the costs of imports and pushing the economy into deflation.
On Thursday, the franc rose against the dollar as traders saw the SNB’s cut as too small to keep deflation at bay.Ninety One multi-asset head John Stopford said the hazard risk was rising for global stocks and that options products that aim to offer protection from incoming volatility looked fairly cheap.
He was buying bonds issued in nations where inflation and rates could come down materially, such as New Zealand, but was negative on longer-dated U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds where economic uncertainty was higher and government borrowing was likely to rise.
Global stocks remain almost 20 per cent above their April trough, after investors relaxed about tariffs.Stopford said there was more to worry about in the short term.
“The stock market feels like it’s a thatched house in a hot country with a fire hazard risk, and people aren’t charging much to insure the house,” Stopford added.

"Global IPO activity slumps in 2025 as tariffs, volatility weigh",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322892-global-ipo-activity-slumps-in-2025-as-tariffs-volatility-weigh,"Global equity IPOs have plunged this year, weighed down by heightened business uncertainty from US tariffs, elevated market volatility and higher interest rates that have raised funding costs and made listings less appealing for issuers.
According to LSEG data, as of June 17, global IPO volume has declined about 9.3 per cent year-on-year (YoY) to $44.3 billion, the lowest level in nine years.US IPO volumes dropped 12 per cent to $12.3 billion, while Europe saw a sharper 64 per cent decline to $5.8 billion. In contrast, Asia-Pacific IPO volumes have risen 28 per cent to $16.8 billion so far this year.
President Donald Trump’s tariffs, which included a 10 per cent blanket levy plus targeted duties on US trading partners, re-ignited tensions in April. Despite his subsequent pause and negotiations on trade and tariffs, businesses globally are uncertain about demand and investment.
“It’s not prudent for companies to go public right now. The volatility in the market is unprecedented,” said Isabelle Freidheim, founder and managing partner at Athena Capital.
“There’s real risk for tech companies that are still figuring out profitability. If the stock drops after the IPO, it’s very hard to recover, especially for companies with less steady cash flow or that aren’t as mature.”
Despite the broader slowdown, China and Japan have seen a sharp pickup in listings, driven by regulatory easing and improved sentiment. A standout was Chinese battery giant CATL, which raised $4.6 billion in the world’s largest IPO so far this year, boosted by renewed market momentum following the US tariff truce.
At the same time, some analysts are cautiously optimistic about a second-half recovery. US IPO interest is showing signs of a rebound, led by fintech firm Chime, which surged on its debut. High-profile names such as Klarna, Gemini and Cerebras are slated to list later this year.
“With US, European defence contractors and Indian consumer names also filing, late-2025 could deliver a textbook “trickle-then-torrent” if volatility behaves,” said Michael Ashley Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital Advisors.

Salaried class demands meaningful relief in Finance Bill,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322893-salaried-class-demands-meaningful-relief-in-finance-bill,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s salaried class has expressed concern over the proposed measures in the Finance Bill 2025-26, which continue to disproportionately burden compliant taxpayers, a statement said on Thursday.
In the past six years, the tax contribution from the salaried class has surged from Rs76.44 billion in 2018-19 to a projected Rs550+ billion in FY 2024-25, marking an increase of nearly 719 per cent. However, this rise does not accurately reflect income growth; instead, it is largely a result of inflation, the lack of indexation, and the removal of essential tax credits related to education, insurance, and investments.
The salaried segment, which has taxes deducted at source and maintains thorough documentation, faces several punitive policies. These include exorbitant taxes on pension funds that particularly penalise retirees with modest non-pension income, an increase in taxes on mutual fund and bank profits that discourages regulated savings and long-term investments, and a continued 10 per cent surcharge on high-earning individuals, while informal and undocumented sectors remain largely unaddressed.
Despite public commitments to provide relief, the current proposals fall short. Key reforms are urgently needed: raising the tax-free salary threshold to Rs100,000 per month, adjusting for inflation; restoring previous slab rates, which would reduce the top slab rate from 35 per cent to 32.5 per cent and decrease the second-highest slab from 30 per cent to 27.5 per cent; maintaining the tax rate for the lowest slab at 1.0 per cent as stated in the budget speech; reinstating tax credits for insurance, education, and investments; withdrawing the 10 per cent surcharge; and ensuring equitable treatment for all taxpayers while expanding
he tax net to include the largely untaxed wholesale, retail and agricultural sectors. Bank profits, discouraging regulated savings and long-term investment; continued 10 per cent surcharge on high-earning individuals, while informal and undocumented sectors remain largely untouched.
While the 2.5 per cent slab rate reduction and minimal surcharge cut are noted, they are far from sufficient. The salaried class is not asking for favours -- only fairness. Policymakers are urged to show compassion and take corrective action before finalising the Finance Bill. A just tax policy is essential to restore public trust, prevent brain drain and secure Pakistan’s economic stability.

KSE-100 down 463 points amid profit-taking,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322894-kse-100-down-463-points-amid-profit-taking,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) started on a positive note on Thursday with reports of power sector circular debt resolution. However, the benchmark KSE-100 index dropped 463 points, as investors followed the global equities’ trend and opted for profit-taking.
The index closed lower by 463.34 points, or 0.38 per cent, to 120,002.59 points, down from 120,465.93 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 121,745.3 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 119,770.03 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said, “Stocks closed lower on fears over the probable escalation of Middle East tensions.”He said that a weak rupee and a slump in global equities played a catalytic role in panic selling at the PSX.
The KSE-30 index decreased by 64.39 points or 0.18 per cent to 36,441.73 points from 36,506.12 points.
Traded shares dropped by 103 million shares to 604.536 million shares from 707.3 million shares. The trading value decreased to Rs20.442 billion from Rs21.273 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs14.523 trillion against Rs14.61 trillion. Of the 459 companies active in the session, 155 closed in green, 269 in red and 35 remained unchanged.
Maaz Mulla, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the local bourse kicked off the trading session on a strong footing, buoyed by news that the federal cabinet has greenlit a financial restructuring plan aimed at slashing Rs1.275 trillion in circular debt within the power sector over the next six years.
Riding on this optimism, the benchmark index surged to an intraday high of 1,279 points. However, the bullish momentum was short-lived, as profit-taking set in later in the session, in line with global market trends.
Rising geopolitical tensions, particularly the intensifying standoff between Iran and Israel, dampened investor sentiment and led to a broad-based pullback, overshadowing the earlier euphoria and highlighting the fragility of market confidence in a volatile global environment, he said.
On the upside, index-heavyweights UBL, BAHL, MCB, and HMB provided some support, jointly contributing 203 points. However, losses in PKGP, EFERT, ENGROH, and LUCK offset those gains, dragging the index down by a combined 270 points.
The highest increase was recorded in Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited, which rose by Rs140.64 to Rs23,129.64 per share, followed by Macter International Limited, which increased by Rs51.39 to Rs565.29 per share. A significant decline was noted in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which fell by Rs1,377.01 to Rs12,393.14 per share; Hoechst Pakistan Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs99.24 to Rs3,150.76 per share.
Analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala at JS Global said the market opened strong with a surge of over 1,200 points but bears quickly took control.
“We advise a defensive strategy, avoiding aggressive exposure in the current climate. Risk management remains key amid heightened market volatility.”
WorldCall Telecom remained the volume leader with 64.601 million shares, which closed lower by one paisa to Rs1.49 per share. Sui South Gas, with 35.626 million shares, followed it, which closed lower by 96 paisas to Rs43.28 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included Prud Mod 1st, Pervez Ahmed Co, K-Electric Ltd., PIA Holding Company, Invest Bank, TPL Properties, Yousuf Weaving, and Ist Capital Sec.         In the futures market, 314 companies recorded trading, 75 of which increased, 232 decreased and 7 remained unchanged.

Rupee drops to 283.64 per dollar in interbank market,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322895-rupee-drops-to-283-64-per-dollar-in-interbank-market,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee ended lower against the US dollar in the interbank market on Thursday. The rupee closed at 283.64 to the dollar, 0.03 per cent weaker than the previous close of 283.55.
In the open market, the rupee also declined, trading at 285.69 against the dollar. It had ended at 285.58 on Wednesday. Dealers said the local currency persisted in its slide owing to heightened dollar demand from importers and companies to meet their obligations.
Oil prices rose again on Thursday after a drop the previous day, as Israel and Iran continued to exchange missile attacks overnight. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump’s stance on the conflict left investors feeling uneasy.
Brent crude futures increased by $1.06, or 1.4 per cent, reaching $77.76 a barrel by 11:51 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude for July was up $1.26, or 1.7 per cent, trading at $76.4.
In a positive development, Pakistan secured a $1 billion loan facility by re-entering the commercial debt market, signalling improved external financing prospects and boosting investor confidence, according to Chase Securities’ note.

"Palm oil vital for Pakistan’s food, economic security, say experts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322896-palm-oil-vital-for-pakistan-s-food-economic-security-say-experts,"KARACHI: Palm oil continues to play a pivotal role in Pakistan’s food security, industrial growth, and nutritional landscape, with experts at a local hotel on Thursday calling for greater public awareness, sustainability measures and strategic policy support to harness its full potential.
Accounting for over 96 per cent of the country’s edible oil imports, palm oil is a staple ingredient in the country’s food industry, with annual consumption surpassing three million tonnes. Its wide-ranging uses include vanaspati ghee, cooking oils, shortenings, margarine, snacks and processed foods.
“Palm oil is a pillar of Pakistan’s oils and fats market,” said Nadar Ali Ghanghro, marketing officer at the Consulate General of Malaysia and author of ‘Palm Oil in Pakistan: A Pillar of the Oils and Fats Market and Its Impact on Food Security’. “Its natural stability, long shelf life and affordability make it essential for national nutrition and economic resilience, particularly in underserved and rural areas.”
Palm oil is naturally cholesterol-free, trans-fat free, and rich in antioxidants such as tocotrienols and beta-carotene. Its balanced fatty acid composition also supports cardiovascular health, nutrient absorption and overall energy needs, making it suitable for a variety of food applications when consumed in moderation.
Dr Ramle Moslim, deputy director-general (R&D) of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board, emphasised palm oil’s unmatched efficiency and adaptability. “Palm oil yields up to 10 times more oil per hectare compared to soybean, sunflower or rapeseed. This high productivity makes it a vital crop for sustainable food production and environmental conservation,” he said.
Dr Ramle also addressed the longstanding concerns surrounding deforestation and biodiversity loss, saying Malaysia is advancing towards a circular, zero-waste palm oil economy guided by science-based policies, reforestation efforts, and multi-stakeholder governance involving NGOs and regulatory bodies. “Our ESG-aligned practices aim to make palm oil a global model of responsible agriculture,” he added.
Zafar Mahmood, CEO of NIMIR, highlighted the industry’s move toward sustainable sourcing practices. “Major multinationals in Pakistan are now demanding RSPO-certified palm oil -- whether Mass Balance, Segregated, or NDPE-compliant. This shift is driving supply chain transparency and environmental responsibility across the sector,” he said.
Palm oil’s nutritional benefits and economic impact are often misunderstood, said Dr Hammad Hassan, assistant professor at Aga Khan University. “There is a lot of misinformation. In reality, palm oil delivers vital nutrients, supports livelihoods, and is more sustainable than many competing oils when produced responsibly,” he noted.
Research efforts are also underway to explore palm-based nutritional interventions. Red palm oil, in particular, is being studied for its potential to combat micronutrient deficiencies in vulnerable populations through healthcare and dietary programmes.
As experts advocate for a collaborative, multi-stakeholder approach to palm oil governance -- uniting science, policy, and public engagement—the commodity remains firmly embedded in Pakistan’s national food and economic strategy.
“With continued improvements in traceability, nutrition, and environmental practices, palm oil is well positioned to remain a critical contributor to global food systems and national development,” said Dr Ramle. “It is time to build collective understanding and support its responsible growth.”

Japan’s exports post first drop in eight months as US tariffs hit auto firms,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322897-japan-s-exports-post-first-drop-in-eight-months-as-us-tariffs-hit-auto-firms,"TOKYO: Japan’s exports fell in May for the first time in eight months as big automakers like Toyota were hit by sweeping US tariffs, and the failure of Tokyo to clinch a trade deal this week will likely pile pressure on a fragile economy.
Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said after the Group of Seven summit in Canada on Tuesday his country had not reached a comprehensive tariff agreement with Washington as some disagreements persisted between the two nations.
Japan and the US “explored the possibility of a deal until the last minute”, he added.Tokyo is scrambling to find ways to get Washington to exempt Japan's automakers from 25 per cent automobile industry-specific tariffs, which are hurting the country's manufacturing sector. Japan also faces a 24 per cent ‘reciprocal’ tariff rate starting on July 9 unless it can negotiate a deal with Washington.
Japan’s automobile sector accounted for about 28 per cent of the total 21 trillion yen ($145 billion) worth of goods the Asian country exported to the US last year.Its total exports in May dropped 1.7 per cent year-on-year by value to 8.1 trillion yen, government data showed, smaller than a median market forecast for a 3.8 per cent decrease, and following a 2.0 per cent rise in April.
Exports to the US slumped 11.1 per cent last month from a year earlier, the largest monthly percentage decline since February 2021, dragged down by a 24.7 per cent plunge in automobiles and a 19 per cent fall in auto components, while a stronger yen also helped reduce the value of shipments. Exports to China were down 8.8 per cent.
In terms of volume, however, US-bound automobile exports dipped just 3.9 per cent, indicating that the biggest Japanese exporters were absorbing the tariff costs.“The value of automobile exports to the US fell, but their volume did not drop that much,” Daiwa Institute of Research economist Koki Akimoto said. “This indicates Japanese automakers are effectively shouldering the tariff costs and not charging customers.”
So far major Japanese automakers have refrained from price increases in the US to mitigate the tariff costs, except for Subaru and Mitsubishi Motors.“They are buying time right now to see the course of Japan-US trade negotiations,” Akimoto said. The absence of price hikes could affect their profits, but their fiscal base is generally solid, he added.
While Japanese stocks and the yen showed little reaction to the data, shares of car companies have come under pressure this year due to concern about the tariff impact.Automakers and other transport companies are the second-worst performer this year among the Tokyo market’s 33 sector sub-indices, down almost 12 per cent. Only makers of precision equipment have fared worse.
Toyota, the world’s top-selling automaker, has estimated that tariffs likely sliced 180 billion yen from its profit in April and May alone. Honda has said it expects a 650 billion yen hit to its earnings this year from tariffs in the US and elsewhere.
The Japan May trade data provide one of the earliest indications of how US President Donald Trump’s tariffs are impacting countries and the global economy.China’s data showed this week that the country's factory output grew 5.8 per cent in May year-on-year, the slowest pace in six months. And its outbound shipments to the US plunged 34.5 per cent , the sharpest drop since February 2020.
The impending tariffs had driven companies in Japan and other major Asian exporters to ramp up shipments earlier this year, inflating levels of US-bound exports during that period.The Japan data showed imports dropped 7.7 per cent in May from a year earlier, compared with market forecasts for a 6.7 per cent decrease.
As a result, Japan ran a trade deficit of 637.6 billion yen last month, compared with the forecast of a deficit of 892.9 billion yen.
DRAG ON GDP
The hit from US tariffs could add pressure on Japan’s lacklustre economy. Subdued private consumption already caused the world’s fourth-largest economy to shrink in January-March, the first contraction in a year.
However, the smaller-than-expected drop in May shipments suggests that Japan’s export driver has not stumbled, slightly raising the chance of the economy avoiding a contraction in the April-June quarter, Yuhi Kawano, economist at Mizuho Securities, wrote in a report.
The tariff woes, though, complicate the Bank of Japan’s task of raising still-low interest rates and reducing a balance sheet that has ballooned to roughly the size of Japan’s economy.
The BOJ kept interest rates steady on Tuesday and decided to decelerate the pace of its balance sheet drawdown next year, signalling its preference to move cautiously in removing remnants of its massive, decade-long stimulus.
According to an estimate by the Japan Research Institute, if all the threatened tariff measures against Japan were to take effect, US-bound exports will fall by 20-30 per cent.Some economists say those duties could shave around 1 percentage point of the nation’s gross domestic product.

"Southeast Asia’s budget airlines bet on travel demand, despite competition woes",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322898-southeast-asia-s-budget-airlines-bet-on-travel-demand-despite-competition-woes,"SEOUL: Southeast Asia’s biggest budget airlines are pursuing a bruising capacity expansion race despite rising cost pressures that are squeezing profitability and led Qantas Airways to shut down Singapore-based offshoot Jetstar Asia.
Low-cost carriers have proliferated in Asia in the past two decades as disposable incomes rise, supported by robust travel demand from Chinese tourists. Demand for air travel in Asia is expected to grow faster than other regions in the next few decades and carriers like Vietnam’s VietJet Aviation and Malaysia-headquartered AirAsia are to buy more planes to add to their already large orderbooks as they seek to gain market share.
But margins are thinner than in other regions. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), an airline industry body, this year expects Asia-Pacific airlines to make a net profit margin of 1.9 per cent, compared with a global average of 3.7 per cent.
Airlines across Asia have largely restored capacity since the pandemic, which has intensified competition, especially for price-sensitive budget travellers, and pulled airfares down from recent high levels.
International airfares in Asia dropped 12 per cent in 2024 from 2023, ForwardKeys data shows. AirAsia, the region’s largest budget carrier, reported a 9.0 per cent decline in average airfares in the first quarter as it added capacity and passed savings from lower fuel prices onto its customers.
Adding to challenges for airlines, costs such as labour and airport charges are also rising, while a shortage of new planes is driving up leasing and maintenance fees. This shifting landscape prompted Australia’s Qantas to announce last week that its loss-making low-cost intra-Asia subsidiary Jetstar Asia would shut down by the end of July after two decades of operations.
Jetstar Asia said it had seen “really high cost increases” at its Singapore base, including double-digit rises in fuel, airport fees, ground handling and security charges.
“It is a very thin buffer, and with margins this low, any cost increase can impact an airline’s viability,” said IATA Asia-Pacific Vice President Sheldon Hee, adding that operating costs were escalating in the region.
Aviation data firm OAG in a February white paper said Asia-Pacific was the world’s most competitive aviation market, with airfares driven down by rapid capacity expansion “perhaps to a point where profits are compromised”.
“Balancing supply to demand and costs to revenue have never been more critical,” the report said of the region’s airlines.
‘GO BIG OR GO HOME’
Southeast Asia has an unusually high concentration of international budget flights. Around two-thirds of international seats within Southeast Asia so far this year were on budget carriers, compared to about one-third of international seats globally, CAPA Centre for Aviation data shows.
Qantas took the option to move Jetstar Asia’s aircraft to more cost-efficient operations in Australia and New Zealand rather than continue to lose money, analysts say.
Budget operators in Southeast Asia were struggling for profits amid fierce competition even before the pandemic and now there is the added factor of higher costs, said Asia-based independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie.
Low-cost carriers offer bargain fares by driving operating costs as low as possible. Large fleets of one aircraft type drive efficiencies of scale.
Jetstar Asia was much smaller than local rivals, with only 13 aircraft. As of March 31, Singapore Airlines’ budget offshoot Scoot had 53 planes, AirAsia had 225 and VietJet had 117, including its Thai arm. Low-cost Philippine carrier Cebu Pacific had 99.
All four are adding more planes to their fleets this year and further into the future. VietJet on Tuesday signed a provisional deal to buy up to another 150 single-aisle Airbus planes at the Paris Airshow, in a move it said was just the beginning as the airline pursues ambitious growth.
The deal comes weeks after it ordered 20 A330neo wide-body planes, alongside an outstanding order for 200 Boeing MAX jets. AirAsia, which has an existing orderbook of at least 350 planes, is also in talks to buy 50 to 70 long-range single-aisle jetliners, and 100 regional jets that could allow it to expand to more destinations, its CEO Tony Fernandes said on Wednesday.“At the end of the day, it is go big or go home,” said Subhas Menon, director general of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.

Czech champion Kvitova calls time on tennis career,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322908-czech-champion-kvitova-calls-time-on-tennis-career,"PARIS: Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova announced Thursday that she will be retiring from the professional tennis circuit after this year´s US Open.
The 35-year-old Czech, who is currently ranked down at 572 in the world, reached a career-high ranking of 2 in 2011 when she won the first of her two Wimbledon titles. She triumphed again in 2014 and went on to reach the final of the Australian Open in 2019.
This week she was handed a wildcard entry for one last outing on the grass courts of south-west London. “There comes a day that it is time for a new chapter and that time for me has come now,” the left-handed Kvitova wrote on social media.
“I therefore wanted to share with you that 2025 is my last season on tour as a professional. “I am excited and very much looking forward to soak in the beauty of playing The Championships, Wimbledon one more time, a place that holds the most cherished memories in my career for me.
“While I am not entirely sure yet what my hardcourt swing in the US will look like, I am intending to finish my active playing career at the US Open in New York later this summer.” Kvitova won Olympic bronze in 2016 but just before Christmas she was attacked in her home by a knife-wielding robber, suffering cuts to the nerves and tendons in her left-hand.
She was a member of six Czech teams to have won the Fed Cup and won the most recent of her 31 tour titles on the grass in Berlin in 2023. Kvitova missed the 2024 season in order to give birth to her first child. Since returning, Kvitova is 1-6, with her lone win coming in the first round of Rome.
“I could not have asked or wished for anything more,” Kvitova posted. “Tennis has given me everything I have today, and I will continue to be forever grateful to this beautiful sport that I love.”

Onley pips Almeida to Tour of Switzerland fifth stage win,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322909-onley-pips-almeida-to-tour-of-switzerland-fifth-stage-win,"PARIS: Scottish rider Oscar Onley won the fifth stage of the Tour of Switzerland on Thursday by a tyre´s length from Joao Almeida after an uphill sprint.
The 22-year-old Onley claimed the second major win of his career at the end of a mountainous 183.5km from La Punt to Sant Maria with a head-to-head battle to the line. “I felt good, and just gave it a go on the last climab,” Onley said.
“I don´t win often and I´ve had a quite a few podiums so far this year, or quite close results, so to pull it off today is really nice for myself and my teammates, because they do a really good job every day, today was no different.
“It´s nice to be able to pay them back now and a again,” he added. Austrian Felix Gall was third 23 seconds behind the Picnic PostNL youngster. Frenchman Kevin Vauquelin took the overall lead from compatriot Romain Gregoire, who struggled and finished more than six minutes behind Onley.
Two-time former world champion Julian Alaphilippe moved to second, 29 seconds behind Vauquelin with Portuguese rider Almeida third and Onley fourth.  It was an emotional day of racing held in memory of Gino Maeder, a 26-year-old Swiss rider who died of his injuries following a high-speed crash on a descent on the 2023 Tour of Switzerland.

Donnarumma warns PSG ‘hungry’ for more success at Club World Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322910-donnarumma-warns-psg-hungry-for-more-success-at-club-world-cup,"Irvine, United States: Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma warned Wednesday that the newly crowned European champions were “hungry” for more success at the Club World Cup as they prepared to face Brazil´s Botafogo.
The French giants launched their Group B campaign in impressive style on Sunday, sweeping aside Atletico Madrid 4-0 at the Pasadena Rose Bowl. The victory marked a seamless entrance to the tournament for PSG, a little over two weeks after their 5-0 drubbing of Inter Milan in the UEFA Champions League final.
Italy´s Donnarumma said the team were intently focused on winning a fifth piece of silverware this season after starting the tournament “the same way we finished” the Champions League. “The Club World Cup is a very important competition for us, we must continue to remain 100 percent focused to reach the final and the trophy,” the goalkeeper told reporters ahead of Thursday´s clash with Botafogo at the Rose Bowl.
“Everyone is hungry for victories, to win titles; it´s important for now and for next year,” he added after training at the University of California. Spanish midfielder Fabian Ruiz said that PSG were comfortable with being tournament favourites.
“It´s positive if everyone is talking about us, isn´t it?” he said. “For our game, what we´re doing. But we don´t feel that pressure, we don´t think about that, but rather about the next match.”
PSG´s opponents Botafogo reached the Club World Cup by winning the Copa Libertadores for the first time in 2024. The Brazilian side opened their campaign with a 2-1 win over the Seattle Sounders on Sunday.
PSG´s Portugal international striker Goncalo Ramos said Botafogo were an unknown quantity. “I know them a little, I know the coach, but I don´t watch many of their matches because they play late. But they´re a good team, it´s different for us to play against a team from Brazil,” Ramos said. After Thursday´s game at the Rose Bowl, PSG will travel north to Seattle for their final group match against the Sounders on Monday.

Gattuso convinced Italy can reach World Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322911-gattuso-convinced-italy-can-reach-world-cup,"ROME: Gennaro Gattuso said Thursday he is convinced Italy can qualify for the World Cup as he begins his reign as Azzurri coach following the dismissal of Luciano Spalletti.
Italy are at risk of missing out on a third consecutive World Cup after a troubled start to their qualifying campaign which has left them nine points behind Group I leaders Norway and cost Spalletti his job.
Asked whether he had more hope or conviction that Italy could reach next year´s finals in the USA, Canada and Mexico, Gattuso said: “conviction”. “I believe that we have good players available to us. We have four or five who are among the top 10 in the world in their position,” added Gattuso.
“We have a good team, but I do mean team, I´m not thinking about individuals. I´m convinced that the team has quality and I´m convinced that we can achieve our goal.” Gattuso has a tough job on his hands with only top spot in the group giving automatic qualification to the World Cup, even with Italy having played two fewer games than Norway.
As well as the significant points gap Italy have a goal difference which is 12 goals worse than Norway, who hammered Italy 3-0 earlier in June. That leaves Italy with the play-offs, from which they failed to reach the last two tournaments, as their only realistic shot at qualification.
“We need to bring back the enthusiasm and not think negatively. My goal is to make sure that the players that come to (Italy´s training centre) Coverciano do so with great enthusiasm, and to create a family,” said Gattuso.
“After formations, technique and tactics the priority is to recreate that mentality that in the past has made us stand out.” Gattuso, a World Cup winner in 2006, was not the Italian Football Federation´s first choice to replace Spalletti.
Claudio Ranieri eventually turned down an appeal to come out of retirement, for a second time, to save his country´s footballing fortunes. But Italy icon Gianluigi Buffon, now head of the national team delegation, said he believes Gattuso is capable of defying those who doubt his capabilities after an up-and-down coaching career. Gattuso, 47, was recently sacked by Hadjuk Split but has also managed AC Milan and Napoli, winning the Italian Cup with the latter club five years ago.

Bordeaux-Begles ‘underdogs’ before Top 14 semis despite Champions Cup triumph,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322914-bordeaux-begles-underdogs-before-top-14-semis-despite-champions-cup-triumph,"PARIS: Bordeaux-Begles may have won the Champions Cup last month but for prop Jefferson Poirot they remain “underdogs” for Saturday´s French Top 14 semi-final with Toulon.
Poirot´s side finished second in the league table at the end of the regular season having claimed their maiden major crown by powering past Northampton on May 24. They head to a sold-out Groupama Stadium in Lyon to face four-time French champions Toulon, who hammered Castres 52-23 in last weekend´s play-off.
“I think you have to forget it altogether,” former France captain Poirot told reporters on Monday. “It would be very dangerous to think that because we have the Champions Cup we´re owed something in the league.
“Right now in the Top 14 we´re still underdogs, we haven´t won anything. “We´re playing Toulon who have historically left their mark on the competition, unlike us,” he added. The 32-year-old Poirot will make his first appearance since the final victory over Saints after being handed a two-week suspension for his role in a post-match incident with the English club´s back-rower Henry Pollock.
“I was really scared of not being able to play,” Poirot said. “I would have had a lot of regrets if I wasn´t able to help the team in a moment like this one,” he added.
- ´Wasted a bullet´ -
Poirot is set to come up against good friend and former team-mate in Toulon scrum-half Baptiste Serin on Saturday. The pair used to share rooms on away trips before Serin headed to the French Riviera in 2019. The half-back´s opposite number will be the equally influential Maxime Lucu, who acts as Antoine Dupont´s stand-in with France.
“They are two important players for their teams,” Poirot said. “I think we have a little Lucu-dependance and they have a little Serin-dependance. “They control the game but not in the same way. “Max will get the team playing more, Baptiste will be a bit more of a catalyst,” he added.
In the other last-four tie, Toulouse play Bayonne who won every home game this season to secure fourth spot and a first-ever appearance in the Top 14 post-season play-offs. Toulouse, meanwhile, who last season clinched a third Champions Cup/Top 14 double, are looking to avoid just a second trophyless season since 2019.
The record 23-time French champions were knocked-out of this campaign´s Champions Cup in the semis by Poirot´s Bordeaux-Begles but ended top of the league table scoring a record 891 points.
“We wasted a bullet,” Toulouse scrum-half Paul Graou told newspaper La Depeche du Midi this week. “We have another title to defend,” he added. Graou has been Toulouse´s first-choice number nine since superstar Dupont suffered a serious knee injury in March.
“Antoine is an exceptional player,” Graou said with Dupont not expected to return before at least October. “We can´t wait to have him back but it´s up to us to take control and make sure the team plays as well as possible,” the 27-year-old added.

Pakistan face dual challenge ahead of France semi-final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322915-pakistan-face-dual-challenge-ahead-of-france-semi-final,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s national hockey team is facing a stern test on and off the field as it gears up for a crucial semi-final clash against World No. 10 France in the Nations Cup Hockey at Kuala Lumpur’s National Stadium today (Friday).
While the Greenshirts are eyeing a spot in the final, troubling developments from within the camp threaten to overshadow their spirited campaign. Credible reports have emerged suggesting growing unrest among the players due to non-payment of daily allowances -- Rs20,000 per player -- since their arrival in Malaysia.
Despite their accommodation and meals being covered, several senior players have voiced frustration over the Pakistan Hockey Federation’s (PHF) failure to release the promised dailies.
“It’s not just about money -- it’s about respect and support for the players who are representing the country. We’ve been chasing the PHF officials for what’s rightfully ours,” a senior player told ‘The News’ from Kuala Lumpur. “We’ve approached PHF President Tariq Bugti directly, but so far, it’s been nothing but empty assurances.”
The issue has created a tense atmosphere ahead of a do-or-die contest against a formidable French side that topped Pool A with two victories and a draw against Wales. The European outfit, known for their structured gameplay and superior rankings, enters the match as the clear favourites.
In contrast, Pakistan’s campaign has been marked by flashes of brilliance marred by defensive lapses -- not more damaging than their recent 3-4 loss against New Zealand. The team squandered a 3-1 lead due to costly errors in the backline, a concern that Head Coach Tahir Zaman and his support staff have worked hard to address in training.
“We’ve focused intensely on defensive organization and penalty stroke conversions. You cannot afford to be casual in knockout matches because here every moment matters,” said Zaman.
“France is a top-tier side, but this is hockey and on that very day, anything is possible. Our goal is to minimise mistakes and play with passion.” Thursday’s rigorous training session, held under the humid Malaysian sun, reflected the team’s resolve to make a strong comeback. The players looked sharp, but the off-field controversies threaten to impact morale at a critical juncture.
The Pakistan vs France semi-final will be the first of the day, followed by an equally intense clash between Korea and New Zealand in the second semi-final. As the PHF struggles with internal financial woes and external scrutiny, Pakistan’s hockey warriors will need more than just tactics -- they will require unity, clarity of purpose, and perhaps a bit of inspiration to reclaim their place among the sport’s elite.

Nissanka’s 187 leads Sri Lanka fightback in first Bangladesh Test,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322916-nissanka-s-187-leads-sri-lanka-fightback-in-first-bangladesh-test,"GALLE: Pathum Nissanka´s career-best 187 helped Sri Lanka finish the third day of the first Test against Bangladesh in a strong position Thursday, only 127 runs off the Tigers´ first innings score.
The 27-year-old opener anchored the Sri Lanka innings before they finished on 368-4 at the close of play, behind Bangladesh´s 495. He struck several key partnerships before he was bowled by Hasan Mahmud towards the end of the day´s play.
Nissanka, who had been under pressure before the match with only one half-century in nine innings, hit 23 fours and a six in his marathon 256-ball innings. Nissanka looked set for his maiden double-ton when he was bowled by Mahmud, who was bowling with the second new ball.
“This is my first Test hundred at home so I was very happy to get there,” Nissanka said after the day´s play. “It is important that we get a decent lead and put them under pressure.” But Sri Lanka´s top-scorer said he was “disappointed” with the way he got out. He acknowledged he had failed to score big since his century in England last year and said that he was “trying to make the most of today”.
Kamindu Mendis (37) and skipper Dhananjaya de Silva (17) will take charge of Sri Lanka´s first innings on the fourth day, with the Galle wicket still playing well for the batters. Besides Mahmud, Taijul Islam, Nayeem Hasan and Mominul Haque finished the third day with one wicket each in a largely uneventful session for Bangladesh´s bowlers.
Nissanka lost his opening partner Lahiru Udara (29) early in the day to the slow left-arm orthodox bowling of Islam. Dinesh Chandimal came in and took a solid 54 runs before he was removed by Hasan after an important 157-run partnership with Nissanka.
Veteran Angelo Matthews, walking out to bat in his farewell Test with a guard of honour from the opposition, hit 39 runs in a key cameo that took the hosts to 293 before he fell to Haque. Earlier, the third day started with Sri Lanka wrapping up Bangladesh´s innings in just three overs after their overnight score of 484-9.

"Test series win in England bigger prize than IPL, says India captain Gill",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322917-test-series-win-in-england-bigger-prize-than-ipl-says-india-captain-gill,"LONDON: Shubman Gill believes captaining India to a Test series victory in England would be a bigger achievement than winning the Indian Premier League.
Gill is set for his first assignment since succeeding Rohit Sharma as Test skipper as he leads a new-look side in the first of five matches against Ben Stokes´ England at Headingley this week.
Test cricket, for so long the pinnacle of the game, has to compete with T20 franchise leagues around the world and players have multiple commitments.
Gill, who won the IPL title with Gujarat Giants in 2022, still views Tests, and especially series wins outside of Asia, as the ultimate achievement.
“You don´t get many opportunities as a captain to be able to come to England -- maybe two, if you´re the best of your generation, maybe three -- and you get to have a crack at the IPL every year,” the batsman told a pre-match press conference in Leeds on Thursday.
“In my opinion winning a Test series in England, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa are bigger.” India will be without the retired trio of Rohit, Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin as they aim for a first Test series win in England since 2007.
Gill did not reveal his team for the first Test at Headingley but confirmed he would step in to Kohli´s usual position of four in the batting order.
Jasprit Bumrah, Ravindra Jadeja and Rishabh Pant are big-name players but Gill said less experienced members of the India squad were unburdened by past failures in England.  “A lot of people talk about us not having experience but there are positives that we don´t really have any baggage coming to England because not all of the players have been to England,” he said.

Pakistan edge Chinese Taipei to enter quarters,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322918-pakistan-edge-chinese-taipei-to-enter-quarters,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan national men’s volleyball team delivered a thrilling performance Thursday, defeating Chinese Taipei in a five-set nail-biter to top Pool C and secure their place in the quarter-finals of the AVC Nations Cup 2025, being held in Manama (Bahrain).
The match was one of the most exciting encounters of the tournament so far, filled with high-paced rallies, incredible comebacks, and outstanding individual brilliance from both sides. Pakistan took an early lead by winning the first two sets 25-20 and 25-22, showing confidence and control on the court. However, Chinese Taipei responded strongly, taking the third and fourth sets 25-21 and 25-16, pushing the match into a decisive fifth set.
In a dramatic and intense final set, Pakistan held their nerves and edged past Chinese Taipei with a score of 18-16, securing an exciting 3-2 victory.  Pakistan will face the second-ranked team from Pool A, which is yet to be decided between Bahrain and Indonesia. Their match outcome will determine Pakistan’s next opponents.
Speaking after the match, PVF Chairman Ch. Muhammad Yaqoob expressed his satisfaction in the team’s performance: “This was a historic win. The team showed tremendous fighting spirit and composure under pressure. The boys have made the whole nation proud. We’re confident that they will carry this momentum into the knockout stages.”

"Dropping Pope for India Test would have been ‘remarkable’, says Stokes",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322919-dropping-pope-for-india-test-would-have-been-remarkable-says-stokes,"LONDON: England skipper Ben Stokes insisted Thursday that Ollie Pope was never in danger of being dropped for this week´s first Test against India, saying it would have been “remarkable” to leave out a man who had just scored 171.
There were suggestions vice-captain Pope and rising star Jacob Bethell were vying for the same batting spot in the first game of a five-Test series at Headingley, starting on Friday. Bethell impressed on England´s New Zealand tour in November and December before Pope underlined his credentials with a mammoth century during an innings victory against Zimbabwe last month.
Bethell missed that match, opting instead to play for Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the Indian Premier League. Stokes, a loyal supporter of 27-year-old Pope, was emphatic in his backing of the batsman at a press conference on the eve of the match.
“The ´big selection´ (idea) did not come from us,” he said. “It would be remarkable to choose someone else if their last knock was a 170, and that´s pretty much all I need to say on that. “Scoring 170 definitely doesn´t do anyone any harm, but having him at number three since I´ve been captain over a three-year period, averaging over 40, it speaks for itself.”
Bethell, 21, has enormous talent and has impressed in all three international formats, though he is yet to score a century in professional cricket. The debate over how he fits into the Test side will continue to rage but Stokes believes Pope has the maturity to block out the noise.
“In this day and age it´s very tough not to see all that speculation, just because of how easily accessible things are,” said the captain. “You don´t even have to go and hunt for it. “But I think scoring 170 in his last Test match has sort of shown how well he´s handled that extra scrutiny.”
The match at Headingley signals the start of a new World Test Championship cycle, just days after South Africa defeated Australia in a memorable final at Lord´s. Stokes has been a longtime critic of the WTC´s format, labelling it “utterly confusing”, and England will once again play the most Tests over the next two years.
Five-match series against India and Australia threaten to make England´s bid to qualify for the 2027 showpiece harder, but Stokes believes he is better off concentrating on the task in front of him. “If we win enough games of cricket, then we´ll find ourselves there at the final at the World Test Championship,” said the all-rounder.
The England and Wales Cricket Board confirmed the winners of the upcoming series would receive the new Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, named in honour of England´s record wicket-taker and India´s top run-scorer. “It´s a proud moment for me and my family to have this iconic series named after Sachin and myself,” said James Anderson, who retired from Test cricket last year.

National cricketers undergo intensive skills development training,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322920-national-cricketers-undergo-intensiveskills-development-training,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) Skills Development Camp is in full swing at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and LCCA Ground in Lahore, where a select group of national cricketers are undergoing rigorous training aimed at refining their technical, tactical, and physical capabilities ahead of a packed international calendar.
The 20-day camp, which began on June 16, is being conducted in three phases, with the first batch of 15 players currently participating under the supervision of NCA coaches. The sessions are structured to include morning fielding and fitness drills from 6:00 to 8:00 AM, followed by skill-based training in the afternoon from 2:30 to 6:30 PM.
On Wednesday, the fourth day of the camp, players engaged in a combination of indoor gym work, technical drills, and role-specific training. Coaches focused on enhancing agility, catching, reverse swing, and shot selection, with former internationals Wahab Riaz, Abdul Razzaq, and Rehan Riaz leading specialized sessions for pacers and batters.
According to Director High Performance Aaqib Javed, the camp is designed to provide “a rare pause from match play” and a platform for one-on-one coaching, allowing players to identify and address individual areas of improvement.
“The initiative is also aligned with the national team’s coaching staff, ensuring consistency in preparation across formats. “A match simulation is scheduled for Thursday, June 20, at the LCCA Ground, offering players a chance to apply their refined skills in a competitive setting.
“These simulations are expected to play a key role in selection assessments for upcoming series against Bangladesh and the West Indies, as well as the Pakistan Shaheens’ tour of England,” he pointed out. Babar Azam, who was part of the initial group, left after two days due to prior overseas commitments, with PCB officials confirming that his absence was communicated in advance.

"Pakistan, West Indies likely to play five or six T20Is",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322921-pakistan-west-indies-likely-to-play-five-or-six-t20is,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Cricket West Indies (CWI) are in advanced discussions to revise their upcoming bilateral series, sources said.
Originally, the tour was set to feature three T20Is in the United States—on July 31, August 2, and August 3—followed by three ODIs in Trinidad on August 8, 10, and 12. However, with the boards prioritising preparations for the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the focus has shifted toward maximising T20 exposure.
“The PCB is optimistic that West Indies will agree to the proposed change,” a source close to the development said, adding that the revised series could feature five or even six T20Is.
The move mirrors a similar adjustment made for Pakistan’s upcoming tour of Bangladesh, where a three-match T20I series—scheduled for July 20, 22, and 24 in Dhaka—was finalised outside the ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP). That series was agreed upon during meetings between PCB and BCB officials on the sidelines.

Warning signs on climate flashing bright red: top scientists,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322983-warning-signs-on-climate-flashing-bright-red-top-scientists,"PARIS: From carbon pollution to sea-level rise to global heating, the pace and level of key climate change indicators are all in uncharted territory, more than 60 top scientists warned on Thursday.
Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels and deforestation hit a new high in 2024 and averaged, over the last decade, a record 53.6 billion tonnes per year -- that is 100,000 tonnes per minute -- of CO2 or its equivalent in other gases, they reported in a peer-reviewed update.
Earth´s surface temperature last year breached 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels for the first time, and the additional CO2 humanity can emit with a two-thirds chance of staying under that threshold long-term -- our 1.5C “carbon budget” -- will be exhausted in two years, they calculated.
Investment in clean energy outpaced investment in oil, gas and coal last year two-to-one, but fossil fuels account for more than 80 percent of global energy consumption, and growth in renewables still lags behind new demand.
Included in the 2015 Paris climate treaty as an aspirational goal, the 1.5C limit has since been validated by science as necessary for avoiding a catastrophically climate-addled world. The hard cap on warming to which nearly 200 nations agreed was “well below” two degrees, commonly interpreted to mean 1.7C to 1.8C.

Greenpeace warns of ‘potential disaster’ after oil spill off UAE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322984-greenpeace-warns-of-potential-disaster-after-oil-spill-off-uae,"BEIRUT, Lebanon: Greenpeace on Thursday warned that an oil spill resulting from a tanker collision off the coast of the United Arab Emirates could have grave environmental consequences, after authorities reported a “small” slick.
On Tuesday, the Emirati coastguard said it rescued 24 crew members of the Adalynn oil tanker after it collided with the Front Eagle vessel in the Gulf of Oman, off the coast of the Khor Fakan area of the UAE.
“Greenpeace Middle East and North Africa (MENA) has warned of a potential environmental disaster after two crude oil tankers collided,” the group said in a statement. The environmental campaign group said satellite imagery indicated a “large plume of oil stretching up to around 1,500 hectares from the site of the crash”.
The group said the Adalynn was part of a Russian “shadow fleet”, which it described as “a collection of partially obsolete tankers that operate below basic security standards and carry Russian oil”.
Security analysts say the fleet of ageing vessels is used by Russia to circumvent international sanctions that ban it from selling oil. Greenpeace said the Adalynn could be carrying about 70,000 tonnes of crude oil, despite being officially listed in ballast condition, and therefore should not have been carrying cargo. The Front Eagle is owned by shipping company Frontline. Farah Al Hattab of Greenpeace urged authorities to “act swiftly to contain the spill and assess its ecological impact”.

Musk’s SpaceX Starship explodes during routine test,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322985-musk-s-spacex-starship-explodes-during-routine-test,"HOUSTON: One of Elon Musk´s SpaceX Starships exploded during a routine test in Texas on Thursday, law enforcement officials said, in the latest setback to the billionaire´s dream of turning humanity into an interplanetary species.
The Starship 36 suffered “catastrophic failure and exploded” at the Starbase launch facility shortly after 11:00 pm (0400 GMT Thursday), a Facebook post by Cameron County authorities said.
A video shared with the post showed the megarocket attached to the launch arm and then a flash and a towering, fiery explosion. Musk´s Space X said the rocket was preparing for the tenth flight test when it “experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,” without elaborating on the nature of the complication.
“A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,” Space X said on social media. “There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing operations continue.” The Starship was not scheduled for launch on Wednesday evening when the explosion occurred during a “routine static fire test,” according to the Cameron County authorities.

Two million Syrians return home since Assad’s fall: UN,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322986-two-million-syrians-return-home-since-assad-s-fall-un,"BEIRUT, Lebanon: Over two million Syrians who had fled their homes during their country´s war have returned since Bashar al-Assad´s overthrow in December, UN refugee agency chief Filippo Grandi said Thursday during a regional visit.
The Syrian civil war, which erupted in 2011 with Assad´s brutal repression of anti-government protests, displaced half of the population internally or abroad. But Assad´s December 8 ouster at the hands of Islamist forces sparked hopes of return.
“Over two million Syrian refugees and displaced have returned home since December,” Grandi wrote on X during a visit to neighbouring Lebanon, which hosts about 1.5 million Syrian refugees, according to official estimates. It is “a sign of hope amid rising regional tensions,” said Grandi, who is due to visit Syria on Friday.

Trump administration puts new limits on Congress visits to immigration centres,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322987-trump-administration-puts-new-limits-on-congress-visits-to-immigration-centres,"WASHINGTON: The US Department of Homeland Security has put new restrictions on visits by members of Congress to immigration enforcement field offices after several episodes where Democratic lawmakers have been refused access or even arrested.
The new guidelines, dated this month, also say Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a DHS agency, has sole discretion over whether to deny or cancel a tour of an ICE detention centre by a member of Congress.
Senators and representatives in Congress have oversight of agencies in the executive branch of government and control their funding. Under federal law, DHS is forbidden from preventing members of Congress from entering any facility “used to detain or otherwise house aliens,” and lawmakers do not have to give DHS prior notice of a visit. DHS may require lawmakers’ staff to give 24 hours’ notice before those staffers can enter.
The new guidelines say that law does not apply to ICE field offices, although immigrants are often detained at ICE field offices before a transfer to an ICE jail. ICE is now asking members of Congress to give at least 72 hours’ notice before a visit.
US President Donald Trump, a Republican, returned to the White House in January partly on a pledge to voters to deport millions of immigrants, including those in the US without authorisation and those seeking asylum. He also has sought to deport international students legally studying in the US who have pro-Palestinian views.

Chinese student gets life in UK jail for ‘campaign of rape’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322988-chinese-student-gets-life-in-uk-jail-for-campaign-of-rape,"LONDON: A Chinese post-graduate student convicted of drugging and raping 10 women in the UK and China and suspected of having attacked more was on Thursday jailed for life by a London court.
Police in London say they have evidence to suggest he may have targeted more than 50 other women. Serial rapist Zhenhao Zou, 28 -- described in court as “calculated and predatory” -- targeted young Chinese women whom he invited to his London flat for drinks or to study before drugging and attacking them.
Zou filmed nine of the rapes with hidden or handheld cameras, but only three of the 10 victims have ever been identified. Sentencing him at Inner London Crown Court, Judge Rosina Cottage said there was “no doubt that you planned and executed a campaign of rape” that had caused “devastating and long term effects”.
To the world he appeared “well to do, ambitious and charming” but this was a mask hiding a “sexual predator”, she said. He treated his victims “callously” as “sex toys” for his own gratification, and his desire to assert “power and control over women” meant that he would be a “risk for an indefinite period”, she added.
Zou, wearing a dark suit and glasses, listened impassively in the dock to the sentence via a translator. He will serve a minimum of 22 years in jail, after accounting for time already spent in custody.

France mulls intercepting UK-bound migrant boats at sea,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322989-france-mulls-intercepting-uk-bound-migrant-boats-at-sea,"LILLE, France: France is considering stopping Britain-bound migrant boats in its shallow coastal waters, but the move raises both safety and legal issues.
France has long been a launchpad for migrants hoping to cross the Channel and start a better life in Britain. Paying smugglers thousands of dollars, they often board overloaded rubber dinghies to make the dangerous and sometimes deadly journey across one of the world´s busiest shipping routes.
France and Britain have long vowed to crack down on people smugglers who organise the journey. But until now, French authorities have only intervened on land to prevent boats leaving.
But once the vessels are at sea, French authorities have, under international maritime law, so far only intervened if someone´s life was in danger. To avoid French authorities stopping them on land, smugglers have in recent years chosen to “taxi” migrants out to boats waiting in choppy waters just off-shore, rather than depart from the beach.
But as more small boats land on English shores, and the UK government comes under mounting pressure from the far right to tackle irregular migration, London has pressed Paris to do more.

Thai PM clings on as crisis threatens to topple govt,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322990-thai-pm-clings-on-as-crisis-threatens-to-topple-govt,"BANGKOK: Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra apologised on Thursday for a leaked phone call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen that provoked widespread anger and threatened to topple her government.
Her main coalition partner quit and she faced calls to resign or hold an election, throwing the kingdom into a fresh round of political instability as it seeks to boost its spluttering economy and avoid US President Donald Trump´s swingeing trade tariffs.
The conservative Bhumjaithai party pulled out on Wednesday, saying Paetongtarn´s conduct in the leaked call had wounded the country and the army´s dignity. As pressure grew on Thursday, Paetongtarn apologised at a news conference alongside military chiefs and senior figures from her Pheu Thai party. “I would like to apologise for the leaked audio of my conversation with a Cambodian leader which has caused public resentment,” Paetongtarn told reporters.
The Thai stock market fell 2.4 percent on Thursday as the crisis raged, but by the evening Paetongtarn, daughter of billionaire ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra, appeared to have won a reprieve as another coalition party said it would not withdraw -- for now at least.
Leaders of the Chartthaipattana, United Thai Nation and Democrat parties held urgent talks on the crisis on Thursday afternoon. Afterwards Chartthaipattana leader Varawut Silpa-archa told reporters his party would remain in government and meet Paetongtarn to decide what to do.
Losing another coalition partner would likely mean the end of her government and either an election or a bid by other parties to stitch together a new coalition. In the leaked call, Paetongtarn is heard discussing an ongoing border dispute with Hun Sen, who still holds significant power in Cambodia despite leaving office in 2023.
She addresses the veteran leader as “uncle” and refers to the Thai army commander in the country´s northeast as her opponent, a remark that sparked fierce criticism on social media. The Thai foreign ministry summoned the Cambodian ambassador on Thursday to deliver a letter complaining about the leaking of the call.
The loss of Bhumjaithai´s 69 MPs left Paetongtarn with barely enough votes to scrape a majority in parliament and a snap election could be on the cards -- barely two years after the last one in May 2023.
Thailand´s military said in a statement that army chief General Pana Claewplodtook “affirms commitment to democratic principles and national sovereignty protection”. “The Chief of Army emphasised that the paramount imperative is for ´Thai people to stand united´ in collectively defending national sovereignty,” it said.
Thailand´s armed forces have long played a powerful role in the kingdom´s politics and politicians are usually careful not to antagonise them. Thailand has suffered a dozen coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, and the current crisis has inevitably triggered rumours that another may be in the offing.

Trump extends deadline for TikTok sale by 90 days,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322991-trump-extends-deadline-for-tiktok-sale-by-90-days,"WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced on Thursday he had given social media platform TikTok another 90 days to find a non-Chinese buyer or be banned in the United States.
“I´ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, putting off the ban for the third time.
A federal law requiring TikTok´s sale or ban on national security grounds was due to take effect the day before Trump´s January inauguration. The Republican, whose 2024 election campaign relied heavily on social media, has previously said he is fond of the video-sharing app.
“I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,” Trump said in an NBC News interview in early May. “If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension.” TikTok on Thursday welcomed Trump´s decision.
“We are grateful for President Trump´s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users,” said a statement issued by the platform. Trump said in May that a group of purchasers was ready to pay TikTok owner ByteDance “a lot of money” for the video-clip-sharing sensation´s US operations.
Trump has repeatedly downplayed risks that TikTok is in danger, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app´s US business. The White House had announced Monday that Trump would throw the wildly popular video-sharing app, which has almost two billion global users, another lifeline.
During this new grace period the administration will work “to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,” the administration said in a statement.
The president is “just not motivated to do anything about TikTok,” said independent analyst Rob Enderle. “Unless they get on his bad side, TikTok is probably going to be in pretty good shape.”
Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, but reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform after coming to believe it helped him win young voters´ support in the November election.
Motivated by national security fears and a belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump´s inauguration, with ByteDance having made no attempt to find a suitor.
TikTok “has become a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry; a flashpoint in the new Cold War for digital control,” said Shweta Singh, an assistant professor of information systems at Warwick Business School in Britain.
The president announced an initial 75-day delay of the ban upon taking office. A second extension pushed the deadline to June 19. Now the deadline is September 17. Trump said in April that China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a dispute over his tariffs on Beijing.

"2,000-year-old Roman wall paintings unearthed in London",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322992-2-000-year-old-roman-wall-paintings-unearthed-in-london,"LONDON: Archaeologists have unearthed one of the largest collections of painted Roman wall plaster ever found in London and painstakingly pieced the fragments together, they said on Thursday.
The plaster, which was discovered on a construction site in 2021, once decorated around 20 internal walls of a high-status early Roman (AD 43-150) building in Southwark, south of the River Thames, the Museum of London Archaeology (MOLA) said.
The plaster was found dumped in a large pit, having been smashed into thousands of pieces during Roman demolition works that took place some time before AD 200. MOLA Senior Building Material Specialist Han Li has spent the last three months laying out the fragments and reconstructing the designs.
“This has been a once in a lifetime moment, so I felt a mix of excitement and nervousness when I started to lay the plaster out,” he explained. “Many of the fragments were very delicate and pieces from different walls had been jumbled together when the building was demolished, so it was like assembling the world´s most difficult jigsaw puzzle. a
“The result was seeing wall paintings that even individuals of the late Roman period in London would not have seen,” he added. The reconstruction revealed bright yellow panel designs decorated with images of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres not seen for 1800 years.

Argentine nurse gets life sentence for murder of five babies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322993-argentine-nurse-gets-life-sentence-for-murder-of-five-babies,"BUENOS AIRES: A nurse was sentenced to life in prison for killing five babies and attempting to murder eight others at a hospital in Argentina, according to local media.
Brenda Cecilia Aguero injected potassium and insulin into newborns between March and June 2022, taking doses from emergency medical carts without inventory control, prosecutors said. Under Argentine law, Aguero will not be eligible for parole before serving 35 years.
The court clerk read out the sentencing in footage broadcast on local media on Wednesday. The babies, all born healthy, died under initially unexplained circumstances at the neonatal ward of the maternal and child hospital in Cordoba province, 600-kms northwest of Buenos Aires.
Eight others survived due to swift medical intervention. The trial also brought charges against 10 other defendants including former provincial officials and health professionals for cover-up and dereliction of duty.
Those charged included a former health minister and secretary of health of Cordoba province, as well as the former hospital director. Aguero, who was arrested in 2022, denied the charges, earlier telling the court “they have no evidence” and accusing media of portraying her as a “serial killer.”
Of the other defendants, five were found guilty but received lesser sentences while five others were acquitted, including the former provincial officials, according to local outlet Infobae.

Kyiv says Russia has been rejecting ceasefire calls for 100 days,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322994-kyiv-says-russia-has-been-rejecting-ceasefire-calls-for-100-days,"KYIV, Ukraine: Ukraine said on Thursday that Russia has for more than three months been refusing a US and Ukrainian proposal to halt some three years of fighting without any preconditions.
The inauguration of US leader Donald Trump earlier this year has spurred a flurry of meetings between US, Russian and Ukrainian officials with the aim of halting Moscow´s invasion, without success.
“It has been exactly 100 days since Ukraine unconditionally accepted the US peace proposal to completely cease fire, put an end to the killing, and move forward with a genuine peace process,” Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said in a statement, adding that a ceasefire was a “basic first step towards peace.”
During several rounds of face-to-face talks in Turkey, Russia has issued terms to initiate peace talks that Kyiv has described as “ultimatums.” The Kremlin is seeking territorial control over four regions it claims to have annexed since 2022 when it launched its invasion, and wants to replace Volodymyr Zelensky as leader of Ukraine.
