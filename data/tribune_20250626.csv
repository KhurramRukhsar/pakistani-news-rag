Mamdani delivers a political earthquake in NYC mayor primary,"US
The little-known state legislator, a proud ""democratic socialist"", is now favorite to win November's election
Zohran Mamdani's victory in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is a seismic wake-up call for a party establishment out of step with younger Americans and failing to counter Donald Trump, analysts say.
The little-known state legislator, a proud ""democratic socialist"", is now favorite to win November's election and become a major voice in the battle between progressives and the establishment wing for the party's soul.
Mamdani, just 33, was at a lowly one percent in the polls in February, but saw off three-term former New York governor Andrew Cuomo with a populist campaign that has Democrats nationwide taking notice ahead of next year's midterm elections.
""The race shows Democratic voters are growing tired of the same old faces and they're willing to bet on newcomers,"" said political strategist Andrew Koneschusky, a top former Democratic Senate aide.
""Looking ahead, we may see more competitive Democratic primaries and more upsets like this. That's bad news for establishment Democrats, but can be good for the party overall.""
Democrats have struggled to make their case as a credible alternative to Republicans since Kamala Harris's 2024 defeat to Trump — seen in part as repudiation of identity politics and so-called ""woke"" ideology.
But the man who would be his city's first Muslim mayor embraced his identity, courting the one million New York members of his faith where they live — in the city's many mosques and community centers.

Railway woes mount as crashes climb,"US
PR grapples with surge in accidents despite safety push
Pakistan Railways recorded a total of 45 train-related incidents in the first six months of 2025, deepening concerns over the persistent safety and infrastructure challenges across the national railway network.
Despite all available resources and initiating multiple safety measures, PR has been unable to prevent the derailment of passenger and freight trains or avert recurring accidents.
The frequent derailments have not only caused distress to passengers but have also disrupted business operations across the country. Recent terrorist attacks on trains have further exacerbated the crisis.
According to official statistics, from January 1 to June 15, a total of 45 train-related accidents occurred, including derailments and other incidents. The accidents included 22 derailments involving passenger trains, 20 involving freight trains and three miscellaneous incidents.
Among the most alarming events was the kidnapping incident involving the Jaffer Express, which has raised serious concerns about the security of passengers and trains.
Several individuals sustained injuries as a result of these accidents, while the Pakistan Railways infrastructure suffered financial damages amounting to tens of millions of rupees.
One of the most serious incidents took place on May 21, when the Shalimar Express, travelling from Karachi to Lahore, collided with a brick-laden trolley at an unmanned level crossing near Sahianwala Darul Ehsan. The impact caused all 15 coaches of the train to derail.
On May 30, the Rehman Baba Express met with an accident after striking a trolley at another unmanned level crossing. On June 1, the Pakistan Express narrowly avoided a major disaster when a trolley beneath its dining car broke off near Mubarakpur.
On June 14, three separate train-related incidents occurred. The Khushhal Khan Khattak Express, en route to Peshawar, had six bogies derail at Kandhkot. On the same day, the Allama Iqbal Express avoided catastrophe when a malfunction was reported in its brake block while the train was in motion. Meanwhile, the Thal Express collided with a car.
On June 18, the Jaffar Express was targeted in a sabotage attack near Jacobabad, where explosive material was used to blow up the railway track, causing five coaches to derail.
In addition to these incidents, air conditioners malfunctioning in moving trains and engine overheating led to several trains being stopped mid-journey.

Unvaccinated children in Pakistan rising,"SG
Study suggests WHO targets will not be achieved
Pakistan has become the second largest country with the highest number of children with zero doses of vaccines in South Asia after India, a media report said, quoting a new study by British medical journal Lancet.
The study found that Pakistan had 419,000 children falling into that zero-vaccine category. Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio still remains endemic, despite global efforts to eradicate the virus.
The Lancet said in a press release that a major new analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study Vaccine Coverage Collaborators, said that despite progress of past 50 years, the last two decades have also been marked by stagnating childhood vaccination rates and wide variation in vaccine coverage.
In 2019, it said, the WHO set ambitious goals for improving vaccine coverage globally through the Immunisation Agenda 2030. However, it added, the challenges exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases and death.
The authors of the study, ""Global, regional, and national trends in routine childhood vaccination coverage from 1980 to 2023 with forecasts to 2030"", said that the latest estimates should be taken as a ""clear warning"" that 2030 target would not be achieved without ""transformational improvements"".
The IA2030 goals included halving the number of 'zero-dose' children — estimated as children aged under 1 who have not received any dose of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine. The programme also aimed to achieve global coverage of 90% for each of the life-course vaccines.

Trump teases Iran talks next week,"US
Says Tehran's N-programme 'set back decades', Claims Israel, Iran 'both tired, exhausted' from war
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would hold nuclear talks with Iran next week, teasing the possibility of a deal even after boasting that recent US strikes had crippled the Islamic republic's atomic programme.
Trump credited the unprecedented US attacks with the ""total obliteration"" of Iran's nuclear capabilities, and said they had set the country's programme back ""decades"".
But leaked US intelligence cast doubt on that assessment, saying the strikes had likely delayed Tehran by just a few months.
Before the agreement of a ceasefire on Tuesday, Israel had pounded Iranian nuclear and military sites over the course of 12 days of war, while Iran launched waves of missiles at its regional arch foe in their deadliest-ever confrontation.
The United States joined the fray in support of its ally, hitting two nuclear facilities with massive bunker-buster bombs over the weekend, while a guided missile from a submarine struck a third.
""They're not going to be building bombs for a long time,"" said Trump, adding the strikes had set back the programme by ""decades"" and that the ceasefire that he declared was going ""very well"".
Trump also mentioned his meeting with Field Marshal Asim Munir during his address, saying, ""And in fact, I had a general who is really was very impressive, the general from Pakistan was in my office last week.""
He later told reporters that Israel and Iran were ""both tired, exhausted"", going on to say that talks were planned with Iran ""next week"".
""We may sign an agreement. I don't know,"" he added.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian had said on Tuesday his country was willing to return to negotiations over its nuclear programme, but that it would continue to ""assert its legitimate rights"" to the peaceful use of atomic energy.
Israel's military said Wednesday it was ""still early"" to assess the damage the war caused to Iran's nuclear programme.
""I believe we have delivered a significant hit to the nuclear programme, and I can also say that we have delayed it by several years,"" said Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin.
Iran's foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei acknowledged to Al Jazeera that its ""nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that's for sure"".
But US media on Tuesday cited people familiar with a Defense Intelligence Agency report as saying the American strikes did not fully eliminate Iran's centrifuges or enriched uranium stockpiles.
The strikes sealed off entrances to some facilities without destroying underground buildings, according to the report.
Israel had said its bombing campaign, which began on June 13, was aimed at preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, an ambition Tehran has consistently denied.
Its commandos had also operated inside Iran during the conflict, Israel's army chief publicly acknowledged for the first time on Wednesday.
""The forces operated in secret deep within enemy territory and created operational freedom of action for us,"" chief of staff Eyal Zamir said in a televised address.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an address to the nation after the ceasefire, announced that ""we have thwarted Iran's nuclear project"".
""And if anyone in Iran tries to rebuild it, we will act with the same determination, with the same intensity, to foil any attempt,"" he said.
Iranian lawmakers on Wednesday voted in favour of suspending cooperation with the United Nations nuclear watchdog, state television reported.
""The International Atomic Energy Agency, which refused to even marginally condemn the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, put its international credibility up for auction,"" parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said, according to the broadcaster.
The decision to suspend cooperation with the IAEA still requires the approval of the Guardian Council, a body empowered to vet legislation.
In an interview with the Al Araby Al Jadeed news outlet, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran remained committed to the Non-Proliferation Treaty but that it had failed to ""protect us or our nuclear programme"", adding without elaborating that Iran's approach towards the regime ""will undergo changes"".
While Iran and Israel have been locked in a shadow war for decades, their 12-day conflict was by far the most destructive confrontation between them.
Israeli strikes hit nuclear and military targets — killing scientists and senior military figures — as well as residential areas, prompting waves of Iranian missile fire on Israel.
Tehran remained relatively quiet on Wednesday, with many shops still shuttered and only some restaurants open, though there was more life on the streets than during the height of the war.
""Thank God, the situation has improved, the ceasefire has been reached, and people have returned to work and their lives,"" said one resident, a 39-year-old salesman who gave his name as Saeed.
Others, however, were uncertain whether the peace would hold.
""I really don't know... about the ceasefire but honestly, I don't think things will return to normal,"" said 28-year-old Amir.
Some Israelis, meanwhile, welcomed the truce.
""Finally, we can sleep peacefully. We feel better, less worried, for the kids, for the family. And I hope it stays that way,"" said Yossi Bin, a 45-year-old engineer in Tel Aviv.
Israeli strikes on Iran killed at least 627 civilians, according to the health ministry.
Iran's attacks on Israel killed 28 people, according to Israeli figures. AFP

Trade talks with US set to conclude next week,"US
.
Pakistan and the US have resolved to conclude trade talks next week, the South Asian nation said on Wednesday after a meeting between its Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
The negotiations, focused on reciprocal tariffs, are part of a broader push to reset economic ties at a time of shifting geopolitical alignments and Pakistan's efforts to avoid steep U.S. duties on exports.
""Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week,"" the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that a longer-term strategic and investment partnership is also under discussion.
Pakistan faces a 29% tariff on exports to the US under President Donald Trump's measures to target countries with large trade surpluses with the US Pakistan's surplus was around $3 billion in 2024.
To offset the imbalance and ease tariff pressures, Islamabad has offered to import more US goods, including crude oil, and to open up investment opportunities through concessions for US firms in Pakistan's mining sector.
Earlier this week, the two countries co-hosted a webinar promoting investment in Pakistan's mineral sector, including the $7 billion Reko Diq copper-gold project.
Senior officials from both governments and US investors discussed public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms.
The US Export-Import Bank is reviewing financing proposals worth $500 million to $1 billion in Reko Diq.
Trump, who hosted Field Marshal Gen Asim Munir at the White House last week, has earlier said trade helped avert a deeper conflict between Pakistan and India.
Meanwhile, the US and Pakistan have agreed to increase bilateral economic and trade ties and meaningful engagement in investment and negotiation on pertinent economic issues.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb held a virtual meeting with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
The discussion focused on meaningful engagement in trade, investment and deepening economic ties mutually beneficial to both sides with technical level trade related discussions to be concluded coming week, said a press release issued here on Wednesday.
A virtual meeting took place between Mr. Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Minister and Howard Lutnick, United States' Commerce Secretary on United States (US) reciprocal tariffs, said a press release issued here on Wednesday.
Both sides showed satisfaction with the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week.
It was also resolved that, further to the trade agreement, a partnership, based on strategic and investment interests, would be concluded in due course covering areas of mutual interest. Both sides expressed confidence in concluding trade negotiations at the earliest.

Pakistan backs diplomacy on Iran,"US
.
Pakistan reaffirmed its support for resolving Iran nuclear issue through peaceful means when the UN Security Council on Tuesday discussed the latest developments related to the implementation of its 2015 resolution endorsing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which limits the Iranian atomic programme.
""Diplomatic engagement and the resumption of dialogue are the best means to resolve all outstanding issues,"" Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, told the 15-member Council on Tuesday.
""Diplomacy has delivered previously and with the necessary political will, it can certainly deliver again,"" he said, referring to JCPOA, which was signed in 2015 after extensive negotiations between Iran and several world powers, including the United States.
The US, however, withdrew from the agreement in 2018 under the Trump administration, and the deal is now considered ""essentially defunct"".
Tuesday's Security Council session followed a brokered ceasefire that brought a pause to recent hostilities — air strikes by Israel and the United States on Iranian nuclear sites, and Tehran's subsequent missile attacks on a United States base in Qatar.
In his remarks, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar said the IAEA, the UN agency responsible for verifying compliance with respective nuclear safeguards obligations of member states, must be enabled to fulfil this statutory function.
""We believe that verification activities by the IAEA should continue unimpeded,"" he added.
The Security Council, the Pakistani envoy said, should allow sufficient time to continuing efforts between the IAEA and Iran as well as other parties to resolve outstanding issues.
Recent developments, he said, have yet again manifested the grave dangers that present themselves when there are violations of the UN Charter and international law.
""The cost of seeking to resolve issues through military means is more than evident,"" he said, adding, ""The region, and indeed the whole world, cannot be hostage to such adventures, dangerous precedents and spiraling escalations.""
With regards to recent developments, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar emphasized: Condemnation of violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states and, of the threat or use of force to settle disputes; Rejection of attacks on IAEA-safeguarded nuclear facilities; Sustained cessation of hostilities and a permanent ceasefire to allow resumption of dialogue and verification activities by the IAEA, and, Renew diplomatic engagement to seriously and faithfully address the outstanding issues in a cooperative manner.
In conclusion, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar informed the Council that together with Russia and China, Pakistan has proposed a draft Council resolution in search of a peaceful solution to the concerns surrounding Iran's nuclear programme.

Water levels rise in dams after heavy downpour,"US
Heavy rain brings relief from heat in twin cities
A spell of heavy rain early Wednesday morning broke the intense heat in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad, bringing down temperatures and ending the humidity.
The weather turned pleasant, and water levels in underground reservoirs and major dams, including Rawal and Khanpur, have improved.
The Meteorological Department has forecast further rainfall, prompting the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) to declare a rain emergency.
Due to the downpour, the water level in Nullah Leh rose to 12 feet. Water also entered low-lying areas, including parts of Murree Road.
WASA teams, equipped with heavy machinery, were actively engaged in water drainage operations. Rainfall recorded in the twin cities exceeded 82 millimetres, with Islamabad's Saidpur village receiving the highest82mm.
Other areas recorded: Golra 25mm, Bokra 68mm, PMD 33mm, Shamsabad 56mm, Chaklala 53mm, and Pirwadhai 53mm. Nullah Leh's water level reached 12 feet at Katarian Bridge and 10 feet at Gawalmandi Bridge but began receding quickly after the rain stopped.
Following the rain, Member of National Assembly Tahira Aurangzeb, Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema, and WASA Managing Director Muhammad Saleem Ashraf visited Gawalmandi Bridge to assess the situation.
MD WASA noted that the water had passed through Nullah Leh rapidly due to timely cleaning efforts and said WASA remained on high alert in accordance with the weather department's forecasts. Staff leaves were cancelled, and personnel with machinery had been deployed in low-lying areas.
WASA MD is personally supervising the drainage operations.
He further stated that, on the directives of the Punjab Chief Minister, a rain emergency has been enforced.
Flood response camps have been established, staffed with personnel and equipment to handle any crisis. Monitoring of stormwater drains across the city continued, and no overflow incidents were reported.
WASA teams were stationed across multiple affected areas including Liaquat Bagh, Committee Chowk, Nadeem Colony, Arya Mohalla, Murree Road, Jamia Masjid Road, Sadiqabad, and Old Airport.

Anthropic wins copyright lawsuit battle,"LB
AI firm can now legally use books to train models
A federal judge in San Francisco ruled late on Monday that Anthropic's use of books without permission to train its artificial intelligence system was legal under US copyright law, reported Reuters.
Siding with tech companies on a pivotal question for the AI industry, US District Judge William Alsup said Anthropic made ""fair use"" of books by writers Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson to train its Claude large language model.
Alsup also said, however, that Anthropic's copying and storage of more than 7 million pirated books in a ""central library"" infringed the authors' copyrights and was not fair use. The judge has ordered a trial in December to determine how much Anthropic owes for the infringement.
US copyright law says that willful copyright infringement can justify statutory damages of up to $150,000 per work.
An Anthropic spokesperson said the company was pleased that the court recognised its AI training was ""transformative"" and ""consistent with copyright's purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.""
The writers filed the proposed class action against Anthropic last year, arguing that the company, which is backed by Amazon and Alphabet, used pirated versions of their books without permission or compensation to teach Claude to respond to human prompts.
The proposed class action is one of several lawsuits brought by authors, news outlets and other copyright owners against companies including OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta Platforms over their AI training.
The doctrine of fair use allows the use of copyrighted works without the copyright owner's permission in some circumstances.
Fair use is a key legal defense for the tech companies, and Alsup's decision is the first to address it in the context of generative AI.
AI companies argue their systems make fair use of copyrighted material to create new, transformative content, and that being forced to pay copyright holders for their work could hamstring the burgeoning AI industry.

Chelsea through to CWC knockouts,"FI
Benfica stun Bayern to set up clash with the Blues
Chelsea beat Esperance of Tunisia 3-0 on Tuesday to set up a Club World Cup last-16 tie against Benfica, who defeated Bayern Munich 1-0 earlier in searing heat.
Elsewhere minnows Auckland City claimed a memorable draw against Boca Juniors while Los Angeles FC bowed out of the tournament with a stalemate against Flamengo.
In Charlotte, Andreas Schjelderup scored the only goal for Benfica in their Group C clash with Bayern in front of 33,287 fans, finishing first-time from a cutback by his fellow Norwegian Fredrik Aursnes in the 13th minute. The German champions, who left the likes of Harry Kane and Michael Olise on the bench at kick-off, were unable to come back in sweltering afternoon conditions in heatwave-hit North Carolina.
Kane and Olise came on at half-time and Bayern did then look more dangerous, but Leroy Sane was denied when clean through by Benfica's Ukrainian goalkeeper Anatoliy Trubin.
A draw would have allowed Bayern to top the section but a Kimmich effort that found the net was ruled out for offside and Trubin denied Sane again while Kane mistimed a header late on.
It was Benfica's first ever win in 14 competitive meetings with Bayern and it meant they finished first and will next play Group D runners-up Chelsea in Charlotte in the last 16 on Saturday.
""I think this was a very fair and important win, historic really,"" said Benfica coach Bruno Lage.
""We were as straightforward and assertive as we should be and I think we were very effective in delivering our strategy today.""
Bayern finished second and so will go to Miami on Sunday to take on Brazilian giants Flamengo, with a potential quarter-final against European champions Paris Saint-Germain awaiting.
""You could see that it was really tough conditions so respect to both teams for that,"" said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany. ""Our first half was not good enough for sure, the second half was definitely more the level that we expected and good enough to score one or two or three goals.""
Another weather delay
That result meant whatever Boca did against Auckland City in Nashville would not be enough to qualify, but the Argentine giants were still expected to do better than draw 1-1 against the tournament minnows from New Zealand.
Auckland had lost 10-0 to Bayern and 6-0 to Benfica but this time they recovered from falling behind in the first half when goalkeeper Nathan Garrow palmed a Lautaro Di Lollo header into his own net. Christian Gray equalised with a header in the second half to earn the sole representatives from Oceania a remarkable point.
""You can't say we haven't learned from the experience of being at the tournament, I'm thrilled for the players and the club, it's wonderful. It's something to go home with,"" said City coach Paul Posa.
""We're a tiny club with a huge heart and that's evident for all to see.""
Delap off mark
The game was the fifth so far at the tournament to be suspended due to a weather warning, with play stopping for almost an hour -- when the action restarted not a drop of rain had fallen at Geodis Park.
Chelsea eased through to their meeting with Benfica with a clinical 3-0 win over Esperance at Lincoln Financial Field in Group D in Philadelphia.
New signing Liam Delap opened his account for the club with a deftly-taken finish in stoppage time at the end of the first half, just moments after Tosin Adarabioyo had headed the Blues in front.
Teeenage talent Tyrique George added Chelsea's third deep into injury time at the end of the game with a low shot that crept under Esperance goalkeeper Bechir Ben Said.
Flamengo, who had already assured themselves of top spot in the section after wins over Chelsea and Esperance, wrapped up their first-round campaign with a 1-1 draw against already-eliminated LAFC in Orlando.
Los Angeles forward Denis Bouanga threatened to give the MLS side an upset win in their final game of the tournament after a cool finish in the 84th minute, only for Wallace Yan to equalise for Flamengo two minutes later.
Elsewhere on Tuesday, FIFA opened a disciplinary investigation into Pachuca's Gustavo Cabral after allegations he made a racist comment to Real Madrid's Antonio Rudiger.
The incident came towards the end of Sunday's game between the two teams which Real won 3-1.

High-value transactions stay cash-based: SBP,"US
Despite 89% retail transactions being online, 71% prefer OTC, paper-based methods over trust concerns
High-value transactions in Pakistan continue to rely significantly on paper-based and over-the-counter (OTC) methods, indicating issues of trust or accessibility in digital high-value channels.
While 89% of Pakistan's retail payments are now conducted through digital channels, they represent just 29% of the total transaction value — Rs48 trillion out of Rs164 trillion — according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)'s latest Payment Systems Quarterly Review.
In stark contrast, OTC payments processed through bank branches and branchless banking agents, though only 11% by volume, account for a dominant 71% share in value.
This disparity highlights a key challenge in the country's digital transition: high-value transactions continue to rely heavily on cash and paper-based methods, suggesting ongoing trust, usability, or accessibility concerns in digital channels for large payments.
The SBP has released its Quarterly Payment Systems Review for Q3FY25, summarising trends in payment systems and presenting notable changes in the country's digital payment landscape.
Digital payments in the country continued their upward trajectory during Q3FY25, with substantial increases in transaction volume and value. Retail payment volumes climbed 12% to reach 2,408 million transactions, while the overall transaction value grew by 8% to Rs164 trillion. Digital channels accounted for 89% of all retail transactions. Mobile app-based platforms — including mobile banking apps, branchless banking (BB) wallets, and e-money wallets — collectively processed 1,686 million transactions worth Rs27 trillion, reflecting a 16% growth in volume and a 22% surge in value.
The number of users of digital banking services also witnessed a steady rise. Mobile banking app users grew to 22.6 million (up by 7%), e-money and BB wallet users increased to 5.3 million (up by 12%) and 68.5 million (up by 6%) respectively, while internet banking users reached 14.1 million (up by 7%).
Internet banking, despite a growing user base of 14.1 million, showed only marginal growth in transaction value, suggesting limited use beyond basic fund transfers. Meanwhile, call centre and Interactive Voice Response (IVR)-based banking has become virtually obsolete, raising concerns about service accessibility for digitally marginalised populations.
Credit card usage remains limited, with only 4% of the 57.5 million cards in circulation being credit cards.
E-commerce payments increased by 40% in volume to 213 million and by 34% in value to Rs258 billion compared to the previous quarter. Digital wallets were the largest contributors to e-commerce payments — 94% (199.1 million) by volume — while card-based online payments accounted for only 6% (13.5 million). For in-store purchases, 140,861 merchants processed 99 million (up 12%) transactions worth Rs550 billion (up 8%) using a network of 179,383 point-of-sale terminals. Additionally, merchants accepting QR codes processed 21.7 million transactions valued at Rs61 billion.
SBP-operated payment systems, Raast (Instant Payment System) and RTGS (Real-time Gross Settlement System), have been instrumental in accelerating digital payments. Raast processed 371 million transactions worth Rs8.5 trillion during the quarter, bringing cumulative volumes since its launch to 1.5 billion transactions and more than Rs34 trillion in value. Large-value payments via RTGS handled 1.5 million transactions amounting to Rs347 trillion.
Although Raast has seen strong growth in person-to-person (P2P) transfers, with transactions rising to 368 million, its person-to-merchant (P2M) component remains underutilised. Only 1.5 million P2M transactions worth Rs4.5 billion were recorded, despite onboarding over 770,000 merchants. This points to weak adoption of QR and account-based payments at retail points.
The shift towards a digital economy is well-supported by SBP's strategic initiatives, as well as the concerted efforts of banks, fintechs, and payment service providers, SBP stated. As digital payments expand, SBP remains committed to promoting financial inclusion and improving payment efficiency for all stakeholders.
Experts say the persistent dependence on cash, underdeveloped credit infrastructure, geographic disparities in digital access, and low interoperability across platforms are key hurdles to realising the full potential of digital financial inclusion in Pakistan.

UK envoy eyes Pakistani investors,"PK
Yasin calls on govt to provide stability, seize UK's open-door policy for trade
The United Kingdom's trade envoy to Pakistan, Mohammad Yasin, on Wednesday urged Islamabad to cement its relative economic stability and instil investor confidence, while also inviting Pakistani businesses to invest in the UK.
In an interview with The Express Tribune at the end of his three-day visit to Pakistan, Yasin noted that the country was doing better than it was two years ago in terms of economic and political stability.
""I would take the message that Pakistan is doing much better and is very serious, but it is a long road, and these policies need to be continued,"" said Yasin in response to a question.
The envoy visited Pakistan to explore investment opportunities and to encourage local businesses to consider investing in the UK. He also met with several politicians and with the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) to raise issues affecting UK investors.
Under the UK's 2035 growth policy, the country is seeking foreign investment across eight sectors, providing opportunities for Pakistani businesses as well.
Yasin said the bilateral trade volume between the two countries currently stands at £4.7 billion, which he described as insufficient. He added that there is no upper limit to increasing this figure by 2035. His message to Pakistan's leadership, he said, was that the UK is open for investment, and Pakistani companies should seize the opportunity.
""The UK is a haven for companies to invest in. We have launched a modern industrial strategy under the new government, focusing on eight different sectors. We are inviting companies from other countries to come invest in the UK — and we also want to invest in Pakistan.""
""Conversely, Pakistan must provide stability and confidence for UK investors,"" he added.
The envoy acknowledged improvements in Pakistan's economic and political environment over the past 18 months, but stressed the importance of consistent long-term policies, particularly under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, to maintain this trajectory.
""Everybody recognises that, compared to only two years ago, things are much better — there's no doubt about that. But things have not been progressing when compared with other developing countries. I think more still needs to be done,"" he said.
""A year and a half is a short time, and to attract long-term investment, you need to do more in the coming years,"" Yasin noted.
He said Pakistan's young population — 65% under the age of 30 — and the rising number of young entrepreneurs, especially women, were national strengths. While optimistic about the country's direction, he reiterated the need for sustained policy consistency to maintain investor confidence.
Yasin said bilateral trade could grow significantly and announced that a ministerial trade dialogue between the two countries would be held in the near future.
He added that the ministerial trade dialogue would focus on breaking down barriers that currently hinder UK investors. Trade teams from both countries are finalising the agenda for the meeting, which will take place in London.
""Security and stability are key factors for investors. Where they don't feel comfortable or confident, they simply do not invest,"" he said.
Asked about the sectors where Pakistan could boost exports, Yasin identified information technology and agriculture as key areas. ""We really want to encourage them to come over there,"" he added.
Yasin said the UK could provide technical expertise to Pakistan in mineral extraction. A UK company has already secured a £53 million contract, he said, while consulting firm McKinsey is advising the Pakistani government on the regulatory and fiscal framework for the mining sector.
He added that the UK is open to addressing Pakistan's concerns regarding non-tariff barriers and said these issues may be part of the upcoming ministerial agenda.
Yasin stressed that Pakistan must invest in its supply chains to help small and medium-sized enterprises scale into larger businesses. He also assured that the UK's Developing Countries Trading Scheme — its replacement for the EU's GSP+ — will continue uninterrupted.
""The UK is not in favour of protectionism and supports global and regional supply chains,"" he said.
""UK companies are keen to invest in Pakistan. Please give them some stability, some confidence, so they can invest here. They really want to come and invest,"" Yasin reiterated.
In response to another question, Yasin said the Pakistani government had taken steps in recent years that move toward long-term stability. However, he added, the country still needs sustained political, economic, and security stability to attract meaningful investment.
""Investors will invest if they feel confident that their money is safe,"" he said. ""Pakistanis living in the UK want to invest here to give back to the countrybut they haven't been able to do so,"" said Yasin, who was born in Pakistan.
He noted that UK companies continue to face challenges related to intellectual property rights and pharmaceutical pricing, particularly due to the classification of medicines as essential or non-essential. Yasin said he raised these concerns with the SIFC.

Capital lacks hostels for working women,"US
Former hostels in Sectors G-6 and G-7 remain non-functional
The federal capital currently lacks any operational government hostel for working women, a situation that has added to the challenges faced by female professionals in need of safe and affordable accommodation.
According to an official source, the Nusrat Hostel in Sector G-6, which previously served as a residence for working women, was converted into a Girls Child Protection Centre, which is also not functional at present. Similarly, the Staff Welfare Women Hostel in Sector G-7 was vacated approximately three months ago and has yet to be reopened.
Working women posted in various government departments, healthcare institutions and educational organisations have expressed concern over the lack of residential facilities in Islamabad. ""Affordable accommodation is a basic need. Without official hostels, we are left to search for expensive private options which are not always secure,"" said Sadia Khan, a school teacher from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. ""Many of us come from distant areas and do not have relatives here. Every month, a major portion of our salaries is spent on rent, which makes it difficult to manage other expenses,"" she said.
Samina Ali, a junior government officer from Punjab, shared her concern saying, ""When I was transferred to Islamabad, I assumed there would be hostel support. But despite repeated inquiries, there is no clear response or timeline for reopening these facilities."" She added that staying in private hostels comes with its own set of challenges, including limited facilities, frequent rent hikes and lack of proper security.
Farzana Bibi, a nurse working at a public hospital, noted, ""We work long shifts and need a safe place to rest. Living in shared private accommodations is neither ideal nor always safe. Government support in this regard would be greatly appreciated."" She emphasised that for female health workers and essential staff who often work night duties, proximity and safety are vital concerns that only official facilities can ensure.
When contacted, Member National Assembly Shahida Rehmani, former Senate Chairman Nayyar Hussain Bukhari and Senator Sherry Rehman acknowledged the issue and underlined the need for suitable residential arrangements for women professionals in the capital.
They expressed their commitment to raising the matter at relevant forums, emphasising that a secure and affordable living environment plays an important role in supporting women's participation in the workforce.
Concerned individuals and stakeholders have urged the relevant authorities to take necessary steps for the revival of previously functional hostels and the establishment of new facilities to cater to the increasing number of working women in Islamabad.

Woman accused of poisoning kids to death,"US
Claims she had threatened to hurt them during an argument
A tragic case in Rawalpindi's Banni Police Station area, Mohalla Raja Sultan, has taken a new turn as the father of three children, all of whom died under mysterious circumstances after reportedly ingesting a toxic substance, has accused his wife of deliberately killing them. A case has been registered by the police.
According to officials, the children's father, Salim Masih, filed a report at Banni Police Station, stating that he works as a sanitary worker at AFIC Hospital and lives with his extended family in a three-storey house. He was married to Zunaira Bibi six years ago. They had three children, four-year-old daughter Mansa, two-and-a-half-year-old son Noel and eight-month-old daughter Marisha.
Salim stated that on Friday, his wife took the children to visit her aunt in Gujranwala and returned on Sunday and that he did not approve of this visit. On Monday, an argument took place between the couple, during which he claims his wife said, I might do something to the children.
The next morning, he left for work around 7am. At approximately 2.30pm, a neighbour called him and told him that his children were unconscious and being rushed to hospital. When he reached Holy Family Hospital, all three children were already declared dead in the emergency ward. He was also informed that his wife was undergoing treatment there.
Salim expressed grave suspicion that his wife, Zunaira Bibi, may have poisoned or otherwise killed the children. He added that his life had been destroyed. An initial examination of the children's bodies revealed no external injuries. However, when a female constable examined Zunaira, scratch marks were found on her wrists.
Police have registered a murder case and launched an investigation. It's worth noting that Zunaira had initially claimed that she gave the children milk with breakfast, which she also consumed herself, after which the situation unfolded.
According to police officials, the wife is currently under medical care and has been placed in protective custody. Post-mortem examinations have been conducted on the children and results are pending. The investigation will proceed on merit based on forensic evidence and autopsy reports.

Venice says no to Bezos,"SG
Tech tycoon's wedding extravaganza continues to face backlash
Celebrities in superyachts sail into Venice this week for the three-day wedding party of Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, despite irate locals who say the UNESCO city is no billionaire's playground.
The tech magnate and journalist have reportedly invited about 200 guests to their multi-million dollar nuptials in the Italian city, which are expected to kick off on Thursday and end on Saturday with a ceremony at a secret location.
The security details are under tight wraps amid rumours the rite may take place at the historic Church of the Abbey of Misericordia, or at the Arsenale, a vast shipyard complex dating back to when the city was a naval powerhouse.
Bezos, 61, and former news anchor and entertainment reporter Sanchez, 55, are said to have booked out the city's finest hotels for a star-studded guest list rumoured to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and Ivanka Trump.
At least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport, the Corriere della Sera said.
And Bezos' mega-yacht, Koru, is likely to moor off the iconic San Giorgio Maggiore island, which sits just opposite St Mark's Square and has reportedly been booked in its entirety for the period.
Star-studded
The lavish celebration has sparked much soul-searching in Venice, where some fear so many A-list guests and their entourages will make life worse in a city already drowning under the weight of holidaymakers.
Around 100,000 tourists overnight in peak periods, while tens of thousands descend just for the day, many hopping off cruise ships for a quick Bellini cocktail, while the city steadily depopulates.
Venice happily hosted the star-studded nuptials of Hollywood actor George Clooney 11 years ago but protesters say Bezos – one of the world's richest men and founder of a company regularly scrutinised for how it treats its workers – is different.
As environmentalists questioned the guests' carbon footprint, Greenpeace slammed billions spent on hedonistic partying while the fragile city is ""sinking under the weight of the climate crisis"".
Sanchez has also been criticised for saying more must be done to tackle climate change while also taking part in a space flight in April on a rocket developed by Bezos's space company Blue Origin.
Activists unfurled a giant banner in St Mark's on Monday, with a picture of Bezos laughing and a sign reading: ""If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax"".
'Private ballroom'
Built on islands in a lagoon, the city has imposed a controversial ticket policy for day-trippers but locals say more must be done to protect local businesses and tackle the housing crisis.
Tommaso Cacciari, 47, who heads the No Space for Bezos movement, said the protesters object to ""the use of Venice as if it were a very private ballroom, rather than a real city with inhabitants, with frailties, with problems"".
He told AFP such events were ""condemning Venice to a definitive death"" by driving out remaining residents, but protesters were ready to kill the romance by throwing ""our bodies, our boats and inflatable animals"" into canals as guests pass.
The couple's Sicilian wedding planner Lanza & Baucina said they have been instructed to minimise any disruption to the city.
And Simone Venturini, Venice's tourism city councillor, denied it would disrupt daily life, telling AFP it was just ""one of many events that the city hosts on a daily basis. It is also relatively small in terms of the number of people involved"".
The couple, both divorced, have made charity donations to support the city and are employing historic Venetian artisans.
Venice's oldest pastry maker Rosa Salva is baking 19th-century ""fishermen's biscuits"" for party bags also expected to contain something by Laguna B, renowned for its handblown Murano glass.
While disgruntled citizens hoping to make a splash ready their swimming costumes, others flattered by Bezos's decision to celebrate here have set up a counter-group called ""Yes Venice Can"".
""It's a fragile city, that's clear, it's not like you can do everything all the time, no matter what – but events like this don't create any problems at all"", said 50-year-old local Michele Serafini.
The wedding ""brings money to the city of Venice"", and that can only be a good thing, he said.

Chase ready to lead much-changed Windies,"US
First Test of 
three-match series will be played at Kensington Oval
Change will be a key theme for both the West Indies and Australia in their upcoming three-test series in the Caribbean with the visitors set to field a remodelled batting line-up and the hosts being led out for the first time by Roston Chase.
Pat Cummins suggested Australia were due a top-order reset after their loss to South Africa in the World Test Championship (WTC) final earlier this month and the skipper said their line-up to face West Indies shows they are looking to the future.
Australia have brought in teenager Sam Konstas to open the batting with Usman Khawaja and added Josh Inglis to the line-up, while they will be without the dropped Marnus Labuschagne and injured veteran Steve Smith for a series which marks the start of both teams' new WTC cycle.
Both Konstas and Inglis have played only two tests, the former opening the batting against India in Melbourne and Sydney last season, and the latter batting in the middle order in Sri Lanka earlier this year. Australia could lose as many as half a dozen test regulars to retirement after this year's Ashes series with the likes of Khawaja, Smith, Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Nathan Lyon all in their mid to late 30s.
When asked about the changes ahead of the first match beginning in Bridgetown later on Wednesday, Cummins told reporters: ""You look forward to what the next couple of years are going to look like.
""I think part of that's a keenness to get Sam and Josh into the squad, into the playing 11. You start looking at what the batting order might look like for the next couple of years. I think that's part of the reset.
""And your goals change a little bit obviously. We're starting on zero points, so it's a bit of a mental reset. You block out the last couple of years and then start again.""
Cameron Green has retained his place at number three despite scoring only four runs and facing just five balls in the WTC final, with Cummins saying he viewed the 26-year-old all-rounder as a long-term option in the slot.
""He had a test match where it obviously didn't go to plan,"" he added.
""Think he only faced three or four balls, so the message is not to look into that too much. We're really happy with where his game's placed and I dare say we'll get a decent run of number three.""
Scars
Spin-bowling all-rounder Chase, who last played a test match in March 2023, will have his work cut out for him as he takes charge of a much-changed West Indies side who finished second bottom in the previous WTC cycle.
""You can expect positive cricket from us,"" Chase, who succeeded Kraigg Brathwaite as captain in May, told reporters.
""We're looking to play with a bit more flair and bring back that Caribbean style to the game, and we're looking forward to making the Caribbean nation proud.
""It's still test cricket, so you still have to have some type of patience, so it'll (be on) the guys to mix their aggression with that patience.""
The sides last met in a two-test series in January 2024 which ended all square after West Indies claimed a shock eight-run victory in the second test in Brisbane - their first test win over Australia since 2003.
""I hope there are some scars,"" Chase said.
""If they're still thinking about that match going out there on Wednesday, that would be very good for us – that will be part of the job done for us.""

Pak A tour of Aus
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Cricket Australia (CA) are mulling over to organise series between their A teams, U19, and women's teams, local media reported on Wednesday.
According to reports, the CA renewed confidence in Pakistan has significantly improved the chances of launching future pathway series, as both sides discuss to gather momentum.
PCB's high-performance centre has identified Australia among its key targets for bilateral cooperation aimed at the development of cricket.
Talks are currently underway regarding A team, U19 and women's team tours between the two nations.
The improved relationship between the PCB and Cricket Australia has already yielded positive results. A notable example is the increased participation of Pakistani players in the Big Bash League (BBL) this season.
In contrast to previous yearswhen players often faced delays in receiving No Objection Certificates (NOCs)this year, NOCs were issued before the draft, allowing players to participate without last-minute hurdles.
In addition to team tours, the PCB is also interested in launching academy exchange programs to further develop young talent.
PCB's Director of High Performance, Aqib Javed exploring opportunities for player exposure not just in Australia and England, but also in other cricketing nations.
He believed that strong international ties are essential to send more Pakistani players abroad for experience and growth.
With mutual trust being rebuilt, more Australian players are expected to be available for future editions of the Pakistan Super League (PSL).
Further strengthening ties, Cricket Australia's CEO recently confirmed Australia's tour of Pakistan next year, reinforcing the commitment to bilateral cricketing relations.
It is pertinent to mention that Pakistan cricket will resume action after a brief break with a tour of Bangladesh at the end of July, where they are scheduled to play a T20I series - although the schedule has not yet been officially released.
Following the Bangladesh tour, the Green Shirts will head to the West Indies, where a limited-overs series comprising three T20Is and three ODIs will begin from August one.
Saud slips in rankings
The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday unveiled the latest Test player rankings, with England's Joe Root holding firm at the top of the batting chart.
Root's consistent performances have solidified his Number one position among the world's elite Test batters.
Pakistan's Saud Shakeel, however, experienced a minor setback, slipping two spots to 10th place.
He remained the only Pakistani batter within the top 10 but now stands at risk of falling out of the elite group. Meanwhile, fellow Pakistani Mohammad Rizwan retained his 16th position.
In other notable movements, England's Harry Brook climbed to the second spot, continuing his impressive rise in international cricket.
India's young batter Yashasvi Jaiswal moved up to fourth, further cementing his place among the top Test batters.
Rishabh Pant's remarkable double-century performance during the Headingley Test against England propelled him up one spot to seventh.
England's Ben Duckett also made a significant gain, jumping five places to eighth following his valuable contribution to England's recent Test win.
In the bowling department, Pakistan's left-arm spinner Nauman Ali retained his fourth-place ranking, remaining the country's lone representative in the top 10.

Steps for climate-resilient agriculture explored,"SG
Pakistan, FAO express concern over increasing impact of climate change on farmers
Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain on Wednesday met with Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Representative to Pakistan Florence Rolle.
The meeting focused on enhancing cooperation to address Pakistan's agricultural challenges, ensure national food security and improve climate resilience across the sector.
During discussion, both sides expressed concern over the increasing impact of climate change on Pakistan's agriculture, including erratic weather patterns, prolonged droughts and pest outbreaks, which have disrupted crop cycles and affected smallholder farmers the most.
The minister noted that Pakistan, as an agro-based economy, was highly vulnerable to climate-induced stresses and it was critical to adopt innovative and sustainable approaches to protect crops and livestock.
Rana Tanveer Hussain highlighted the government's initiatives aimed at improving agricultural productivity such as facilitating the availability of certified seeds and fertilisers, introducing mechanised farming techniques and promoting modern irrigation methods.
FAO's Florence Rolle emphasised the importance of joint actions to improve food value chains, reduce post-harvest losses and promote digital technologies for farming communities.
She also called for focusing more on enhancing the capacity of farmers, especially women and youth, through training programmes and awareness campaigns.

NATO agrees massive spending hike,"US
32 countries to spend 5% of GDP on defence
NATO countries agreed Wednesday to massively ramp up their defence spending to satisfy US President Donald Trump, who hailed it as a ""monumental win"" for America — and reaffirmed his country's commitment to protect its European allies.
Trump cut a jubilant figure after NATO's 32 countries agreed to his headline target of five percent of GDP on defence spending following two days of talks in The Hague.
Taking credit for a ""fantastic"" outcome that ""no one really thought possible"", Trump described the spending hike as ""a monumental win for the United States"".
""They said you did it, sir,"" he told a news conference. ""Well I don't know if I did it — but I think I did.""
In a reassuring move for European allies worried over the threat from Russia, Trump signed off on a final leaders' declaration confirming ""our ironclad commitment"" to NATO's collective defence pledge that an attack on one is an attack on all.
NATO allies backed the spending increase to help counter a growing threat from Russia but also -- crucially -- to keep Trump engaged, with the US leader repeatedly suggesting Washington could withhold protection from lower-paying allies in Europe.
The deal appeared — for now at least — to have laid those gripes to rest.
The compromise hatched by NATO sees countries promise to dedicate 3.5 percent of GDP to core military spending by 2035, and a further 1.5 to broader security-related areas such as infrastructure.
While signing off on the target on paper, Spain has said it thinks it can fulfil NATO's demands while spending less — earning a fresh rebuke Wednesday from Trump, who threatened to hit its trade interests in response.
But the pledge endorsed in The Hague allows Trump to claim triumph, while in practice providing some wiggle room for cash-strapped governments in Europe.
Diplomats said that behind closed doors Trump had given strong assurances of Washington's commitment as an ally and urged others to spend some of the new money on US weaponry.
Everything was choreographed at the gathering in The Hague to keep the volatile US president on board: from chopping back the official part of the meeting to putting him up overnight in the royal palace.
Underpinning the leaders' discussions on defence was Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, and in another sop to the demands of allies the United States allowed NATO to refer to the ""long-term threat posed by Russia to Euro-Atlantic security"" in the communique.
Though its language was watered down from previous years, the declaration also said allies would continue to support Ukraine ""whose security contributes to ours"" and could use money from the new spending pledge to fund military aid for Kyiv.
Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky played a less central role here than at previous summits — with leaders wary of any bust-up after his infamous Oval Office shouting match with Trump.

Can our oil and gas sector keep pace with climate demands?,"PK
Pakistan remains one of the ten most climate-vulnerable countries.
As nations accelerate their shift to cleaner energy, Pakistan's continued dependence on fossil fuels, accounting for over 85% of its energy mix, presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The oil and gas sector — long central to powering homes, industries and transport — must now adapt to a shifting global landscape.
Pakistan remains one of the ten most climate-vulnerable countries. The 2022 floods, which inflicted over 30 billion dollars in damages and displaced millions, were a tragic reminder of this vulnerability. Worsening air quality, volatile energy prices and increasingly frequent climate-related disasters highlight the unsustainable nature of current energy practices.
Globally, the energy sector is undergoing transformation. British Petroleum has committed to cutting oil production by 40% while investing 5 billion dollars annually in low-carbon technologies. Shell is rapidly scaling up hydrogen and electric mobility infrastructure.
In Southeast Asia, Malaysia's Petronas is diversifying through climate bonds and renewable energy initiatives. These companies are not just reacting; they are redefining their role in a low-carbon economy. Pakistani firms must learn from these transitions.
Some positive developments are emerging locally. Mari Petroleum, now Mari Energies Limited, has joined the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter and issued its first integrated sustainability report — complete with a net-zero policy and a pilot carbon capture initiative that aims to store 1.6 million tonnes of carbon annually. OGDC and PPL have also joined the charter, indicating a shared commitment to decarbonization.
PSO, meanwhile, is advancing its clean-energy journey through steps like energy-audits and renewables planning, although it has not yet signed the charter. As a next step, all these companies can demonstrate leadership and enhance credibility in the global transition.
What is needed is not just technical upgrades but a mindset shift across the sector. Energy companies must integrate sustainability into all aspects of operations - from investment planning to workforce development.
This includes setting verifiable emissions reduction targets, investing in carbon capture technologies, piloting renewable energy projects and ensuring transparent environmental reporting.
Equally important is building internal climate literacy so that employees, leadership and stakeholders understand the long-term implications of their actions. Collaborations with international energy companies can further facilitate the transfer of green technologies and practices suited to Pakistan's conditions.
Policy support will play a crucial role in this transition. Regulators must enforce existing environmental standards, introduce practical incentives for clean energy and mandate public disclosure of emissions.
Meanwhile, solar and wind energy — despite their abundance — remain underexploited and skeptical among the masses. Reducing import duties on renewable energy equipment, encouraging local manufacturing and simplifying project approvals could significantly scale up adoption.
Thar's lignite coal reserves, while offering short-term energy relief, present a long-term environmental conundrum. Continued reliance on coal undermines Pakistan's international climate commitments. A more balanced path involves deploying cleaner coal technologies, tightening environmental oversight and concurrently expanding renewables to gradually displace coal's role in middle timeframe.
Looking ahead, the upcoming COP30 summit in Brazil offers a timely opportunity. In preparation, a national roundtable titled 'Road to COP30' brought together stakeholders, including regional ministers, policy experts and professionals.
The discussion emphasized strengthening regional cooperation, aligning domestic energy goals with climate resilience and fostering inclusive policymaking. These ideas now need to be translated into actionable strategies.
Pakistan must reform outdated practices, invest in clean technologies and embrace a future where environment sustainability and economic development go hand in hand. As the world moves toward a carbon-neutral future, Pakistan must not only follow — but lead. COP30 offers a moment not just to reflect, but to act.

Govt aims for 'dust-free Lahore',"US
Air pollution from infrastructure work to be curbed
As Lahore continues to struggle with a deteriorating air quality, the Punjab government has launched an initiative aimed at transforming the metropolis into Pakistan's first 'dust-free city'.
The plan comes at a time when the city's air pollution remains a significant public health concern.
On Wednesday, Lahore recorded an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 149, classified as ""unhealthy for sensitive groups,"" with PM2.5 concentration reaching 55 micrograms per cubic metre, far exceeding safe limits.
The worsening pollution levels, attributed to a mix of construction activity, vehicular emissions, industrial output, and seasonal factors, have prompted the authorities to act. Punjab Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Noorul Amin Mengal visited the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) headquarters to review ongoing and upcoming urban development projects. LDA Director General Tahir Farooq briefed him on environmental reforms being integrated into project planning and execution.
One of the key steps announced was the tightening of construction-related standard operating procedures (SOPs) to reduce airborne dust and pollution generated from infrastructure work.
A uniform development standard will be introduced across all government departments to improve sustainability, visual coherence, and regulatory enforcement in urban planning.
The meeting participants were told that the government also intends to legislate design guidelines for commercial property facades in a bid to reduce visual pollution and restore architectural harmony in the city.
In a parallel development, a wrap-up meeting was held with the World Bank's Implementation Mission for the Punjab Clean Air Programme, which was led by Transport Task Team Leader Shyam Srinivasan.

Addressing the National Assembly, Tarar expressed disappointment that what he expected to be constructive cut motions on human rights turned into political point-scoring. ""I had hoped that we would hear positive proposals during the cut motions on human rights,"" he said. He lashed out at the opposition for politicising the subject.
""The legislation we've passed should have been discussed. Instead, this important and innocent subject has been sacrificed at the altar of politics.""
Responding to criticism over the role of parliamentary committees, Tarar said there was no link between the federal budget and the standing committees.
Regarding the legal proceedings related to the May 9 riots, the law minister stated: ""I do not have the authority to pardon cases related to May 9.""
Tarar reminded the opposition to respect parliamentary norms. ""Instead of focusing on national priorities like the budget, they are busy recording petty grievances and sending them to Adiala Jail,"" he added.
Calling the federal budget a ""serious national matter,"" the minister urged a more mature approach. ""Let's not forget the sacrifices of our leaders ... Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto laid down his life for the truth. Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz have also endured persecution,"" he said.

Chinese Defence Minister Dong held individual meetings with his counterparts
The defence ministers of Pakistan and India may meet for the first time since last month's four-day military conflict, as both Khawaja Asif and his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh are attending a Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) meeting in China.
The two-day SCO defence ministers' summit has begun in Qingdao City, located in China's eastern Shandong Province. The meeting is being hosted by Chinese Defence Minister Dong Jun. Both Singh and Asif are present for the event.
It is the first time since Marka-e-Haq that the high-ranking officials from both the countries will be present at the same event. On the sidelines of the event, a meeting could take place between the two ministers, according to Express News report.
On the first day of the meeting, Chinese Defence Minister Dong held individual meetings with his counterparts from Belarus, Iran, Pakistan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia. In the meetings, he stressed the need for international fairness and justice, and upholding global strategic stability.
The defence ministers meeting was preceded by the meeting of the security council secretaries of the SCO member countries on Tuesday. At the meeting, Pakistan was represented by the national security adviser (NSA), according to a news release.
During the visit, the NSA met with the Chinese leadership and the delegates attending the meeting and discussed ways to enhance bilateral and security cooperation, and reiterated Pakistan's stance on the global, regional situation and contributions to peace and security.
The NSA emphasised on Pakistan's desire for a stable and peaceful neighbourhood and its role as a 'net regional stabiliser', the news release said. Chinese Public Security Minister Wang Xiaohong called on the SCO states to deepen practical cooperation on law-enforcement and security.
Wang put forward a five-point proposal at the meeting, calling on SCO member states to practice true multilateralism and provide solutions to global challenges, and remain committed to sharing weal and woe and shielding against interference from forces outside the region.
he called for enhancing regional counter-terrorism capabilities, improving cooperation mechanisms and strengthening their platforms, combating emerging transnational crimes, and deepening exchanges to provide experience for the development of a global community of security for all.

We Were Liars' writer credits social media for fame,"SG
E Lockhart grateful for creative TikTokkers
It is the stuff of every writer's fantasies: wow the world with a bestseller and then watch it played out on screen as a beloved TV series.
It was certainly the dream cherished by We Were Liars author E Lockhart, who penned the 2014 bestselling YA novel about the wealthy Sinclair family in their extravagant home on a private island. And now with her novel having found new life as an eight-episode Prime video series of the same name (thanks, in part, to a revival by Tiktok), Lockhart reminisces to The Hollywood Reporter about how her book may have never have taken off the way it has without the intervention of social media.
""We Were Liars was my best-selling book when it first came out, and then, as it always happens, it was no longer a best-seller, and I went on to write other novels,"" recalls the novelist. ""And then in 2020, when we were all living through the pandemic, Tiktok creators started making a new kind of book recommendation video that was very exciting and very creative.""
The We Were Liars adaptation, which Lockhart reveals had been in development ever since the book came out, follows a non-linear structure in which an amnesiac Cadence is trying to piece together a tragedy that has occurred. Ugly secrets and well-knitted lies to bubble to the surface before exploding into a delicious twist that continues to enthral viewers and readers alike. The show stars Emily Alyn Lind, Esther McGregor, Shubham Maheshwari and Joseph Zada.
With quirky reviews from content creators reeling viewers into the world she had created, Lockhart elaborated how new readers discovered her book. ""Instead of simply saying, 'Hey, here's a book I like. Maybe you would like it too and here's why,' they were making aesthetic videos that brought readers into the world of this privately owned island off the coast of Massachusetts with pictures of kids jumping off cliffs to go swimming and bonfires on the beach and summer love and all of that.""
Such recommendations proved to be the springboard that started conversations. ""The other kind of videos they made were very vulnerable videos of themselves reading the ending to the novel and responding to it,"" said Lockhart. ""And sometimes they were throwing the book across the room. Sometimes they were weeping copiously, and snot was dripping out of their nose and mascaras running on their face. And so people were either exercising their creative [outlet] or sharing their vulnerability.""
Lockhart credits such committed reviewers for bringing We Were Liars into the limelight again. ""I felt very lucky that my book was one of several that got that kind of attention,"" she admits.

PM Shehbaz seeks report on smart meters installation,"SG
.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that provision of relief to the public and uninterrupted power supply to industries, through reforms in the power sector, were among the top priorities.
The prime minister chaired a review meeting on the ongoing power sector reforms.
The prime minister directed swift completion of the second and third phases of privatization of loss-making GENCOs and further instructed that the GENCOs' auction process should be broadcast live on the media, just like other privatization programmes, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The prime minister emphasised expediting the privatization of power distribution companies.
During the meeting the prime minister called for an early report after the installation of smart meters was completed. He said that the federal government had completed the solarization of tube wells in Balochistan, which would enhance the province's agricultural productivity.
The meeting received a detailed briefing on ongoing reforms and projects related to electricity generation, transmission and distribution.
It was informed that the first phase of the privatization of outdated and loss-incurring GENCOs was completed, generating revenue of Rs9.05 billion for the national exchequer.
The second and third phases were underway at a fast pace. To ensure transparency, the auction proceedings were being broadcast live.
The meeting was further informed that successful negotiations were held with 36 Independent Power Producers (IPPs) regarding electricity tariffs, resulting in projected savings of Rs. 3.69 trillion for the national treasury.
The prime minister also instructed that the establishment of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across the country be accelerated and directed that proposed projects to improve the power transmission and distribution system be initiated promptly.
NTDCL, the national transmission company, had been dissolved and replaced with the Energy Infrastructure Development Company and the National Grid Company, which were now being assigned their respective responsibilities, it was added.
The meeting was also briefed that the process of setting up EV charging stations nationwide is progressing rapidly.
An online portal was activated to receive applications for establishing charging stations, through which 120 applications were received.

Rizwan vows to serve Pak athletes,"US
Director National Hospital DHA aims to make country shine in nutraceutical world
If one has the privilege, it is incumbent upon them to use it for the benefit of others, and Registered Dietician Rizwan Aftab Ahmad is ensuring he fulfills his duty.
""It is about building a legacy and continuing one to serve the country for me,"" he explained in the exclusive conversation with this correspondent.
The 44-year-old is leading a movement that involves most of the top Pakistani athletes that can help spread awareness about health and the importance of meeting dietary needs while sponsoring them for events abroad and taking care of their general medical treatment and specialised treatment for sportspersons.
It has been almost two years that leading Pakistani stars like the Paris Olympic gold medallist and record-maker Arshad Nadeem, Paralympics multi-medallist including, the 2020 Tokyo Olympic discus thrower Haider Ali, and the Commonwealth Games record-setting weightlifter Nooh Dastgir Butt among others are all endorsing the multi-vitamin and multi-mineral supplement Activit brand.
The Activit roster of several athletes and legends includes cricketers like Salman Agha and Shan Masood along with Shoaib Akhtar as well.
At first, it looked like any other company sponsoring the leading talent, but there is more than meets the eye.
Rizwan is filling a gap for athletes as the Director at National Hospital DHA, Lahore, where he provides them with free medical treatment for life. The same free-of-charge treatment is extended to the family members of these athletes as well.
One of the examples of how he has subtly helped shape the Pakistani sports landscape was by assuring Arshad received adequate treatment for his long-standing elbow and knee injuries throughout 2023 and before going to the Paris Olympics. Rizwan was instrumental in getting Dr Ali Bajwa from England on Arshad's case.
It was a connection that Arshad and, consequentially, Pakistan hugely benefited from when the 28-year-old became the first Pakistani to win an Olympic gold medal in 40 years.
Had Dr Bajwa not come into the picture, Arshad's recovery would have been even more painful, jeapardising his chances of winning the international accolades.
Rizwan's empathy for the athletes comes from the fact that his grandfather Iftikhar Ahmed Shah was a trailblazing swimmer who represented Pakistan in the 1948 Olympics and his third great-grandfather Raja Ghazanfar Ali Khan served as Pakistan's Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Health after 1947 and was the first president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation and later served as a diplomat.
Given the state of neglect by the government and even the sports bodies when it comes to athlete welfare, Rizwan and his brand have been helping them to go to international events, financing those trips but mainly completely setting the athletes free of the burden of medical expenses and giving them the access to the best facilities completely free of charge.
But its vision remains that athletes can spread the awareness of a healthier lifestyle and Pakistanis too can have a shot at affordable supplements that are essential for good health, however, they do not get them due to poor quality of food products.
""The driving force behind supporting the athletes and also making this product that can help everyone is patriotism and activism, there is the need to serve my country, it has been a tradition of my family and so I am walking in those footsteps,"" the Aitchisonian and Queen's University Canada graduate told this correspondent.
He has certification as a registered dietitian and men's health specialist (Cornell University & Harvard Medical School) in his credentials, but mostly his pride comes from the rich heritage of his family he has been well-respected and even revered as Syed Ghulam Haider Shah, Rizwan's the 4th great-grandfather from his maternal side, was a spiritual figure of Jalalpur Shareef, whereas from his paternal side he is related to Faiz Ahmed Faiz. The Cambridge-educated diplomat Sultan Muhammad Khan, Faiz's father, was Rizwan's great-grandfather.
""It is about the optimal lifestyle that people can achieve. I have seen people in their 80s and 90s who feel great but those in their 30s don't, and there comes the difference in the diet and the nutrients they are getting from it,"" Rizwan highlighted.
The young CEO believes that while he is serving the athletes and the people of the country from Activt Foundation, his true motivation comes from the example of his father Prof. Dr. Aftab Ahmed, who is a pioneer of orthopedic surgery in Pakistan, founder of National Hospital DHA Lahore and the first Orthopedic Wing at Services Hospital.

England knew they could 'blow match apart': Stokes,"US
The hosts snatched a five-wicket victory against India in Leeds
England captain Ben Stokes praised his side's approach after they pulled off a remarkable five-wicket win over India in the first Test at Headingley on Tuesday. Ben Duckett's superb 149 paved the way for England's ultimately comfortable pursuit of 371 on the last day as Stokes' men once more made light of a seemingly stiff chase with the dynamic batting that has been a hallmark of their play in the 'Bazball' era of coach Brendon McCullum.
England twice conceded totals in excess of 350 in the first of this five-match series but managed to inflict late-order collapses of 7-41 and 6-31 that proved costly for India.
""There's been a lot of skill that has contributed to us winning this Test match but our attitude as well,"" said Stokes. ""Every session we turned up with the attitude that we could blow this match apart. This was England's second-highest fourth-innings run-chase, just behind the 378-3 they managed also against India at Edgbaston not long after Stokes and McCullum joined forces as captain and coach.
""I think we're just a very simple-minded pair, me and Baz (McCullum), when it comes to cricket,"" Stokes said.
""Everyone knows what cricket is about, it's about scoring more runs than the opposition. When you strip it all back, that's it...When you're chasing totals like that, how you are in the dressing room is very important.""
Duckett had one moment of good fortune when he was dropped on 97 on Tuesday but the 30-year-old Nottinghamshire opener was otherwise in commanding form.
Together with Zak Crawley (65), he laid the foundation for victory against an India attack featuring Jasprit Bumrah, the world's number one-ranked Test bowler, with an outstanding first-wicket partnership of 188.
""Ducky has been incredible since coming into the team,"" Stokes said. ""He's shown he can score runs pretty much all over the world in any conditions he's faced with.""
He added: ""Ducky got the 149 but Zak was so, so important, too. They complement each other so well. I'm sure you could ask the opposition bowlers about why they're a nightmare when they are in for a long period.""
Stokes's decision to field first after winning the toss in seemingly ideal batting conditions was criticised by former England captain Michael Vaughan
But all-rounder Stokes added: ""It's a good job Test cricket is played over five days. You make a decision and you don't know what is going to happen.""
India coach Gautam Gambhir said the tourists would still stand by their plan to play Bumrah — who, remarkably, went wicketless in the second innings at Headingley — in just three of the five Tests to preserve his fitness following a back injury.
""We won't change the plans,"" Gambhir said after India's attack rarely threatened on the final day in Leeds.
""To manage his workload is more important. Before he came on this tour, it was already decided he would play three Tests but let's see how his body turns out.""

PA passes key budget grants,"US
Rs638 billion approved for five departments amid opposition's criticism
The Punjab Assembly on Wednesday approved over Rs638 billion in grants for five major departments by rejecting all cut motions moved by the Opposition, which had questioned the government's policies and the performance of various sectors.
Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman presented the grants following the conclusion of the general discussion on the 202526 annual budget, which spanned five consecutive days.
The session was presided over by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan.
The grants passed include Rs200.10 billion for the police, Rs26.53 billion for agriculture, Rs258.97 billion for health services, Rs137.53 billion for education and Rs15.16 billion for public health. The Opposition's attempts to reduce allocations were firmly defeated by the treasury benches, which maintained majority support throughout the proceedings.
During the session, Opposition lawmakers, particularly from the PTI, criticised the police department, accusing it of political victimisation.
They alleged that police had registered fake cases against PTI leaders and failed to perform its primary duties of maintaining law and order.
PTI MPA Sheikh Imtiaz called for urgent police reforms and the depoliticisation of the force, while Ijaz Shafi claimed the police were ineffective and accused them of wasting taxpayer money, asserting that they could not even deal with local outlaws.
On the agriculture front, the Opposition questioned the allocation of Rs26.53 billion, arguing that the sector had been mismanaged and neglected.
PTI's Farhat Abbas alleged that the government had failed to support farmers or even produce quality seeds.
In response, Agriculture Minister Syed Muhammad Ashiq Hussain Shah defended the allocation, highlighting several initiatives, including the introduction of a fertiliser act, zoning for early cotton sowing, and provision of tractors to high-yield wheat farmers.
He added that Rs32 billion had been earmarked for water conservation and another Rs30 billion for interest-free loans to purchase agricultural machinery.
He claimed the government had already disbursed Rs80 billion to farmers and intended to increase this to Rs200 billion.
The Opposition also raised concerns over the health sector, citing Pakistan's low global ranking and the growing number of drug addicts and shortage of medical professionals. However, Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique rejected these criticisms and detailed several major initiatives undertaken by the government.
He said 100 beds had been allocated for advanced-stage cancer patients at the Nawaz Sharif Cancer Hospital, while new cardiology hospitals were under construction in Sargodha and Sahiwal.
Burn units were also being established in Bahawalpur and Rahim Yar Khan, and over 900 medical clinics had been set up in underserved areas.
In the education sector, the government approved a grant of Rs137.53 billion, again brushing aside Opposition objections.
A grant of Rs15.16 billion was also approved for public health, with the government defending its approach to improving services through partnerships and infrastructure upgrades.
In his concluding remarks, Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman described the budget as balanced and people-centric, claiming it reflected the aspirations of the common man. He said the government had made difficult but necessary decisions.

Govt employees jam Peshawar in protest,"SG
Block Khyber Road, demand federal-style pay raise, pension restoration
The provincial capital witnessed a complete traffic standstill on Wednesday as thousands of government employees took to the streets, staging a massive protest and sit-in at Assembly Chowk that blocked Khyber Road and other key arteries, including access routes to hospitals, for over 10 hours.
The protest, organised under the banner of the Government Employees Grand Alliance, began with a rally that marched from Government High School No. 1 to Assembly Chowk.
Protesters raised slogans demanding a salary hike in line with federal scales, a minimum wage of Rs50,000 for labourers, and the restoration of the previous pension mechanism.
Participants included members from all major departments, including teachers, clerks, and Lady Health Workers. The demonstrators rejected the recently introduced Contributory Pension Scheme (CPC), insisting on a return to the traditional pension model.
In addition to salary parity and pension reform, protesters demanded the fulfilment of previous promises regarding the upgradation of teachers, and called for Lady Health Workers to be granted BPS-9 and BPS-15 based on seniority.
Protesters said they had already held talks with the provincial finance adviser, but claimed he refused to accept their demands.
As the demonstration entered its final stages, government representatives extended an invitation for negotiations.
Talks were held between union leaders and a government committee, during which employees were assured that their demands would be reviewed and their concerns addressed.
After several hours of protest, and in light of the government's assurance, the sit-in was called off peacefully.

"Diddy trial finishes, closing arguments next","SA
Disgraced rapper faces life in prison if convicted
Both legal teams in the trial of Sean ""Diddy"" Combs rested their case on Tuesday, ushering in the final phases of the high-profile proceedings gripping a Manhattan federal courthouse.
US prosecutors finished questioning their 34th and final witness in the seventh week of testimony, after which the defense delivered a brief case in which they opted against calling anyone further to the stand.
That included Combs himself: it is common for defendants not to testify in their own trial, as taking the mic could open them up to potentially incriminating themselves.
In a short, standard exchange with Judge Arun Subramanian, Combs confirmed that he would not take the stand on his own behalf.
""Is it your decision not to testify in this case?"" the judge asked, to which Combs responded: ""That is my decision, your honour.""
""It is solely my decision,"" he continued, before adding that he came to that conclusion ""with my lawyers.""
""It's my decision to make. I'm making this freely.""
The defense rested after presenting a number of exhibits, a process that lasted less than half-an-hour.
It's not abnormal for defense teams to opt against presenting witnesses; the obligation to prove guilt lies on prosecutors, and unless jurors decide they have, the defendant is presumed innocent.
Marathon closing arguments are expected to begin on Thursday, after which jurors will be tasked with deciding the fate of the 55-year-old Combs, who faces life in prison if convicted on charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation for purposes of prostitution.
Also on Tuesday the defense presented to the judge their acquittal motion – an argument that the prosecution has not met its burden of proof for each of the five charges.
Such efforts are common in these types of cases, but acquittals are almost never granted.
Since early May, prosecutors have aimed to draw connections across a web of witnesses, phone records and travel bookings in a bid to show that Combs was the kingpin of an enterprise that carried out crimes including bribery, arson and kidnapping to enforce his power and satisfy his every desire.
The prosecution said the artist and entrepreneur trafficked women and men for drug-fueled sexual marathons, sometimes days-long encounters dubbed ""freak-offs"" or ""hotel nights.""
Some of the events were filmed, and jurors have watched a number of sexually explicit clips.
Government attorneys closed their questioning by offering reams of text messages and other records for jurors to review, documentation of dozens of freak-offs that they say also shows arrangements for prostitution and trafficking.
Combs denies all charges.

Amateurs Auckland City hold Boca Juniors,"FI
Both sides settled with a 1-1 draw in Nashville
Amateur side Auckland City earned the greatest result in the team's history with a 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors at the Club World Cup on Tuesday.
The already-eliminated New Zealanders fought off the Argentine powerhouses, who entered the game with hopes of advancing if they won, although as Benfica beat Bayern Munich in the other Group C match, Boca would also have been ousted anyway.
Auckland goalkeeper Nathan Garrow's own goal sent Boca ahead but Christian Gray equalised with a header in the second half to earn his team a remarkable point.
After a weather delay, Boca kept pushing and racked up 40 shots but could not find a way past Garrow, who made up for his first half misfortune with several good saves.
Auckland, who were crushed 10-0 by German giants Bayern in their first game and 6-0 by Benfica in the second, set up to defend with five at the back and it paid off.
""It's been a tough trip, we've had some tough results but I'm just happy for the team and the boys, I think we deserve it, we got a little bit of respect back I hope,"" Auckland goalscorer Gray told DAZN.
""We rely on volunteers, we don't have a lot of money, so I'm just happy that (everyone) is happy...
""It's been a long four years to be honest, building up to this... (I'm) a little bit lost for words.""
As amateurs Auckland City players have regular jobs, with Gray working as a teacher.
""I've got a few assignments that have piled up over the last month, so that's what I'll be going back to, and the school holidays thankfully,"" he added.
Boca controlled the game but were slow in their build up and struggled to break down the New Zealanders' back-line, with 38-year-old veteran striker Edinson Cavani kept quiet.
The minnows had the first chance of the game, with Regont Murati forcing a save from Agustin Marchesin from the edge of the box.
Boca took the lead after 26 minutes when Lautaro Di Lollo's header from a corner hit the post and was palmed into his own net by Garrow.
Boca twice came close to doubling their lead before the break, with Carlos Palacios whipping a shot from distance against the crossbar. Then, Miguel Merentiel's header hit the woodwork as well.
Auckland, the only amateur side in the competition, scored their first goal of the tournament to level after 52 minutes.
Defender Gray shook off his marker and headed home from Jerson Lagos' corner.

Grok shows 'flaws' in fact-checking Israel-Iran war: study,"US
Raising fresh doubts about its reliability as a debunking tool.
Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok produced inaccurate and contradictory responses when users sought to fact-check the Israel-Iran conflict, a study said Tuesday, raising fresh doubts about its reliability as a debunking tool.
With tech platforms reducing their reliance on human fact-checkers, users are increasingly utilizing AI-powered chatbots — including xAI's Grok — in search of reliable information, but their responses are often themselves prone to misinformation.
""The investigation into Grok's performance during the first days of the Israel-Iran conflict exposes significant flaws and limitations in the AI chatbot's ability to provide accurate, reliable, and consistent information during times of crisis,"" said the study from the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) of the Atlantic Council, an American think tank.
""Grok demonstrated that it struggles with verifying already-confirmed facts, analyzing fake visuals, and avoiding unsubstantiated claims.""
The DFRLab analyzed around 130,000 posts in various languages on the platform X, where the AI assistant is built in, to find that Grok was ""struggling to authenticate AI-generated media.""

When facts are rumoured to be conspiracy theories,"US
Israel controls America from within is not a conspiracy theory.
Journalists and book authors have spent a considerable amount of time and writing to teach us all about how to do authentic research so as not to consider conspiracy theories as facts.
Conspiracy theories are usually designed in such a way that they're not only entertaining for the human mind to quickly embrace it but also are quite unintelligent and helps lazy minds to settle an issue without much thinking to do about it. There's more entertainment in them than any rationality.
However, understanding the reverse is perhaps equally, if not more, important. What if certain facts are wrongly understood to be conspiracy theories because they're too cheesy and too unrealistic. Before I delve into that, let me give you a bit of a context.
I grew up in Pakistan watching Hollywood movies. There would be violent scenes of guns being used and serial killers killing innocent people without reason or remorse. I always thought movie makers had to spice things up for entertainment purposes and that in the real world things weren't this extreme.
Then I came to America. After more than a decade of living here, I realised what they showed in the movies didn't even amount to 10% of the truth. The truth here is a lot more violent and a lot worse.
When it comes to Israel and America, I always heard from almost all sources that usually spin out conspiracy theories that America was owned and controlled by the Jewish lobbies. I am sure you've seen the film The Arrivals. It was entertaining but quite conspiracy theories filled. Well, maybe not so much.
Israel controls America from within is not a conspiracy theory. Almost every, if not every, politician comes to public office shining up his credentials that he or she will be a fierce and loyal defender of Israel.
The United States gives billions to Israel, which uses a good amount of that money to donate to politicians and public officer holders through lobbying groups such as AIPAC. Then they're asked to make policies and laws that will be good for Israel but harmful for America most of the time. It's a vicious cycle.
In 2017, there was a massive hurricane that hit Texas. It was called Hurricane Harvey. Businesses and personal properties were damaged. My business, car and other items were damaged completely. The state of Texas was providing relief help only to those who'd pledge not to boycott Israel.
I mean think about it for a minute; I being an American citizen and an American business am required to show loyalty to a foreign country in order to get help from my own country. That fact alone is crazier than the most bizarre conspiracy theories that ever existed. Israel uses American money to control America.
One might conclude that it's money. Not so fast. Because the Saudis have a lot more money than a mere few billions. No American politician sticks a Saudi flag outside their office with the text ""I stand with Saudi Arabia"".
The Israelis have spent almost half a century, if not more, in creating this false narrative and convinced the American people of it that the Holy Bible commands that Israel must be protected, that American values align very neatly with Jewish teachings, that the interests of America and Israel are one and the same, that Israel is the victim, that they are the chosen people who are the rightful owners of that land because they were there 2000 years ago.
None of it is true but these falsehoods are enough tools to scare any politician who might have funny ideas about the freedom of Palestine. AIPAC uses scare tactics to remind such politicians about the money and the zombified, if you will, electorate that stays high on the 'chosen ones' nonsense.
Once this chokehold is understood, then every nonsense that America does starts making sense.

The war is over — for now,"SG
Iran claims the site was already evacuated.
Finally, at the desperate urging of PM Netanyahu, the US on June 21, 2025, in a complex attack involving around 125 aircraft, including seven B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, and one submarine bombed three Irani nuclear sites at Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.
The US dropped fourteen 30,000 pounds GBU-57 bunker busting MOP (massive ordnance penetrator) at Fordow and Natanz and fired around 75 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, mainly at the Isfahan site.
The Virginia-based B-2s flew in two directions on takeoff, one component heading towards Guam for deception, and the other towards the Middle East. The sites already pulverised by the IAF revisits were described as 'obliterated' by President Trump.
Fordow, containing around 3,000 sophisticated centrifuges in two enrichment halls, was attacked through ventilation shafts at two points, and GBU-57s seems to have ""severely damaged but not destroyed"" it, as per US officials.
Iran claims the site was already evacuated. Natanz, the largest uranium enrichment centre, had earlier sustained 11 explosions in Israel's clandestine operation in 2020. IDF destroyed its above ground structures and electric supply on June 13. The US strikes extensively damaged its underground enrichment centrifuges.
The Isfahan complex, outside the ancient Isfahan capital, was a storage site for the near bomb-grade nuclear fuel. IDF struck its laboratories that convert Uranium gas into the substance needed to produce a weapon. IAF jets again targeted it on June 21, before the US bombing. Satellite images show extensive damage.
Israel's no-holds-barred illegality aside, the US attack on another country's nuclear sites was unprecedented, and sets a new normal by the sole superpower, that can and would be emulated in future conflicts with immense consequences.
It renders the sanctity of nuclear sites even during active hostilities, null and void. India Pakistan regularly exchange the locations of their nuclear installations to avoid even accidental targeting. This situation under Modi's India, following Netanyahu's template, now stands altered.
The question whether the US attack destroyed Iran's nuclear programme is debatable. The main site at Fordow is reportedly hardened using steel and concrete and is around 800 metres deep. It has uninterrupted and multiple sources of power for the thousands of humming centrifuges, that so far has provided Tehran with over 400 kg of Uranium (enough for some 9 nuclear bombs), reportedly enriched up to 60%, a little below the weapons grade enrichment of around 80-90%.
At that depth, even tandem employment of GBU-57 at the same point of application may not have caused the desired damage. Iran would have stored the enriched uranium safely elsewhere, and most likely shifted some critical infrastructure to other unknown, undeclared and undetected sites beforehand. So, it is safe to assume that Iran's nuclear programme is mauled, delayed but probably not eliminated.
So, the next logical step for the West Plus is to pressurise Iran to sign the much-touted nuclear deal, and force Tehran to agree to cap and roll back its nuclear programme. For this, Iran will continue to be threatened using all means, with or without the US involvement.
Iran was politically compelled to respond to the US aggression especially for regime survival, by considering: a) a limited and calibrated response, without undue escalation; b) escalating and targeting some of the 19 US bases in the Middle East, especially in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and GCC etc; and c) blocking the Strait of Hormuz, carrying over 20% global oil flows, to upend the world energy market.
Iran wriggled out of its 'response dilemma' by hitting the sprawling Al Udaid US base in Qatar on Monday, pre-coordinated with Qatar and the US. This limited response avoided further retaliatory strikes and enables Iran to undertake legal, diplomatic and political recourse and advantage, subsequently during negotiations. On June 24, President Trump dramatically announced a complex ceasefire deal after extensive behind-the-scenes parleys during the 12-day crisis.
Israel emerged neither victorious nor unscathed from the relentless Irani hypersonic missile response, lately penetrating through its multi-layered AD system, comprising Arrow Missiles, David's Sling and Iron Dome.
The system, reportedly, showed signs of wear and tear, and suffered from non-availability of required munitions even with the US. This costly AD system (costing some 167 million USD per engagement) was swarmed, saturated and exhausted repeatedly by low-cost Irani drone and missile combos, in layers.
Deterioration of the AD situation was compelling IDF to let some missiles through, to focus on the incoming warheads against critical assets. The estimated percentage of such uncontested and otherwise penetrating ballistic missiles remained over 11% — very significant for a small country like Israel.
On June 23, immediately after the US strikes, Irani onslaught continued for the longest time — some 40 minutes. Iran also successfully targeted Israeli settlements on occupied lands, causing mass exodus of Jewish settlers.
Besides, many Israelis were fleeing to Ukraine, Poland, etc, to a not very warm welcome. Antisemitism spiked high for the 'child killers of Gaza' as reported by the international press. The over 600-day wars left deep scars on the already stressed Israeli state, society, psyche and armed forces. This exhaustion was to naturally lead to a ceasefire.
As a consequence, the regime in Tehran is more firmly entrenched for now, Iran's nuclear programme seems to have survived the strongest possible challenge, and its missiles proved decisive. The US-Israeli nexus does not seem to have achieved the intended military objectives of war.
This intense conflict again demonstrated, like the Afghan wars, the success of mass against technological superiority in a modern conflict. This carries profound lessons for countries like Pakistan. This conflict also validates the age-old dictum of 'might is right', demonstrating to the week that rules, regulations and statutes are only for them.
The strong can trample them with impunity. This war will, heretofore, intensify the race to acquire nuclear weapons globally, hitting at the very basis of non-proliferation. Iran may be restrained for some time, but a nuclear Iran in the mid to long-term is a reality, that Israel will have to live with, with or without the Ayatollahs in power.
For Pakistan, investment in drone and missile technologies, asset hardening especially the nuclear sites, counterintelligence, AD and PAF are critical now, like never before.

Siblings held for blackmailing women,"SG
Suspects allegedly record explicit videos of unsuspecting female friends
The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Rawalpindi has arrested three siblings involved in blackmailing women by secretly recording and storing inappropriate videos and images.
According to officials, the group — comprising two sisters and a brother — befriended unsuspecting women and introduced them to the male sibling. Once trust was established, the trio manipulated the victims into situations where compromising content could be secretly recorded.
This material was later used to threaten the victims and demand money.
On the complaint of one of the victims, Additional Director Mehmoodul Hassan Satti instructed Circle In-charge Nadeem Ahmed Khan to conduct a thorough inquiry.
After confirming the allegations, authorities registered a case under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) and other relevant laws.
The accused were apprehended using modern digital tracking and intelligence-based operations.
Officials recovered mobile phones from the suspects containing explicit videos, images, and chat records.
The recovered material is currently undergoing forensic analysis, and further investigations are underway to identify any additional suspects.
Four held in raids
A team from the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) faced armed resistance while conducting a raid to arrest proclaimed offenders on Chakri Road in Rawalpindi.
The operation resulted in the arrest of four suspects and the seizure of illegal weapons.
According to police sources, the CTD team was acting on intelligence, indicating the presence of six proclaimed offenders at the camp of Arshad Bhatti.
As the team approached the location, Bhatti reportedly shouted, ""Mushtaq, run, the police have arrived,"" alerting the suspects, who managed to flee through a back exit. During the raid, two armed individuals — Farhan Akbar and Qasim — attempted to resist the arrest but were successfully arrested by the officers.
Shortly after, Qaiser Mahmood and Wajid Mahmood arrived in a vehicle and tried to block the road to obstruct the police operation. They, too, were overpowered and taken into custody.
A total of two Kalashnikov rifles and ammunition were recovered from their possession. CTD SP stated that the arrested accused will be fined before the court with concrete evidence to ensure justice is served. He added that operations against possession groups and proclaimed offenders will continue.

Heavy rains trigger power outages,"SG
The spokesperson urged citizens to follow safety guidelines during rainy conditions.
Heavy rains triggered widespread power outages due to faults and tripping on multiple underground and overhead feeders in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, and surrounding areas. Several feeders were also shut down as a safety precaution.
According to a spokesperson for the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), water accumulation has made it difficult for operational staff to address the complaints promptly. However, restoration work is ongoing in affected areas.
The spokesperson urged citizens to follow safety guidelines during rainy conditions. People are advised to maintain a safe distance from electric poles, transformers, meters, and other installations and to avoid touching electrical appliances with wet hands or bodies.
He further advised that if any broken wires are spotted, they should not be touched under any circumstances and should be reported immediately to the complaint office. Households are also advised to use high-quality wiring, keep it up to date, and install electrical circuits out of the reach of children.
The spokesperson warned against tying animals to electric poles or transformers and constructing houses near power lines. In case of an emergency, citizens can contact IESCO through Helpline 118 or the Complaint and Monitoring Cell at 051-9252933.

Gold flat as safe-haven demand cools,"US
Prices edge up Rs300/tola; rupee up five paisa at 283.72/$
Gold prices in Pakistan remained largely flat on Wednesday, mirroring global trends where prices eased due to reduced safe-haven demand following signs of de-escalation between Israel and Iran. Investors also remained cautious ahead of upcoming US economic data.
In the domestic market, the price of gold rose slightly by Rs300 to settle at Rs354,665 per tola, according to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA). The price of 10-gram gold increased by Rs258 to Rs304,068.
This marginal recovery comes after a sharp drop on Tuesday, when gold fell by Rs3,800 per tola.
Interactive Commodities Director Adnan Agar noted that international gold prices touched the high of $3,337 an ounce and low of $3,311 on Wednesday, with current levels hovering around $3,323.
""The overall sentiment is weak,"" he said. Gold is holding support between $3,300 and $3,290, but if it fails to break above $3,340, ""we could see further downside"". A close below $3,290 might push the market towards $3,200.
He added that with geopolitical tensions easing, particularly on the Israel-Iran front, the near-term outlook for gold appears bearish, though a bounce may be possible after further correction.
Internationally, spot gold was down 0.3% at $3,314.45 per ounce at 0934 am EDT (1334 GMT) after prices hit their lowest in over two weeks in the previous session, according to Reuters. US gold futures fell by 0.2% to $3,328.10.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee recorded a slight gain against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Wednesday, appreciating by 0.02%. By the end of trading, the local currency closed at 283.72, up by five paisa from Tuesday's close at 283.77.
Govt raises Rs467b via T-bills, bonds
To support its financing needs, the government raised a total of Rs466.67 billion through auctions of Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) and Pakistan Investment Bonds – Floating Rate (PFL) on Wednesday, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
In the MTBs auction, the SBP raised Rs322.59 billion across four tenors. The breakdown includes Rs14.02 billion from one-month bills, Rs95.89 billion from three-month bills, Rs64.18 billion from six-month bills and Rs148.50 billion from 12-month bills.
The auction saw competitive and non-competitive bids, with the total realised value slightly lower than the face value due to discount pricing.
For 10-year PFL, the SBP raised Rs144.08 billion, which includes Rs142.80 billion from competitive bids and Rs1.28 billion in accrued interest. The bonds were issued at a cut-off price of Rs95.1982 million, with an additional Rs5.55 billion accepted through non-competitive bids.
The auctions reflect strong market participation, with the MTBs contributing the majority (69%) of the total funds raised, while the PFL accounted for the remaining 31%.

Emma Raducanu's tears of joy,"US
She fought back from losing the opening set to Ann Li
Emma Raducanu held back tears after sealing her place in the second round of the Eastbourne Open, while Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova survived match points to progress on Tuesday.
Raducanu fought back from losing the opening set to American Ann Li to win 6-7 (5/7) 6-3 6-1 after nearly two-and-a-half hours on court.
""It feels incredible. I want to thank the crowd for getting me through some really sticky moments,"" the former US Open champion said in her on-court interview.
""It really meant a lot to me and I'm really proud of how I fought back after losing the first set. I'm very, very happy to come through that.
""It was tough, it was up and down, but from the middle of the second set I think I found another gear and a another level.""
Raducanu missed last week's Berlin Open due to a back problem she has been nursing since before the French Open.
But, aside from a slip and fall on the grass in set one, she appeared to come through her opening examination on England's south coast unscathed.
Raducanu next faces Australian teenager Maya Joint, who knocked out two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur on Monday.
Kreickova crashed out in the first round at Queen's two weeks ago on her return to the grass for the first time since her triumph at the All England Club last year.
Britain's Harriet Dart had two match points on her own serve to secure arguably the biggest win of her career in the third set before the Czech fought back for a 6-3 6-7 (4/7) 7-5 victory.
Kreickova will face another Brit in round two following Jodie Burrage's 6-3 6-2 win over Japan's Moyuka Uchijima.
Third seed Jelena Ostapenko had an easier passage to round two with a 6-3, 7-6 (7/2) win over Sonay Kartal.

PPP hardens stance on 'draconian powers' for taxman,"US
Govt reaches out to key ally on eve of budget approval
The Pakistan Peoples Party has refused to vote in favour of new ""draconian"" powers for taxman to arrest people in tax fraud cases, resulting in a new round of negotiations between the two key partners of the alliance just hours before the approval of the budget from the National Assembly.
On behalf of the government, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar has reached out to the top PPP leadership who was hopeful to resolve the issue before the approval of the budget.
The government was hopeful that after adding some more safeguards, the PPP may vote for the arrest powers amendment in the Finance Bill today (Thursday)
The sources told The Express Tribune that the top leadership of the PPP conveyed to the government on Wednesday it would not vote to give arrest powers to the Federal Board of Revenue in spite of inclusion of new safeguards to have a check on these powers.
The government cannot get the budget passed from the National Assembly without the support of the PPP.
On June 12, the government proposed in the budget that the FBR can arrest people in tax fraud cases. During discussions on the budget in the National as well as Senate standing committees on finance the additional safeguards were introduced to stop the misuse of these powers. These safeguards had been proposed by the PPP.
Despite the additional safeguards, the FBR cannot be trusted; a senior PPP negotiator told The Express Tribune on condition of anonymity. The real issue was the trust on the FBR, he added.
The development surfaced a day before the approval of the budget by the National Assembly, which is scheduled to approve it on Thursday (today).
The sources said that on behalf of the government Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar contacted top PPP leadership. ""I am back in Islamabad and we will resolve it soon Insha'Allah,"" said Ishaq Dar while talking to The Express Tribune. Dar was in the United Arab Emirates where he reached an understanding with the UAE rulers to address the serious issue of denying visas to Pakistani government officials.
Dar said that he was in contact with the President Asif Ali Zardari and the other PPP leadership. The matter regarding the arrest powers will be addressed before the approval of the budget, said the Deputy Prime Minister.
During deliberations on the budget, the chairman National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance Syed Naveed Qamar had termed the powers to arrest as ""draconian"". A few members of the committee equated the FBR with the National Accountability Bureau.
On the complaints from the businesses, the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also constituted a committee to include checks on these powers.
Tax fraud has been defined as: ""knowingly, intentionally or dishonestly doing any act or abets any action to cause loss of tax under this Act, including: using or preparing false, forged and fictitious documents including return, statements, annexures and invoices; false claim of input tax credit based on fictitious transactions; issuance of any tax invoice without supply of goods; tampering with or destroying of any material evidence or documents required to be maintained; generating fake input through manipulation of return filing system of the Board and making fake entries in the sales tax returns or in the annexures; and making fictitious compliance of section 73, including routing of payments back to the registered person, or for the benefit of the registered person, through a bank account held by a supplier or a purported supplier.""
Upon committing any of the above offences, the FBR will have the authority to arrest the individual without first seeking a warrant from any court of law, according to the proposed powers.
When contacted, FBR spokesman Dr Najeeb Memon said that the updated bill has already been submitted in the National Assembly by its standing committee on finance and the decision now rests with the assembly.
Unlike in the past, when the government would submit the updated bill in the National Assembly, this time the standing committee securitized the budget where FBR also proposed additional revenue measures of Rs36 billion.
In the budget, the government had proposed a total Rs435 billion new tax measures, which after the adjustments has now increased to Rs463 billion. The Chairman FBR Rashid Langrial said that describing the Rs36 billion additional measures as mini-budget was not correct since the Parliament has not yet approved the Finance Act.
The FBR chairman had told the standing committee last week that the criminality of tax fraud has been divided into two parts. In some cases, court permission will be required before an arrest is made.
He explained that crimes such as suppression of taxable supplies under the Sales Tax Act, suppression or nonpayment of withholding tax for more than three months, dealing in goods liable to confiscation and making taxable supplies without registration will require court approval for arrest.
According to the proposal, an Inland Revenue officer not below the rank of assistant commissioner — or any officer authorised by the board – may initiate an inquiry upon approval from the commissioner, if there is material evidence pointing to the commission of tax fraud or an offence warranting prosecution under the act.
The inquiry officer shall have the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including summoning and enforcing attendance of any person, examining on oath, requiring discovery and production of documents and receiving evidence on affidavits.
The inquiry officer must complete the inquiry within six months. During proceedings, the officer must provide the accused with a chance to be heard and confront them with details of the alleged fraud.
A final report will then be submitted to the commissioner, who may either approve a full investigation, request further details, or close the matter.
Upon approval, the investigation must be completed within three months. The board may authorise a commissioner — through a three-member committee notified by the chairman — to issue an arrest warrant if the tax loss exceeds Rs50 million. Arrests will only be made if the accused fails to respond to three notices, attempts to flee, or is likely to tamper with evidence.

"Diljit lauds Hania, slams Bollywood","PK
When it comes to his art, the Punjabi star cares little for geopolitical tensions
By now, the memory of Abir Gulaal, touted as heartthrob Fawad Khan's Bollywood comeback, is dead and buried amid the settling dust of last month's ceasefire between Pakistan and India. Fawad's Bollywood re-entry, having been built up into an extravagant cross-border romance, has been parked firmly into a corner. Rushing to fill the vacuum, we have the true-to-herself fresh-faced Hania Aamir stepping behind the camera alongside Punjabi hitmaker Diljit Dosanjh, shaking things up in the upcoming Sardaar Ji 3, heading to cinemas on June 27.
Unless, that is, you are a cinema-goer in India. Across the border, where Pakistani artists continue to be tainted by association, Sardaar Ji has been definitively banned in theatres – not that any of this has bothered the film's star Diljit, who outlined his feelings on both Hania and the Indian ban in no uncertain terms during a recent interview with Haroon Rashid on the BBC Asian Network.
Working with Hania and women
Maintaining a respectful distance between himself and his female co-stars, the actor-singer had nothing but warm words for the professionalism displayed by Hania on set as the pair worked together in the film.
""My experience with Hania was very good,"" stated Diljit in a short but sweet commendation. ""She was professional when we were working. We didn't have that much time together, though.""
For her part, Hania is known for not allowing geopolitical tensions between governments to get in the way of budding friendships with Indian artists. Her friendship with rapper Badshah serves as a prime example of this accepting trait. Moreover, returning to Sardaar Ji 3, this is not the first time the Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum star has crossed paths with the Punjabi singer. Last October, Hania – then a mere member of the crowd – joined Diljit on stage at his own invitation during a packed London concert, to the delight of both herself and fans around the world.
As for Diljit, the man remains true to both his art and dedicated to maintaining a respectful distance between himself and his female colleagues – despite having appeared onscreen together with fellow Sardaar Ji 3 star Neeru Bajwa no less than seven times (rivalling the romantic pairing between Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol during the '90s).
""I respect everyone's privacy,"" maintained Diljit. ""I myself am very private and give everyone their space – especially women. We should give them even more space."" In case anyone was left with any lingering doubts, the actor confirmed, ""I am not the way I am in films.""
'Not in our hands'
Viewers in India may not be getting the chance to see Diljit in this particular film after the offering has been blocked in his country, but it is a decision about which the Indian actor has no hard feelings.
""When this film was being made, the [political] situation was fine,"" mused Diljit, adopting the sanguine, accepting tone of one picking their battles. ""When we shot this film in February, everything was fine. But a lot of big things are not in our hands.""
As readers will have surmised, Diljit was referring to the Pakistan-India military tension that escalated in the wake of a terrorist attack in Pahalgam in April. This was the incident that cemented Fawad's ban and the ultimate shelving of Abir Gulaal – but fortunately for film fans, Sardaar Ji, despite a similar cross-border cast, appears to have escaped such a fate.
""The producers decided that obviously this film could not be released in India, so we would be releasing it overseas,"" elaborated Diljit. Acknowledging that such a move would inevitably result in a financial loss, he added, ""Obviously, they have lost a lot of money with such a decision. Yes, there will be a loss, because you are removing one whole territory. We do have this in our minds. But the situation is out of our hands, and [they producers] have my full support.""
Anoushey has Diljit's back
The producers may be blessed with Diljit's support, but closer to home here in Pakistan, Diljit himself has VJ and self-proclaimed supporter of artists' rights Anoushey Ashraf in his corner. Taking to Instagram Stories to denounce Indian authorities' decision to block the film due to the presence of a Pakistani actor, Anoushey wrote, ""Imagine being more offended by art than by hatred dividing people.""
Commenting on how a political stance should be unconnected with creating art, Anoushey continued, ""Punishing your own for working with our actors says more about your insecurity than your patriotism. For you, everyone's a pawn in petty politics. Please don't embarrass yourself further. The hate is clear; it's also boring now.
Addressing her Indian community as she lamented the fraught state of affairs in the cross-border entertainment industry, the VJ noted that there could be no change on the horizon as long as those in political power continued to make decisions impacting art. ""To all my Indian friends, am so sorry it's come down to this,"" she shared. ""We've seen better times, but until this hateful government of yours lasts, our shared goodness is going to be on the back burner.""
To back up her point, Anoushey took the chance to post a reel of Diljit on Stories where the Punjabi star insists he has no interest in Bollywood per se. ""I don't even want to work in Bollywood,"" the actor can be seen remarking in the video. ""My love is for music, and I can create that without any one else's permission.""
Lauding Diljit's commitment to his work, Anoushey's caption said it all. ""We should release his movie in Pakistan,"" commented the Pakistani VJ. ""His nationality is artistry. Really beyond limitations!""
Whether or not the Diljit-and-Hania-collaboration enthrals viewers for its artistry remains to be seen – but the Indian star has won hearts across the border for his commitment to his art in defiance of his government's stance.

PSX extends rally on improved confidence,"US
KSE-100 index rises 515 points, aided by easing of regional tensions
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), after hitting the second-highest single-day gain a day ago, extended its bull-run on Wednesday as investors remained upbeat about the market outlook.
The excitement from Tuesday's historic surge, when the KSE-100 index jumped over 6,000 points, was carried forward into the new session due to rising investor confidence, fuelled by easing geopolitical tensions and supportive economic signals.
In opening hours, the index jumped 900 points, before entering a range-bound session, where traders locked in profits. The upward momentum was driven by relative calm in the Middle East following ceasefire between Israel and Iran and improving domestic economic indicators.
The approval of $194 million in financing from the World Bank and $350 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) strengthened Pakistan's external position and broader economic outlook.
The index touched the intra-day high of 123,257 and low of 122,169, before settling at 122,762, up 515 points, or 0.42%.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti noted that stocks recovered as investors weighed Israel-Iran ceasefire talks, easing inflation, a surge in exports and approval of $194 million and $350 million in World Bank and ADB loans, respectively. ""Surging global equities, deliberations on privatisation of state enterprises, strong rupee and the circular debt management plan were the key catalysts for bullish close at the PSX,"" he said.
KTrade Securities, in its report, wrote that the PSX extended its rally following the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran. The index rose 515 points while trading volumes climbed to 750 million shares, largely fuelled by rollover activity ahead of futures expiry.
It observed that positive sentiment was driven by strong performance in banking, cement, fertiliser and food sectors, with notable support coming from stocks such as Bank AL Habib, HBL, Fatima Fertiliser, DG Khan Cement and National Foods. The broader market outlook remains upbeat as momentum is likely to
continue, provided the ceasefire remains in place, the report added.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) said that the KSE-100 index built on the previous day's surge with a 0.42% gain and closed at the high for June. A total of 55 stocks advanced while 41 declined, where Bank AL Habib (+4.15%), HBL (+3.03%) and Fatima Fertiliser (+6.54%) were the biggest contributions to index gains.
AHL pointed out that in a statement regarding trade talks with the US, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said ""both sides showed satisfaction over the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude them next week"".
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala commented that the KSE-100 index surged over 500 points, extending its bullish run on the back of sustained investor confidence. Positive sentiment dominated the session, where the index touched the intra-day high of 123,257.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 749.8 million shares compared with Tuesday's tally of 804.8 million. The value of shares traded was Rs28 billion. Shares of 472 companies were traded. Of these, 274 stocks closed higher, 161 fell and 37 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 102.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.03 to close at Rs1.49. It was followed by Pakistan Refinery with 47.1 million shares, rising Rs2.39 to close at Rs35.27 and Cnergyico PK with 39.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.09 to close at Rs7.25. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs949 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

Pakistan offers US mining ventures,"PK
US envoy says it is right time for investors to explore vast mineral deposits
Pakistan has invited US companies to explore the potential of public-private partnerships and joint ventures in the mining sector, which is enriched with vast mineral resources.
""With one of the world's largest undeveloped copper and gold deposits at Reko Diq and a strong commitment to economic reforms, this is the right time for US investors to explore and engage,"" US Charge d'Affaires Natalie Baker stated while addressing a webinar.
The government of Pakistan, in collaboration with the US embassy, hosted a high-level webinar titled ""Opportunities in Pakistan's Mining Sector – Unlocking Mineral Potential,"" aimed at promoting investment opportunities and inviting American companies to pump capital into the mineral and mining sector.
The virtual event was hosted together by Federal Minister for Energy (Petroleum Division) Ali Pervaiz Malik and US Charge d'Affaires Natalie Baker at the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) head office in Islamabad.
The webinar brought together senior officials from Pakistan's Ministry of Energy, leading Pakistani mineral and energy companies, representatives of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and top US diplomats and energy sector stakeholders. Petroleum Secretary Momin Agha, OGDCL Managing Director Ahmed Hayat Lak, MDs of Government Holdings Private Limited, Mari Energies, Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC), DG mines and senior representatives from Ark Metals, BMEC, BMRL and Pakistan Petroleum, along with the US embassy's economic counsellor and energy officer, participated in the event. Various American business representatives took part in the conference virtually.
In his remarks, Energy Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik highlighted the vast potential of Pakistan's mining sector. ""Pakistan is richly endowed with mineral resources, including gold, copper, coal, rare earth elements and other critical minerals essential for renewable energy transition,"" he said.
The minister noted the international significance of Reko Diq copper and gold project and pointed to recent discoveries in Balochistan's Chaghi district and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's Waziristan region.
He emphasised Pakistan's role in global transition towards clean energy, citing the country's abundant reserves of critical minerals as a foundation for its green transition.
""Renewable energy development is central to our climate goals and economic future. We are facilitating this shift by supporting the mining of essential minerals and improving ease of doing business,"" he stated.
The energy minister acknowledged the success of the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 (PMIF25), held earlier this year, which attracted over 5,000 participants and brought global attention to the country's mineral wealth.
""PMIF25 marked a turning point, showcasing Pakistan as a serious player in the global minerals economy,"" he said and invited US companies to explore the potential of public-private partnerships and joint ventures.
Ali Pervaiz Malik stressed that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and army chief Asim Munir were personally leading the development of the mining sector. He underscored that the government of Pakistan and the SIFC were fully committed to providing all kinds of facilitation to international companies to build partnerships aimed at unlocking the vast mineral reserves.
The US charge d'affaires reaffirmed the longstanding economic partnership between the United States and Pakistan. ""Pakistan offers immense opportunities in the mineral sector,"" the envoy said.
Baker commended Pakistan's recent policy efforts to unlock the mining sector's potential and underlined the US embassy's commitment to supporting American businesses looking to invest in Pakistan.
""We are here to facilitate connections and create win-win partnerships. US investors have long contributed to Pakistan's development and we see great promise in this sector,"" she added.
Participants were briefed on ongoing regulatory reforms, including the development of the National Minerals Harmonisation Framework aimed at streamlining investment procedures and aligning federal and provincial regulations.
The digitalisation of geological data and upgrading of the Geological Survey of Pakistan were also underway to improve transparency and data access for investors.
The Pakistani side also hosted a Q&A session with American investors to clear ambiguities or address queries.
In her closing remarks, Baker reiterated the US government's commitment to supporting Pakistan's economic development and deepening bilateral economic ties. ""We believe in Pakistan's potential and we see a shared opportunity in its journey towards inclusive, sustainable growth,"" she concluded.

A strategic triad rewiring Eurasia,"US
That's not just a logistical improvement -— it's a strategic shift.
On May 28, 2025, the leaders of Azerbaijan, Türkiye and Pakistan gathered in Lachin to formalise a trilateral partnership that could reshape how countries in this region trade, cooperate and respond to crises.
This wasn't just another summit. It was the beginning of a serious effort to build a new kind of regional alliance - one rooted in shared history, mutual respect and a desire to chart a more independent future.
At the heart of this vision is the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Originally a bilateral project between China and Pakistan, CPEC is now evolving into something much larger. The plan is to connect it with the Middle Corridor and the Lapis Lazuli Route, creating a seamless land bridge from Gwadar to Istanbul via Baku.
That's not just a logistical improvement -— it's a strategic shift.
In an era where global supply chains are vulnerable to disruption — from Red Sea piracy to Indo-Pacific militarization — land-based corridors offer resilience, speed and autonomy.
The proposed tri-corridor integration could reduce cargo transit time from China to Europe from 35-40 days to just 15-18 days, while slashing freight costs by up to 15%. But beyond the numbers lies a deeper narrative: the emergence of a multipolar Eurasia, where regional actors assert agency through cooperation rather than dependency.
The Lachin Summit laid out a comprehensive framework for trilateral cooperation across energy, defense, crisis response and diplomacy.
That vision is already taking shape: Pakistan has exported over 100 JF-17 Block III fighter jets to Azerbaijan, cementing a strong defence partnership. On the energy front, Azerbaijan's hydropower capacity — exceeding 1,000 megawatts — could help develop a regional energy grid that includes Pakistan. Türkiye, with its modern infrastructure and transit corridors, provides a natural gateway to European markets hubs.
Economically, Pakistan and Türkiye have set a targeted bilateral trade goal of $5 billion, with prospects for expansion through trilateral mechanisms involving Azerbaijan. Meanwhile, Azerbaijan's LNG exports to Pakistan are shaping a new East-West energy corridor.
With these three countries connected through CPEC, the Middle Corridor and the Lapis Lazuli Route, the population impact stretches across 1.5 billion people — turning this trilateral framework into a strategic and economic force across the wider Eurasian region.
To understand why this matters, it helps to look back. The ancient Silk Road once connected China, Central Asia, the Middle East and Europe, allowing goods, ideas and cultures to flow freely. What we're seeing now is a modern revival of that vision — but with new players and new priorities.
At the same time, we must remember the lessons of dependency theory which warns that countries that rely too heavily on external powers often find themselves trapped in cycles of underdevelopment and political vulnerability. This new alliance is, in many ways, an attempt to break that cycle.
Of course, there are challenges. The global balance of power is shifting. The US-China rivalry, Russia's evolving role in Central Asia and India's assertive diplomacy — all create uncertainty. There's also the risk of overextension — building and maintaining thousands of kilometers of infrastructure is no small task. And political changes in any one of the three countries could slow progress.
But the potential rewards are worth the effort. For Pakistan, this alliance offers more than just economic benefits. It provides a stronger voice on the world stage, greater energy security and a chance to move beyond traditional dependencies. For Azerbaijan and Türkiye, it's an opportunity to deepen their influence in South and Central Asia and to work with a partner that shares their concerns on issues like Kashmir and Karabakh.
So what needs to happen next?
First, the alliance should establish permanent mechanisms for coordination - something more than just occasional summits. Second, it should invest in digital infrastructure to make trade faster, more transparent and more secure. Third, it should focus on people-to-people ties: student exchanges, academic networks and cultural programmes that build trust and understanding from the ground up.
This triad also has the chance to lead by example on multilateral platforms like OIC, ECO, SCO and the UN. At the 51st OIC Summit in 2025, Azerbaijan reiterated its support for Pakistan's position on Kashmir. That kind of diplomatic alignment can amplify each country's voice and help shape a more balanced global order.
In the end, this isn't just about roads, railways or pipelines. It's about rewriting the rules of how countries in our region work together. It's about learning from the past — both the promise of the Silk Road and the warnings of dependency theory — and building something better. If the Azerbaijan-Türkiye-Pakistan alliance can stay focused, flexible and fair, it could become one of the most important stories of our time.

Govt approves Rs12b to transform Gadani yard,"PK
Maritime minister says development will align ship recycling with global standards
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced the approval of Rs12 billion for transforming the Gadani Ship-Breaking Yard into a model green facility, aligning the maritime sector with international climate and environmental standards.
According to an official statement released on Wednesday, while chairing a high-level meeting on the Gadani redevelopment, Chaudhry underscored the ship-breaking industry's contribution to the economy and its potential role in the country's climate resilience strategy.
""Ship recycling must evolve to meet global sustainability standards. This transformation is essential to reduce pollution, manage hazardous waste responsibly, and contribute to a greener maritime future,"" he said.
The maritime minister added that this major initiative focuses not only on modernising infrastructure and safety mechanisms but also on addressing the climate crisis through green shipping and environmentally responsible ship recycling.
Secretary Maritime Affairs Syed Zafar Ali Shah informed the minister that a 30-bed hospital, residential blocks for medical staff, and labour colonies will be constructed as part of the project's social uplift component. Additionally, 32 kilometres of roads, a school, a public park, and modern water supply and treatment systems will be installed to support the workforce and local community.
The minister directed the relevant authorities to establish a robust monitoring mechanism to ensure transparency and the timely implementation of the project. He stressed that the Hong Kong International Convention for the Safe and Environmentally Sound Recycling of Ships (HKC) must be strictly observed.
He noted that Gadani produces over 1.2 million tonnes of steel annually, making it a critical part of Pakistan's scrap and steel supply chain. However, after years of stagnation, the industry is now facing serious challenges in keeping pace with regional competitors.
""Gadani was once among the world's largest ship-breaking hubs. Today, it stands at a crossroads — either we modernise it in line with green shipping goals or risk further decline,"" he warned.
Chaudhry emphasised that the revitalisation of Gadani would contribute to Pakistan's broader climate goals, support the green economy, and reposition the country as a regional leader in sustainable ship recycling.
He reaffirmed his commitment to working with provincial governments and industry stakeholders to establish Gadani as a model yard for safe, climate-resilient, and economically viable ship-breaking.

CM announces major tax relief,"PL
Cotton fee, professional tax, local cess and entertainment duty abolished
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has announced extensive tax relief measures in the 2025-26 provincial budget aimed at stimulating economic growth and easing financial burdens on citizens.
In addition to the reliefs included in the Finance Bill, several incentives have been formalised through amendments to key laws. The measures span both tax and non-tax sectors, targeting agriculture, transport, education, and small businesses.
To support farmers amid a 30.7% decline in cotton production, the cotton fee has been abolished.
The drainage cess has also been removed to counteract erratic weather effects.
A 50% reduction has been approved in fees for property transfers, certified copies, sales, solvency, and inheritance certificates.
The annual tax on commercial vehicles has been cut to Rs1,000, and professional tax has been completely abolished.
The Sindh Assembly passed amendments to seven laws, including the repeal of the Sindh Entertainment Duty Act 1958, and changes to the Stamp Act, Motor Vehicles Act, and Local Government Act, eliminating the local cess.
Stamp duty on third-party motor insurance is now fixed at Rs50, and two-wheelers are exempt from mandatory insurance.
The entertainment duty has been removed entirely, benefiting cinemas, theatres, art councils, and cultural venues.
The sales tax exemption limit for small businesses has been increased to Rs4 million, and for restaurants and caterers, to Rs5 million, offering Rs400 million in relief.
Terming the initiatives as ""progressive and people-centric,"" the CM said the budget reflects a strong commitment to economic revitalisation, equitable taxation, and long-term development in Sindh.

High tax termed blow to goods transport sector,"PK
Businessmen demand reversal of decision, reinstatement of previous 4% tax rate
The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) and the Pakistan Goods Transporters Association have jointly urged the federal government to withdraw the increase in withholding tax on logistic services announced in the federal budget for 2025-26 and swiftly address other critical issues confronting the transport sector.
Speaking at a press conference at the LCCI, Chamber President Mian Abuzar Shad called the increase in withholding tax on logistic services from 4% to 6% a harsh and unjustified blow to the goods transport sector, which is already struggling for survival.
He said that such a move could push the sector to the brink of collapse and demanded that the government immediately reverse the decision and reinstate the previous 4% tax rate.
The LCCI president said that the only general truck stand in Lahore, located on Ravi Link Road, was insufficient due to the city's expanding population and commercial activity.
He urged the Punjab government to allocate land outside city limits for establishing a modern, international-standard truck terminal, which would facilitate the relocation of goods forwarding agencies outside of urban areas. ""This move will help reduce traffic congestion, lower environmental pollution and improve logistic efficiency.""
Leaders of the goods transporters association including President Nabeel Mehmood Tariq, Senior Vice President Haji Irfan Sultan and others also spoke at the press conference.
They criticised the government's practice of increasing toll taxes every two months, describing it as unbearable for transporters. They said that the establishment of new toll plazas at various locations has opened doors to unjustified extortion, severely impacting the sustainability of transport businesses.
The association leaders denounced the unwarranted fines and harassment by traffic police under the guise of document checking, which not only demoralise drivers but also negatively affect operations and reputation. They stressed that transporters were being penalised for minor issues, which adds to the already immense financial burden.
Warning of dire consequences, they said that the national economy was already under pressure and if immediate steps were not taken to resolve the ongoing issues, transporters would be left with no option but to shut down their operations.
Participants of the press conference called on the government to extend urgent relief to the transport industry to ensure its survival and enable it to continue contributing meaningfully to the economy.

Why does the internet think Khushhal Khan is a red flag?,"US
Duniyapur' star's marriage comments split fans
Heartthrob Khushhal Khan recently appeared on Ahmad Ali Butt's podcast Excuse Me, and spoke candidly about everything from his love for boxing to his thoughts on masculinity. But one particular comment stole the spotlight and got the internet talking.
When asked about his romantic life, Khushhal replied, ""I'm not a flirt. There is no such thing. When my mother approves, only then will it happen. Alhamdulillah.""
Some fans found his answer sweet and respectful. One comment read, ""As a mom watching, I feel you're a good son raised with good values."" But others had a field day. ""So he's one of those guys who dates around and then gets an arranged marriage approved by mommy,"" wrote an X user. Another critic labelled him a ""red flag,"" saying, ""A man who cannot make his own life decisions is not worth it.""
Despite the virtual backlash, arranged marriages remain a common and culturally respected practice in Pakistan. Khushhal's comments reflect a deep bond with his family, especially his mother, and it's not surprising that he'd want her blessing for such a major decision. When Butt asked what keeps him grounded amid his rising fame, Khushhal answered, ""My family, they definitely keep me grounded,"" adding warmly, ""My mother has more nerves of steel than any man I know.""
On positive masculinity
The conversation took an even more thoughtful turn when Khushhal discussed masculinity. He proudly said, ""Pathan,"" referencing the strong, respectful men he grew up around in Nowshera. ""I'm talking about the real Pathans, the way they treat their women, the way they respect them, the way they treat their children, the way they stand up, the way they are always at the front,"" he said, noting these were the qualities he admired and wanted to live by.
The star also opened up about his love for boxing, describing it as something that gives him discipline, focus, and resilience. When asked if he worried that boxing might ruin his looks, something often important for an actor, Khushhal just laughed. ""I understand the concern, but there's just a fire inside me that I have to satiate.""
He stressed the importance of sports in promoting a positive image of Pakistan and shared admiration for javelin star Arshad Nadeem, praising him for choosing to stay in Pakistan despite the difficulties.
Talking about his journey in the entertainment industry, Khushhal touched on the hypocrisy and gatekeeping he faced along the way. When Butt brought up how production companies try to ""control"" actors because they believe they ""launched"" them, Khushhal didn't hesitate. ""I don't, I just move on,"" he said. ""Nobody launched anybody. Allah has made the way for them, so they should be happy about that. If I do that for someone, I'll be grateful for that opportunity.""
Despite the memes and backlash, the full interview paints a much fuller picture. Between the jokes and the viral tweets, Khushhal's honesty, humility, and grounded energy stood out, offering a much-needed glimpse of positive masculinity and the quiet strength of women behind the scenes.

Downpour debunks drainage promises,"US
Despite Rs140m expenditure on desilting, waterlogged areas paint different picture
The second spell of heavy pre-monsoon rain on Wednesday exposed the hollow claims of the Rawalpindi Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), Rawalpindi Solid Waste Management Company (RWMC), Cantonment boards, and Rawalpindi District Council about the cleaning of Nullah Leh and 15 stormwater drains.
Despite the reported expenditure of Rs140 million on desilting efforts, waterlogged streets and flooded commercial and residential areas painted a different picture.
Streets and markets were submerged under up to three feet of water, causing severe damage to homes and shops.
Citizens reported millions in losses as water entered buildings. WASA officials were visible only at Committee Chowk underpass, while no senior official from any agencyincluding the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, DG RDA, MD WASA, or District Council Administratorwas seen in affected low-lying areas.
Rainwater and sewage remained stagnant for 4 to 6 hours, leaving a trail of mud, hospital waste, dead rodents, garbage, and fruit peels once the water receded.
No personnel from the Solid Waste Management Company's 'Clean Punjab Project' were seen in the affected neighbourhoods on Wednesday. Streets turned muddy and impassable, raising health concerns.
Residents in areas like Javed Colony and Nadeem Colony described how water entered their homes within three hours of rainfall starting at dawn.
They were left to manually drain water using buckets. Even parked vehicles, including loaders and rickshaws, were inundated with two feet of water and had to be push-started after hours.
Leaking ceilings in court buildings and on the Metro Bus track further indicated infrastructure vulnerabilities. Residents demanded an audit of the Rs. 140 million spent on cleaning Nullah Leh and storm drains, questioning why such devastating flooding occurred if the work had indeed been completed.
In many inner-city areas, residents have begun temporary evacuations. Among the worst-hit locations were Nadim Colony, Javed Colony, Fazalabad, Arya Mohalla, Dhok Elahi Bakhsh, Dhok Khaba, Amarpura, Qasimabad, Mohanpura, Pirwadhai, and several neighbourhoods around Dhok Hassu, Dhok Ratta, and People's Colony. Commercial hubs like Bohar Bazaar, Lal Haveli, Moti Bazaar, and Shalley Valley also remained submerged for over three hours.

Terror nexus,"US
Pakistan is in a catch-22 situation as it confronts terrorism from its western and eastern frontiers
Pakistan has flagged an existential threat that it faces from a fugitive and outlawed organisation based in Afghanistan. The United Nations Security Council has once again been informed that Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, the TTP, is freely operating from the West Asian state, and all efforts on the part of Islamabad to persuade the authorities in Kabul to move against them have fallen on deaf ears.
This past Tuesday, it was brought on record before the 15-member world body by Pakistan's envoy that the TTP is the largest UN-designated terrorist group operating from Afghan soil with an estimated strength of around 6,000 fighters, posing a direct threat to Pakistan's national security.
The spike in terrorist activities inside Pakistan during the last two years is a case in point, and the TTP has now struck a nexus with other non-state actors including Al-Qaeda and Baloch militant groups.
Pakistan is in a catch-22 situation as it confronts terrorism from its western and eastern frontiers, and the new revulsion on the Iranian front has made the strategic equation more worrisome.
The intensity could be gauged from the fact that Pakistan has confiscated a huge cache of modern weapons abandoned by the US forces while leaving Afghanistan in a state of lurch.
Unscrupulous entities have laid their hands on this armament which has led to massive bloodshed in Pakistan, especially in the restive provinces of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
This is where Kabul's cooperation is desired along with a trans-regional counter-terrorism understanding to exterminate the terror nexus. The role of the US and the UNSC is essential if this simmering threat perception has to be dealt with in a sophisticated manner so that the evolving geo-economics is saved from waywardness.
The mushrooming of terrorists, incidentally, has taken a new turn as India-backed proxies are now raising their ugly head. The killing of 11 'khwarij' at the hands of security forces yesterday during intelligence-based operations in K-P amplifies the threat module, and is in need of being tackled lethally. This evolving trepidation must come to an end.

"CTD arrests six RAW facilitators, seizes explosives","US
Plan for terror attacks foiled in 'Operation Yalghar'
The Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) has arrested six suspected facilitators of India intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).
Officials announced at a press conference on Wednesday that a major counterterrorism 'Operation Yalghar' had resulted in foiling a sophisticated terrorist plot targeting religious and civilian infrastructure.
Additional Inspector General Operations Shahzada Sultan, DIG Waqas Nazir and Senior Superintendent of Police Waqar Azeem briefed media representatives about the arrests and seizures made during coordinated raids across multiple districts in the province.
According to senior CTD officials, the operation uncovered a well-organised terrorist network allegedly supported and funded by India's premier external intelligence agency.
The arrests were made following months of surveillance and intelligence gathering that led the authorities to suspects operating in different regions.
In Toba Tek Singh district, CTD operatives seized a cache of explosive material, including detonators and detailed confidential maps of strategic locations. The maps reportedly contained markings of sensitive installations and potential target sites, suggesting planning for coordinated attacks.
The Bahawalpur CTD apprehended a suspected RAW facilitator who officials claim was receiving financial support channeled through foreign banking networks. The suspect, according to investigators, served as a key liaison between Indian handlers and local operatives.
In a parallel development in Bahawalnagar district, two suspects were detained on charges of procuring improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from India's Border Security Force (BSF). Officials alleged that the suspects had established direct communication channels with BSF personnel to acquire sophisticated explosive devices designed to cause maximum casualties.
During the extensive investigation process, the CTD claimed to have uncovered detailed plans for devastating terrorist attacks targeting a prominent mosque and busy railway station in Bahawalpur. The planned attacks, according to the officials, were designed to maximise civilian casualties and create widespread panic among the local population.

GLOF alert issued as early monsoon sets in,"PK
Sudden outbursts from lakes could trigger flash floods
The National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has issued multiple alerts across Pakistan, warning of potential Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF), flash floods, landslides and heavy monsoon rainfall across northern and southern regions over the next 24 hours.
A combination of sustained high temperatures, intensified monsoon currents, and a prevailing westerly wave has heightened the risk of extreme weather and hydro-meteorological hazards.
In its GLOF advisory, the NDMA reported that persistent heat has accelerated glacier and snowmelt in the Northern areas over recent weeks. The influence of ongoing monsoon rainfall and thunderstorms has increased pressure on glacial lakes, raising the risk of sudden outbursts.
The NEOC specifically identified vulnerable valleys such as Reshun, Brep, Booni, Sardar Gol, Thalu 1 and 2, Badswat, Hinarchi, Darkut and Hundur as high-risk zones.
Sudden outbursts from these lakes could trigger flash floods, posing threats to human life, livestock and agriculture, as well as infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and communication systems. Access to remote valleys may be temporarily disrupted.
Residents, trekkers, and tourists have been strongly advised to avoid travel near glaciers, glacial lakes, and riverbanks in the identified danger zones.
NDMA urged the public to remain informed through official channels, follow evacuation orders when issued, and report any unusual glacier activity, sounds, or water flows to local disaster management authorities immediately.
To support real-time alerts and risk communication, the NDMA recommended downloading its ""Pak NDMA Disaster Alert"" mobile app.
Separately, the NDMA also issued a consolidated, impact-based weather alert for Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Islamabad, warning of heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and gusty winds over the next 12 to 24 hours.
In AJK, areas including Bagh, Rawalakot, Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Haveli, Hattian Bala and Mirpur are expected to receive moderate to heavy rain with thunder and lightning.
Similar conditions are forecast for most parts of Sindh, including Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Khairpur, Karachi, Hyderabad, Tharparkar, Mirpur Khas, Thatta and Badin.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, districts expected to be affected include Chitral, Dir, Swat, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Haripur, Karak, Kohat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, Mohmand, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Bannu, Buner, Hazara, Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi and Waziristan.
Punjab, including Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, Hafizabad, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Lahore, Kasur, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rahim Yar Khan and Dera Ghazi Khan, is also under alert.
The capital, Islamabad, may experience similar weather conditions.
NDMA cautioned that uprooted trees, damaged power lines, and structural hazards such as collapsed rooftops or electric poles could occur. Visibility may be severely reduced due to dust storms and strong winds, increasing the risk of traffic accidents.
The public is advised to avoid standing near unstable structures, billboards, and trees.
Emergency services have been directed to remain on high alert.
Meanwhile, continuous rainfall in the mountainous Galiyat region on Wednesday triggered multiple landslides and rockfall incidents, disrupting traffic at several key road points. Authorities urged tourists and residents to avoid unnecessary travel and adhere strictly to safety guidelines.
Traffic wardens have been deployed at critical locations, and the district administration has activated a 24/7 helpline (1915) to provide emergency support and information.
In a parallel development, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government has initiated the setup of flood emergency warning centres-cum-control rooms at both district and tehsil levels, as heavy rains threaten seasonal nullahs and glacial lakes, especially in low-lying areas.
According to official sources, these centres are being established under the supervision of District Disaster Management Authorities (DDMAs) and Deputy Commissioners in all ten districts of AJK.
Equipped with trained personnel from Rescue 1122, Civil Defence and Red Crescent Society (AJK chapter), these units will operate round the clock to assess risk, monitor flood activity, and facilitate timely responses.
Muzaffarabad DC Yasir Riaz confirmed that the centres will stay in continuous contact with central authorities and adjacent flood-prone regions, including Jhelum district, to ensure prompt dissemination of warnings and response coordination.

Justice Mansoor turns away K-P chief minister,"PK
Advises Gandapur to approach CJ for meeting with Imran
Supreme Court Justice Mansoor Ali Shah on Wednesday turned away Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who sought the court's intervention for a meeting with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in Adiala Jail, telling him that he was knocking at the ""wrong door"".
Gandapur appeared in the court of Justice Shah along with senior PTI leader Advocate Latif Khosa and the K-P advocate general. Khosa requested the court to immediately hear the request for a meeting with the founder PTI because of the ongoing budget session of the provincial assembly.
Gandapur said that the budget approval process was ongoing in the K-P assembly. He emphasised that the party chief's vision was important in the budget. He complained that despite his repeated requests, the meeting between the PTI founder and the provincial budget committee had not been arranged.
On that, Justice Shah remarked that Chief Justice Yahya Afridi or the Supreme Court Registrar should approached. He further stated that Chief Justice Afridi was the chairman of the Practice and Procedure Committee, therefore, approaching would save time. ""You have knocked on the wrong door,"" Justice Shah said. ""We cannot do anything on the judicial side, Chief Justice Yahya Afridi is in Lahore, so it is better to approach the registrar or the chief justice,"" Justice Shah told the K-P chief minister.

'Minus-one formula' in the works again,"PK
PTI sees 'conspiracy', crowns Imran as 'irreplaceable'
As tension thickens over the political future of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, both nationally and within his own party, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday rejected what it described as a concerted campaign to politically sideline its founder amid renewed murmurs of a ""minus Imran"" formula.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur denounced the ""conspiracy"" to impose governor's rule and sideline the party's patron-in-chief, while party spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram accused PML-N's Azma Bukhari and her allies of running a palace-backed agenda to fracture PTI from within.
Azma said that Imran Khan had been ""sidelined by his own sister and party"".
""Look at fate's irony. The one who sought to sideline Nawaz Sharif has himself been pushed aside at home and within his party,"" she said in a statement.
Azma alleged that Aleema Khan, Imran's sister, is continuously plotting against K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and that Gandapur himself had recently acknowledged conspiracies against him.
""If Ali Amin had not managed to get the provincial budget approved in time, he would have been constitutionally forced to step down,"" she stated.
The provincial minister also accused the ""Aleema Khan group and PTI's social media team"" of running a campaign against Gandapur.
Azma noted that PTI is split into three factions at the Centre and three separate groups in K-P.
In K-P, one group is led by Junaid Akbar, another by Atif Khan and the third comprises rebellious party members, she said
She added that for the past 12 years, K-P had been left at the mercy of ""incompetent and corrupt politicians"".
In contrast, Azma said, ""Punjab has become a role model for merit, good governance and transparency"".
Reacting to Bukhari's remarks, PTI alleged that the entire ruling coalition – ""a court of puppets and maids"" in Waqas's words – was obsessed with the idea of ""minus Imran"" and had ""disgraced itself"" in the process.
Simultaneously, Gandapur, speaking outside the Supreme Court, warned that a covert plan was underway to impose a financial emergency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and ""usurp"" its PTI-led government, linking the moves to deliberate exclusion of Imran Khan from the budget process and backdoor power plays.
Gandapur rebuffed speculation that Imran had become politically irrelevant. ""Minus Imran? The PTI founder is the party and no one can hold a position higher than him,"" he said.
Stressing Imran's continuing authority, he added, ""If the founder wants to end the government, I can do it in a minute. This government belongs to him"".
He alleged that some actors were trying to exploit Imran's incarceration to advance their own agendas. ""When the founder is free, these agenda-driven individuals will be unmasked. The public will judge those weakening Imran.""
He further claimed that meetings had been deliberately obstructed and consultations blocked. ""A conspiracy was underway to take over our government, but it failed,"" he added.
Describing the quick passage of the provincial budget without Imran's consultation, Gandapur added, ""The best budget is ours we just needed to tell Imran. As the government, we have the power to amend it anytime. Any necessary changes directed by the founder will be implemented.""
He warned of an alleged plan being hatched behind the prime minister's back to ""impose a financial emergency, enforce governor rule, and seize control of the province.""
Meanwhile, in a parallel response issued from party headquarters, PTI's central spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram took direct aim at PML-N's Azma Bukhari. ""In their desperation to 'minus' Imran Khan, the entire royal court stands disgraced and exposed,"" the statement read.
It went on to accuse the ruling alliance of ""burying the Constitution, the law, justice, democracy, values, and humanity itself"" in its effort to sideline the PTI founder.
""By the grace of God, Imran Khan has not been 'minused' but multiplied, and the nation has placed him above all others,"" Waqas declared. According to the statement, Imran's rising popularity amid ""repression and fascism"" had unnerved the ruling camp.
He accused government operatives of repeatedly attempting to divide the PTI and weaken its grassroots base. ""Desperate and defeated puppets, mired in humiliation and hysteria, now try to cover their shame by spreading conspiracies of division and discord within PTI,"" he said.
Waqas claimed that every plan over the past three years to ""fracture the unity of a party that guards the Constitution and democracy"" had ended in failure and disgrace. ""Imran Khan is not only the leader of PTI. He is the leader of the nation. Despite the dirty tricks and palace conspiracies, Imran Khan remains Pakistan's hope,"" he added.
He said the party would weather this storm like it had before. ""Just as we've faced every previous challenge with unity, we'll do so again. The maids and lackeys of the regime will lose sleep once again"".
He also blasted governance in Punjab, accusing the ruling coalition of corruption. ""The mandate thieves of Punjab now carry the shameful stain of Rs1 trillion in financial misconduct,"" he claimed.
Targeting Bukhari directly, he added: ""Instead of spouting unhinged propaganda as the unbridled mouthpiece of these mandate thieves, she should explain to the people how their wealth is being plundered under the leadership of 'Panama Queen'"".

Education underfunded,"SG
The number has steadily declined since 2018 when it was 2% of GDP.
The federal education budget has fallen to an all-time low of 0.8% of GDP, reflecting utter disregard for something that should be among every government's top priorities.
The number has steadily declined since 2018 — when it was 2% of GDP. That year is significant because it was when the PTI government took office, and despite its promises to improve life for the masses, funding for education saw only nominal increases in real terms, with the actual share of GDP actually contracting.
The PDM and PML-N governments criticised the PTI for this, only to do the exact same thing when they came to power. In fact, despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's much-publicised ""education emergency"" declaration last year, the government has actually slashed education expenditure by 29% in the first nine months of FY25, allocating a paltry Rs899.6 billion against Rs1,251.06 billion a year earlier. It is worth noting that the UN has called on all countries to spend between 4% and 6% of GDP on education.
This collapse in education funding coincides with a 20% hike in defence spending — the largest increase in a decade — following border clashes with India. While national security is vital, underfunding education will create even more security risks tomorrow. Studies show each additional school year boosts individual earnings by 9% and national productivity exponentially.
But it should not be forgotten that the biggest drain on the budget is actually debt servicing, which now accounts for over half of the federal budget, leaving social services, the bureaucracy and the military fighting over the rest.
While it is important to keep the debt in check, the most reliable way to actually bring it down in the long term is to build a future where economic growth is guaranteed — such as by having an educated workforce. Unfortunately, our leaders either cannot, or will not, plan that far ahead.

The climate cost of coal,"US
Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change is well-documented.
The message is stark and urgent. As Pakistan faces yet another sweltering summer, its chief meteorologist has issued a grave warning that the country's reliance on coal-fired power plants is an active driver of the extreme weather events now battering the nation with increasing intensity. From deadly heatwaves to devastating flash floods, the cost of coal is existential.
Pakistan's vulnerability to climate change is well-documented. But what is often overlooked is the country's internal contribution to this crisis. While global emissions remain a primary driver, the local increase in carbon dioxide — thanks in large part to the coal-based power generation projects recently installed in Sindh — is adding fuel to the fire.
These plants emit significant greenhouse gases, trapping heat in the atmosphere and setting the stage for more frequent and violent climatic events.
If mitigation and adaptation capacities are not rapidly scaled up, Pakistan will find itself fighting a losing battle on multiple fronts — energy insecurity in particular. It is therefore imperative for Pakistan to shift decisively toward renewable sources of energy.
Solar, wind and hydropower remain underutilised, despite the country's natural abundance in these resources. Pakistan's energy planners must revisit and revise the national power policy, moving away from short-sighted, high-emission solutions and investing instead in decentralised and resilient energy systems.
The long-term cost of coal is far too high — not just in terms of environmental degradation but in lives lost and livelihoods disrupted. Thus, energy transition has literally become a matter of survival.
Policymakers must move beyond piecemeal reforms. What is needed is a clear, time-bound roadmap to retire coal, invest in renewables and protect Pakistan's future from the smoke of its present.

NEPRA cuts base tariff by Rs1.49 per unit,"US
.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Wednesday reduced the base power tariff by Rs1.49 per unit for fiscal year 2025-26.
The recommendation in this regard has been sent to the federal government.
Last month, the government moved to revise the base power tariff for the coming fiscal year, suggesting a modest cut ranging from 30 paisas to up to Rs2.25 per unit under seven different scenarios.
Assuming stable economic conditions and an exchange rate of Rs280, the average base tariff would drop by Rs2.25 per unit to Rs24.75 in 2025-26, compared to the current rate of around Rs27 per unit.
If the local currency depreciates to Rs300 against the dollar, the base tariff would decrease by approximately 30 paisas per unit. This decrease is primarily driven by a drop in capacity payments.
Meanwhile, power consumers across the country, excluding K-Electric (KE) and lifeline users, may face a 10-paisa per unit increase in electricity tariffs under the Fuel Charges Adjustment (FCA) for May 2025.
The power regulator is scheduled to hear the proposed hike of Rs0.1015 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) on June 30. The session will also be available online via Zoom.
The proposal has been submitted by the Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G) on behalf of Ex-WAPDA Distribution Companies (XWDISCOs).
According to CPPA-G, the actual fuel cost in May stood at Rs7.4940/kWh, compared to a reference cost of Rs7.3925/kWh, resulting in the requested hike.
In May, 12,755 GWh of electricity was generated at a cost of Rs99.153 billion, averaging Rs7.7739/kWh. After deducting transmission losses of 355 GWh (2.78%) and adjustments, 12,367 GWh was delivered to DISCOs at Rs92.676 billion or Rs7.4940/kWh. Hydel power led the generation mix with 37.98% (4,844 GWh), followed by RLNG (16.99%), nuclear (15.77%), and local coal (11.08%). Imported coal contributed 6.24%, while gas added 6.92%. Other sources included RFO, solar, wind, and bagasse.
The power regulator has invited stakeholders to join the hearing and submit feedback. If approved, the FCA will apply for one month only.

Rs192b supplementary budget passed,"US
Dr Ibadullah, Leader of the Opposition, waded into the debate with figures.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Wednesday approved a supplementary budget of Rs192.74 billion for the current fiscal year (2024-25), clearing 62 funding demands covering additional departmental expenditures.
The move sparked a backlash from opposition parties, who staged a fiery protest and a walkout, decrying the move as evidence of the provincial government's flawed planning and faulty economy.
Speaker Babar Saleem Swati presided over the session, which quickly turned contentious after he invoked special powers to bulldoze opposition cut motions and fast-track the budget.
Opposition members, branding the exercise a matter of ""disastrous policy failure"", alleged this marked the 14th supplementary budget under PTI's 13-year rule. They lambasted the frequent recourse to such budgets, arguing that when unchecked expenditures balloon year after year and questioning the government's proclaiming of a surplus.
Dr Ibadullah, Leader of the Opposition, waded into the debate with figures. ""Surplus doesn't fit the bill,"" he said, pointing to the staggering provincial debt rising from Rs150 billion to Rs800 billion under successive PTI administrations.
He questioned the logic of approving patchwork budgets when nearly a third of development funds had gone unspent and alleged Rs200 billion in financial irregularities per the auditor general's findings.

The suspects, Usman Khan, a former branch manager, and Shehzad Arif, a former relationship manager, were presented in the court following their arrest and were now under investigation.
According to the FIA, the suspects, along with other bank staff and another man, had orchestrated the scam involving the creation of a fake bank account using forged signatures of an overseas account holder, Fazal Ahmed. They issued a fraudulent cheque book and later transferred $128,500 from the victim's account into their own.
A case under eight sections of the relevant laws has been registered against Aamir Ayaz, Saeed Alvi, Fariha and Hassan Raza.
The investigation was launched following the victim's complaint, which led to the unearthing of the collusion among banking staff.

YouTube fights against Aussie teen ban,"US
Regulators argue under-16 ruling should also apply to video platform
Australia's internet watchdog and YouTube exchanged barbs on Tuesday after the regulator urged the government to reverse a planned exemption for the Alphabet-owned video-sharing platform from its world-first teen social media ban.
The quarrel adds an element of uncertainty to the December rollout of a law being watched by governments and tech leaders around the world as Australia seeks to become the first country to fine social media firms if they fail to block users aged under 16.
The centre-left Labour government of Anthony Albanese has previously said it would give YouTube a waiver, citing the platform's use for education and health.
Other social media companies such as Meta's Facebook and Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok have argued such an exemption would be unfair.
eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said she wrote to the government last week to say there should be no exemptions when the law takes effect.
She added that the regulator's research found 37 per cent of children aged 10 to 15 reported seeing harmful content on YouTube – the most of any social media site.
""This is not a fair fight where our kids are concerned, vis-a-vis social media sites,"" Inman Grant told the National Press Club in Sydney.
She said social media companies deployed ""persuasive design features"" like recommendation-based algorithms and notifications to keep users online and ""YouTube has mastered those, opaque algorithms driving users down rabbit holes they're powerless to fight against"".
YouTube, in a blog post, accused Inman Grant of giving inconsistent and contradictory advice, which discounted the government's own research which found 69 per cent of parents considered the video platform suitable for people under 15.
""The eSafety commissioner chose to ignore this data, the decision of the Australian Government and other clear evidence from teachers and parents that YouTube is suitable for younger users,"" wrote Rachel Lord, YouTube's public policy manager for Australia and New Zealand.

The National Assembly on Wednesday completed the approval process for demands for grants pertaining to ministries, divisions and various federal departments.
In total, the lower house of parliament, which met under the chairmanship of Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, approved 136 demands for grants amounting to Rs9,951.22 billion for 33 federal ministries and divisions.
Meanwhile, over 750 cut motions moved by the opposition were rejected by majority vote.
Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, while winding up the debate, said that independent data validated by global rating agencies and reputable surveys shows a significant rise in consumer confidence, reaching its highest level since 2022.
He highlighted that Pakistan's macroeconomic stability was improving, with inflation declining, policy rates reduced, foreign exchange reserves increasing, and the national currency showing signs of stability.
He emphasised that the recent boost in public confidence is not based on government statistics but on independent assessments.
Aurangzeb stated that the country's tax-to-GDP ratio was projected to increase to 10.4 percent by the end of the current fiscal year, compared to 8.8 percent last year.
He acknowledged that throughout the year, speculation about looming debt crises and repeated calls for ""mini-budgets"" were widespread, but said these forecasts have proven exaggerated, as recent indicators show a more resilient and adaptive economic environment.
He further added that federal expenditure this year was expected to increase by less than 2 percent, a stark contrast to the 10 to 13 percent growth seen in past years. Key reasons for this include the decline in debt servicing costs due and lower policy rates.
Commenting on the government's cost-cutting measures, he remarked, ""Gone are the days when the prime minister used to come and go from the office in a helicopter. Expenditures have to be reduced from the top.""
The minister said that major reforms are currently underway at the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) aimed at improving transparency and reducing human intervention in the tax collection process.
Speaking on tax policy in the former FATA region, he clarified that the matter is not related to any particular province. He explained that income tax in the area remains exempted, while sales tax is being implemented gradually and progressively.
""This is an ongoing process and all relevant stakeholders have been engaged. There should be no misconception that decisions were made without consultation,"" he stated.
Senator Aurangzeb also spoke about the alignment of development priorities under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
He said, the federal PSDP stands at Rs1 trillion, the combined Annual Development Plans (ADPs) across all provinces amount to more than Rs4 trillion, underscoring the importance of coordinated development planning at all levels of government.
The assembly approved 14 demands for grants amounting to Rs 3.55 trillion for the Finance Division to meet various expenditures for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026.

Extortion ring dismantled: police,"US
One suspect killed, several arrested in crackdown
Police have dismantled a criminal network involved in a recent surge of extortion cases across the metropolis. One suspect was killed in an encounter, while several others have been apprehended.
Police are intensifying efforts to capture remaining key suspects, including one suspect for whom a Red Notice has been issued.
According to SSP SIU Muhammad Shoaib Memon, extortion-related crimes escalated in New Karachi starting March this year. Criminals targeted local businesses and residents, demanding money through threatening slips and WhatsApp calls. Those who resisted or delayed payments faced violent retaliation, including armed attacks on their shops, residences, and workplaces.
During the last 10 days of Ramazan, a citizen, Abdul Jabbar, was fatally shot at a charity Dastarkhwan.
On 16 July, a rickshaw driver was killed and six others injured in Surjani Town in another extortion-related shooting.
The Special Investigation Unit (SIU) launched a targeted operation to dismantle the extortion network. Investigations revealed that Wasiullah Lakho, operating from Iran, was orchestrating the gang's activities through Abdul Samad Kathiawari.

Miandad recalls his rivalry with Doshi,"US
Former Indian spinner passed away on Monday
Cricket has always had its share of fierce battles, but few were laced with as much wit and warmth as the legendary exchanges between ace Pakistan batsman Javed Miandad and former Indian spinner Dilip Doshi who expired in London on Monday.
Miandad was overcome with emotions as he paid tribute to his ""close friend"" Doshi while speaking to Telecomasia.net, recalling with fondness the mischief, banter and friendship that blossomed between the two.
""When he used to bowl at the leg-stump, I would start saying 'bow-wow',"" Miandad smiled. ""When he finally asked what it meant, I told him: 'Only dogs — and you —  try to catch my leg!'""
It was 1979. Pakistan were touring India, and a young, cheeky Miandad had found the perfect target for his humour in the reserved and erudite Doshi, who was often tasked with curbing the Pakistani batter's scoring.
Doshi's response? A mix of frustration and disbelief — enough to prompt complaints to the umpires and even captain Sunil Gavaskar, who, like the rest of the Indian team, couldn't help but laugh.
""He was from a very sophisticated, highly educated family — always impeccably dressed, his white kit spotless,"" Miandad recalled while paying tribute to Doshi.
One particular exchange became part of subcontinental cricketing folklore. ""I once asked him what room number he was staying in at the hotel. He angrily asked why. I told him, 'I want to hit the ball straight into your room!'""
The harmless barbs became a running theme whenever they met on the field — even years later in English county cricket, when Miandad turned out for Glamorgan and Doshi for Northamptonshire. ""Even there, I would keep teasing him. But by then, we had become friends,"" Miandad said. ""We met often. He invited me to his house in Kolkata. His wife is also a very kind and decent person.""
Though the jokes flew thick and fast, Miandad held nothing but respect for Doshi's cricketing prowess. ""Doshi Saheb took 114 wickets in 33 Tests — that says everything. He played in an era where scoring was slower; imagine what he could have achieved in today's game where batters take more risks.""
