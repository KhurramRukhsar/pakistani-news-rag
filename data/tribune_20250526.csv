Year's third polio drive kicks off,"US
Govt aims to vaccinate over 45m children U-5 in critical campaign
In continued efforts toward a polio-free Pakistan, the Pakistan Polio Programme launched its third National Immunisation Days (NIDs) campaign of the year on Sunday at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister's Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme's core group and representatives of partner organisations.
To mark the launch, Farooq administered oral polio vaccine and Vitamin A drops to children under five, reinforcing the government's unwavering commitment to eradicating the crippling disease from every corner of the country.
Scheduled to begin on May 26, the weeklong campaign aims to vaccinate over 45 million children under five, making it a critical intervention in Pakistan's final push to interrupt poliovirus transmission and achieve eradication by the end of 2025.
""Polio eradication is not just a health goal — it is a national imperative and a matter of immense pride for our country,"" Farooq said.
""This third campaign of 2025 marks a decisive milestone in our 2-4-6 roadmap. These back-to-back rounds from September 2024 to May 2025 represent our most strategic opportunity to close immunity gaps and halt virus circulation before the high transmission season begins.""
Farooq acknowledged the persistent challenges in key reservoirs such as Karachi, South K-P and Quetta Block but noted encouraging progress in reaching previously underserved populations.
She also extended heartfelt appreciation to the 400,000 frontline workers powering the campaign, including 225,000 female vaccinators and recognised the critical role of civil and military law enforcement in ensuring safe access to children.
Despite major gains, wild poliovirus continues to pose a threat. Pakistan has confirmed 10 cases so far this year. Environmental surveillance has detected the virus in 272 sewage samples from 127 testing sites, across 68 districts, signalling continued circulation.
Speaking at the event, UNICEF representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil, expressed confidence in the programme's direction.
As he concluded his tenure in Pakistan, Fadil commended the national leadership and Farooq for their tireless dedication to polio eradication.
""Pakistan is closer than ever to making history. With continued political will, community engagement, and coordinated action by all partners, I believe this country can soon achieve a polio-free future,"" he said.
The public is strongly encouraged to cooperate with vaccination teams and report any missed children via the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline 1166 or the WhatsApp Helpline at 0346-7776546.

"Mother, children of Pakistani origin killed in London house fire","US
.
A Pakistani mother and her three children died in a house fire in north-west London early on Saturday morning. A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder, police said.
The fire broke out at around 01:20 BST at two adjoining terraced houses on Tillett Close in the Stonebridge area of Brent. Emergency services arrived to find both properties severely damaged.
The victims have been identified as a 43-year-old woman and her three children – a 15-year-old girl, and two boys aged eight and four. All four were pronounced dead at the scene.
Police confirmed that the woman was the mother of the three children.
According to the BBC, two other members of the same family - a woman in her 70s and a teenage girl — were also in the house and were taken to the hospital. Their conditions have not been made public.
The Metropolitan Police said a 41-year-old man was arrested outside the property on suspicion of murder. He remains in custody. The family were of Pakistani origin and had lived in the UK for over 20 years, neighbours told the BBC.
Eight fire engines and around 70 firefighters from stations across Wembley, Park Royal, and Willesden responded to the blaze. They fought the fire for several hours before it was brought under control.
The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Fire investigators and homicide detectives are working jointly on the case.
Neighbour Mohamed Labidi, 38, a teacher who lives on the same street, told the PA news agency he was devastated by the loss.
""I could not even look at the house,"" he said. ""They were good people. We used to socialise together. The children were always polite. It's heartbreaking.""
Another resident told the BBC she heard screaming and breaking glass and came outside to see the property next door on fire.

Bangladesh court begins first trial of Hasina-era officials,"AZ
.
Bangladesh began the first trial on Sunday at a special court prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Sheikh Hasina, the chief prosecutor said.
The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection to the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.
The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
""The formal trial has begun,"" Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh's domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters.
""The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused,"" he said.
It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year's student-led uprising, which ended Hasina's iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina's government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.
The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka's former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.
Hasina also fled by helicopter to India, her old ally.
She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka's extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.
The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina's government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits elections that the interim government has vowed will take place before June 2026.
Islam said the eight men were accused of ""different responsibilities"", including the most senior for ""superior command responsibility, some for direct orders.. (and) some for participation"".
He said he was confident of a successful prosecution.
""We have submitted as much evidence as required to prove crimes against humanity, both at a national and an international standard,"" he said.
Among that evidence, he said, was video footage of the violence, as well as voice recordings of Hasina in ""conversations with different people where she ordered the killing of the protesters using force and lethal weapons"".

NADRA keeps the deceased alive in its records,"US
Delays in cancelling the identity cards of the deceased cause legal issues for families
Long after families have fulfilled the last rites of their deceased loved ones, many remain alive in NADRA's official records thanks to delays in the cancellation of their national identity cards, which create unnecessary inconveniences for the surviving kin.
One such citizen was Majid Hussain, who was facing difficulties selling his late father's property. ""When I tried selling the shops registered under my father's name, a person claimed that the shops were mortgaged for a loan of Rs5 million. He even presented forged documents. Despite a case filed in court, the issue remains unresolved since my father's ID card was not cancelled in NADRA's records,"" lamented Hussain.
Similarly, Nabeela Kausar faced issues updating her surname on her CNIC since her father's death was not registered with NADRA. ""I visited the NADRA office to replace my father's name with my husband's name but was asked to provide my parents' original CNICs. When I informed them of my parents' death, the officials instructed me to cancel their CNICs before updating my record,"" claimed Kausar.
According to the National Database & Registration Authority (NADRA), despite the registration of over 100 million deaths in the provincial civil registration and management system, the identity cards of these individuals have not been cancelled in NADRA's records, instigating a host of legal and administrative problems for the kin of the deceased.
Conversely, the failure to cancel the deceased individuals' CNICs has led to irregularities in various welfare programs as well. In the Punjab Government's Ramadan Nigahban Program, hundreds of cheques worth Rs10,000 were issued in the name of individuals who had passed away, depriving many families from receiving aid.
Legal experts believe that the failure to cancel a deceased person's identity card can create a host of problems for their heirs. While this can prevent many legal heirs from obtaining property, it can also enable forgery, allowing unauthorized individuals to seize properties or withdraw money from bank accounts.
Furthermore, if a government employee's identity card is not canceled, their pension and other benefits can be obtained illegally. In addition, there is a risk of electoral irregularities due to the inclusion of deceased persons in the voter list in the records of the Election Commission.
Senior lawyer Altamash Saeed informed this correspondent that NADRA's records were linked to various government databases. ""If a person's death is not registered, it can create complications in immigration and other legal matters. Hence, NADRA should empower local union councils to directly update birth, death, marriage, and divorce records in NADRA's database. This would help citizens avoid unnecessary difficulties,"" opined Saeed.
Reportedly, NADRA has introduced an SMS notification system to involve citizens in the posthumous process, informing close relatives of deceased individuals to visit NADRA registration centers to cancel their identity cards. A public awareness campaign is also underway, utilizing social media, print, and electronic media to disseminate this information.
Under new regulations, the parents, spouse, children, siblings, or other close relatives listed in the deceased's family record can cancel the ID card. The required documents include the original ID card or its number, a computerized death certificate issued by the Union Council, Cantonment Board, or Tehsil Municipal Office, and a burial certificate.
""Canceling an identity card is free of charge, and the cancellation certificate is issued within seven days. To prevent misuse, the original identity card is destroyed at the NADRA registration center. Authorities urge citizens to take timely action to prevent potential forgery and ensure the accuracy of government records,"" claimed officials from NADRA.

12 Ukrainians killed in 'biggest ever' Russian drone attack,"US
.
Russia launched a record number of drones against Ukraine and killed 12 people across the country, officials said on Sunday, even as Kyiv and Moscow completed their biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war.
Ukraine's emergency services described a night of ""terror"" as Russia launched a second straight night of massive air strikes, including on the capital Kyiv.
The attacks came even as the two countries completed their biggest prisoner swap since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with 1,000 captured soldiers and civilian prisoners exchanged by each side.
The death toll from the latest Russian strikes included two children, aged eight and 12, and a 17-year-old, killed in the northwestern region of Zhytomyr, officials said.
Their school named the dead children as Roman, Tamara and Stanislav in a post on Facebook, saying: ""Their memory will always be with us. We will never forgive"".
""Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,"" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media.
""The silence of America, the silence of others around the world only encourages Putin,"" he said, adding: ""Sanctions will certainly help.""
The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called for ""the strongest international pressure on Russia to stop this war"".
""Last night's attacks again show Russia bent on more suffering and the annihilation of Ukraine. Devastating to see children among innocent victims harmed and killed,"" she said on social media.

Power lines threaten Mukhi House,"AE
HESCO delays action despite formal appeal from the museum's curator to remove tangled electrical cables
A month after a formal request was made, no action has yet been taken to remove hazardous electrical wires hanging from the historic Mukhi House Museum in Hyderabad.
The museum's curator and administrator, Naeem Ahmed Khan, submitted a letter to the Chief Executive Officer of the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) on April 21, 2025, requesting the relocation of electric wires entangled with the museum's structure. The letter highlighted the architectural and cultural significance of Mukhi House, which was declared protected heritage under the Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act, 1994, in 2018.
Mukhi House was later converted into a museum and opened to the public in 2021. Located in a densely populated residential area, it now faces a serious preservation challenge: electricity to nearby homes is supplied via cables that run across and hang from the museum's outer walls, some even strung across windows and fastened to its original iron grills. The letter warned that these power lines not only compromise the visual integrity of the site but also pose a serious threat to the building's structure - particularly its wooden doors and windows - in the event of an electrical malfunction.
Copies of the letter were also sent to the Deputy Commissioner of Hyderabad, the Deputy Director (Heritage/Admin), and the PS to the Director General of the Sindh Culture, Tourism, Antiquities, and Archives Department. Yet, despite the passage of a full month, officials have taken no action. Restoration work is currently underway at Mukhi House after years of delay. Museum staff caution that if the hanging wires are not removed soon, a large portion of the museum's outer wall may remain unrestored and unpainted, defeating the purpose of ongoing renovation efforts.
Window to past
Also known as Mukhi Mahal, the building was constructed in 1920 by Mukhi Jeth Anand, a prominent member of Hyderabad's Sindhi Hindu community. The architecture of the mansion combines Renaissance, Art Deco, and Art Nouveau styles, featuring stained glass windows, intricately carved wooden details by Indian artisans, and marble accents.
The house comprises 12 rooms, two grand halls, and a spacious central courtyard along with a smaller rear courtyard. In a notable moment of pre-Partition history, India's future Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru stayed at Mukhi House with his family - a visit now commemorated with a rare photograph on display at the museum. After Partition, the Mukhi family remained in Hyderabad until 1957 before migrating to India. The building was subsequently occupied by various government departments, including the Settlement Office and a girls' school. It also suffered damage during periods of political unrest in the city.
It was not until the tenure of former District Nazim Kanwar Naveed Jamil that a decision was made to preserve the site. In 2008, the Mukhi family relinquished formal ownership under the condition that it would be preserved and opened as a public museum. Restoration began in 2009 under the Sindh Government's Department of Archaeology, and by 2013 the museum opened its doors to the public.
Mukhi House today hosts a collection of personal memorabilia, historical photographs, and cultural artifacts donated by the Mukhi family - an effort to preserve not only their legacy but the broader cultural history of Hyderabad.
The building, located near Chaari at Homestead Hall, remains a popular attraction for both local and visiting tourists.
However, the entangled power cables, particularly at the rear of the building, continue to mar the structure's historic charm and pose an ongoing threat to its preservation. Unless immediate steps are taken to address the issue, a vital piece of Sindh's heritage may face further degradation.

Lahore Qalandars clinch HBL PSLX title,"AE
Rich tributes were paid to the officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Navy in the innings break during the PSL X final
A breathtaking 59-run match-winning partnership off just 37 balls between Kusal Perera and Sikandar Raza propelled Lahore Qalandars to a nail-biting six-wicket victory over Quetta Gladiators and lifting the HBL PSL X title in front of a packed house of 34,000 fans at Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on Sunday night.
By virtue of their victory, the Qalandars became only the second team to achieve this milestone three times, emulating the feat of Islamabad United.
In a thrilling chase of 202 runs, Lahore Qalandars began aggressively with Mohammad Naeem and Fakhar Zaman laying a strong foundation. The duo put together a 39-run opening partnership, setting the tone for the innings.
However, the partnership was broken when Fakhar was dismissed by Abrar Ahmed after scoring just 11 runs off 10 balls, including two boundaries.
Abdullah Shafique then joined Naeem at the crease, and the pair quickly accelerated, hitting boundaries and building a crucial second-wicket partnership. The 26-year-old was in fiery form as he approached his PSL 10 fifty, but his innings came to an end courtesy of Faheem Ashraf.
The opening batter scored a valuable 47 runs off 27 deliveries, featuring a boundary and six sixes. His dismissal ended the important 46-run stand, with the team positioned at 85 for 2 after 8.4 overs.
Abdullah Shafique continued to impress, forging a 30-run partnership with Kusal Perera, who also contributed important runs with his eyes set on surpassing the target.
The partnership was eventually broken by Usman Tariq, who dismissed Shafique. Shafique played a fiery knock of 41 runs off 28 balls, including four boundaries and a six, with the team at 115 for 3 in 12.3 overs.
In the 17th over, Mohammad Amir picked up his first wicket, dismissing Rajapaksa, who scored 14 off 16, leaving the side at 145-4 in 16.4 overs.
Sikandar Raza and Perera then went on a rampage and started hitting boundaries to finally earn a grand win for Qalandars.
Earlier, after winning the toss and electing to bat first, Quetta suffered an early setback as captain Saud Shakeel was dismissed by Qalandars' skipper and left-arm pacer Shaheen Afridi for just four runs off six balls, leaving the Gladiators at 17-1 in 2.4 overs.
Quetta's troubles continued in the next over when Salman Mirza removed Finn Allen for 12 off 11 deliveries, putting the side under early pressure. However, a 38-run partnership between Rilee Rossouw and Hasan Nawaz steadied the innings.
Dinesh Chandimal then joined Nawaz and provided valuable support, striking two sixes off Sikandar Raza in the 17th over to propel the score to 170-4.
Shaheen Afridi returned to halt the charge, removing Chandimal for a brisk 22 off 13 balls. Two balls later, he struck again, dismissing the well-set Hasan Nawaz for a brilliant 76 off 43 deliveries, reducing Quetta to 172-6 in 17.5 overs.
However, Faheem Ashraf played a vital cameo in the final over, smashing 28 off just eight balls, including multiple boundaries, to help Quetta breach the 200-run mark. He was dismissed on the final delivery of the innings.
Tribute paid to Pakistan Navy
Rich tributes were paid to the officers and soldiers of the Pakistan Navy in the innings break during the PSL X final. The ceremony was attended by Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, US embassy Islamabad Charge D'affaires Natalie Baker, senior civil and military leadership were present on the occasion.
Lahore win prize of $500,000, Quetta $200,000 as runners-up.

Religion and Pakistan's relations with India,"US
.
Religion became a major factor in the recent military encounter between India and Pakistan. Analysts said that the popular mood in Pakistan was a key factor as the government weighed whether and where to retaliate against its larger, more powerful rival when India used its air force to launch attacks on Pakistan in early May.
Many Pakistanis applauded the military's response to the Indian strikes. Some took to the streets to applaud actions against a country that was poorly treating its large Muslim minority. In Islamabad, authorities urged citizens to join the civil defence brigades. The United States and China called for a diplomatic solution, but it was unclear who would lead those efforts.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with both Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Jaishankar, the Indian foreign minister. ""At this moment in time, there is one thing that has to stop which is a back-and-forth and a continuation, and that is what we are focused on right now,"" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a news briefing on May 8.
Other countries with interest in keeping peace in South Asia also got involved with both India and Pakistan as the two were drifting towards a military confrontation. Jaishankar was approached by Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi Arabia's minister of state for foreign affairs, for an unannounced visit to Delhi. He also met with the Iranian foreign minister, Syed Abbas Aragchi.
The Modi government in India was using all the means at its disposal to paint a positive picture of its situation with respect to Pakistan. Modi sought to define the conflict in religious terms. It named the operation against Pakistan as Sindoor, the vermillion that adorns Hindu brides and a likely reference to Hindu women grieving over the loss of their husbands in the killings by Muslim fighters in the Indian occupied part of Kashmir who had appeared from the dense forests in the area.
Pravin Sawhney, the editor of an Indian defence magazine and a former army official, said he was troubled by the religious connotation of the name of the operation which local media said was chosen by Narendra Modi himself. He said that politicising India's secular military would be harmful to unit cohesion. ""A political message was being sent to the people of India, that Hindus were killed in Kashmir, so we have to take revenge.""
The Hindu, an Indian newspaper based in the country's more secular south, deleted a social media post on May 7 that said that three Indian jets had been downed because there was no ""on record official information"", fueling concerns among journalists that Modi's administration might intensify its clampdown on the media.
The Global Government Affairs team on X said that it had received orders from the Indian government to block more than 8,000 accounts in the country. ""To comply with the orders, we will hold the specified accounts in India alone,"" the post from X read but ""we disagree with the Indian government's demands,"" characterising them ""as contrary to the fundamental right of free speech."" Across Kashmir - where Indian and Pakistani forces continued to exchange artillery shells across the contested border - people braced for long nights.
There was considerable frustration among people on the Indian side of the Line of Control (LoC), the name the border in Kashmir was given after an earlier confrontation. A story by its correspondents Anupreeta Das and Salman Masood in The New York Times on May 10, that covered the use of aerial drones by the two sides as the weapon of choice, was written following interviews with affected people on ground.
""Speaking on Friday [May 9] morning, residents in both parts of Kashmir said they were exhausted; some said it was the worst shelling they had experienced in nearly three decades. 'We're fed up with running every time the shelling begins,' said Atta Muhammad, 70, a resident of Uri, a town on the Indian side of Kashmir. 'It's better that both countries go for a nuclear war and kill us all. At least that will rid us of this suffering'.""
The steps taken by India were most likely to increase resentment on the part of the way the Indian occupying force was treating the local populace. They were destroying the houses that were believed to be the residences of those who were upset about the way the Indian authorities were ruling the part of Kashmir that was under their control. New Delhi was also encouraging Hindus to move into the parts of the state that already had people of their faith in residence. This was the demographic strategy aimed at reducing the proportion of Muslims in the population.
Drones manufactured at home by the two countries were a relatively new weapon in their arsenal. Early on May 10, a day after India said that Pakistan had sent waves of drones toward Indian airspace, the Pakistani military accused Indian forces of launching air-to surface missiles that targeted at least three air bases across Pakistan. Among them was a key installation near the capital Islamabad.
The base is named after Air Marshal Nur Khan who had occupied several high positions in the Pakistani government. It is located on the main road that connected the cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. On May 9, Indian defence officials said Pakistan's military had attempted aerial intrusions in 36 locations with 300 to 400 drones to test India's air-defence system.
Both India and Pakistan have been developing their respective drone-building industries in recent years, and both import drones from foreign allies - Pakistan from China, for instance - but neither country appears to have any that can carry nuclear warheads, according to James Patton Rogers, a drone expert at Cornell University. And while he calls the conflict ""incredibly worrying"", he also notes that drones generally are used as the lowest possible escalatory step in a conflict, usually to pressure and test the opponent's air defences.
According to one expert, ""Although many countries now have drones in their arsenals, this is the first time the unmanned aerial vehicles were used by the two countries against each other."" The use of drone warfare may have been inevitable, but it could reshape the way the world views hostilities between India and Pakistan, much as it did after the two countries became nuclear powers in the 1990s.

Greengrocers ignore official rates,"US
Consumers deprived of peak harvest season's benefit
Official prices of perishable food items across Lahore remained largely stable this week, but consumers saw little benefit due to widespread overcharging and profiteering by greengrocers, retailers and street vendors.
Despite seasonal declines driven by peak harvest conditions and hot weather, shoppers continued to pay 50 to 100 per cent above official prices.
For many residents, the failure to curb profiteering has become routine, with price lists issued by market committees often ignored and enforcement officials appearing disengaged from the daily struggles of the public. ""What's the point of these official rates if no one follows them?"" said Nadeem Qureshi, a father of three shopping in the Green Town Bazaar. ""Vendors charge whatever they want, and no one checks them.""
Farzana Bibi, a homemaker from the Township area, shared. ""Every week, I see prices go up on the same itemseven when the government says they've gone down. We're told there's a price control system, but we've yet to see it work.""
A review of official price lists and market surveys reveals stark contrasts.
Live chicken was officially priced between Rs397 and Rs411 per kilogram, yet vendors sold it for Rs570 to Rs680, with boneless chicken reaching as high as Rs1,050 per kilogram.
Despite official price control efforts, a wide range of essential vegetables and fruits continued to be sold at grossly inflated rates across Lahore's markets, burdening consumers with unchecked overpricing.
From staples like potatoes, onions, and tomatoes to seasonal fruits such as mangoes, cherries, and apricots, the official rates served as little more than a formality.
A-grade potatoes, fixed at Rs45 to Rs50, were routinely sold for up to Rs100 per kg, while onions listed at Rs30 to Rs35 fetched Rs80 in many places.
Tomatoes, meant to cost Rs3035, were sold at nearly triple the price. Garlic and ginger, essential kitchen ingredients, saw massive discrepancies, with official prices being consistently ignoredChinese garlic, for instance, was listed at Rs285300 but sold at Rs500, and ginger retailed for up to Rs1,000 against its listed Rs610640.
Similar patterns were observed in other vegetables. Bitter gourd, spinach, zucchini, and cucumbers, despite price reductions or stability, were sold far above government-fixed rates. Brinjal, priced officially at Rs6670, reached Rs140, and ladyfinger, listed at Rs124130, was sold at nearly Rs180.
Even lemons, after a Rs70 drop in official price, cost up to Rs600 per kilogram in the markets. Cauliflower and cabbage were among the worst examples, sold at over four times their official rates.
Fruits showed no relief either. Apples priced at Rs230390 were sold as high as Rs800, while bananas of all grades saw increases of Rs80130 over official rates.
Dates were listed at Rs430460 but sold for as high as Rs800-2,000 per kilogram. Melons, watermelons, peaches, and phalsa all saw similar surges, with consumers paying far beyond government-fixed prices.
This blatant disregard for official pricing mechanisms has rendered the price control system ineffective.
Despite daily updates and official campaigns, vendors openly flout regulations with impunity, exploiting both high demand and lax enforcement.

"Retired teacher kidnapped, murdered over debt","DE
Victim had lent Rs150,000 on interest to suspect
A retired schoolteacher was kidnapped, murdered and his body dumped in fields in Pattoki.
A resident of Bilal Colony, Naila Riaz, submitted an application to Pattoki city police, stating that her husband had left their home after dropping some items bought from a market.
Sometime later, a man named Iqbal arrived at their home on her husband's motorcycle. When she asked him about her husband's whereabouts, he made excuses.
When she questioned him, he said her husband had left for somewhere and would be back soon.
Despite waiting for a long time, her husband did not return home. She expressed fear that her husband had been abducted with the intent to murder him.
The police registered a kidnapping case against unknown individuals on the woman's complaint.
A few hours after the case was registered, the police found the abducted man, Muhammad Zulfiqar, dead in nearby fields.
According to the police, the deceased had lent money on interest to the suspect Iqbal. When Zulfiqar demanded repayment, the suspect murdered him by stabbing him multiple times and dumped the body in the fields.
The police arrested the suspect, Iqbal, on the charges of the murder. The murder weapon was also seized.
According to the suspect, he had borrowed Rs150,000 on interest from the victim and had been paying installments for the past 19 months. Frustrated with the ongoing interest payments, he stabbed the victim to death and threw his mobile phone into a drain.

Citizens protest 25 day water disruption,"US
Water demand has increased but not city supply, forcing citizens to buy expensive water tankers
Water supply has remained severely affected in different areas of the city for the past 25 days.
The water demand has increased, but the city's water supply is not returning to normal, causing difficulties for citizens, who are forced to buy expensive water tankers.
The affected areas include Korangi, Landhi, Gulshan-e-Iqbal, Jamshed Road, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad, Dastgir, Federal B Area, and Baldia Town.
In addition, there was a power breakdown at Gharo Pumping Station, which, according to a spokesperson for the Water Corporation, occurred on Saturday morning, resulting in 30 million gallons of water unable to be supplied to the city.
Power supply was also suspended at the NIPA Pumping Station for several hours, affecting water supply in Gulshan-e-Iqbal, while power supply disruption also affected water supply at the NEK Pumping Station.
In response to the water woes, citizens protested at Sakhi Hassan Hydrant in District Central, closing the hydrants.
Member Sindh Assembly Jamal Ahmed also participated in the protest, during which protesters blocked both roads, complaining that water supply had been disrupted in their area for several days.
Due to the protest, water supply from Sakhi Hassan Hydrant also remained suspended for several hours.

"Municipal committees hike water, property taxes","US
Residents have one month to file objections to new rates
As the new fiscal year 2025-26 approaches, municipal committees across Rawalpindi district have introduced steep increases in water tariffs and other taxes, further burdening already frustrated citizens.
In a move dubbed a ""water bomb"" by locals, water bills have been sharply raised.
In Kahuta, the municipal administrator has increased the residential water bill from Rs200 to Rs1,500 per month, and the commercial water bill from Rs400 to Rs3,000.
A new industrial water bill of Rs10,000 per month has also been introduced. Reconnection of disconnected water supplies now requires full payment of dues plus a reconnection fee of Rs5,000.
A 1 per cent municipal tax has been imposed on all property transactions within committee limits.
Fees at slaughterhouses have also risen significantly: for small animals like goats and sheep, the fee has increased from Rs50 to Rs150 per head, and for larger animals such as cows and buffaloes, from Rs100 to Rs300.
Advertisement charges have surged as well.
Shop signage fees are up from Rs5 to Rs15 per square foot per month, hoardings from Rs30 to Rs100, sky signs from Rs24 to Rs80, and digital displays (LCD/VCD) from Rs150 to Rs450.
Advertisement floats have also seen massive hikes as truck and bus floats now cost Rs60,000 per month (up from Rs20,000), while smaller vehicle floats like Shehzore and Suzuki have doubled to Rs30,000 and Rs16,000, respectively.
According to the municipal administrator, residents have one month to file objections to these new rates, after which the revised tariffs will be implemented.

Students left to swelter in tin sheds,"US
Over 500 pupils attend classes at public school with no electricity, fans and potable water
Government Kohinoor Girls High School in Rawalpindi, run under the supervision of the Punjab Education Department, lacks all basic facilities in an era of scientific and technological advancement, leaving educators and school children, including boys, at the mercy of scorching heat.
The school's second shift classrooms still lack basic necessities like proper roofing, electricity, fans, and clean drinking water.
The school is home to around 2,000 students and of these, about 500 boys and girls attend the second shift - a shift now held in a makeshift structure covered with iron and tin sheets.
By 9am, harsh sunlight begins to pour into all the classrooms. With no doors, tin roofs, and no ventilation, the classrooms turn into virtual ovens. Reports of children suffering from nosebleeds due to the intense heat have become a daily occurrence.
Due to a 'severe financial crisis', the Education Department has declined to provide any funding for improvements. Distressed parents had submitted protest letters to PML-N MNA Malik Abrar, who promised to construct proper classrooms. However, since the land is privately owned, the commitment could not be fulfilled.
Teachers have resorted to holding classes under trees. The school operates in two shifts — the morning shift in a larger building, and the second shift (with 500 students) in an adjacent structure. About a month and a half ago, the Education Department abruptly discontinued second shifts in all schools across the district. But due to the number of students, Kohinoor Girls High School's second shift was retained, albeit in appalling conditions.
The tin-roofed structure offers no insulation from the scorching sun. By 10am, the sun beams directly into the classrooms, making even the blackboards, teacher's chairs, and students' benches unbearably hot. The heat is so intense that more than 200 out of 500 students have stopped attending school.
Teachers, who raise these issues, are reportedly issued warnings. Parents have submitted multiple complaints and reminders to the Department of Education, Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema, the Assistant Commissioner, and the Chief Minister's Complaint Cell - but no action has been taken. In response, parents and local traders have formed an action committee.
Parents - including Mazhar Abbas, Musarrat Parveen, Mubeen Kausar, Muhammad Kaleem, and Saeed Akhtar - told The Express Tribune that they are exhausted by the lack of response from authorities. The only answer they now receive is, ""Send your children to another school."" As a result, many have already done so or withdrawn their children from education altogether.
They demand that students be immediately relocated from the dangerous tin-roofed structure to the old, solid, yet currently unused school building nearby. Until new classrooms are constructed, classes should be held in that safer facility. Parents have also requested urgent installation of fans and provision of cold drinking water.
The spokesperson for the Rawalpindi DEA says summer vacations are about to begin and that a permanent solution will be considered after the holidays.

'The Future of Civilisation' launched at ACP,"US
The event brought together a panel of academics and thinkers to reflect on the book's philosophical themes
Intellectuals, writers, and admirers gathered at the Arts Council of Pakistan on Sunday to celebrate the launch of ""The Future of Civilisation: Exploring the Profound Impact of the Role of Sacrifice in Building a Noble and Humanitarian Society,"" the English translation of Syed Muhammad Taqi's seminal 1980 Urdu work ""Karbala: Tehzeeb Ka Mustaqbil.""
The event brought together a panel of academics and thinkers to reflect on the book's philosophical themes - moral collapse, the crisis of modernity, and the civilisational power of sacrifice.
Translated by journalist and writer Sumera Naqvi, Taqi's granddaughter, the book reintroduces to a global readership the late scholar's exploration of how modern civilisation's moral drift can be confronted through an ethical re-engagement with historical legacies — especially the enduring symbolism of Karbala.
""The modern age is faced with a serious societal crisis and conflicting intellectual approaches,"" Taqi writes. ""Thinkers seeking solutions will encounter great challenges The key to solving this problem can be found in humanity's vast cultural heritage.""
Held at Auditorium 2 of the ACP, the evening featured prominent voices from diverse fields. Dr Azra Raza, acclaimed oncologist and literary scholar at Columbia University, appeared via video link, describing the book as ""philosophically rich and beautifully written."" She praised Naqvi's translation as a rare literary achievement, stating, ""Translation is a mysterious act Sumera Naqvi has remained faithful to tone and intention.""
Wasif Rizvi, president of Habib University, offered a trenchant critique of modern epistemology. ""Epistemic hegemony, rooted in logical positivism, has created binaries in us,"" he said. ""This may be the most non-philosophical age in human history."" Dr Nomanul Haq, a literary historian and editor at Oxford University Press, lauded Naqvi's ability to convey her grandfather's complex prose into accessible English. He endorsed Taqi's central argument, stressing the urgency of universalising the moral weight of Karbala beyond sectarian confines.
Veteran educationist Abbas Husain, reflecting on his personal encounters with Taqi, recalled, ""His Urdu vocabulary could be overwhelming, but his philosophical insight was unparalleled. He set a standard for intellectual discourse.""
Renowned poet and scholar Iftikhar Arif delivered a particularly memorable address. He noted the precision and fidelity with which the translation had captured Taqi's intellectual rigor. ""The language and diction in his discourse, public or private, were consistently elevated,"" he said. ""Sumera Naqvi must be congratulated for masterfully translating a demanding text.""
The event concluded with a Vote of Thanks from Sumera Naqvi, who stressed the book's relevance in a world increasingly detached from humanitarian values. The Future of Civilisation is now available in bookstores and online, offering readers a timely meditation on the intersection of sacrifice, ethics, and the civilisational crisis of our age.

'Political parties lack internal democracy',"US
.
Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) chief Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has lashed out at all the mainstream political parties in the country, describing them as ""private properties"" with no internal democracy.
Speaking at an event on Sunday, Naeem said there is no democracy in any political party of the country except for the JI. ""Whether people reach parliament through Farm 45 or Farm 47 [through rigging or genuine vote], they belong to parties which are more like private properties,"" he said.
He said to call these parties democratic is an insult to the idea of democracy. According to the JI chief, the parties which have been ruling the country come into power after pledging allegiance to America.
""Here people are elected as heads of political parties on the basis of wills or inheritance. All these partiesboth secular and religiousare run by families."" Naeem stated that the JI is the only exception as the party is based on a democratic system from bottom to top.
He claimed that the political parties have no idea as to what are the real issues of the people, what is the price of grocery items and how much a common man has to spend on gas and electricity bills.

A strategic shift towards self-reliance,"AZ
To bridge competitiveness gap, trade policy modernisation must be starting point
The government's recent shift towards an export-led growth strategy has garnered broad support. Yet, some manufacturers and commentators remain sceptical, expressing concerns about the impact on local industry and jobs.
Others question the timing of these reforms, particularly amid a global ""trade war,"" not realising that this should have been done when Pakistan had started approaching the IMF in quick succession from 2008 onwards for relatively large bailout packages.
For more than a decade, Pakistan's exports have remained stagnant – hovering between $25 and $30 billion annually – while imports have nearly doubled. This widening gap has created a structural imbalance in the foreign exchange reserves, leaving the economy perpetually vulnerable to external shocks and reliant on repeated IMF bailouts.
To break this cycle, the government established specialised task forces comprising trade experts, senior officials and academia. After months of rigorous analysis and consultation, the conclusion was clear: without a comprehensive overhaul of Pakistan's outdated and distortionary import tariff regime, achieving sustained, double-digit export growth will remain elusive.
Several international organisations that have studied Pakistan's trade regime have long urged reform. The World Bank, for example, has consistently ranked Pakistan among the world's most protectionist economies, with average tariffs at least twice the global average and three times higher than those in successful East Asian economies. This tariff structure has created a strong anti-export bias, functioning more as a tool for revenue collection than as a catalyst for industrial competitiveness. If Pakistan is serious about bridging its competitiveness gap and integrating into global markets, modernising its trade policies must be the starting point – and the moment to act is now.
In line with the government's commitment to doubling exports within its five-year tenure, tariff restructuring efforts have been underway for several months. Once finalised, the proposed changes were evaluated through rigorous economic simulations using models such as the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) and government-developed econometric frameworks.
The results indicated clearly positive economic outcomes: increased employment, accelerated export growth outpacing imports and a favorable shift in investment flows. Notably, the analysis revealed a direct correlation between the ambition of reforms and the productivity of outcomes – the bolder the reforms, the greater the economic gains.
These findings are not based on theoretical models alone. Historical evidence from both Pakistan's own tariff liberalisation efforts in the 1990s and early 2000s, as well as from other developing countries, shows that opening up to competition spurs exports, creates jobs, and reduces poverty, especially benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Of course, no reform is without its challenges. Certain sectors may require transitional support. But with careful planning and well-designed safeguards, tariff reform could be the bold step Pakistan needs to unlock its full export potential.
While the government will closely monitor implementation and impact, it is crucial to focus on the long-term upside and acknowledge the costs of not reforming. Over the past two decades, many of our peer countries embraced liberalisation while Pakistan fell behind, increasing its economic isolation.
Unsurprisingly, not all stakeholders agree. The Pakistan Association of Auto Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (Paapam) has expressed strong reservations about reducing tariffs to 15% over the next five years. They argue that such reductions could force many local firms to shut down and exacerbate unemployment.
However, the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) counters that excessively high tariffs – currently over 87% on auto parts – only encourage smuggling. According to the KCCI, smuggled auto parts already account for 60% of the market, worth $380 million.
Similarly, a Customs Department study found that in 2021, smuggled auto parts captured half of the Rs122 billion market while local production stood at just Rs16 billion. Ironically, tariffs designed to protect the domestic industry are instead incentivising smuggling and undermining both industry and government revenue.
High tariffs carry several additional drawbacks. They have contributed to Pakistan's economic isolation, both regionally and globally. To offset the impact on certain industries, the government has introduced a range of schemes to provide cheaper inputs – yet these benefits are largely captured by a few large players, leaving SMEs at a disadvantage. At the same time, the cost of exemptions and concessions under the customs duty regime has surged, now amounting to nearly 50% of the total tariff revenue. This growing volume of preferential treatment not only undermines the integrity of the tariff system but is also widely seen as a major deterrent to foreign investment, which thrives on transparency, predictability and a level playing field.
Tariff reform is not a leap into the unknown; it is a calculated, evidence-based step towards a more dynamic, inclusive and globally competitive economy. While short-term resistance is inevitable, the long-term benefits far outweigh the costs.
If implemented with vision and consistency, these reforms can serve as a cornerstone of Pakistan's economic transformation, helping the country shift from a consumption-driven, import-reliant model to one that thrives on productivity, innovation and exports. This is not just about trade policy; it is about reshaping Pakistan's economic destiny. The choice before us is clear: continue with the status quo and endure recurring crises, or embrace reform and move confidently towards prosperity.

Low turnout as opposition boycotts divisive Venezuela vote,"US
.
A trickle of Venezuelans lined up at the polls Sunday to choose a new legislature and state governors in a vote that the main opposition party was boycotting in protest at last summer's disputed reelection of President Nicolas Maduro.
Some 21 million voters are eligible to cast ballots for 285 members of the National Assembly and 24 governors, including for the first time in the disputed oil-rich region of Essequibo, on the border with Guyana.
But pollster Delphos projected a turnout of just 16 percent, mostly Maduro supporters, after the main opposition -- led by Maria Corina Machado, an engineer and former lawmaker -- urged Venezuelans not to legitimize what they see as yet another sham election.
Polls opened at 6:00 am (1000 GMT), but by midday AFP journalists at polling stations in Caracas, San Cristobal and Barinas reported that just a handful of voters had turned out.
It was a far cry from the crowded presidential election of last summer, marred by violence and allegations of fraud as Maduro claimed a third-term victory.
""It's empty also because of the time,"" Carla Romero, a 52-year-old civil servant, told AFP.
""It's an important process of citizen participation,"" said Samadi Romero, a 32-year-old university student who voted for Maduro's son for the National Assembly.
""I'm not going to vote because I voted (in the presidential election) and they stole the elections. So it's really a farce,"" said Candelaria Rojas Sierra, a 78-year-old retired civil servant in San Cristobal, on her way to mass to ""pray for Venezuela.""
The polls officially close at 6:00 pm, although polling stations must remain open as long as there are voters waiting in line.
A small opposition faction led by two-time former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles had rejected the boycott call, arguing that previous voter stayaways had merely allowed the 62-year-old Maduro to expand his grip on power.
""We must vote as an act of resistance, of struggle,"" said Capriles, who is running for the National Assembly.
Tensions were high in the run-up to the election.
More than 400,000 security agents were deployed to monitor the vote.

Iraq's water reserves are at their lowest in 80 years after a dry rainy season, a government official said Sunday, as its share from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers shrinks.
Water is a major issue in the country of 46 million people undergoing a serious environmental crisis because of climate change, drought, rising temperatures and declining rainfall.
Authorities also blame upstream dams built in neighbouring Iran and Turkey for dramatically lowering the flow of the once-mighty Tigris and Euphrates, which have irrigated Iraq for millennia.

"Shehbaz, Erdogan vow to elevate 'strategic' ties","US
PM holds talks with Turkiye president in Istanbul; Thanks Ankara for support during Marka-e-Haq
Pakistan and Turkiye reiterated their resolve to ""elevate the bilateral strategic partnership to greater heights"" during ""a warm and most cordial meeting"" between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul on Sunday.
Shehbaz, accompanied by Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and key cabinet ministers, began his two-day official visit to Turkiye, as part of his four-nation regional tour, the Prime Minister's Office (Press Wing) said in a statement.
In the meeting with President Erdogan, Prime Minister Shehbaz expressed gratitude to the government and the people of Turkiye for their unwavering support to Pakistan during the recent conflict with India, the statement said.
Underscoring the strength of the fraternal bond between the two nations, Shehbaz lauded Turkiye's principled stance and the outpouring of goodwill of the Turkish people for Pakistan. He described it as ""a source of great comfort and strength"" for Pakistan, the statement added.
He highlighted the courage and the spirit of sacrifice of the Pakistan Armed Forces and the resolute patriotism of the Pakistani people that was demonstrated in an unprecedented manner and contributed greatly to Pakistan's overwhelming victory in Marka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
The two leaders conducted a comprehensive review of the entire spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirmed their principled support for each other's core concerns, including the Kashmir dispute. They pledged to continue working closely for regional peace, and the shared prosperity of their peoples.
""The two leaders  reiterated their resolve to elevate the [bilateral] strategic partnership to greater heights,"" the statement said, adding that both sides ""renewed commitment to further deepen the multifaceted cooperation between Pakistan and Turkiye"".
Emphasising the need for further strengthening bilateral cooperation, particularly through joint ventures and enhanced investment, Shehbaz highlighted key sectors, including energy, information technology, defence production, infrastructure, and agriculture as areas of mutual interest and potential.
The statement said that Prime Minister Shehbaz and President Erdogan also followed up on the implementation of key decisions taken during the seventh session of the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) held in Islamabad on February 13, 2025.
In addition to bilateral issues, the two leaders also discussed pressing regional and international developments. They expressed deep concern over the grave humanitarian situation in Gaza and called for an immediate ceasefire and unimpeded humanitarian access to the affected Palestinian population.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq dar, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Syed Tariq Fatemi and Pakistan's Ambassador Dr Yusuf Junaid were also part of Pakistan delegation. President Erdogan also hosted dinner for Prime Minister Shehbaz and his delegation.
""The engagement [between the leaders of the two countries] reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, anchored in shared values, mutual respect, and a common vision for progress and prosperity,"" the Prime Minister's Office stated.

Norris wins 'dream' maiden Monaco Grand Prix,"US
The Briton finished ahead of Ferrari's local hero Charles Leclerc
Lando Norris resisted intense pressure to claim a well-deserved victory for McLaren ahead of Ferrari's local hero Charles Leclerc in Sunday's strangely chaotic and tactical Monaco Grand Prix.
The Briton came home 3.131 seconds clear of last year's winner with championship leading McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri taking third.
Four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull came next ahead of seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Ferrari.
Norris became the first McLaren winner in Monaco since Hamilton, in his first title-winning season of 2008. It was his first Monaco triumph, his second this year and the sixth of his career.
French rookie Isack Hadjar finished sixth for the RB team ahead of Esteban Ocon of Haas, Liam Lawson in the second RB and the Williams pair Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.
""Monaco baby, yeah baby!"" screamed Norris from his car during his slowdown lap after closing to within three points of Piastri in the title race.
""It feels amazing. It's a long and gruelling race. I was nervous into the last corner and we pushed, but we won in Monaco so it doesn't matter how you do it.
""I've realised a dream today.""
The race began on a clear, dry and sunlit afternoon with the teams choosing a wide range of tyres ahead of the first mandatory two-stop race.
Norris made a solid start from pole, but went close to sliding off at Ste Devote. He held on to resist Leclerc before a quartet of tail-enders - including Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly made early stops.
A skirmish involving Kimi Antonelli and Gabriel Bortoleto was followed by early use of a virtual safety car (VSC) which prompted the first stops, but most stayed out with Norris hanging on in front.
Yellow flags waved again on lap eight when Gasly lost control of his Alpine at the Nouvelle Chicane and ran into Tsunoda's Red Bull, damaging his front left wheel. He limped back to the pits and retired.
The disrupted order was affected by off-set strategies as teams sought to control one car's pace to create space for a pit-stop for the other.
This ploy required Hamilton, Lawson and Sainz, among others, to sacrifice their races, in the process slowing the field and creating traffic jams.
Hamilton pitted on lap 18 and Norris on 20, the race leader resuming in fourth as Hadjar, making the most of RB's tactics, pitted for a second time and returned in eighth.

Peshawar to witness two political demos today,"US
Due to these demonstrations, GT Road is expected to be closed to traffic from afternoon onward
Two major political parties are set to stage demonstrations on GT Road in Peshawar today, showcasing their political strength and raising key issues.
The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) will protest against alleged corruption, deteriorating law and order, and other provincial government policies, while Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) will hold a separate protest against drone strikes in tribal districts.
Due to these demonstrations, GT Road is expected to be closed to traffic from afternoon onward, causing potential disruptions to the city's transport network.
The PPP protest is scheduled for 2 PM outside Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly. The party leadership from the province will address the rally, highlighting concerns over governance and administrative failures in the region.
Meanwhile, PTI's protest, led by the party's provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan, will take place at 5 PM in the Hashtnagri area. The demonstration is in response to recent drone attacks in the tribal areas.
Authorities anticipate significant traffic congestion across the city, particularly on GT Road.
Commuters may also face delays on inner-city routes including Dalazak Road, Dabgari, Saddar, and Khyber Road due to the protests and associated road closures.

Netflix drops trailer for sub implosion docufilm,"US
'Titan: The OceanGate Disaster' to release on June 11
In a trailer released recently, Netflix confirmed that the documentary Titan: The OceanGate Disaster will be available for streaming from June 11. As per The Hollywood Reporter, the film is headed to the Tribeca Festival on June 6, days before its premiere.
Directed by Mark Monroe, the feature follows the 2023 underwater implosion of Titan, a submersible operated by American tourism and expeditions company OceanGate. It offers insights into the mindset of CEO Stockton Rush, who piloted the Titan but breathed his last after the submersible malfunctioned.
Titan: The OceanGate Disaster is produced by Monroe, Lily Garrison, and Jon Bardin, with Liz Garbus, Dan Cogan, Kate Barry, Mala Chapple, Tommy Coriale, Jude Gerard Prest, Hannah Olson, and Amy Herdy onboard as executive producers.
The film employs whistleblower testimony, audio recordings, and footage from the company's beginnings to revisit the voyage to the wrecked Titanic that resulted in the deaths of five people, including Pakistani father and son Shahzada and Suleman Dawood.
""There was no way of knowing when Titan was going to fail. But it was a mathematical certainty that it would fail,"" an individual says in the trailer.
Another says of the CEO, ""I thought Stockton was a borderline psychopath. How do you manage a person like that who owns the company?""
Carrying a pilot and four passengers, the submersible went missing in June 2023 with all individuals, including British explorer Hamish Harding and French diver Paul Henri Nargeolet, confirmed to be dead soon after.
The BBC recently obtained footage from the US Coast Guard's investigation, which captured the sound of the submersible imploding. The footage shows Wendy Rush, the CEO's wife, hearing a sound from her position on the sub's support ship. ""What was that bang?"" she asks.
After receiving a delayed message, she mistakenly believes that there's no cause for concern, not knowing that everyone onboard is dead.
Later this year, the US Coast Guard is expected to publish a report on the findings from the investigation, which will assess the shortcomings and how such a tragedy can be prevented in the future.

Bangladesh's Yunus seeks unity with fresh political talks,"PL
.
Bangladesh's interim leader held a second day of marathon talks Sunday with multiple parties seeking to build unity and calm intense political power struggles, party leaders and officials said.
Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held, has called for rival parties to give him their full support.
The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted by a student-led revolt in August 2024, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Yunus met around 20 party leaders on Sunday, after talks that stretched late into Saturday evening with the major political parties, including those who have protested against the government this month.
Mamunul Haque, leader of the Islamist Khelafat-e-Majlish party, was among those who spoke to Yunus on Sunday in discussions that he said focused on ""the ongoing crisis"".
After a week of escalation during which rival parties protested on the streets of the capital Dhaka, the government led by Yunus warned on Saturday that political power struggles risked jeopardising gains that have been made.
""Broader unity is essential to maintain national stability, organise free and fair elections, justice, and reform, and permanently prevent the return of authoritarianism in the country,"" it said in a statement.
Yunus on Saturday met with the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), seen as the election front-runners, who are pushing hard for polls to be held by December.
According to Bangladeshi media and military sources, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman also said this week that elections should be held by December, aligning with BNP demands.
Microfinance pioneer Yunus, who returned from exile at the behest of protesters in August 2024, says he has a duty to implement democratic reforms before elections he has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.

Tax reform must start at the core,"AZ
As budget nears, relief for salaried workers and expansion of tax net are crucial to revive growth, protect
As budget season looms, attention is firmly fixed on the current finance czar and team Sharif, who are tasked with steering Pakistan from the stabilisation phase into a sustainable growth trajectory. While the first year under the new government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme has largely met expectations, the real test lies in the next two to three years.
Despite some geopolitical triumphs and a renewed sense of national security amid regional tensions, the true battle for Pakistan remains economic. We can ill afford complacency. Structural economic reforms are urgent, particularly in enhancing the country's chronically low tax-to-GDP ratio — currently hovering around 10.6%, with an ambitious target of 11% set for this year.
Tax reform: A shift towards equity
Thus far, the burden of taxation has disproportionately fallen on the already compliant segments of the economy. Now is the time to widen the net. Greater fiscal inclusion must be achieved by targeting the largely untaxed informal and retail sectorsthose operating outside the formal economic structure.
One pressing area for reform is the taxation of the salaried class. Over recent years, salaried individuals have endured what can only be described as a 'quadruple shock'. First, significant currency depreciation has eroded the real dollar value of their earnings. Second, income tax rates have increased on these already diminished earnings. Third, economic stagnation has led to job losses and a dearth of new opportunities. Finally, soaring utility bills and indirect taxation have dramatically reduced disposable income, making daily life increasingly unaffordable for the lower and middle classes.
Recognising the middle class as a growth engine
The World Bank estimates that 40% of Pakistan's population now lives below the poverty line. Combined, the lower and middle classes constitute well over 200 million citizens — a vast segment of the labour force and the electorate. In most developed economies, the salaried class forms the backbone of both economic productivity and consumer demand. Pakistan must move in a similar direction.
Providing tax relief to this segment is not merely a moral imperativeit is also sound economics. Reduced income tax for salaried individuals could generate a multiplier effect. Given their higher marginal propensity to consume, such relief would inject liquidity directly into the economy, stimulating demand, growth, and eventually tax revenues. Furthermore, increased savings could help reduce the cost of borrowing for public and private sector investments alike.
Lowering the effective tax burden on salaries also incentivises formal employment and entrepreneurial activity. Employers often focus on net-of-tax salary offers; a lower tax regime would encourage job creation and business expansion, particularly among SMEs.
Political economy of reform
Currently, both salaried and corporate tax rates in Pakistan are among the highest in the region and peer economies. Such a high-tax environment hampers competitiveness and suppresses economic dynamism. A bold new vision is required to tackle this crisis.
Convincing the IMF of a Laffer Curve-style argument — that lower taxes can lead to higher revenues — may be a stretch, given Pakistan's historical credibility issues. However, a credible reform package could still win support. Key pillars of such a package should include: rapid privatisation of loss-making state-owned enterprises like PIA; the expansion of the tax base to include the vast retail sector; higher capital gains taxation on real estate speculators; and, crucially, the devolution of agricultural tax collection to provinces, targeting influential landowners who often escape the tax net while shaping policy.
Without these structural changes, Pakistan risks perpetuating a model where military strength is unmatched by economic independence. True sovereignty in the modern world is measured not just in strategic capability but in economic resilience.

Govt vows to make PR passenger-friendly,"US
Minister urges authorities to ensure high standards of hygiene and sanitation
Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi Sunday reaffirmed the government's commitment to transforming Pakistan Railways into a modern, reliable and passenger-friendly mode of transport.
""Efforts are underway to make the railway a reliable and preferred mode of travel,"" he said while paying an unannounced visit to Margalla Railway Station.
The minister assessed the overall facilities and engaged directly with passengers and staff.
During his visit, Abbasi conducted a detailed inspection of cleanliness arrangements across the station premises and expressed satisfaction over the efforts of the staff.
He instructed station authorities to ensure that high standards of hygiene and sanitation are consistently maintained.
He personally inspected each coach of the train stationed at the platform, evaluating onboard conditions and facilities provided to passengers.
He also took time to interact with travelers, listening attentively to their complaints and suggestions regarding railway services.
The minister held discussions with railway personnel about the quality of service and various operational challenges.
He also reviewed the progress of ongoing development projects aimed at upgrading the Margalla Station infrastructure.
The minister announced plans to introduce recreational facilities at Margalla Station and said that specially designed public restaurants are also under consideration as part of the station's future development.
Last month, it was reported that the Pakistan Railways has been facing serious issues in ensuring smooth train operations across the country as a major chunk of its rolling stock has become overage, with 58 per cent of the entire locomotive fleet completing its functional lifespan.

Imposter held for assaulting medic,"RO
A case was registered at Murree Police Station, and the police swiftly arrested the accused.
A female doctor from the Government TB Hospital Samli in Murree was allegedly sexually assaulted by a man in a private hotel near Sunny Bank on the night of May 20. The accused had been falsely presenting himself as a Special Advisor to the Punjab Chief Minister.
A case was registered at Murree Police Station, and the police swiftly arrested the accused, identified as Asad Khan.
According to reports, the suspect first went to Samli Hospital, where he verbally abused the security staff and forcibly took the lady doctor, introducing her as his wife, in a Mehran car. Two unidentified men were already present in the vehicle, who allegedly threatened the doctor with death.
Both the accused, Asad Khan, and the victim reportedly belong to the same village in Khanewal. The lady doctor stated that Asad had previously attempted to sexually assault her in Lahore after luring her there. He had also misled her with false promises of employment in various hospitals, claiming he could secure postings through his influence.
However, credible sources confirmed that the doctor was appointed to Murree's TB Sanatorium Hospital purely on merit. She had only been at her new post for two days before the incident occurred. The Murree police have initiated legal proceedings.

MBBS fee spike irks families,"US
With government colleges offering limited seats, private medical education has become unaffordable
In Pakistan, nearly all parents hope that at least one of their children gets to flaunt the highly revered, ""Dr."" title of a doctor. However, as the medical education sector becomes increasingly reliant on costly private institutions, it appears that the white coat will now be reserved for those born with a golden spoon in their mouth.
In 2019, the total tuition fees for the five-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree was fixed at Rs5 million. Although private medical colleges implemented this policy for two years, now they are charging Rs10 million to Rs15 million as fees for the same degree. As a result of the increase in fees, students and their parents are facing severe financial difficulties since they also have to bear the additional cost of Rs2 million on books, clothing, transportation and daily expenses during the five-year academic period.
Beenish, a pre-medical student, shared her experience of taking admission at a private medical school after she could not qualify for a government college. ""In addition to the first-year fee of Rs2.2 million, I was asked to deposit additional money in the name of donation, for which no receipt was given. If we use the college's transportation, then Rs100,000 is collected annually as travel charges. Similarly, a monthly fee of Rs50,000 is sought for living in the girls' hostel. Our parents are suffering from severe mental stress because of the huge sum of money required for our education,"" said Beenish.
Ali Murtaza, a second-year medical student at a private medical college confirmed that exorbitant fees were being collected from students at private institutions even though their faculty was incomplete. ""Private medical colleges have a monopoly in the city and are charging arbitrary fees. As a result, medical education has become so expensive that the children of low to middle-income parents cannot afford to become doctors,"" exclaimed Murtaza.
Muhammad Zia Iqbal, former Dean of Basic Sciences at Dow University and former Professor at the Sindh Medical College, confirmed that private medical education had become a commercial industry in the country since the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) had failed to formulate any uniform policy regarding their fees. ""Hence, the annual fee of private colleges has increased by 200 per cent,"" claimed Iqbal.
On the other hand, the PMDC has maintained complete silence on the extraordinary, unannounced and arbitrary increase in tuition fees by private medical and dental colleges. From 2019 to 2021, the annual tuition fee for MBBS was fixed at Rs1 million. However, after the dissolution of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), the Pakistan Medical Council (PMC) divided medical colleges across the country into A, B and C categories, after which these colleges started deciding their own fee.
Some medical colleges are charging an additional fee of 10 to 20 per cent every year. An international medical college in Karachi is charging a five-year fee of 90,000 US dollars, hence proving that the PMDC has become practically inactive. This is aggravated by the fact that limited seats are allocated for medical education in government medical and dental colleges.
A total of 2,450 seats are allocated for MBBS in government medical colleges in Sindh. The number of government medical colleges across Sindh including Karachi is 12 while the number of government dental colleges is seven and the number of government medical universities is six.
The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council has issued a public notice on January 8, 2025, directing private medical and dental colleges to not collect fees for the academic session of 2024-25 until the Medical Education Committee established by the Prime Minister under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister takes a decision regarding the review of tuition fees.

23 dead as Israel controls 77% of Gaza Strip,"HK
Spain hosts European, Arab nations to pressure Israel on ending war
Israeli military strikes killed at least 23 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Sunday, including a senior rescue service official and a journalist, local health authorities said.
In a separate statement, the Gaza media office said Israeli forces were in control of 77% of the Gaza Strip, either through ground forces or evacuation orders and bombardments that keep residents away from their homes.
The latest deaths in the Israeli campaign resulted from separate Israeli strikes in Khan Younis in the south, Jabalia in the north and Nuseirat in the central Gaza Strip, medics said.
In Jabalia, they said local journalist Hassan Majdi Abu Warda and several family members were killed by an airstrike that hit his house earlier on Sunday.
Another airstrike in Nuseirat killed Ashraf Abu Nar, a senior official in the territory's civil emergency service, and his wife in their house, medics added.
The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said that Abu Warda's death raised the number of Palestinian journalists killed in Gaza since October 2023 to 220.
Later on Sunday, the International Committee of the Red Cross ICRC said in a statement that two of its staff – Ibrahim Eid and Ahmad Abu Hilal - had been killed in a strike on a house in Khan Younis on Thursday.
""Their killing points to the intolerable civilian death toll in Gaza. The ICRC reiterates its urgent call for a ceasefire and for the respect and protection of civilians, including medical, humanitarian relief, and civil defence personnel,"" the ICRC statement added.
Meanwhile, Spain's foreign minister said the international community should look to sanction Israel to stop the war in Gaza as European and Arab nations gathered in Madrid on Sunday to urge a halt to its offensive.
Some of Israel's longstanding allies have added their voices to growing international pressure after it expanded military operations in Gaza.
A two-month aid blockade has worsened shortages of food, water, fuel and medicine in the Palestinian territory, stoking fears of famine.
Aid organisations say the trickle of supplies Israel has recently allowed to enter falls far short of needs.
The talks in Madrid aim to stop Israel's ""inhumane"" and ""senseless"" war in Gaza, Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares told reporters before the gathering opened.
Humanitarian aid must enter Gaza ""massively, without conditions and without limits, and not controlled by Israel"", he added, describing the Strip as humanity's ""open wound"".
""Silence in these moments is complicity in this massacre... that is why we are meeting,"" said Albares.
Representatives from European countries including France, Britain, Germany and Italy are joining envoys from Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Morocco, the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
Norway, Iceland, Ireland and Slovenia, who like Spain have already recognised a Palestinian state, are also taking part alongside Brazil.
After the European Union decided this week to review its cooperation deal with Israel, Albares told reporters Spain would request its ""immediate suspension"".
Spain would also urge partners to impose an arms embargo on Israel and ""not rule out any"" individual sanctions against those ""who want to ruin the two-state solution forever"", he added

Operation Bunyanum Marsoos to operation economy,"AZ
It's time to hire the right people, stop importing consultants, and make decisions based on ground realities
The Operation Bunyan Marsoos (OBM) concluded with a decisive victory for Pakistan. The armed forces' zeal and unwavering commitment to protecting the motherland thwarted all attempts by adversaries (India and Israel). Pakistan has once again demonstrated its ability to be a formidable power, possessing both the will and the capacity to safeguard its sovereignty and interests.
This reinforces the fact that in challenging times, Pakistan achieves remarkable feats, and Pakistanis are a steadfast and resilient nation. The Pakistani nation has demonstrated this repeatedly, from the 1965 war to the 2022 flood. Thus, no one should doubt the ability or resolve of the people and the State of Pakistan to defend its sovereignty and interests.
However, the zeal and commitment were not without wisdom. It is apparent from the decision-making, observance of merit, appointment of the right person for the right job, and establishment of the chain of command. for example, the army, air force, and navy are always led by professional and brilliant soldiers from their respective fields. it never happened that a navy sailor led the air force. the observance of merit and commitment to the right person for the right job has turned the armed forces into a formidable power and contributed to remarkable achievements.
Pakistan needs to carry the same mentality, policy, strategy, and commitment to turn around the economy.
Firstly, apply the policy of the right person for the right job. In pursuance of this policy, Pakistan needs to entrust economic planning and management to economic professionals with brains. They are trained to formulate and oversee economic strategies. A bird's-eye view of global economic institutions, as well as national ministries and departments, clearly indicates that economists lead the charge in driving economic progress. Unfortunately, in the case of Pakistan, the situation is quite different. Economists are often sidelined, while those outside of the field frequently manage economic affairs.
The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) serves as a prime example in this regard. SIFC is an excellent and timely initiative; it was much needed. However, its execution falls short. Policymakers have overlooked the importance of selecting the right people for the right jobs. SIFC has been staffed with bureaucrats and military personnel who possess little or no understanding of the economy or its dynamics. Consequently, after more than two years, aside from a few projects, SIFC has struggled to deliver on its perceived objectives. The finance ministry offers another prominent example. It is often led by chartered accountants and bankers who are not trained to plan or manage the economy.
Second, indigenous wisdom and local experts, who are working within the system, should lead the development of economic policies and plans. They may not be good at speaking English or giving fancy presentations, but they know the economy better than anyone else. They have devoted their lives to understanding and operating the economic system during its most challenging times. They are aware of the strengths and weaknesses of Pakistan's economic system.
Unfortunately, the Pakistani elite do not like them and discourage them. The elite enjoy listening to fancy presentations and fluent English and are impressed by international organisations' tags, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Thus, they love to import expats and consultants. The expats and imported consultants do not fully understand the ground realities, weaknesses, and strengths of Pakistan's economic system. They only give fancy slogans or do marketing for foreign companies. They are selling false dreams of entering the tertiary economy by bypassing the secondary economy, which is not possible. Unfortunately, our elite is happy with such slogans.
Third, before devising any policy or plan, policymakers and planners must have a strong understanding of the ground realities. It must be a prerequisite for policy development. For example, these days, every expat and imported consultant is talking about technology and urging Pakistan to venture into it and make it a leading area of work.
There is no second opinion that Pakistan must venture into the technology field; however, it should have a place on the priority list, given its role in the economy and Pakistan's economic status. There is no harm in dreaming big, but we must also remember that the execution of policies and plans is done based on ground realities, not fancy slogans.
The ground realities indicate that Pakistan is not a major producer of technology, especially as it lags in the production of hardware such as machines, laptops, satellites, or mobile phones. Pakistan is only a consumer of the technology, and expats and consultants advise them to buy technology from global companies.
Furthermore, the analysis of ground realities suggests that, at present, the strength of our economy is based on agriculture, minerals, livestock, tourism, and defence products, among others. Thus, we need to focus on modernising agriculture, developing an agricultural and livestock value chain, and building markets for defence products. Simultaneously, Pakistan needs to work towards transitioning to a secondary economy by fast-tracking industrialisation. The transition will also give an impetus to technology development. Unfortunately, we are not doing it. We are blindly running after the fancy slogans raised by expats or imported consultants.
Thus, if Pakistan wants to grow, Pakistan needs to change. If Pakistan successfully changes, then Pakistan can turn around its economy. Fortunately, we have an excellent opportunity to do so through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The CPEC has all the ingredients that can help Pakistan revive its economy and pave the way for sustainable development. Following the successful completion of the first phase, CPEC has now entered its second phase. The long-term document of CPEC shows that industrialisation and agricultural cooperation would be driving forces during the second phase. Moreover, Pakistan and China have strengthened their science and technology cooperation to create and enhance Pakistan's technological base. These three areas of collaboration can fast-track the transition to the secondary economy and pave the way for the tertiary economy.
However, to fully benefit from the CPEC and leverage our strengths, Pakistan must address the areas discussed above. Let's try to understand the importance of these areas or required interventions through an example. For instance, consider a scenario: can Pakistan appoint a skilled doctor to the post of air chief marshal instead of a professional soldier from the Pakistan Air Force? If Pakistan had appointed an engineer as air chief marshal, what would have been the status of Pakistan in the recent war?
During the recent conflict, the air force was led by a career soldier who dedicated his life to the Pakistan Air Force. Now, imagine another scenario: was it appropriate to hire a foreign consultant, such as someone from the American Air Force, to lead the Pakistani Air Force by arguing that he leads the most advanced and largest air force in the world? No, not at all, because he does not understand the Pakistani Air Force and lacks the passion to serve the country. The same is true for the economy.
In conclusion, based on the above discussion and examples, three suggestions can be listed: hiring the right person for the right job, stopping the import of expats and consultants, and making decisions based on ground realities.

'Govt wastes wheat in warehouses as millions go hungry',"US
Sindh's departments are steeped in their own tales of corruption
Lawmakers of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) have expressed deep concern over the shocking revelation that wheat worth billions of rupees has rotted in warehouses across Karachi. In a statement issued from the party's Bahadurabad headquarters, they described the Sindh Food Department as a ""minefield of corruption,"" accusing it of being complicit in allowing thousands of tons of wheat to decay instead of delivering it to markets.
According to the MQM-P legislators, the scandal is yet another example of a long-standing nexus between corrupt officials and hoarders, which has rendered essential food items unaffordable for the common man.
""Sindh's departments are steeped in their own tales of corruption, yet the government continues to paint a false picture of normalcy,"" the lawmakers said. ""In the past, the Food Department has even claimed in court that rats consumed thousands of tons of wheat or that the stock simply deteriorated.""
They alleged that the department breaks its own corruption records every year, while the public continues to suffer under skyrocketing prices. ""The political slogan of 'Roti, Kapra aur Makaan' has been completely exposed,"" they added. ""Is it not equivalent to snatching food from the mouths of the poor when grain remains locked in warehouses for years instead of reaching markets?""

'Right To Play Pakistan' successfully hosted a Play Fest with vibrant celebrations at Islamabad College for Girls, F-6/2, in connection with the second annual International Day of Play to be held on June 11.
The event brought together over 600 children and other stakeholders in a joyful and inclusive environment dedicated to highlighting the vital role of play in children's development.
In Pakistan, more than 224 million children face barriers to play and education because of poverty, conflict, and climate-related crises. Recognised globally by the United Nations in 2024, the International Day of Play emphasises play as a fundamental right of every child under Article 31 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Play Fest 2025 showcased how play serves as a powerful tool for learning, emotional expression, cognitive growth, and social inclusion, especially for children attending government schools.
Participants enthusiastically engaged in various activity zones that included physical games such as obstacle courses, relay races, tug-of-war, and sack races; creative activities like storytelling, face painting, drum circles, clay therapy, and theater; traditional games including pithoo, marbles, and hopscotch; and cognitive challenges with board games, puzzles, LEGO building blocks, and LUDO. A special play-themed quiz station further stimulated the children's minds.

Truckload of lubricant looted,"US

Incidents of highway robberies are resurging on the M9 Motorway in Jamshoro, where two trucks carrying valuable cargo have been looted within a week. On Sunday, truck driver Kalaamuddin Khan reported to Lunikot police that robbers stole lubricant oil worth Rs140 million. He said a car intercepted their truck, and he and his brother were held at gunpoint, blindfolded, and tied up before being forced into the rear seat of the cabin.
The suspects drove the truck to Bhit Shah, Matiari, where they vanished, leaving the container empty. The shipment, 21,300 liters of oil, was en route from Karachi to Faisalabad. The robbers also took their phones and cash. Although the complaint was filed, an FIR had yet to be registered by evening.
Earlier, on May 17, a truck transporting Rs33 million worth of medicines from Karachi to Rawalpindi was looted similarly. Driver Rehman Hussain said the vehicle was intercepted around 3:35 am, and an FIR was registered at Jamshoro police station.

Real Madrid 'legend' Alonso returns,"PL
He will replace Brazil-bound Carlo Ancelotti as coach
Real Madrid appointed Xabi Alonso to replace Carlo Ancelotti as coach on Sunday, with the Spaniard to take over from June 1 and lead the team at the Club World Cup.
""Xabi Alonso will be the Real Madrid coach for the next three seasons, from June 1, 2025 until June 30, 2028,"" said Real Madrid in a statement.
With veteran Italian coach Ancelotti taking the reins of the Brazilian national team, Madrid secured a deal with former midfielder Alonso, whom they have been linked with for months.
Alonso, 43, leaves German side Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the Bundesliga season after finishing second.
""Alonso is one of the biggest legends at Real Madrid and in world football,"" continued Los Blancos' statement.
""He wore our shirt in 236 games between 2009 and 2014. During that time he won six trophies.""
Alonso will be officially presented on Monday at 1030 GMT.
The Spaniard coached Leverkusen to a league and German Cup double in the 2023-2024 campaign, with his team unbeaten in the top flight, making him a target for Europe's top clubs.
Basque coach Alonso had an agreement with Leverkusen to allow him to depart if one of his former sides, including Madrid, Liverpool and Bayern Munich, wanted to hire him.
Ancelotti's Madrid endured a disappointing campaign, winning the European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup but suffering Champions League quarter-final elimination by Arsenal.
Barcelona beat Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup and Copa del Rey finals and then reclaimed the Liga throne from their arch-rivals, meaning they failed to win a major trophy.
Madrid added French superstar Kylian Mbappe last summer but Ancelotti found it hard to include him in the team alongside Vinicius Junior without destabilising it.
Mbappe netted 31 La Liga goals which should earn him the European Golden Shoe, but Alonso's main job will be to restore the team's solidity without compromising the attack.
After losing two matches in the whole of the previous campaign, this season Madrid slumped to 14 defeats.
La Decima
Alonso will replace one of the most successful managers in Madrid's history, despite their struggles this season.
Ancelotti, 65, took Los Blancos to 15 trophies during two spells at the club, spanning six years.
The Italian won three Champions League trophies in Madrid, including La Decima -- Madrid's 10th -- in 2014, with Alonso as part of his squad, although he was suspended for the final.
Alonso was also coached by Pep Guardiola, Jose Mourinho and Vicente del Bosque among others and is considered tactically adroit and an excellent organiser, which could be ideal for a Madrid side that has lacked balance.
The midfielder won two European Championships and the 2010 World Cup with Spain as he helped La Roja dominate the international game.
After retiring from playing in 2017 he coached Real Madrid and Real Sociedad at youth level before being appointed by Bayer Leverkusen in 2022.
Real Madrid have already signed defender Dean Huijsen from Bournemouth this summer and Liverpool right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold is expected to follow, with his contract coming to an end at Anfield.
Madrid are trying to bring in the England international before the Club World Cup this summer, which will be Alonso's first chance to win silverware.
Real Madrid face Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal in Miami on June 18 in their opening match at FIFA's lucrative summer tournament, which will be the first look at Alonso's side.

NCCIA driver faces inquiry in abduction case,"US
CCTV footage helped identify the suspect, prompting internal probes and legal action
A departmental inquiry has been launched against a driver employed at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), following allegations of involvement in a raid on a call centre and the suspected abduction of its owner.
The inquiry was ordered by the director general of the NCCIA.
According to sources, officials from three different institutions allegedly conducted multiple raids at a call centre in Islamabad and reportedly took the owner with them.
They allegedly demanded ransom before releasing the individual.
After being released, the victim approached Islamabad police. Upon the case being handed over to the CIA unit, CCTV footage reportedly led to the identification of a driver from the NCCIA and an official from the Karachi Company police station as suspects.
Police subsequently detained these individuals along with other suspects.
Three of the accused are now under departmental investigation by their respective agencies, while police have initiated legal proceedings against the two identified suspects.
In a statement, a spokesperson for the NCCIA clarified that the incident appeared to be the result of an individual's actions rather than an institutional operation.
While the driver was initially cleared of the charges by police in preliminary findings, Director General Waqaruddin Syed has still ordered a full internal probe.
Further action will be taken in accordance with legal and administrative rules once the inquiry report is submitted, he said.

Mirror to the rulers,"PK
.
Each year, the HRCP's report sparks a familiar ritual: civil society erupts in outrage, the state stays mute and the powerful grow defensive. The 2024 report, however, lays bare a fundamental breakdown in how we govern and treat the public, particularly the most vulnerable. It's a blunt diagnosis of a country steadily unlearning democracy, shedding compassion and settling into repression.
The findings are impossible to miss, unless one is willfully blind. From sweeping protest curbs to laws that equate criticism with defamation to rising judicial meddling, dissent is being actively crushed. The 26th Amendment — rammed through in majoritarian fashion — and laws like the Public Order Act and the Punjab Defamation Act aren't one-offs. They're part of a pattern. The message is clear: citizens are no longer seen as participants, but only as problems to be managed.
Freedom of expression continues to shrink, per the report. The ban on X drags on like an old wound that refuses to heal. Internet blackouts are now routine whenever unrest brews on the streets. Journalists remain in the line of fire — 162 attacks last year alone. And yet, we still hear official lines about 'restoring order' and 'promoting journalism' as if these were neutral moves rather than calculated muzzling.
The rot also extends into the judiciary, an institution meant to curb overreach but itself under strain from both within and without. The HRCP sounds the alarm on a crippling 2.4 million-case backlog and damning claims by judges of meddling and intimidation. The idea of an independent judiciary — something we proudly tout — rings hollow in practice. If judges feel intimidated, what hope is there for the everyday Pakistani seeking justice?
Violence, too, is surging. Not just from terrorist attacks but also from actions that blur the line between policing and raw force, with nearly 5,000 suspects meeting their end in police encounters across Punjab and Sindh. Justice now happens at the barrel of a gun. Bursting at the seams with lawlessness and impunity, Karachi records over 47,000 crimes while prisons across the country overflow at more than twice their capacity. These are signs of a society fraying and a system buckling under its own weight.
But the decay doesn't stop here. The report shows — as if we needed proof — that Pakistan remains profoundly unjust and perilous for women and children. The numbers are staggering: over 400 honour killings, thousands of rapes, rampant violence and cyber harassment, over 26 million out-of-school children and hundreds of cases of child sexual abuse.
These aren't aberrations. They're baked into the DNA of a state that abandons its most vulnerable. When cruelty becomes routine and children and women are so easily discarded, it's like a society tossing its future in the trash.
But perhaps the most sobering part of the report isn't a single statistic or law — it's the overall picture: a country where political engineering trumps public mandate, where economic pain is normalised, where ecological breakdown goes unchallenged and where religion is twisted to excuse violence. This is democratic decay!
Instead of brushing off the report as mere alarmism, those at the helm would do well to pay heed: the HRCP hasn't attacked the rulers; it has simply held up a mirror to them. If they find the reflection ugly, the remedy lies not in smashing the mirror but in righting the wrongs.
A dispensation that leans on force over fairness, coercion over consensus and control over care can't expect to build a just and lasting society. Can repression ever be a foundation for stability?
Pakistan doesn't need a harder hand. It needs a softer heart and the courage to put human rights at the centre of governance. And if we continue down this path — prioritising control over care and hard power over human dignity — no economic policy, security operation or political slogan will pull us from the brink.

From prison cell to Cannes,"GB
Iran's director Jafar Panahi defies censorship, creates art
Jafar Panahi never set out to be a political filmmaker. ""In my definition, a political filmmaker defends an ideology where the good follow it and the bad oppose it,"" the Iranian director says. ""In my films, even those who behave badly are shaped by the system, not personal choice,"" he tells DW.
But for more than a decade, Panahi has had little choice. Following his support for the opposition Green Movement protests, the director of The White Balloon and The Circle, was handed a 20-year ban on filmmaking and international travel in 2010. That didn't stop him.
Over the years, he found new ways to shoot, edit, and smuggle out his films — from turning his living room into a film set (This Is Not a Film) to using a car as a mobile studio (in Taxi, which won the Golden Bear at the 2015 Berlinale).
Last week, Panahi stepped back into the spotlight — not through smuggled footage or video calls, but in person. For the first time in over two decades, the now 64-year-old filmmaker returned to the Cannes Film Festival to present his latest feature, It Was Just an Accident, premiering in competition to an emotional 8-minute standing ovation.
Prison to the Palais
The road to Cannes has been anything but smooth. Panahi was arrested again in July 2022 and detained in Tehran's notorious Evin prison. After almost seven months and a hunger strike, he was released in February 2023. In a stunning legal victory, Iran's Supreme Court overturned his original 2010 sentence. Panahi was legally free, but artistically still bound by a system he refuses to submit to.
""To make a film in the official way in Iran, you have to submit your script to the Islamic Guidance Ministry for approval,"" he tells DW. ""This is something I cannot do. I made another clandestine film. Again.""
That film, It Was Just An Accident, may be Panahi's most direct confrontation yet with state violence and repression. Shot in secret and featuring unveiled female characters in defiance of Iran's hijab law, the film tells the story of a group of ex-prisoners who believe they've found the man who tortured them — and must decide whether to exact revenge. The taut, 24-hour drama unfolds like a psychological thriller.
Stylistically, It Was Just An Accident is a sharp break from the more contained, and largely self-reflexive works Panahi made while under his official state ban, but the plot remains strongly autobiographical.
Thriller that cuts deep
The film opens with a banal tragedy — a man accidentally kills a dog with his car - and spirals into a slow-burning reckoning with state-sanctioned cruelty. Vahid (Valid Mobasseri), a mechanic who is asked to repair the damaged car, thinks he recognises the owner as Eghbal, aka Peg-Leg, his former torturer. He kidnaps him, planning to bury him alive in the desert. But he can't be sure he's got the right man, because he was blindfolded during his internment.
""They kept us blindfolded, during interrogation or when we left our cells,"" Panahi recalls of his time in prison. ""Only in the toilet could you remove the blindfold.""
Seeking reassurance, the mechanic reaches out to fellow prisoners for confirmation. Soon Vahid's van is packed with victims seeking revenge on the man who abused them for nothing more than voicing opposition to the authorities. There's a bride (Hadis Pakbaten) who abandons her wedding, together with her wedding photographer and former inmate Shiva (Maryam Afshari), to go after the man who raped and tortured her. There's Hamid (Mohamad Ali Elyasmehr), a man so traumatised and so furious by his experience he doesn't care if the man they've caught is the right guy; he just wants vengeance.
""Even dead, they're a scourge on humanity,"" he says of all the intelligence officers serving under the regime.
As the group debates vengeance vs non-violence, alongside brutal descriptions of the beatings and torture they endured, Panahi inserts sly moments of humour and touches of the absurd. The hostage-takers cross paths with Eghbal's family, including his heavily pregnant wife, and suddenly find themselves rushing her to the hospital to give birth. Afterwards, as is tradition in Iran, Vahid heads to a bakery to buy everyone pastries.
""All these characters that you see in this film were inspired by conversations that I had in prison, by stories people told me about the violence and the brutality of the Iranian government, violence that has been ongoing for more than four decades now,"" says Panahi. ""In a way, I'm not the one who made this film. It's the Islamic Republic that made this film, because they put me in prison. Maybe if they want to stop us being so subversive, they should stop putting us in jail.""
No escape, no exile
Despite a career defined by resistance, Panahi insists he's simply doing the only thing he knows how. ""During my 20-year ban, even my closest friends had given up hope that I would ever make films again,"" he said at the Cannes press conference for It Was Just An Accident.
""But people who know me know I can't change a lightbulb. I don't know how to do anything except make films"".
While many Iranian filmmakers have fled into exile - including Panahi's close friend Mohammad Rasoulof, director of the Oscar-nominated The Seed of the Sacred Fig, who now lives in Berlin — Panahi says he has no plans to join them. ""I'm completely incapable of adjusting to another society,"" he says. ""I had to be in Paris for three and a half months for post-production, and I thought I was going to die.""
In Iran, he explained, filmmaking is a communal act of improvisation and trust. ""At 2AM I can call a colleague and say: 'That shot should be longer.' And he'll come join me and we'll work all night. In Europe, you can't work like this. I don't belong.""
So, even after his Cannes triumph, Panahi will return home. ""As soon as I finish my work here, I will go back to Iran the next day. And I will ask myself: What's my next film going to be?""

Things we learned from Eng's rout of Zim,"US
Ben Stokes-led men hammered the tourists by an innings and 45 runs
England launched their home season with an innings and 45-run thrashing of Zimbabwe in a one-off Test at Trent Bridge on Saturday.
A match scheduled for four days was all over before tea on the third, with England off-spinner Shoaib Bashir taking a Test-best 6-81 after Zimbabwe were made to follow-on.
But what is the importance of such a result for England ahead of the sterner challenges that surely await them in an upcoming five-Test series with cricket powerhouse India?
Below AFP Sport examines three key talking points that emerged from a largely lopsided contest in Nottingham.
All-rounder Stokes
If Ben Stokes's Test career continues on its present path – a batting average of 35 and a bowling average of 32 – some future fans may wonder what all the fuss was about.
But the raw figures alone will never tell the whole story when it comes to the England captain's priceless ability as a game-breaker.
At Trent Bridge, the all-rounder was playing his first game of the year in any form of cricket following his latest bout of hamstring surgery.
He rushed back from a similar injury last year and was unable play a full part with the ball.
But in Nottingham, with Zimbabwe in relatively comfort at 187-3 in their first innings, it was lively seam and swing bowler Stokes who took two wickets for no runs in 11 balls to leave the tourists struggling at 199-5, with the follow-on now all but assured.
Stokes' performance was perhaps the biggest plus point for England out of the whole game.
Not only is he an inspirational figure in his own right, Stokes' sympathetic treatment of Bashir was also central to the bowler putting a poor start to the county season behind him with a match-clinching return.
Top-order cash inSeveral things can be true at once: It was a welcome sign for England that all of their top three batsmen made hundreds in a huge first-innings total of 565-6 declared that paved the way for victory.
Yet it was equally true those runs were scored on a good pitch against an utterly outclassed Zimbabwe attack that was further weakened when paceman Richard Ngarava left the field with a back injury after bowling just nine overs.
Nevertheless, openers Zak Crawley (124) and Ben Duckett (140) have often been accused of a lack of ruthlessness, while vice-captain Ollie Pope's 171 came amid speculation his place at number three was under threat when Jacob Bethell returns from franchise duty in the Indian Premier League.
Crawley's hundred was just his fifth in 54 Tests.
But Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum's faith in the 27-year-old Kent right-hander appears unshakeable, with his stunning Ashes 189 at Old Trafford two years ago still fresh in the memory of team management as they build towards a 2025/26 Test series in Australia.
Pace project concerns
England's Sam Cook unsuccessfully appeals for the wicket of Zimbabwe's Ben Curran (unseen) on the second day at Trent Bridge.
England have set great store in assembling a battery of fast bowlers, but the likes of express quicks Jofra Archer, Mark Wood and Olly Stone – none of whom played in Nottingham – have too often been injured.
And there were few reasons for any India batsman to be unduly worried by how England's pace trio at Trent Bridge – Sam Cook, Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue – struggled to impose themselves on a placid pitch where 21-year-old opener Brian Bennett broke the record for the fastest Test hundred by a Zimbabwe batsman with a 97-ball century.
Test debutant Cook, an unusually conventional pick by the current England set-up in that his selection was a reward for years of consistent county form with Essex rather than an educated 'hunch' finished with match figures of 1-119.
It was a stark reminder of the gap left in the attack by the retirements of James Anderson and Stuart Broad, England's all-time two leading Test bowlers with a combined 1,308 wickets between them.

Iffat believes Fahad needs to go easy on vloggers,"PK
Actor thinks showbiz peers should live and let live
In an interview with Hina Niazi, seasoned actor Iffat Umar expressed her opinion on the clash between content creators and showbiz professionals. ""I'm not the kind of person who lives in the past. I've always changed myself according to the times. I have nothing against anyone,"" she said. ""Whatever someone wants to do to attain fame, I feel that we should let them.""
Iffat believes that actors, especially someone as high up in the industry as Fahad Mustafa, should not be too critical of vloggers like Rajab Butt. ""Don't criticise everyone,"" she stressed. ""'Don't do this, don't do that.' I mean, why must it be a competition between Fahad and him?""
The film-and-TV star has voiced his distaste for content creators on multiple occasions in the past. In an interview with Shoaib Akhtar, he disapproved of the idea of sharing the screen with a TikToker, asking whether his peers would do the same. Condemning the process of content creation, he said, ""'Content' is the most overrated word in this country. There is no such thing as content. Everyone is selling their families.""
The Na Maloom Afraad actor has also been critical of the influence of YouTubers on the entertainment industry in the past. He pointed out that, in his opinion, celebrities exercise great caution when giving interviews, as some content creators tend to focus on sensationalising and misrepresenting their statements to generate content for their platforms.
Fahad's firm views caught the attention of YouTuber Rajab Butt, who in turn criticised the actor for accusing content creators of exploiting their families. While defending himself and his craft, Rajab also stated that a senior doesn't get respect by default but must earn it through their actions.
Addressing Fahad in reference to this feud, Iffat said in her interview, ""You've worked hard yourself, Fahad. You are the pride of Pakistan. Measure your hard work with dignity, not with your financial status. And again, you are the highest paid actor in this country. Tend to your own business. Get out of the clutches of frequent criticism. Live and let live.""
Differences aside, Iffat went on to say that things have changed for the better in the entertainment industry. Speaking of her juniors, she said, ""I'm very happy for these kids, who are able to build a grand lifestyle with the help of their hard work and talent. This wasn't the case in my time. I'd tell people I'm an actor, and they'd ask me what my real profession was.""
She believes that younger actors no longer need to deal with these conversations. ""Now nobody asks Fahad or these other kids what they actually do.""

Shoaib crowned Federal Cup champion,"US
He defeated Muzammil in the marathon National Ranking Tennis Championship final
The curtains fell on the 37th OGDCL Federal Cup National Ranking Tennis Championships with a spectacular and action-packed final day at the PTF-SDA Tennis Complex, Islamabad.
The prestigious championship, now in its 37th edition, is organized annually by the Islamabad Tennis Association. This year's tournament featured over 120 players competing across six categories: Men's Singles & Doubles, Ladies' Singles, Boys' U18 Singles, Boys' U14 Singles, and Girls' U12 Singles.
A total of PKR 850,000 was distributed among winners and runners-up as prize money and travel allowances. Due to a thunderstorm and rain in the capital city, the Men's Singles Final — originally scheduled for 4:00 pm — started later than planned. However, the delay did not dampen the intensity or quality of tennis that followed.
In a thrilling showdown, 23-year-old top seed Muhammad Shoaib of PAF successfully defended his title against Muzammil Murtaza 7-6(6), 2-6, 6-4 in an exhilarating three-set battle that lasted over 2 hours and 58 minutes.
Muzammil started strong, breaking Shoaib early and taking a 3-0 lead but Shoaib quickly adjusted his strategy, breaking back in the fifth game and forcing a tiebreak after both players held serve.
In the tiebreak, Shoaib's early mini-break and consistent pressure earned him a hard-fought 8-6 win in the first set. Muzammil bounced back with renewed focus in the second set, breaking Shoaib's serve in the fourth and sixth games to level the match with a 6-2 win.
In the deciding set, both players showcased exceptional baseline rallies and strategic cross-court play, reaching 4-4. Shoaib then delivered a clinical performance, breaking Muzammil's serve in the ninth game with powerful down-the-line winners. He maintained his composure while serving for the match, forcing unforced errors from his opponent and sealing the final set 6-4. The enthralling final was officiated by ITF White Badge Umpire Husnain Mehmood.
Earlier in the day, in the Junior 18 & Under Singles Final, Muhammad Salar emerged as the champion, defeating promising Islamabad youngster M. Hazik Aasim in a competitive straight-sets match.
Muhammad Shafik, Director Commercial - Air Blue, Majid Bashir, President Islamabad Tennis Association, and the President Pakistan Tennis Federation Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi attended as guests of honor.

A nasty and dangerous phase,"US
.
The fragile ceasefire between Pakistan and India may remain intact, but tension is far from over. The two nuclear-armed neighbours, with a long history of wars and military standoffs, are now entering a new, far more perilous phase in their relationship.
Consider the post-Pulwama episode of February 2019. Despite India's airstrikes on Balakot and Pakistan's swift military response, tensions were de-escalated relatively quickly. Diplomatic ties, though briefly strained, were soon normalised. Borders remained open, and even the Indus Waters Treaty — often cited as a pressure point — was not weaponised. In fact, weeks after the military standoff, then-Prime Minister Imran Khan went so far as to express a preference for Modi's re-election, believing a hardliner like him might finally resolve the deadlock. That assumption, however, was wrong.
Today, the landscape is starkly different. After the Pahalgam attack, India took a series of unprecedented steps. It suspended the IWT for the first time since 1960, closed the Wagah-Attari border, expelled military advisers, reduced diplomatic staff, and ordered all Pakistani nationals to leave the country. Pakistan responded in kind.
Then came the events of May 6th and 7th. In a dramatic escalation, India launched missile and drone strikes deep into Pakistani territory. For the first time, the world witnessed an exchange of missiles and drones between two nuclear powers. What made matters worse was the disinformation campaign run by Indian media.
On the eve of Pakistan's counter-strike to India's so-called Operation Sindoor, Indian news outlets spread false reports — claims of Karachi Port being bombed, Indian forces entering Lahore, and even the Indian flag flying over Islamabad. These fabrications were quickly debunked by international media, which confirmed that India's attempts to set a new normal had failed. Notably, the downing of advanced Rafael jets by Pakistan remains a hot topic in global defence circles — one India refuses to acknowledge, citing vaguely that ""losses are part of combat.""
The broader implications of this latest flare-up are deeply troubling. Pakistan and India appear poised for their most dangerous confrontation yet. Frustrated by setbacks and international apathy, Prime Minister Modi is doubling down on aggressive diplomacy. India has dispatched bipartisan delegations worldwide to present its narrative, while simultaneously pushing for Pakistan's diplomatic and economic isolation.
One telling move came just days after the conflict: Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's visit to the Netherlands. This was no routine stopover. The Dutch have played a key role in strengthening Pakistan's maritime security, including supplying mine-hunters and offshore patrol vessels. India's goal was clear: pressure the Dutch to halt such cooperation. Similar efforts are underway with Pakistan's other economic and defence partners.
India is also believed to be leaning heavily on regional allies to discourage any financial or strategic collaboration with Islamabad. There are signs that India is lobbying behind closed doors, using economic leverage and diplomatic influence to corner Pakistan multilaterally.
Pakistan on the other hand is actively pursuing its own game plan. Together with its close allies and international partners, Islamabad is making efforts to nullify New Delhi's campaign. Despite limited resources and other challenges, Pakistan has demonstrated it could take on India both on the battlefield and diplomatic front.
While India is struggling to find answers to its miscalculation, Pakistan is looking to take advantage of the opportunity its eastern neighbour has thrown at it. The decision-makers in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, however, must not be complacent. India will not take this defeat lightly. It would resort to both covert and overt actions to undermine Pakistan. The coming months could well see the region descend into a new and even more volatile chapter — one that might push South Asia closer to a conflict of unprecedented scale.

"Man accused of slaying wife, driver","US
Victims shot, mutilated; suspect held days later from Rawalpindi
Police claimed to have cracked a double murder case in Kotli Loharan, Daska where a man allegedly killed his wife and her suspected lover before attempting to dispose of their bodies in a car.
The victims, identified as 36-year-old Ehtesham alias Raja and 28-year-old Sana, were found dead in a car a few days ago. Both were residents of the same locality.
Police said the car was discovered abandoned near Saddle House in Kotli Loharan.
Local residents noticed the vehicle sitting idle for hours and alerted police after spotting two bodies in the back seat.
Upon arrival, police confirmed that both victims had been shot and showed signs of mutilation, with knife wounds on various parts of their bodies.
The suspect, identified as Imran Bagh Ali - Sana's husband and Ehtesham's employer - allegedly carried out the murders in a fit of rage.
According to the FIR filed by Sidra Ehtesham, the widow of Ehtesham, Imran had frequent arguments with Sana after marrying her following a previous divorce.
Ehtesham had worked as a driver for the couple, and suspicions of an affair had reportedly fuelled tensions in the household.
On the day of the incident, a heated argument reportedly erupted between Imran and Sana. Enraged, Imran is believed to have shot his wife with a pistol.
Ehtesham, who intervened in an attempt to stop the violence, was also shot and killed.
Afterwards, Imran reportedly attempted to dismember the bodies using a knife and searched for a sack to dispose of them but failed.
Instead, he placed
the bodies in his car and drove off.
Police said the car collided with an electric pole.
In panic, Imran abandoned the vehicle and fled the scene.
The bodies remained inside the car for hours before being discovered.
Forensic teams confirmed that both individuals had been brutally murdered, with post-mortem examinations revealing multiple gunshot wounds and deep lacerations.
The bodies were shifted to Allama Iqbal Memorial Teaching Hospital for further examination.
Police launched a manhunt for Imran and arrested him in Rawalpindi.
He is currently in custody at Kotli Loharan Police Station, where he is being interrogated.
DPO Sialkot Faisal Shahzad stated, ""Such heinous acts are intolerable. We are committed to ensuring justice is served and the safety of our citizens is upheld.""
Police say the investigation is ongoing, and more revelations are expected in the coming days.

Govt moves to turn idle power into digital gold,"PK
With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services
In a ground-breaking move to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation, the government allocated 2,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity in the first phase of a national initiative to power Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centres, said a press release on Sunday.
This initiative, spearheaded by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), which works under the Finance Ministry, is part of a broader strategy to monetise surplus electricity, create high-tech jobs, attract billions of dollars in foreign direct investment (FDI), and generate billions of dollars for the government.
According to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the press release stated, this strategic allocation marked a pivotal moment in Pakistan's digital transformation journey, unlocking economic potential by turning excess energy into innovation, investment, and international revenue.
""Pakistan is uniquely positioned — geographically and economically — to become a global hub for data centres. As a digital bridge between Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, Pakistan offers the most strategic location in the world for data flow and digital infrastructure,"" said the press release
Since its inception, the PCC has evoked tremendous interest from global Bitcoin miners and data infrastructure companies. Several international firms have already visited Pakistan for exploratory discussions, the report added.
""Following this landmark announcement, more global players are expected to visit in the coming weeks,"" read the press release. ""Pakistan's underutilised power generation capacity is now being repurposed into a high-value digital asset.""
According to the press release, AI data centres and Bitcoin mining operations, known for their consistent and heavy energy usage, provided an ideal use case for this surplus. ""Redirecting idle energy, especially from plants operating below capacity, allows Pakistan to convert a long-standing financial liability into a sustainable, revenue-generating opportunity,"" it said.
PCC Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Bilal Bin Saqib, while emphasising the transformative nature of the initiative, said that Pakistan could become a global crypto and AI powerhouse with proper regulation, transparency, and international collaboration.
As regulations evolve, he said, ""Pakistan can accumulate Bitcoin directly into a national wallet, marking a monumental shift from selling power in Pakistani rupees to leveraging the digital assets for economic stability"".
With more than 40 million crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres will not only address growing concerns around data sovereignty but also enhance cybersecurity and improve digital service delivery, the press release said.

500 migrants rescued off Greek island,"SA
.
Greek authorities have rescued more than 500 migrants off the southern island of Crete in recent days, the coastguard said in a statement Sunday.
Greece is one of the main gateways to Europe for people fleeing war and poverty, mainly from Asia, Africa and the Middle East.
In recent years, an increasing number of people have embarked on the migratory route south of the island of Crete, opposite Libya and Egypt.
On Saturday alone, some 280 people were rescued from five separate shipwrecks, including 13 minors, said the coastguard statement.
Most were men and many reported having set sail for Greece from Libya, paying ""between 150,000 and 200,000 Egyptian pounds (3,000-4,000 dollars)"".
Among them, authorities arrested a 24-year-old Sudanese and suspected smuggler who was later prosecuted.
The country's deadliest shipwreck occurred two years ago, when a rusty, overloaded trawler sank off the south-western Peloponnese peninsula, claiming more than 600 lives, according to the UN.

Operation Bunyanum Marsoos neutralised 26 Indian targets: DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif
Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry reaffirmed on Sunday that the Pakistani nation and its armed forces have always stood together in the face of external threats and will continue to do so.
Addressing students from various universities of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the military's top spokesperson pointed to recent tensions with India, emphasising the collective resolve displayed by the nation.
""They [India] thought we would attack and Pakistan wouldn't respond. You saw how all of you stood behind your country. The entire Pakistan stood united and, by the grace of Almighty, this iron wall was erected,"" he said, referring to the national unity witnessed during the latest standoff with India following the Pahalgam attack.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said all of India's assumptions, including those made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, were comprehensively disproven by Pakistan's timely and effective response.
He detailed Pakistan's retaliatory steps following the attacks on May 6 and 7, revealing that Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir had ordered a response targeting 26 Indian positions.
The ISPR chief disclosed that Pakistan had successfully destroyed the brigade headquarters of the Indian unit responsible for the shelling that martyred a seven-year-old child, Irtaza, in Muzaffarabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
He further stated that the Indian airbases from which aircraft had launched strikes on May 6 and 7 were also among the targets neutralised during the operation.
Contrasting Pakistan's conduct with that of its adversary, the DG ISPR said that the military adhered to international laws and norms.
""Did your [Pakistan] army target any civilian infrastructure, any civilian population? No,"" he asked the students.
""We are peace-loving and prefer peace as our first choice,"" he added, warning India that any repeat of such aggression would be met with an even more ""fierce response"".
Regarding regional terrorism, Lt Gen Chaudhry said India was orchestrating and financing destabilising activities across South Asia, including Pakistan.
He said that the perpetrators of attacks on mosques and the slaughter of innocent civilians had no connection to Islam or the traditions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or Pashtun culture.
""These terrorists are followers of India,"" he said.
He also referred to a militant figure, Khargi Noorwali, criticising him for justifying collaboration with non-Muslims under the guise of religious legitimacy.
""He claims that Shariah permits seeking help from non-believers. But in Islam, truth and falsehood cannot exist together,"" said the ISPR chief.
""You seek help from India, a country where the dignity of Kashmiri girls is violated,"" he added.
Speaking on Afghanistan, Lt Gen Chaudhry stressed that Pakistan viewed its western neighbour as a ""brotherly Islamic country,"" while criticising elements within the Afghan elite for enabling anti-Pakistan activities.

Khuzdar bus bombing death toll rises to 10,"FR
Seven girls, one boy among the students martyred
Two more students, Sheema Ibrahim and Muskan, embraced martyrdom while receiving treatment in a Quetta hospital, raising the number of students martyred in the recent terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, to eight, according to security sources.
The total death toll has risen to 10.
Security officials confirmed that among those martyred are seven female students and one male student.
On the day of the suicide bombing, Sania Soomro (Grade 6), Hafsa Kausar (Grade 7), and Ayesha Saleem (Grade 10) were among the first to embrace martyrdom.
Later, Haider, Malaika, and Sehr Saleem also succumbed to their injuries while receiving medical treatment, security officials said.
According to intelligence sources, the attack was planned and sponsored by the terrorist state of India.
""The blood of these innocent children will not go unavenged. Those behind this — including the Indian handlers and their local agents — will be held accountable,"" security officials stated.
During a press briefing in Rawalpindi on Friday DG ISPR Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the attack was not just on a school bus, but an attack on our values, education, and the fabric of our society. ""Our response will be decisive. They will not succeed,"" said the interior secretary.
DG ISPR said that India-sponsored attackers have no humanity, morality, and Baloch or Pakistani identity, adding that India has been involved in state-sponsored terrorism for 20 years, destabilising regional peace. He pointed out that in 2009, Pakistan had presented a dossier to the United Nations with evidence of India's involvement in terrorist activities in Balochistan.

"Over Rs1b released for cardiac, burns unit","US
.
Dera Ismail Khan is set to witness a major advancement in its healthcare infrastructure as the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has released Rs1.11 billion for the establishment of modern Cardiac Catheterization Laboratories (Cath Labs) and a state-of-the-art Burn Center.
The facilities will be developed in two major hospitals of the city - Mufti Mehmood Memorial Hospital and District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital.
While talking to APP, K-P Chief Minister's focal person on developmental affairs, Nawaz Khan said that the funds have been officially sanctioned by the provincial Finance Department.
This initiative marks a critical step forward in providing specialized treatment for cardiac patients and burn victims within the region, eliminating the need to seek such services in distant cities.
The project has been met with widespread appreciation from the local population.
Citizens have lauded Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur for their commitment to fulfilling campaign promises and addressing the longstanding healthcare needs of southern K-P. However, while expressing their support, residents have also voiced a strong demand for transparency and timely execution of the project.

Water theft,"US
.
In Karachi, water is like liquid gold for those controlling it. The city's decades-old water crisis has deepened into a criminal enterprise, with tanker mafias operating unchecked, often with the silent complicity of those tasked with managing public utilities. This is not a recent development. Karachi has always faced water shortages, but never before has the theft and trade of water been so systematically entrenched, so brazenly defended and so lethally protected.
In a rare moment of official candour, Mayor Murtaza Wahab has acknowledged the scale of illegal water extraction taking place in the city. Following a surprise inspection on May 10 accompanied by senior officials of KWSC, the mayor confirmed widespread unauthorised tapping in both the Federal Trunk Main and Customer and Technical Maintenance divisions.
His letter to Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah outlines the scale of the theft and the total collapse of internal oversight. Two officials have been suspended. But this is barely a scratch on the surface of a deep-rooted problem. Karachi needs 1,200 million gallons of water daily. It receives barely half of that. What isn't delivered through the fragile and aging infrastructure is stolen by water tanker mafias at extortionate rates to desperate citizens. Those who have dared to raise their voice have faced threats and, in some tragic cases, death. Moreover, the complicity of certain officials within KWSC can also be brushed aside as mere negligence.
Mayor Wahab's call for an inquiry and subsequent action is a welcome, if long overdue, step. But Karachi cannot afford another inquiry that dies in silence. What is needed now is not just accountability but an unflinching dismantling of the entire tanker mafia network, regardless of how high or deep the roots go.

Why consumption-led growth is failing,"US
Pakistan's tax system, riddled with exemptions, high duties and WHT, is flawed
Pakistan's economy is trapped in a structural bind: a consumption-led growth model drives up imports, suppresses exports, and widens tax revenue shortfalls, while an overreliance on regressive withholding taxes – deducted at source from salaries, imports, and production – burdens consumers and stifles progress.
In the first half of fiscal year 2024-25, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its Rs6.009 trillion tax collection target by Rs386 billion, with the tax-to-GDP ratio stagnating at 10.8%, far below the Asia-Pacific average of 19.3% and the 15-20% achieved by fast-growing economies like India, Vietnam, and Malaysia. As a business expert, I argue that Pakistan's tax system, riddled with exemptions and propped up by high customs duties and withholding taxes, is fundamentally flawed.
The perceptions of many so-called tax experts – who defend exemptions and indirect taxes as necessary for equity or simplicity – are empirically unsound and detrimental to growth. This article quantifies the distortions of Pakistan's consumption-led economy, identifies key Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) granting exemptions that must be withdrawn and proposes a roadmap to align the tax-to-GDP ratio with dynamic economies.
Pakistan's economy is overwhelmingly consumption-driven, with private consumption accounting for 83% of GDP in 2022-23, compared to 65% in Vietnam and 60% in Malaysia (World Bank, 2022). This reliance fuels demand for imported goods, with Pakistan's import bill reaching $55.3 billion in FY23, while exports stagnated at $27.7 billion, resulting in a $27.6 billion trade deficit.
Rising consumption drives imports of luxury goods, electronics, and raw materials, depleting foreign exchange reserves to $9.4 billion by December 2024. Meanwhile, high production costs and tax distortions suppress exports, with Pakistan's export-to-GDP ratio at a mere 10%, compared to 25% in Vietnam.
When consumption is curtailed – through austerity or inflation (6% in FY25) – tax revenues collapse. Sales tax, heavily reliant on consumer spending, fell short by Rs286 billion in July-December 2024, as reduced consumption shrank taxable transactions. This volatility underscores the fragility of Pakistan's tax system, which depends on consumption rather than a stable, broad-based tax net.
Fast-growing economies like India balance consumption with investment-led growth, taxing income and production equitably. Pakistan's consumption-led model, exacerbated by tax exemptions, costs the exchequer over Rs1.7 trillion annually, equivalent to 27% of the FBR's total collection in FY23.
Regressive burden of WHT
Pakistan's tax system heavily relies on withholding taxes, which account for 65% of direct tax revenue (Rs1.98 trillion of Rs3.06 trillion in FY23). These taxes, deducted at source from salaries, imports, exports, and transactions, are passed on to consumers, inflating prices and eroding purchasing power.
The salaried class, just 2% of the workforce, contributes 18% of income tax, facing rates up to 35% (Finance Bill 2024), while sectors like agriculture (23% of GDP) contribute only 0.6% to revenue. Withholding taxes on imports (eg, 5.5% on raw materials) and factory-stage production (eg, 1-2% on manufacturing) are embedded in product prices, effectively taxing the poor and middle class indirectly.
For instance, a 5.5% withholding tax on imported edible oil increases retail prices by 8-10% after supply chain markups, contributing to a 30% rise in food prices in FY24. Similarly, a 1% withholding tax on exports (SRO 1125(I)/2011) raises production costs, making Pakistani textiles less competitive than Bangladesh's, where export taxes are minimal.
This regressive structure contradicts claims by tax experts that withholding taxes simplify collection. Instead, they burden consumers, discourage exports, and widen the tax shortfall, as evidenced by the Rs442 billion combined shortfall in indirect taxes in H1 FY25.
Exemptions: undermining tax base
Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) granting exemptions in income tax and sales tax are a primary driver of Pakistan's low tax-to-GDP ratio. These concessions, often justified as relief for essentials or incentives for growth, benefit entrenched interests and cost billions.
Income tax contributes 3.7% of GDP (Rs3.06 trillion in FY23), but only 2.74 million individuals — 1.3% of the population — file returns. Exemptions shrink the tax base, costing Rs1.2 trillion annually. Key SROs include:
SRO 1062(I)/2013: Exempts agricultural income. In FY23, agriculture contributed Rs36 billion, costing an estimated Rs1.2 trillion in forgone revenue at a 10% effective rate. This benefits large landowners, not small farmers. SRO 947(I)/2008: Grants exemptions to export-oriented industries, notably textiles, costing Rs150 billion annually.
SRO 1125(I)/2011: Reduces withholding tax rates for distributors and retailers, costing Rs80 billion annually. Retail tax evasion persists despite POS integration initiatives.
Sales tax, at 41% of FBR revenue, is undermined by exemptions. Key SROs include: SRO 190(I)/2002: Exempts foodstuffs, costing Rs200 billion annually. A 5% GST, as in India, could yield Rs100-150 billion.
SRO 837(I)/2021: Zero-rated pharmaceutical inputs and equipment, costing Rs50 billion. Over-invoicing abuses this.
SRO 563(I)/2022: Exempts plant and machinery, costing Rs120 billion. This favours large firms, while SMEs are taxed fully.
Exemptions cost Rs1.7 trillion annually. Agriculture's exemption has not boosted productivity, and food exemptions fail to curb price hikes. Withdrawing these could add Rs1 trillion, narrowing the fiscal deficit (6.7% of GDP in FY25).
To offset exemption losses, Pakistan relies on customs duties (17% of FBR revenue). High duties (20% average) distort the economy. Duties on raw materials raise production costs and reduce export competitiveness. High tariffs fuel smuggling, costing Rs300 billion annually in electronics and textiles.
Duties also inflate prices, contributing to inflation. For example, a 20% duty on hats was reduced to 5%, but selective relief creates inequities. Fast-growing economies use moderate tariffs and broad-based VATs to balance revenue and trade. Pakistan's reliance on customs is unsustainable.
Many tax experts defend exemptions and withholding taxes as necessary. These claims are flawed. Agricultural exemptions benefit large landowners, not small farmers. Food exemptions don't reduce prices. Withholding taxes inflate costs and reduce competitiveness. High duties disincentivise exports and fuel smuggling. FBR data shows direct taxes outperformed targets in H1 FY25, while indirect taxes missed, proving that broadening direct taxes is more effective.
To achieve a 15-20% tax-to-GDP ratio, Pakistan must implement bold reforms: Withdraw SROs – SRO 1062: Tax agricultural income above Rs600,000; SRO 190: Apply 5% GST on food; SROs 947 and 1125: End export and retail exemptions; SROs 837 and 563: Phase out pharmaceutical and machinery exemptions.
Reduce withholding taxes: Lower rates on salaried class and exports to 10-15%. Broaden the tax base: enforce Section 114B to penalise non-filers and expand the filer base; integrate all retailers into the POS system. Lower customs duties: Reduce tariffs to 10%, boosting trade. Digitalise and reform: Automate FBR processes and restructure it into an autonomous body.
Withdrawing SROs could generate Rs1 trillion. Tax base expansion could add Rs380 billion. Customs reform could add Rs100 billion. Combined with the current Rs6.15 trillion baseline, Pakistan could collect Rs7.63 trillion, raising the tax-to-GDP ratio to 14.5%. With sustained reform, it could reach 16-18% by 2030.
The current strategy – raising taxes on the salaried class while preserving exemptions – fuels inflation, emigration, and inequality. Instead, the government must shift from indirect taxes to direct taxes, eliminate discretionary SROs, and invest in digitalisation to streamline collection and reduce evasion.

Alcaraz begins French Open title defence,"US
Sinner launches campaign as Osaka faces Badosa in intriguing first round clash
The French Open first round continues on Monday at Roland Garros with defending champions Carlos Alcaraz and Iga Swiatek beginning their title defences, while world number one Jannik Sinner opens his quest for a fourth Grand Slam crown. Swiatek, who lifted the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen in 2020, 2022, 2023 and last year, has been far from her best in the clay swing and slipped out of the world's top three for the first time since March 2022 after falling short in Madrid and Rome. She faces Slovakian Rebecca Sramkova in her opening match.
In the pick of the first-round matches in the women's singles draw, four-times Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka will take on former world number two Paula Badosa.
Osaka has never made it past the third round in Paris but can take heart from her performance at the WTA 125 tournament in Saint-Malo, France, where she picked up her first title on clay.
The pair were supposed to meet in Rome but Badosa, a semi-finalist at this year's Australian Open, was forced to withdraw due to a back injury.
""I was really looking forward to it (meeting in Rome) because I know she's a good player,"" Osaka told reporters. ""It's kind of crazy that we have both been on tour but we haven't played each other yet. I know that she's supposed to be a good clay court player also.""
Zeppieri vs Alcaraz
Defending champion Alcaraz is the strong favourite in the men's singles after lifting trophies in both Monte Carlo and Rome.
The Spanish world number two was initially scheduled to face Kei Nishikori, but will instead play against 310th-ranked Giulio Zeppieri after the Japanese former world number four withdrew.
Alcaraz has crossed paths with Zeppieri once before, beating the Italian in three sets at the Croatia Open in 2022, and should have little trouble progressing to the second round.
Sinner looking to build fitness
Sinner is bidding to win a third Grand Slam tournament in a row when he begins his campaign against Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech, but his preparations have been hampered by a three-month doping ban. The Italian agreed a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency in February and began an immediate suspension, only returning to action at this month's Italian Open, where he reached the final and was beaten by Alcaraz.
Sinner said he was unsure how he would hold up to the physical demands of a Grand Slam, telling reporters: ""We are working hard, trying to reach the physical level I would like to, and how I would like to feel on court. ""Best-of-five is going to be a great test for me, trying to understand where I am. Let's see how my body will respond here.""
Zheng stretches winning run
Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen eased past 2021 finalist Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-4 6-3 in the French Open first round on Sunday to stretch her winning run on the Parisian clay to seven matches.
The Chinese has fond memories of the Philippe Chatrier court having won the women's singles gold medal on the same court at last year's Paris Games.
""I am happy to get this match against a great opponent,"" Zheng said. ""Always the first match in a tournament is not easy.""
French farewells
Two French favourites will begin their final campaigns at Roland Garros on Monday, with Richard Gasquet taking on compatriot Terence Atmane and Caroline Garcia facing American Bernarda Pera.
Former world number seven Gasquet will retire after the French Open, while Garcia, who reached a career-high singles ranking of fourth in 2018, on Friday confirmed she would also be calling time on her career.

Fishermen Cooperative Society still without elected board,"US
Six weeks have passed since the elections of the representative body of the fishermen in Karachi
More than six weeks have passed since the elections of the Fishermen Cooperative Society (FCS), yet the elected Board of Directors has not been constituted. As a result, administrative affairs continue to be managed by unelected officials.
The long-delayed elections, held on April 9 after a gap of five years, resulted in a sweeping victory for the Fishermen's Alliance Panel (Mahigeer Itehad Panel). However, despite the mandate, no official notification has been issued to formalise the new board.
Muhammad Yousuf, who was elected as a director on the victorious panel, told The Express Tribune that the last FCS elections were conducted on February 24, 2017.
""The next elections were due in March 2020, but the Sindh government-appointed administration repeatedly delayed the process using various pretexts,"" he said. ""The matter was eventually taken to court, and following the Sindh High Court's directive, elections were finally held on April 9.""
However, Yousuf added that the newly elected board remains in limbo due to the absence of a formal notification by the Sindh Cooperatives Department.
The delay comes as fishing operations at sea are suspended for two months — June and July — due to the annual fishing ban. This seasonal closure has reduced business activity at the Karachi Fish Harbour, fueling speculation among industry stakeholders that the Sindh Cooperatives Department may be intentionally prolonging administrative control during this dormant period.
Currently, Deputy Registrar Naveed Abbasi of the Sindh Cooperatives Department continues to oversee the FCS as its administrator. Under his administration, a fish market hall was recently leased to a private party, which reportedly carried out unauthorised construction on the premises.
The Karachi Fish Harbour Authority (KFHA) intervened, demolishing the illegally erected wall the same night. According to KFHA officials, the construction took place in a designated ""red zone"" area where any form of building is strictly prohibited. A similar attempt to encroach on the same site was previously reported in November 2024 but was also thwarted by harbor authorities.
Repeated attempts by The Express Tribune to contact Naveed Abbasi for comment, including phone calls and WhatsApp messages, went unanswered. Concerns are growing among the fishing community over the continued absence of an elected board and the opacity surrounding key administrative decisions. Many see it as a violation of democratic and cooperative principles within one of Karachi's most vital industries.

Pindi's water demand outpaces supply,"PL
Experts stress long-term strategies like conservation, regulation of tanker mafia and public awareness
With an expansion in population, groundwater depletion and migration of people to the garrison city, Rawalpindi faces water availability challenges and urgently requires a multi-faceted approach.
These approaches include expanding water storage capacity through dams and reservoirs, improving water distribution networks, promoting water conservation measures, and addressing issues like tanker mafia and infrastructure maintenance.
Recognising these challenges, the city's civic agencies have been taking measures for the construction of new dams like Chahan and Daducha dams, and side by side steps for maintaining the storage capacity of existing Rawal and Khanpur dams.
Managing Director (MD) of Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) Muhammad Saleem Ashraf says the Garrison City needs a total water supply of around 51 Million Gallons Daily (MGD) in winter, 30.5 MGD of which is through 480 tube-wells, 10 MGD from the Rawal Dam and 6 MGD from the Khanpur Dam.
The city has to face a shortfall of around 7 MGD in winter, which rises to around 19 MGD during summer, with the daily water demand reaching over 70 MGD, he added.
Both the cantonments (Rawalpindi and Chaklala) also receive some 12 MGD water from the Rawal Dam, the WASA MD said. For overcoming the water shortage, Saleem says work is already underway on the Developing Resilient Environment and Advancing Municipal Services (DREAMS-I) project, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The project's overall scope involved the treatment and transportation of 14.5 MGD water from Chahan Dam to Rawalpindi city, besides the improvement and replacement of the city's existing water supply system, he added.
Moreover, he said, the rehabilitation and upgradation of Rawal Lake filtration plants were also in process to supply an additional 5 MGD of water to the Garrison City. Similarly, he said, two new heavy pumps are being installed at the Khanpur Dam to increase water supply to 8 MGD. The project to provide a 24/7 water supply to three union councils of Khayaban-e-Sir Syed was also underway.""
This project (DREAMS) of public importance will be completed in two years instead of the stipulated period of three years,"" he added. The MD further said that work on the Chahan Dam treatment plant had been kicked off, which was expected to provide 10 MGD of water to Rawalpindi city.
He said the feasibility of setting up the Daducha Dam had been included in the Punjab Annual Development Plan, which would hopefully provide 30.5 MGD water to meet the future needs of the city.
As regards water losses, he said that water leakage and theft from the distribution network were major sources of water loss and needed to be addressed. He said the Punjab Government had banned the establishment of new car washing stations across the province. In compliance with the orders of the Lahore High Court (LHC), the Punjab Environmental Agency (EPA) had imposed a ban on non-essential use of underground water and violators, including car wash/service stations, would have to face heavy fines, he warned.
Chief Executive Officer of the Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) Syed Ali Rizvi says the RCB provides some 1.50 MGD water to its residents from 55 tube wells, 11.28 MGD from the Khanpur Dam and 0.03 MGD from the Rawal Dam. The RCB's distribution network includes eight overhead reservoirs and 34 underground tanks, he says and adds the Board provides clean drinking water to the people through 52 filtration plants.
MNA Malik Ibrar Ahmed says the construction of modern underground tanks having a capacity to store 1 MGD water has entered the final stage.
The project aims to provide a lasting solution to the longstanding water shortage in local communities of RCB areas, ensuring improved supply and overcoming the seasonal scarcity, especially during the summer months.
He says every year, with the onset of summer, the residents of Rawalpindi and Chaklala cantonments face severe water shortages due to the lack of storage facilities, but allocated funds are now being prioritised for the timely completion of the vital projects.
The construction of underground tanks at Bhata Chowk, with a storage capacity of 200,000 gallons per day, and Gawalmandi, with a capacity of 100,000 gallons per day, are rapidly progressing, the MNA adds. Additionally, he adds, projects are underway at Naseerabad, Barf Khana Chowk, Ghazi Abad, Afshan Colony, Tench Bhatta, Tahli Mohri, and Wards 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the Chaklala Cantonment, each designed to store 50,000 gallons daily.

Nine terrorists neutralised in K-P IBOs,"US
It said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain Indian sponsored terrorists.
Security forces killed nine India-backed terrorists in three separate operations in Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and Khyber districts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement on Sunday.
According to the ISPR, the media wing of the military, the Khwarij – a term used for the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan – were killed on the night between Saturday and Sunday. It said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain Indian sponsored terrorists.
""An intelligence based operation was conducted by the Security Forces in Dera Ismail Khan District, on reported presence of Indian sponsored khwarij. During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,"" the ISPR stated.
Another intelligence based operation was conducted in Tank District and in ensuing fire exchange, two more Indian-sponsored Khwarij were sent to hell by the security forces. In third encounter that took place in general area Bagh, Khyber district, own troops successfully neutralised three more Indian-sponsored khwarij,"" it added.
""Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the killed Indian-sponsored khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.""
According to the ISPR statement, sanitization operations were being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area. ""The security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian Sponsored Terrorism from the country,"" it added.
President Asif Zardari praised the security forces for their bravery in killing nine Indian-sponsored terrorists in three separate operations in K-P. He appreciated the security forces' successful operations to eliminate India-backed terrorists.
The president said that the security forces would continue to operate until the terrorists were completely eliminated. ""Our resolve to eliminate terrorist elements and defend the country remains unwavering,"" he said, reiterating the national resolve to completely eliminate ""Fitnat-ul-Khawarij"".

George Floyd's uncertain legacy marked in US,"US
.
Americans on Sunday marked five years since George Floyd was killed by a US police officer, as President Donald Trump backtracks on reforms designed to tackle racism.
Floyd's deadly arrest on May 25, 2020 helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement into a powerful force that sought to resolve America's deeply rooted racial issues, from police violence to systemic inequality.
But since Trump's return to power in January — he was serving his first term when Floyd died — his administration has axed civil rights investigations and cracked down on diversity hiring initiatives.
BLM, meanwhile, finds itself lacking the support it enjoyed when protesters sprawled across US cities and abroad during the Covid pandemic — with many now agreeing the movement achieved little of substance.
Some Democratic politicians, as well as UN rights chief Volker Turk, commemorated the anniversary on Sunday.
""As anti-racism, inclusion efforts & law enforcement reforms face serious setbacks, we must continue advocating for racial justice & equality globally -- with greater determination & strength,"" Turk wrote on X.
A memorial event was held this weekend at what has been named George Floyd Square, the area of Minneapolis where the 46-year-old took his final breath as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck during an arrest.
Dozens of people on Sunday visited the small junction set in a residential part of the northern US city, which is covered with protest art, including a purple mural that reads ""You Changed the World, George.""
That optimistic message painted in 2020 is now, however, at odds with a president whose more extreme allies have suggested he pardon Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering Floyd and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.
Some experts believe Trump's re-election was partly a backlash to BLM activism, which included protests that turned to riots in some cities and calls to defund the police.
Floyd's family members told AFP on Friday that they wanted people to continue pushing for reform despite the hostile political climate.
""We don't need an executive order to tell us that Black lives matter,"" said his aunt Angela Harrelson, who wore a dark T-shirt depicting Floyd's face.
""We cannot let a setback be a holdback for the great comeback. Donald Trump just didn't get the memo,"" she added to nods from other relatives standing beside her.
Paris Stevens, a Floyd cousin, agreed: ""No one can silence us anymore.""
Protests marking Floyd's death have also been planned in a handful of other US cities, including Chicago and Dallas, but no major rallies were expected.
In Minneapolis, some people cried and others laid flowers or stuffed animals by the roadside spot where Floyd's fatal arrest was filmed and shared around the world.
""George Floyd may be resting in peace and power, but he's alive through everyone that shows up here,"" WD Foster-Graham, an author who grew up in the same neighborhood, told AFP Sunday.
""It can be very easy to forget, but as one person to another, make sure we never forget and let those powers that be know we haven't forgotten, and we're not going away,"" the 73-year-old added.
Jamie Dencklau, 30, said it was important to show that Floyd's death was not just a ""moment in time.""
But the nonprofit worker from Minneapolis said she was upset about Trump, who has a track record of racially charged rhetoric and heavy support from far-right figures.
""It's disheartening to see that our country has elected this individual as our president, and it really makes me question how important equity and inclusivity are to our community,"" she said.
Memorial events have been held annually since Floyd's death and the theme for this one — ""The People Have Spoken"" — was suggested by Nelson Mandela's grandson Nkosi when he visited the square, according to Floyd's aunt Harrelson.
She said the defiant title was meant to reflect five years of protesting, adding that ""even though it's tiresome, we go on.""

Economics is all about incentives,"US
For prosperity, Global South needs pro-growth set of supply-side economic policies, not anti-growth IMF bailouts
Taxation and spending policies have a huge impact on any country. Until you see how a country treats its taxpayers, foreign producers and those who benefit directly from government spending, you can never assess the prospects of a country.
Besides taxation, tariffs and government spending explicitly, it equally applies to public companies, state-owned enterprises, highly regulated industries and other economic activities where government intervention is determinative – a movement towards state-controlled means of production.
IMF and World Bank reports about the Global South all have forecasts of GDP, inflation, trade, current accounts, budget deficits, etc, but not much details of government taxation, tariffs, non-tariff barriers or government spending.
Central to understanding taxation is incentives. There are two types of incentives in this world – negative incentives and positive incentives. Negative incentives tell people what not to do and positive incentives tell people what to do.
Taxation is a negative incentive. Like other negative incentives, it tells people what not to do: do not report taxable income. Taxation doesn't tell you how not to report taxable income. Potential taxpayers can evade, avoid or otherwise not report taxable income.
Government spending and subsidies, as opposed to taxation, is a positive incentive, telling people what to do. So, all you have to know to achieve economic prosperity and growth is to remember negative and positive incentives. Economics is all about incentives.
We are tax income earners, employers and profitable companies because the government needs revenues to function. But we must still remember the negative impact of a government's tax system.
No one can be oblivious to the fact that when the government taxes people who earn income, they will reduce the amount of income they earn and they especially will reduce the amount of income they report. When the government taxes people who employ other people, employers will reduce the number of people they employ. When government taxes companies that make a profit, these companies will try to reduce the amount of profit they make or report. Negative incentives accompany all tax systems.
A tax system's function should be solely to raise enough revenues in order for the government to perform its requisite tasks. While all taxes are bad, some taxes are worse than others. So, what you want your government to do is to collect taxes in the least damaging way possible, but still able to raise the requisite amount of revenues to function effectively. Efficiency in government spending is essential for economic prosperity.
Economics is, after all, about incentives. People don't work to pay taxes; they work to get what they can after taxes. People don't save to go bankrupt. People save to augment their wealth. Therefore, the after-tax return on saving is critical to how much people will save, just as the after-tax return on work is critical to the amount of work that will be done.
And finally, businesses don't locate their production facilities as a matter of social conscience; they locate their production facilities to make an after-tax return sufficient to incentivise their shareholders.
The optimal tax system is one where taxpayers recognise their obligation to pay taxes and believe the tax system is fair. Then people will pay taxes willingly. Taxpayers should be treated nicely. They are customers.
High and excessive tax rates are a disincentive to work, produce and to invest. The theory of incentives provides the basis for the concept of a flat-rate tax, which is so called because a tax applies equally to all sources of income and does not change as a result of a taxpayer's volume of income.
A low-rate, broad-based flat tax with no exemptions, no exclusions, no deductions, no credits is what we call tax expenditures (ie, positive incentives). If a programme is good enough to deserve a tax break, it's even better to receive the money transparently through a government check.
Free and unencumbered trade amongst the many nations of this world is truly a win-win situation for every single country. Each and every country has some things it makes more efficiently than other countries, and those other countries, in turn, make other things more efficiently than yet other countries. The economic gains from trade by all countries are called the Ricardian gains from trade and comparative advantage.
Tariffs are taxes on traded products. People work, produce and earn income in order to buy foreign products. If the government taxes foreign products, then it is effectively reducing the income workers receive from working. For any given income, workers who prefer foreign-made products will be able to buy less than prior to the tariff. Tariffs are just like other taxes. They are job killers and reduce output, income and employment.
Government spending and taxation are killing the Global South prosperity. You cannot tax an economy into prosperity. Countries need to have a limit on government spending and those limits should be reasonable. Government spending is taxation – government doesn't create resources, it redistributes resources.
Because decision-makers in the government spend other people's money, those decision-makers don't bear the consequences of the actions they take. In business, decision-makers do bear the consequences of their actions.
In summary, you need: a low-rate, broad-based flat tax, free trade and minimum regulations, spending restraint and then the government should get the heck out of the way and let the private sector go. The source of prosperity in every economy is its people, not its government.
Today the Global South is in the middle of a political and economic crisis. To attain prosperity, they need a common-sense approach to a pro-growth set of supply-side economic policies and not the anti-growth IMF bailout policies that have subjugated the Global South through loan addictions since the last century.

Pakistan to keep modernising its military: US report,"PK
Says Islamabad procures WMD applicable goods from foreign suppliers
Pakistan regards India as an existential threat and will continue to pursue its military modernization effort, including the development of battlefield nuclear weapons, to offset India's conventional military advantage, said 2025 Worldwide Threat Assessment.
The assessment was prepared by the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and presented to the US House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Intelligence and Special Operations based on information available as of May 11, 2025.
Following the April 22 militant attack in occupied Kashmir, India conducted missile strikes in Pakistan. The missile strikes provoked multiple rounds of missile, drone, and loitering munition attacks, and heavy artillery fire, by both militaries from May 7 to May 10, when both countries agreed to a full ceasefire.
The assessment said Pakistan is modernizing its nuclear arsenal and maintaining the security of its nuclear materials and nuclear command and control. ""Pakistan almost certainly procures WMD [Weapons of Mass Destruction] applicable goods from foreign suppliers and intermediaries,"" it claimed.
According to the assessment, Pakistan primarily is a recipient of China's economic and military largesse, and Pakistani forces conduct multiple combined military exercises every year with China's People's Liberation Army (PLA), including a new air exercise completed in November 2024.
""Foreign materials and technology supporting Pakistan's WMD programs are very likely acquired primarily from suppliers in China, and sometimes are transshipped through Hong Kong, Singapore, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.""
It stated that during the next year, the Pakistani military's top priorities are likely to remain cross-border skirmishes with regional neighbors, rising attacks by the TTP and Baloch militants, counterterrorism efforts, and nuclear modernization. It said despite Pakistan's daily operations during the past year, militants killed more than 2,500 people in Pakistan in 2024.
It also claimed that terrorist attacks targeting Chinese workers who support China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects have also emerged as a point of friction between the two countries as seven Chinese nationals were killed in Pakistan in 2024.
According to the assessment, Pakistan and Iran have taken steps, including high-level meetings, to de-escalate tensions after the two countries conducted unilateral airstrikes on each other's territory in January 2024 in response to cross-border terror attacks.
""In September 2024, Taliban and Pakistani border forces clashed near border posts, resulting in the death of eight Taliban fighters. In March 2025, Pakistan and Afghanistan exchanged air and artillery strikes on each other's territory, each citing alleged militant infrastructure as the targets,"" it said.
It stated that South Asia's security situation is shaped by various factors, including terrorism and longstanding mistrust among neighboring states, several of which are modernizing their militaries and nuclear capabilities.
""Terrorist activity in Afghanistan and Pakistan will challenge military and security forces, and ongoing tensions along India and China's Line of Actual Control border demarcation are capable of escalating quickly. Russia and China continue efforts to bring regional powers closer into their respective spheres of influence,"" it added.
The assessment said Indian Prime Minister Narenda Modi's defense priorities will probably focus on demonstrating global leadership, countering China, and enhancing New Delhi's military power.
""India views China as its primary adversary and Pakistan more an ancillary security problem to be managed, despite cross-border attacks in mid-May by both India's and Pakistan's militaries.""
It said to counter Chinese influence and boost its global leadership role, India is giving priority to advancing its bilateral defense partnerships in the Indian Ocean region through exercises, training, arms sales, and information sharing.
India also has increased trilateral engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and actively participates in multilateral fora such as the Quadrilateral, BRICS, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and ASEAN.
It said that China will continue to advance selected areas of partnership with Russia while avoiding actions such as overtly providing materiel or lethal military assistance to Russia that might elicit reputational or economic costs for Beijing.

"No, Hasan Raheem has not tied the knot just yet","US
Singer's viral groom look was teaser for new song
We knew it: the groom fit, the cryptic caption, the refusal to let anyone repost the pic, it had music video shenanigans written all over it. And now, in the most Hasan Raheem fashion possible, he's come clean: ""I'm still single,"" he posted on Instagram. Hearts mended. Playlists queued.
Back in April, the Joona heartthrob sent fans into a collective meltdown with an Instagram post showing him suited up like a groom, seated next to a woman in bridal wear. ""Kept it lowkey, it was a big day,"" Raheem wrote in the caption. Naturally, Gen-Z went into emotional cardiac arrest, because had Pakistan's crush really gone and soft-launched a wedding?
It turns out that the shoot was just a teaser for MEMORIES, the first track from his upcoming album DKP. The song dropped on Friday, and so did our jaws.
A groovy Punjabi-English crossover featuring the powerhouse Peechay Hutt royalty Justin Bibis, MEMORIES marks Raheem's first foray into Punjabi vocals. It's moody yet groovy, like crying in the middle of the dance floor while still serving looks. Shehryar Khan's production gives it that slick, urban beat we've come to expect from Raheem's genre-bending, bedroom-pop style.
And the video is pure, iconic chaos. Set at a wedding, Raheem (playing groom) is confronted mid-celebration by the ghosts of his ex-girlfriends. What follows is a dramatic, slow-mo showdown that quickly escalates into a stiletto-flinging brawl. The women unite against their shared heartbreak, and Raheem gets the on-screen thrashing of a lifetime. Blood, glitter, bruised egos — it's heartbreak with an RSVP. There's even a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment where someone hurls a cake. It's cinematic mischief at its finest.
Online reactions were predictably unhinged. ""I knew this was a prank,"" yelled one fan. ""Bro, you played with my heart,"" wept another. Actor Osman Khalid Butt took a jab at Raheem's trademark messy hair, commenting, ""I knew the news couldn't be real when I saw your unwashed hair."" Anoushey Ashraf simply declared, ""Good job!""
Long before the wedding-day chaos of MEMORIES, Raheem was winning hearts with his tender, unplugged performances. Back in February, he shared a stripped-down version of Obvious on Instagram, enchanting fans with his warm, soulful vocals and intimate lyricism. With DKP on the horizon, it's safe to say Raheem's just getting started.

Minister inaugurates Mohmand Dam Phase II,"PK
Water is our lifeline - no one will be allowed to steal it, says Wattoo
Federal Minister for Water Resources, Muhammad Moin Wattoo, has issued a stern warning against any attempts to disrupt Pakistan's water supply, calling such actions ""an act of war."" He emphasized that the government will not tolerate any infringement on the country's water rights.
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony of Mohmand Dam Phase-II, the minister underscored the critical role of water in Pakistan's survival and progress.
""No one has the right to take our water. Blocking it is equivalent to waging war against us,"" Wattoo stated firmly.
He referenced the Indus Waters Treaty, affirming that both Pakistan and India are legally bound to honor its terms.
""This is a binding agreement with full legal validity. Its suspension or violation will not be tolerated under any circumstances,"" he warned.
Progress on Mohmand Dam
Wattoo noted that construction of the Mohmand Dam is advancing rapidly and is projected to be completed by 2027 or 2028. However, he assured the public that the government is striving to complete it ahead of schedule.
He also praised the contributions of Chinese engineers working on the project.
""It is truly commendable that Chinese engineers are working day and night to ensure timely completion of this crucial infrastructure,"" he said.
Wattoo reiterated the government's commitment to allocating all available resources to ensure swift completion of the dam.
Economic and Environmental Impact
Once operational, the Mohmand Dam will generate 800 megawatts of clean, affordable hydropower and will bring thousands of acres of land under irrigation. It is expected to significantly improve the local economy by creating jobs and boosting agricultural productivity.
WAPDA Chairman Lt Gen (retd.) Sajjad Ghani was also present at the ceremony.
Located on the Swat River in the Mohmand District of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the Dam is poised to be the fifth-largest Concrete Face Rock-Filled Dam (CFRD) in the world, standing at 213 meters high. It will have a storage capacity of 1.29 million acre-feet, bringing 18,233 acres of new land in Mohmand and Charsadda districts under cultivation, while also supporting irrigation for another 160,000 acres of existing farmland.

Public health milestone,"US
.
According to a 2017 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, trachoma ranked as the fifth most common cause of blindness in Pakistan. The WHO identified the country as a priority target for its Global Elimination of Trachoma 2020 (GET2020) initiative, as the disease was endemic across four provinces of Pakistan and nearly 30,000 people were living with trichiasis – an advanced stage of trachoma.
After an almost two-decade-long fight against the disease, WHO officially recognised Pakistan as having eliminated trachoma as a public health concern in 2024. This milestone has now been acknowledged on an international platform, as Pakistan has been presented with an award for its successful elimination of the disease during the 78th World Health Assembly.
Pakistan's sustained efforts towards the successful elimination of trachoma reflect the government's unwavering dedication towards easing public healthcare concerns. Not only is this a remarkable achievement for the country's healthcare sector, but with trachoma reduced to levels that no longer pose significant risks to the population, Pakistan also joins the ranks of just 19 nations worldwide to have achieved this status.
Trachoma is an infectious disease of the eye spread by flies that breed in human faeces, fingers, hands, clothing or bedding. It spreads quite rapidly through contaminated objects and physical contact with infected persons. Therefore, it is more likely to spread in developing countries with overcrowded living conditions and poor sanitation.
The curtailment of trachoma ultimately means there have been improvements in public hygiene, sanitation systems and public health services. As part of WHO's global efforts to eliminate trachoma, Pakistan also implemented the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy, which integrates key elements of trachoma prevention and control.
This success underscores the country's broader commitment to strengthening healthcare systems and tackling preventable diseases through sustained interventions and global collaborations.

Scarred by explosives,"US
.
The human toll of explosive weapons in Pakistan is a harrowing testament to the indiscriminate brutality of modern warfare. A new report by Action on Armed Violence, a British NGO, says Pakistan ranks among the countries worst affected by civilian casualties from explosive violence.
It is also worth noting that only six countries have been ranked higher than Pakistan in 2024 by the AOAV report. They include Lebanon, Sudan, Myanmar and Syria (who are/were in the middle of civil wars) as well as Ukraine and Gaza (who are under an invasion). Pakistan is just one among these seven worst affected countries where there is no war or civil war. Also, all the explosive incidents in Pakistan involved 'soft' targets, meaning those in predominantly civilian areas.
The high number of attacks also illustrates not only the impact of criminal violence in general but also how the government is trying to downplay the extent of the situation in Balochistan. Experts also believe that rising tensions with India will also lead to an increase in explosive violence as the military's focus shifts to securing the eastern border, allowing space to the Taliban, BLA and the likes to up the ante.
Another concerning finding is that the vast majority of violent attacks were actually credited to the TTP. And the BLA terror group only undertook a handful of attacks. However, this is less surprising when we consider that the government clearly took its eye off the ball and failed to stop the Afghan Taliban and India from supporting the TTP and other terrorist groups.
Pakistani civilians will suffer for decades the consequences of violent policies crafted in New Delhi and Kabul. About 88% the casualties in March were due to improvised explosive devices, such as roadside bombs, which can be long-lasting if they are not detected and safely disarmed. This means that, much like landmines, civilians may continue to suffer the consequences of unexploded ordnance, even several years after the elimination of the terror groups that placed the bombs or helped plan the attacks.

PCB names interim coaching staff,"US
Three-match T20I series against BD will be played in Lahore
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday, announced the team management for the upcoming three-match home T20I series against Bangladesh, with assistant coach Azhar Mahmood being a notable absentee.
Mahmood was one of the frontrunners to become the new head coach of the Pakistan men's cricket team besides Mike Hesson, who eventually landed the role earlier this month for an undefined period.
Mahmood, in an interview earlier this month, had expressed his interest in taking up the role, stating that he would apply for the role.
""I'm definitely going to apply for the Pakistan team head coach role,"" Mahmood stated. Azhar Mahmood has previously held the role of bowling coach and remains a familiar figure in Pakistan's coaching setup.
Notably, following the conclusion of former pacer Aqib Javed's tenure as the interim head coach, the men's cricket team is once again set to embark on a new era under new coaches and support staff, led by Hesson.
Among considerable changes, the PCB also brought in former Australia pacer Ashley Noffke as the bowling coach, while former first-class cricketer Hanif Malik has been appointed as the batting coach.
Mohammad Masroor and Cliffe Deacon remained fielding coach and physio respectively, while Imranullah has been named the strength and conditioning. Naveed Akram Cheema, on the other hand, will serve as the team manager.
Bangladesh reach Lahore
The Bangladesh men's cricket team arrived in Pakistan in the wee hours of Sunday to play a three-match T20I series, scheduled to commence on May 28.
According to the details, a 10-member group of the Bangladesh cricket team reached Lahore in the first phase, including Hasan Mahmud, Tanvir Islam, Parvez Hossain Emon and Tanzim Hasan Sakib.
The remaining members of the Bangladesh will arrive on Monday. For the unversed, Bangladesh were originally scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on May 21 in two groups for a five-match T20I series, with the opening game planned for May 25 in Faisalabad.
However, due to logistical challenges and evolving security considerations, the tour has been shortened to a three-match series. The decision was finalised after a productive meeting between PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) officials, including BCB Chairman Nazmul Abedeen and President Farooq Ahmed.
Following constructive discussions, both boards agreed to proceed with the revised tour, setting aside earlier concerns.
As per the new schedule, all three T20Is will now be played at the Gaddafi Stadium here on May 28 and 30 and June 1, respectively.
Earlier, Bangladesh batter Soumya Sarkar has been ruled out of the three T20Is in Pakistan due to back injury.
Soumya missed the three T20Is against UAE in Sharjah, a series Bangladesh lost 2-1, and the team physio Bayjedul Islam Khan said he would need a couple of weeks to recover.
""Following medical evaluation, it has been determined that the injury requires an extended rehabilitation period of approximately 10 to 12 days,"" Bayjedul said. ""This effectively means that he will not be available for next week's three-match series in Pakistan.""
Squads
Pakistan: Salman Ali Agha (c), Shadab Khan (vc), Abrar Ahmed, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Hassan Nawaz, Hussain Talat, Khushdil Shah, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Mohammad Wasim Jnr, Muhammad Irfan Khan, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wicket-keeper) and Saim Ayub.
Bangladesh: Litton Das (c), Tanzid Hasan, Parvez Hossain, Mehidy Hasan Miraz, Najmul Hossain Shanto, Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Jaker Ali, Rishad Hossain, Mahedi Hasan (vice-capt), Tanvir Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Hasan Mahmud, Tanzim Hasan Sakib and Shoriful Islam.

Heatwave triggers skin ailments,"PK
Dermatologist warns of infections, rashes due to excessive sweating
An ongoing heatwave across South Punjab has triggered a sharp rise in skin ailments.
A skin specialist, Dr Waqas Arqam Malik, said that the heat and sweat were contributing to the spread of fungal infections, rashes, body odour issues, and acne flare-ups.
He added that blocked sweat pores provide a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi, especially in individuals with oily or sensitive skin.
Patients suffering from prickly heat, underarm infections, foot fungus, and rashes in body folds are visiting clinics in increasing numbers.
If left untreated, such conditions can lead to pigmentation and recurring skin inflammation, the doctor added.
He advised people to maintain personal hygiene by taking showers twice a day during intense sweating, using antifungal powders in skin folds, and avoiding heavy creams and makeup, which can block pores.
He recommended wearing light-coloured, loose-fitting cotton clothes, staying hydrated and changing sweat-soaked clothes regularly.
He also advised avoiding direct sunlight between 11am and 4pm and applying sunscreen before stepping outdoors.

"Beyond revenue: transforming FBR for trust, transparency","PK
Trust deficit, outdated systems and governance weaknesses preventing country from achieving desired tax-to-GDP ratio
Pakistan doesn't just need a better Federal Board of Revenue (FBR); it needs a new social contract on taxation. As long as the system treats taxpayers like suspects and protects evaders like VIPs, nothing will change.
The trust deficit between taxpayers and tax administrators, outdated systems, lack of institutional autonomy, governance weaknesses and poor enforcement are some of the core issues preventing the country from achieving its desired tax-to-GDP ratio and realising its true revenue potential.
Every business needs certainty to plan its short- and long-term goals, especially when it comes to tax policy. If tax policies are constantly shifting based on the government's immediate revenue needs, how can investors be expected to commit capital to Pakistan?
Setting aside issues like repatriation and foreign exchange, there is an urgent need for stable and predictable tax policies that encourage investment, reduce evasion and allow businesses to focus on creating value. This could be achieved by introducing a multi-year tax policy framework with minimal changes each year.
The formation of the Tax Policy Office (TPO) is a milestone in this direction, helping separate policy from administration. However, to be effective, the TPO must be made fully operational with appointments based on merit, not political considerations, something that has long plagued the FBR itself.
The FBR, as the country's tax administrator, must be transformed from a traditional bureaucracy into a performance-oriented organisation. The frequent turnover of FBR chairpersons, seven in the past five years, has made policy continuity impossible.
The chairman should have a fixed term of at least three years and appointments must be based on competence and merit, with clear accountability. Political appointments at any level should be avoided. Institutional autonomy must also be granted, with a governance board that includes top private-sector professionals.
The induction process at the FBR needs to be overhauled to ensure the right people are selected for the right roles. Recruitment must be transparent and promotions should be based strictly on performance against the measurable KPIs.
Too often, capable individuals are bypassed in favour of less competent teams. Continuous capacity building is essential, with training in modern taxation, digital tools and international best practices. In addition to revenue targets, taxpayer service quality must become a KPI for officers.
Training should also emphasise respectful and professional engagement with taxpayers, who are not criminals by default. Officers should avoid undue harassment, especially during quarter- or year-end drives, where threats like bank account attachment are used without due legal process. This is contrary to both the law and the principles of good governance.
Risk-based audit selection, clear audit guidelines and periodic third-party audits are essential to minimise misuse and ensure fairness. We should train our officers on how the IRS of USA, HMRC of the UK, CRA of Canada, etc initiates such proceedings and what practices they follow when they engage themselves with the taxpayers. Rotation policies must also be enforced to prevent collusion between officers and taxpayers.
With greater responsibility must come greater accountability. The FBR should publish annual transparency reports that include performance metrics, audit outcomes, disciplinary actions and top performers, similar to practices in other professional organisations.
This will build public trust and act as a deterrent against corruption. Whistleblowing should be encouraged by ensuring protection and even offering financial rewards for reporting misconduct or leakages.
The FBR cannot operate in isolation in the modern technological era. A tax ecosystem must be created through integration with departments such as the SECP, NADRA, banks, utility companies and property registrars. A centralised tax management system should allow for seamless digital processes, including registration, filing, payments, audits, appeals and even deregistration, with minimal human intervention.
AI and data analytics can be used to detect anomalies and identify potential taxpayers who are currently outside the net. While the FBR has made some digital progress, it still lags far behind global standards in automation, transparency and efficiency.
Equally important is the need to simplify the existing tax laws. They are currently overcomplicated and impose high compliance costs on honest taxpayers. Discretionary powers granted to officers for interpretation should be reviewed. Additionally, harmonisation between federal and provincial sales tax laws is critical to reducing confusion and improving compliance.
The FBR must also work on public awareness and taxpayer education through media campaigns, tax facilitation centres and educational outreach to promote voluntary compliance and shift its focus from enforcement to engagement.
In conclusion, a meaningful reform of the FBR is not just about increasing revenue, it's about restoring trust, improving governance and creating an equitable, predictable and efficient tax environment. Pakistan cannot progress by penalising the compliant and protecting the privileged.
A high-performing, autonomous and service-oriented FBR, supported by strong institutions and stable policies, can help build a fairer society and attract sustainable investment. The path forward requires courage, vision and, above all, a collective commitment to fairness and rule of law in taxation.

Arsenal win women's Champions League,"US
The Gunners upset the odds with a 1-0 victory over Barcelona in the final
Arsenal forward Alessia Russo wants the Gunners' stunning women's Champions League final triumph to be the springboard for further success.
The London club upset the odds with a 1-0 win over Barcelona in Lisbon on Saturday as they dethroned the Spanish side, who had won the trophy three times in the previous four seasons.
Arsenal are still the only English club to win the women's edition, having previously lifted the trophy as part of an historic quadruple in 2007.
Their latest continental triumph, sealed by Stina Blackstenius' 74th-minute goal, guarantees Arsenal a direct place in next season's Champions League league phase — along with Women's Super League champions Chelsea, who for all their domestic success have still to be crowned queens of European football — after they became the first team in history to reach the final from qualifying round one.
""I'm absolutely buzzing,"" said Russo. ""I can't really put it into words, it just feels bloody amazing. It feels surreal right now, but I just had so much belief going into this game. We all did.
""We didn't really want to say it too much, but we all kind of had this feeling. We knew we could and we just had to go and deliver.""
Victory means Arsenal will also represent Europe in the inaugural FIFA Women's Champions Cup next year, entering as automatic semi-finalists.
But Russo is adamant lifting the Champions League trophy should only be a first step on the road to further glory for manager Renee Slegers' team.
""I feel like that massively,"" said Russo. ""When you win things, you want to win things even more, and also you know you're good enough to do it.
""It was important to win for many reasons, but now we want to win more. We want to go back and start next year strong. We want to compete domestically more so than we did this year, and we want to be back winning this trophy again.""
Meanwhile Arsenal great Ian Wright said the women's side had ""saved"" the club this season following yet another trophyless campaign for the men's team.

Six people died in Switzerland over the weekend in accidents in the Alps, officials said Sunday.
Near the luxury resort of Zermatt, rescuers found the bodies of five people, police said in a statement.
A helicopter was sent to survey the area around the Rimpfischhorn mountain after climbers alerted authorities after spotting abandoned skis near the summit on Saturday.
""The bodies of five people were quickly found,"" Swiss police said in a statement.
Authorities have opened an investigation into the incident and were working to identify the victims, it said.
The Rimpfischhorn is a 4,199-metre (13,776-foot) mountain that lies east of Zermatt, near the Italian border, and is popular with backcountry skiers.
Further north, a 29-year-old alpinist was killed in an avalanche on the Morgenhorn in the Bern canton, police said.
Two other climbers caught in the avalanche were rescued and hospitalised with light injuries, police said.
Outdoor sports are a popular pastime in mountainous Switzerland and accidents are a regular feature of winter.

RDA scam sparks NAB probe,"LT
Sources say payments were made to fake companies through manipulated processes
An alleged embezzlement scandal involving Rs1.94 billion in the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has raised serious questions about negligence and misconduct by top officials over the past nine years.
According to sources, the scandal reportedly implicates former and current director generals and directors of administration and finance, all of whom had signatory authority over the RDA's financial affairs.
The matter has now been transferred to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) via the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment for further investigation.
According to sources, over the last nine years, payments amounting to nearly Rs1.94 billion were made from RDA's bank accounts to fictitious companies posing as registered vendors.
These transactions were conducted through Call Deposit Receipts (CDRs), with around 21 transactions linked to eight companies and thirteen individuals.
Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for financial dealings within the RDA were reportedly ignored, and the signatory authority granted to the director general and director admin & finance was misused.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities failed to monitor bank account activity or audit financial records held both in RDA offices and in the respective banks.
Following the revelation, NAB has started collecting relevant documents from the RDA and corresponding banks.
Letters have also been sent to the private banks involved, requesting transactional records.
This has created a troubling situation for all individuals who held the roles of director general or director admin & finance during the past nine yearswhether in service or retired.
Questions are being raised as to why they failed to oversee the issuance of CDRs, track their reference letters, and review how funds were funnelled to various companies and individuals.
According to sources, investigations aim to identify the public officials, fake companies, and individuals involved in the scam, with the ultimate goal of recovering the embezzled public funds.
Legal action is expected against those who received payments either as company representatives or in a personal capacity.
On the other hand, the RDA has prepared a proposed Annual Development Plan (ADP) for the fiscal year 2025-26. The plan, which awaits final approval from the Punjab government, includes major infrastructure initiatives under the ""Urban Development Package"" and ""City Development Package.""
The proposed projects consist of three underpasses, one flyover, a multi-storey parking plaza, and several road infrastructure schemes. Each development initiative has been recommended by the respective members of the national and provincial assemblies.

Uprooted businesses await monetary relief,"LT
Struggling financially since being relocated during the construction of the Metrobus and Orange Line
While mass transit projects are the need of the hour given the seasonal smog crisis plaguing the province, they are often a source of huge financial losses for thousands of local businessmen, who are suddenly left without a source of income.
For instance, Naeem Aamir, a businessman uprooted during the construction of the Metro Bus, revealed that he had inherited several shops alongside the Ferozepur Road.
However, even after the passage of several years, he was still struggling to receive the promised compensation. ""The monetary compensation given by the government is like salt in flour. Even today, we have to plead for our money and have almost become shuttlecocks between the development agency and the project,"" claimed Aamir.
Similarly, Riaz Ahmed, a small trader, who used to own a shop in Anarkali, was uprooted during the construction of the Orange Metro Train Station. ""I used to work as a used-cloth merchant and owned a small shop.
The government did not offer proper compensation for my loss. Money was only given for the land, while no relief was given for the damage to my business, which had to be shut down eventually. Even today, I am making rounds of various government offices to get some help,"" explained Ahmed.
As per information obtained by The Express Tribune, more than 22 underpasses, 17 flyovers, a ring road spanning more than 100 kilometers in length, a 28-kilometer Orange Line train and a 27-kilometer Metro Bus have been constructed in Lahore, the largest city of the province during the past two decades. While these projects have resulted in development work worth trillions of rupees, they have also caused financial hardship for hundreds of families.
According to Sohail Hanif Bhandara, an urban developer, the government has a reputation of giving stepmother treatment to the business community and residential areas during the construction of big development projects. ""Although big business entities are paid well, small businesses are often neglected.
Therefore, before starting any big development project, efforts should be made to bypass areas with small businesses or mini residential schemes on the route. This process will not only reduce the cost of the project but will also ensure that the common man is not affected,"" implored Bhandara.
On the other hand, Rai Nasir Jamil, a land acquisition collector, claimed that whenever the government acquired any land, it first evaluated the value of the land and then offered compensation to businesses as per the government's standard formula. ""The standard formula is that whenever a project affecting residential, urban and rural populations is announced, the cost of the project is calculated only after determining its parameters. Sometimes there are irregularities in the valuation. But this can be settled by the complainant later on,"" said Jamil.
As per the claims of the government, a special package was given to underprivileged families who had been living on the land of various government departments for more than 60 years and did not have ownership rights.
Families living in one room in a multi-storey building were given assistance of Rs1 million per household. Land compensation for residential houses located in Kapoorthala House, Kacha Lake Road and Edward Road was Rs.2.5 million per marla, while the compensation for commercial land was Rs3.5 million per marla. One hundred families were living in the Bengali Building while 58 families were living in the Maharaja Building.

Indus river crisis: a call to action for Pakistan,"PK
Rpidly growing population, rampant pollution is intensifying  climate change  by pushing Indus system towards crisis
The Indus River is far more than a waterway; it is the absolute heart of Pakistan, sustaining our nation, feeding our people, and powering our progress. For generations, it has been the source of life for hundreds of millions. Yet today, this vital lifeline faces a confluence of severe and escalating pressures.
A rapidly growing population, increasing demands from farms and factories, rampant pollution, and the intensifying reality of climate change are pushing the Indus system towards crisis.
These challenges are complex and interconnected, and pose existential threats to our public health, our food security, and even the stability of our region. To navigate this critical juncture, we require a clear, strategic vision and decisive action.
One of the most pressing concerns is the alarming deterioration of water quality.
As urban areas expand and industrial activity increases, a torrent of untreated sewage, agricultural runoff, and industrial waste flows directly into the river. This isn't merely an environmental issue; it's a profound public health emergency.
Contaminated water contributes tragically to high rates of infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, and is linked to tens of thousands of deaths — of children in particular — annually in major cities. The pollution also devastates the river's precious ecosystems, including critical coastal mangroves.
Adding to this burden, the Indus Basin is extraordinarily vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. We are witnessing an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events — devastating floods and prolonged droughts that disrupt natural river flows. These changing patterns, combined with human pressures, threaten the basic environmental health of the river system itself.
The catastrophic monsoon floods of 2010 and the more recent floods of 2022 served as stark reminders of our vulnerability, displacing millions and leaving vast populations without access to safe water.
Beneath the surface, we face the critical, often less visible, issues of groundwater depletion and increasing salinity. Excessive pumping for irrigation in freshwater zones is causing water tables to plummet, while in saline areas, a lack of adequate drainage leads to the accumulation of salts, rendering valuable agricultural land unproductive.
These issues are projected to worsen significantly without intervention, already causing immense agricultural losses measured in the tens of billions of Rupees annually.
Navigating these challenges is further complicated by governance complexities and political dynamics. Our existing water allocation frameworks, while foundational, lack the necessary flexibility to adapt to changing realities and haven't fully fostered the trust required for basin-wide consensus on essential new infrastructure.
Managing this vital resource effectively requires significantly enhanced strategic coordination between federal and provincial authorities, supported by both a shared national vision and sustained budget allocations.
The international dimension also remains significant, particularly the enduring, yet recently tested, Indus Waters Treaty with India.
While remarkably resilient through past conflicts, recent pressures underscore that even this vital agreement is not immune to political tensions, highlighting the critical need for continued dialogue and strategic engagement.
Given the scale and urgency of these challenges, a fragmented, piecemeal approach is insufficient. We need a comprehensive, integrated strategic vision that encompasses the entire Indus system. This vision must prioritise several key pillars:
Firstly, we must transform our governance and planning.
This requires a strategic shift towards managing surface and groundwater resources as a single, integrated system, demanding unprecedented coordination across all relevant government sectors. While fundamental changes to established accords are complex, we must explore innovative, flexible mechanisms for optimising water use across the basin. Crucially, this includes implementing prudent policies for groundwater management, limiting unsustainable extraction - a strategic necessity that could also be cost-effective in the long run.
Secondly, strategic investment in critical infrastructure and technology is paramount. Upgrading our aging canal systems is essential to dramatically reduce water losses, reclaim land affected by salinity, and free up water for more productive use.
Building new reservoirs is necessary to strategically increase storage capacity, providing a crucial buffer against droughts and shortages while also generating much-needed hydropower. Furthermore, widespread adoption of modern, water-saving irrigation technologies on farms is a vital investment in future efficiency.
Thirdly, we must strategically boost agricultural productivity. This means producing more food with less water by improving farming techniques, utilising improved crop varieties, and adopting technology. Increasing overall water productivity in agriculture is not merely an efficiency gain; it is a national food security imperative.
Finally, our strategic vision must be underpinned by enhanced research and data capabilities. We need to deepen our scientific understanding of the entire basin, particularly how climate change impacts snow and ice melt in the upper regions, which directly affects water flow downstream. Investing in advanced data collection, analysis, and modeling tools is necessary for strategically predicting future conditions and effectively evaluating different adaptation pathways.
Securing the future of the Indus River is not solely the mandate of government ministries; it requires the strategic awareness and active engagement of every citizen.
It means supporting integrated national policies, adopting responsible water-use practices in our homes and communities, and demanding accountability for pollution.
The challenges are daunting, but they are not insurmountable. By clearly recognising this crisis and uniting behind these strategic actions, we can protect and revitalise the Indus — the undeniable lifeline and heartbeat of our nation — for the prosperity and security of future generations.
The time for visionary planning and decisive action is now.

Billy Joel cancels concerts after brain disorder,"US
Doctors advised singer to refrain from performing
US singer-songwriter and pianist Billy Joel took to Instagram on Friday to announce that he is cancelling all his scheduled concerts after he was recently diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus, a brain disorder.
In line with his diagnosis, the 76-year-old singer added in his statement that he is undergoing physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing while he recovers, according to a statement on social media.
""I'm sincerely sorry to disappoint our audience, and thank you for understanding,"" Joel said.
The artist's condition was exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance, added the statement.
Citing the Cleveland Clinic, Reuters reported that the condition, which is more likely in people over the age of 65, occurs when fluid builds up inside the skull and presses on the brain. Its symptoms resemble those of dementia and can sometimes be reversible.
Joel, known for hits like Piano Man and Uptown Girl, ended his record-breaking monthly Madison Square Garden residency – which had begun in 2014 – last year. During his nine-year residency, the singer performed a total of 150 sold-out shows.
According to The Guardian, Joel's team stated that the 23-time Grammy winner was ""thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritising his health. He is grateful for the support from fans during this time and looks forward to the day when he can once again take the stage.""
The publication noted that Joel's cancelled dates include 17 stops in North America and the UK. However, whilst the artist may no longer be fit to perform, two-part documentary Billy Joel: And So It Goes will premiere at the Tribeca film festival next in New York next month.

"Fluffy, feral and fashionable","US
Labubus are the new accessory taking over internet
With their gnarled teeth, wild expressions, and cuddly bodies, Labubu dolls are an unlikely luxury accessory, but that's exactly what they've become. Originally created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung as part of his ""The Monsters"" series, Labubu first appeared in 2015. ""At that time, there were no game consoles or computers, so I had to draw dolls with a pen, so I had the idea of painting fairy tales since I was a child,"" Lung said in an interview with Hypebeast.
Inspired by Nordic folklore and his own vivid imagination, Lung's creations were brought to mass popularity after his 2019 collaboration with Chinese art toy giant Pop Mart. Since then, Labubu has exploded in cultural visibility, moving from niche toy collector feeds to mainstream fashion content on TikTok and Instagram, and even landing in the hands of celebrities like Rihanna and Blackpink's Lisa.
On social media, influencers and fashionistas have been clipping Labubu dolls to their Hermès Birkins, Chanel crossbodies, and Dior totes, turning these bug-eyed monsters into the latest symbols of ""Big Into Energy"" style. As fashion writer India Roby puts it in Who What Wear, Labubu charms have become the ultimate flex: a mix of luxury and levity that doesn't take itself too seriously. It appears that the absurdity of pairing a thousand-dollar monster toy with a USD20,000 handbag is exactly the point.
This movement is part of the broader ""kidult"" trend, where adults embrace objects from childhood for comfort, whimsy, and, let's face it, content. Labubu's appeal also hinges on Pop Mart's signature ""blind box"" model: you don't know which design you're getting until you open it. This gamification, combined with limited editions and seasonal drops, fuels a massive resale market, where rare Labubu dolls can fetch over USD1,000, as reported by The Guardian.
Content creators have amplified this trend further. TikToker Suki Crafts, who customises Labubu dolls into full fashion looks, has over 1.2 million likes on her videos. On Instagram, the account Labubu Deluxe curates daily images of Labubu styled in designer outfits, often with satirical or ironic captions. ""It's fashion, it's feral, it's fabulous,"" reads one viral post. Users flood the comments with ""need,"" ""iconic,"" and ""capitalism won.""
Taking the world by storm
According to Pop Mart's official quarterly sales data, Labubu was the top-performing character IP in Q1 2024, with sales accounting for over 22 per cent of total brand revenue. The company reported that demand for Labubu series figures increased by 187 per cent year-on-year. To meet growing global demand, Pop Mart announced in March 2024 that it would expand its manufacturing capacity, with a new production facility planned in Chengdu.
Internationally, Pop Mart has also been scaling up its retail presence. New stores dedicated to Labubu and other collectibles have opened in Tokyo's Harajuku district, Seoul's Hongdae, and New York's Times Square. In April 2024, Pop Mart launched a limited-time Labubu pop-up café in Shanghai, serving themed desserts, drinks, and exclusive merchandise. The café attracted over 10,000 visitors in its first week, according to China Daily.
Pop Mart's online flagship store on Tmall hosted a Labubu-themed livestream sale on May 3, 2024, which drew over 2.3 million viewers and generated more than USD3.5 million in sales in under two hours. New product lines included crossover collaborations with fashion designer Angel Chen and tech accessories brand CASETiFY.
In addition, Pop Mart has started rolling out Labubu-themed vending machines, called Robo Shops, across Southeast Asia. Locations in Singapore's Orchard Road and Kuala Lumpur's Pavilion Mall have seen long queues, especially during weekend restocks. The machines dispense both standard and exclusive blind box editions.
It's this perfect collision of chaos and curation that explains why Labubu has stuck. In an age where luxury is less about old money polish and more about niche internet aesthetics, Labubu dolls hit the sweet spot between collectible culture, personal expression, and emotional nostalgia.

Afghanistan cracks down on elements targeting Pakistan,"PK
Islamabad feels change in Kabul's attitude
The interim Afghan government has taken a series of steps, including for the first time cracking down on elements that encouraged Afghan nationals to launch cross-border terrorist attacks – a significant development that has led to deeper engagement between Islamabad and Kabul.
While much of the public focus over the past month remained on tensions between Pakistan and India, Islamabad and Kabul quietly worked to reset their troubled relationship during the same period.
At the heart of the strained ties is the presence of the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other groups posing a threat to Pakistan.
For long, Pakistan failed to convince the Afghan Taliban to take decisive steps against terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil.
However, for the first time, Pakistan observed a change in Kabul's approach when a Pakistani delegation, led by Special Envoy on Afghanistan Ambassador Muhammad Sadiq Khan, visited the Afghan capital in the third week of March and was briefed about steps Kabul had taken to stop cross-border terrorist attacks.
A source privy to the closed-door discussions told The Express Tribune that for the first time since the Taliban took over in August 2021, Pakistan felt the interim government was serious about addressing its concerns.
The source said the Pakistani delegation, which included military and intelligence officials, was convinced that this time the Taliban side meant business.
Details were not revealed at the time, but sources have now confirmed that the Afghan Taliban began a crackdown on their nationals who had either joined the TTP or were planning to be part of the group.
Sources said many Afghans, particularly those recruiting fellow nationals for the TTP, were jailed and proceeded against.
In recent months, Afghan nationals were increasingly found involved in the TTP-sponsored terrorist attacks in Pakistan, something that rang alarm bells in Islamabad.
Pakistan strongly protested and provided evidence to the Taliban government about the involvement of Afghan nationals in terror attacks. Sources said finally the Afghan Taliban swung into action, which not only led to a significant drop in suicide attacks in K-P but also helped improve ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
All those developments paved the way for Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar to undertake a visit to Kabul on 19 April. This was the first visit by any Pakistani foreign minister to the Afghan capital in three years.
Both sides during the visit had agreed on a number of steps, including a fresh Kabul assurance not to allow Afghan soil to be used against Pakistan. In return, Pakistan removed certain restrictions on Afghan trade, including doing away with the condition of bank guarantees for Afghan importers.
The Taliban government won Pakistan's confidence after it apprehended certain Afghan nationals who facilitated over 70 terrorists, mostly Afghan, trying to infiltrate into Pakistan soon after the Pahalgam attack.
However, Pakistan's timely action neutralised all of them at the border near North Waziristan in the biggest encounter with terrorists in a single day since Pakistan's war on terror after the 9/11 attacks.
However, sources said Pakistan believes that the Afghan Taliban needed to take irreversible steps. ""It is a positive start. We hope they (Taliban government) will continue on this path,"" said an official while requesting anonymity.
It is believed that China, from behind the scenes, nudged both sides to stay engaged and resolve issues through dialogue.
On May 21, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi hosted a previously unscheduled meeting of Pakistan and Afghanistan Foreign Ministers in Beijing.
After the informal trilateral meeting, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that Pakistan and Afghanistan expressed their willingness to upgrade their ties and, in principle, agreed to exchange ambassadors.
A Pakistani official confirmed the decision and said the process would take some time since certain formalities needed to be fulfilled.
The official defended Pakistan's move, saying many regional countries were contemplating upgrading ties with the Taliban government.
China was the first country to send a full-time ambassador to Kabul and accept a full-time Taliban envoy in Beijing.
It is believed that Russia and Turkey are also considering appointing full-time ambassadors in Kabul.
The official said that despite many reservations, Pakistan had few options but to pursue a more pragmatic approach.
The recent military escalation with India is also believed to have played a role in shaping Pakistan's policy towards Afghanistan.
Given that tension with India is not going to ease anytime soon, Pakistan wants to ensure that there is no trouble at the western border.
India is also trying to reach out to the Afghan Taliban, who were once seen as Pakistan's proxy in New Delhi. Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar spoke to his Afghan counterpart recently, departing from New Delhi's over two-decade-long policy of not engaging with the Taliban.
Observers believe that the recent Beijing trilateral meeting was China's message to India. At the same time, Beijing conveyed to the Taliban government that Afghanistan's interests were better served if they aligned themselves with China and Pakistan.

Why the odds will ever be in 'The Hunger Games' favour
My first and only vacation abroad with my parents was special, and I was determined to round off the memorable trip by getting matching souvenirs for my friends back home. Little Me knew it had to be something related to the books the five of us had read, given that this was a time when Young Adult (YA) fiction was all anyone talked about.
Only problem was, I wasn't big on Harry Potter like the rest of them. That's how I ended up purchasing four Deathly Hallows necklaces and a single Mockingjay one. Because, hey, we've all got to live up to the main-character dream at some point in our lives (no offence to the school buddies reading this; the gifts were still just as heartfelt). The Mockingjay pendant proved to be a worthwhile investment because next year, over a decade later, it accompanies me to the theatre for The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping.
Expectations for the Haymitch Abernathy prequel have risen to an all-time high, and one can credit the cast announcements for that. It's not everyday that you see the cast for a film adaptation meet the fans' standards. But between book-accurate features and striking resemblances, Sunrise on the Reaping continues to impress. It's as if we can watch the film unfold while it's still in production. I mean, Kieran Culkin taking over Stanley Tucci's legacy? Name a better pick.
Of course, there are always exceptions, but this isn't the first time The Hunger Games franchise has hit the mark with its cast. The previous batch belonged to the President Snow prequel, The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which stunned audiences by bringing Tom Blyth onboard as Donald Sutherland's young counterpart among other top-tier casting choices.
And while the crews for each feature deserve every bit of the praise they rack up, it's hard to imagine a world where The Hunger Games films would be able generate this much fanfare without the enduring glory of the books.
Dystopian yardstick
The original Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins became a worldwide sensation during the 2010s, leading the way for YA dystopian novels that tailed the genre's success.
The most prominent example that comes to mind is Divergent and its subsequent novels, which set up a world divided into five factions - like the 12 districts from The Hunger Games. In similar fashion as the latter, Divergent, too, has a young female protagonist, Tris, who finds herself in the centre of a budding revolution.
The amount of similarities might have you squinting to find the differences between the universes, and that's true not just for Divergent but for the many novel series published after The Hunger Games.
This is not an attempt to incite plagiarism debates, but to understand Collins' cultural impact and the formula it inspired. A teenage huntress entangled in an uprising much larger than her unsophisticated existence (and possibly, simultaneously a love triangle) because she is the chosen one destined to lead the people. How many stories come to mind?
Except, the thing about Katniss Everdeen is that she's neither the ideal pick for the 'chosen one' archetype, nor is she qualified to lead anyone. Katniss is not a warrior but an underprivileged girl who is forced to match pace with her circumstances. She earns no medals because nobody wins in a war. Because even if you make it out of the arena alive, the Games never truly leave you.
What Katniss represents
Katniss is not, as the kids say, a girlboss. That's what drew Little Me and like-minded readers to her more than traditional heroes. She never sets out to be one. She doesn't aspire for greatness. She just wants to be left alone, safe and sound. But grief propels her actions, leading her to spark a blood-soaked revolution. She is a symbol by condition, not by choice.
In a meta extension, the Girl on Fire also unintentionally shaped what readers now seek in female protagonists, just as in the books she's reluctantly coaxed into becoming the Mockingjay despite being just a kid reacting to life-or-death stakes.
Even after all these years, as critics pick apart other franchises for relying on ambience over coherent plots, Katniss's flame still burns.
Thanks to the position she's assigned in the story, she becomes a gateway for a deeper exploration of characters she inspired, even those she came in conflict with, allowing the author to effectively revisit the gruesome world of death trials.
Coriolanus Snow's side of the story would not have seen the light of day, a decade after Mockingjay, were it not for the impact his nemesis had on the world. Here, too, Katniss went unknowingly meta by sparking a revolution of sorts, one motivated entirely by grief and no larger purpose.
The impact of many other protagonists, who tried to emulate Katniss' charm, didn't land because this archer didn't set out to be charming. Or a standout. Because the real world is home to many Katniss Everdeens.
Real-world implications
Maturing with The Hunger Games is effective in making one realise that the dystopia we read about isn't situated too far into the future - that is, if it's not already here. In a world infused with humanitarian issues, growing up upset at endless conflict is still a privileged position to be in compared to what someone else your age might be going through.
The world raises Katniss Everdeens, individuals who are morally compelled to take a stand if they desire safety, but it also has Coriolanus Snows, opportunists who have seen hardship only to chain it down with an unrelenting power-grab.
The world also births Haymitch Abernathys, who pay a lifelong price for stepping out of line in hopes of putting an end to prejudice. While at the same time, it nurtures politically distant yet somehow well-meaning souls like Effie Trinket, who rectify their ways the older they get.
That's why The Hunger Games has secured a mural in literary history. Because it's not merely a cautionary tale, but a community-focused narrative; not a story of one, but a story of many — prisoners of war, martyrs, dead-weight expendables, and people who are tragically buried in statistics.
It is a story of people who fight the good fight versus people who don't. People who exploit their odds to reign on top versus people who don't. It's a cycle of heroes, villains, and everyone caught in between. It's a tale of unceasing collateral damage.
And just as the arena of the Games doesn't let you escape once you're inside, The Hunger Games has seeped into every crevice of culture and conflict to the point that it has become difficult to ignore. And it will stay relevant as long as the flames of resistance burn, as long as the odds are ever in favour of change.

"Lead fight against polio, CM asks elected representatives","US
Says eradication of the crippling disease moral duty, national emergency
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has made a strong and urgent appeal to all elected representatives - including members of the national assembly, provincial assembly, and local government bodies - to take full ownership of the anti-polio campaign and lead efforts to protect future generations from the crippling yet preventable disease.
In a detailed letter addressed to lawmakers on both treasury and opposition benches, the chief minister emphasized the critical need for unified and accelerated action ahead of the National Anti-Polio Day scheduled for May 26, 2025.
""Polio eradication is not merely a health issue - it is a moral responsibility. The future of our children and the well-being of generations to come depend on our ability to eliminate this deadly virus once and for all,"" the letter stated.
Shah pointed out that Pakistan remains one of only two countries in the world where wild poliovirus still exists. Alarmingly, 74 cases of wild poliovirus were reported nationwide in 2024 - a significant surge compared to previous years. A large number of these cases were reported from Sindh, particularly Karachi and the northern districts.
While vaccination campaigns continue, several persistent challenges remain. Many children are still being missed due to parental refusal, lack of access to remote or neglected areas, and unregistered births.
The chief minister urged elected representatives to lead public engagement campaigns, raise awareness, and support comprehensive health initiatives to overcome these barriers.
Key measures proposed by CM Murad include, ensuring complete and accurate registration of all births, strict enforcement of routine immunisation at all levels, and tackling parental refusal through community engagement and education. Moreover, he also suggested, deploying mobile vaccination teams and local volunteers to reach underserved children and achieving 100% vaccination coverage in every round of the anti-polio drive.
The letter also referenced the upcoming Sub-National Immunization Day in July, stressing the need for sustained vigilance and commitment in the ongoing battle against polio.
""This is a time for leadership and unity,"" Murad Ali Shah concluded. ""Let us come together to make history by completely eradicating polio from Pakistan.""
Push against plastic
CM Murad Ali Shah, on the occasion of International Plastic Free Day, emphasised that plastic pollution poses a serious threat to our environment, rivers, marine life, and urban infrastructure.
The CM called for the elimination of plastic as a collective responsibility and urged the public to cease using plastic for a better urban environment.
Shah asserted that a plastic-free environment guarantees a better future. He highlighted that the Sindh government has undertaken several measures to combat plastic pollution.
Murad informed that since August 2024, the use of plastic bottles has been banned in all government offices, and glass jugs have been mandated to replace plastic bottles. Moreover, in April 2025, the Sindh government imposed a complete ban on the manufacturing, sale, and use of plastic bags.
CM appealed to the public to opt for environmentally friendly alternatives such as cloth and paper products instead of plastic to make Sindh a cleaner and greener region. The Chief Minister stressed that these steps are not only essential for protecting the environment but also ensure a healthier and better life for future generations.
