Crisis to cannonade,"US
.
As Israel and Iran trade fire to the extent of annihilation, Pakistan has come up with a categorical stance on the evolving warfare in the region. The National Security Committee, highest civil-military combine, yesterday reaffirmed Tehran's right to self-defence, and called for immediate cessation of hostilities. The emergent session under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Israel's acts of aggression, and feared that it could lead to catastrophic results. The committee was reportedly debriefed by the Army Chief Gen Asim Munir on the details of his meeting with President Donald Trump last week at the White House, as the session called for dialogue and diplomacy to tackle the situation in the Middle East.
Islamabad has taken a leap forward in defusing the crisis as it joined Russia and China in tabling a draft resolution at the UN Security Council demanding ceasefire and protection of civilians. The bombing of Iranian nuclear facilities by the US has circumvented all prospects of a negotiated solution, as Iran has vowed to avenge it in days to come by broadening the scope of retaliation. This is where some critical diplomacy and abject positioning is desired, and Pakistan is on the mark, sticking to a principled approach of non-violation of any state's territorial integrity. The crisis at hand, especially the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, is a clear breach of International Law – an aspect castigated by the IAEA itself.
Panic in the Straits of Hormuz, nonetheless, tipped the conflagration to new heights as commercial vessels were seen flagging for peace. This nervousness, coupled with exigency statements – German Chancellor Friedrich Merz insisting that there was ""no reason to criticize"" the US for striking Iran, and NATO chief Mark Rutte stressing that Tehran should not be allowed to have a nuclear bomb – are unreasonable stunts. The alignment on the other side of the divide, however, is marshalling as Russian President Vladimir Putin threw his weight behind Iran as he met Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Moscow. This evolution from crisis to conflagration demands astute diplomacy and not a cannonade.

"War indispensable if India violates IWT, says Bilawal","IN
PPP chief condemns US-Israel strikes on Iran; announces his party's support for budget
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari asserted in the National Assembly on Monday that Pakistan had secured military, diplomatic and narrative dominance over India in the recent war, warning that Pakistan would be forced to go to war again if India attempts to block the country's water in violation of the Indus Water Treaty.
The PPP chairman also vehemently condemned the Israeli and US strikes on Iran, calling the attacks illegal and dangerous.
The former foreign minister, who has returned after presenting Pakistan's stance before the world on the recent victory against India in a four-day war, said Iran's sovereignty was violated under false pretexts, with military leaders, scientists and innocent civilians targeted in their homes and nuclear facilities attacked in breach of international law.
""Any attack on nuclear facilities is not just a potential attack on Iran, if there is any leakage, it would have consequences for all neighbouring countries in the region, including Pakistan,"" the PPP leader said.
Since October 2023, he said, the world is seeing Israel's genocidal, apartheid-imposing expansionist regime conducting ever-expanding war, which has the potential to drag us all into World War III.
He maintained that the US conducted a more expansive attack on Iran's nuclear sites, and the Israeli government is forcing the US public into a war that the people do not support. Chairman PPP said that after decades of pushing the same lie that Iran was days away from developing nuclear weapons, a claim that the Israeli prime minister made in 1996, 2001, 2003, 2007, 2010, 2012, 2023, 2024 and in 2025.
At last, he said, Israel's regime attacked Iran under the pretext of this lie. ""We condemn the attack on Iran,"" he said, ""Iran's sovereignty was violated in violation of international law."" He said that this was done through the same lie that was peddled before the American public before the Iraq war in 2003.
During his address in the National Assembly, PPP chairman said that Chief of Army Staff Field Marshall Asim Munir was invited for lunch by President Trump at the White House. ""Is a defeated army ever extended such an invitation?"" he questioned before saying the answer is no.
""This was a congratulatory lunch to the head of the military that defied the entire world's expectations, by defeating a country seven times larger in size and significantly bigger economically,"" Bilawal said, ""President Trump's remarks on the meeting are a testimony of this.
Turning to Indian aggression, Bilawal cautioned that Pakistan's red lines had been crossed. He said that India said that the Indus Water Treaty was no longer to be followed after the Pahalgam attacks, saying they are holding the treaty in abeyance.
This is illegal, he said, because the treaty even today is binding on India and Pakistan.
However, the mere threat of stopping the flow of water to Pakistan is a violation of the UN Charter and is illegal, he said, saying India cannot do this.
""If India decides to implement this threat, we would have to fight another war,"" he warned, saying PM Shehbaz Sharif and the NSC have already stated that if the flow of water is stopped, then we would have to fight.
Reflecting on Pakistan's response to Indian aggression, Bilawal credited the PM Shehbaz Sharif-led government for resisting pressure and responding with force, in contrast to the alleged ""helplessness"" shown by ex-PM Imran Khan's administration in 2019.
""This time, when Kashmir was attacked, and Pakistan was attacked, we did not bow or succumb to fear; we fought a war and won,"" he said, noting the downing of six Indian jets and a diplomatic shift that revived international recognition of Kashmir as a disputed issue.
He also warned that India's attempts to use terrorism and water as tools of aggression would be countered forcefully.

Quality assurance panels to monitor projects,"US
This board will investigate complaints of corruption and misconduct within the department
The Punjab Housing, Urban Development and Public Health Engineering Department has established Quality Assurance Committees in all key subordinate agencies and development authorities across the province.
Official sources confirmed that these committees will operate within Water and Sanitation Agencies (WASAs), Parks and Horticulture Authorities, and Development Authorities.
Their primary mandate is to monitor project execution, verify adherence to technical standards, and provide consistent feedback to improve ongoing and future development schemes.
Each committee will include departmental engineers, quality control officers, and administrative staff to ensure a comprehensive review of project implementation.
Reports from these committees will be regularly submitted to the Housing Department's central monitoring cell for oversight and any required corrective actions.
This quality control initiative follows the earlier creation of a high-level Search Committee tasked with ensuring merit-based recruitment of top positions, such as Directors General, Managing Directors, and Chief Engineers.
Chaired by Housing Minister Bilal Yasin, the committee evaluates service records and seniority to ensure that appointments reflect capability and integrity.
Additionally, the department has established an Internal Accountability Board, operating under the Punjab Employees Efficiency, Discipline and Accountability (PEEDA) Act.
This board will investigate complaints of corruption and misconduct within the department and its subsidiaries, enforces internal discipline, audits compliance, and advises on policy reforms.
Commenting on the department's multi-layered reforms, Housing Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal said: ""The Quality Assurance Committees are another critical step toward institutionalising excellence in public service. When combined with the Search Committee and Internal Accountability Board, we are creating a governance model rooted in merit, integrity, and public trust.""
He stressed the importance of responsible use of public funds, noting that billions of rupees are invested annually in housing and sanitation projects.

"Turkiye looks for jointventures in IT, tourism","US
The ambassador said that many leading companies of Turkiye were already operating in Pakistan
Turkiye Consul General Durmus Bastug on Monday visited the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) to explore ways to expand trade and investment cooperation with Pakistan.
Key areas that came up for discussion were technology, tourism and agriculture along with regular exchange of business delegations.
The ambassador said that many leading companies of Turkiye were already operating in Pakistan, which reflected the confidence of Turkish investors in the South Asian country's market. He stressed the importance of strengthening business-to-business ties and shared Ankara's interest in initiating more joint ventures with Pakistani firms.
Speaking on the occasion, LCCI Vice President Shahid Nazir Chaudhry highlighted Turkiye's consistent support for Pakistan on key international matters. While acknowledging the strong relationship, he pointed out that the current volume of bilateral trade was modest.
Pakistan's exports to Turkiye during fiscal year 2023-24 amounted to $337 million while imports stood at $491 million, bringing the total trade volume to around $828 million.
He stressed the need for greater efforts to unlock the untapped trade potential and fully utilise the Trade in Goods Agreement, which came into effect in May 2023. He expressed optimism that with mutual collaboration, the trade volume could be increased to at least $5 billion in the coming years.

Japanese sunscreens go global as influencers drive skincare boom,"US
Light-weight, effective SPF solutions lead race
When YouTuber Hannah Price set out to compare Japanese and Australian sunscreen, she was not expecting her deep dive into the subject to rack up over two million views.
The huge number of people poring over Ms Price's video shows the growing interest in skincare products from Japan, much like the K-beauty phenomenon from South Korea.
It includes sun protection, increasingly recognised as a daily essential by influencers who want to shield their skin from ageing and enthuse about the lightweight texture of Japanese brands.
Companies that have perfected their secret formulas want to capitalise on booming demand, including by building factories overseas and selling to Japan's record influx of foreign tourists.
Ms Price, 32, fell into a ""year-long rabbit hole"" while making her video, learning about everything from SPF science to cultural attitudes to sun exposure.
""I always loved Japanese sunscreen since I first moved to Japan in 2012,"" she told AFP at her studio in Tokyo. ""I remember trying it for the first time and thinking, 'this is so much better than anything I tried in Australia',"" her home country where sun cream felt ""thick, sticky, greasy"".
""I thought that the video would be popular... but I wasn't expecting it to reach as far"" as it did, Ms Price said.
The habit of regular sunscreen use is spreading, especially among younger generations, said Mr Takuya Wada, who works in marketing for Japanese chemical and cosmetics firm Kao.
""There are no borders when it comes to obtaining information on social media, especially Instagram and TikTok,"" he said, adding that influencer posts have a ""very large"" impact on global sunscreen sales.
Beautifully white
The global skincare market was worth more than US$115 billion (S$148 billion) in 2024 and is expected to grow to US$194 billion by 2032, according to Fortune Business Insights.
A boom in celebrity skincare brands has contributed to the industry's growth – with A-listers like Kylie Jenner using social media to share their beauty routines, including sun protection, with hundreds of millions of followers.
When it comes to sunscreen, country-specific regulations mean no single company dominates the field, as the entry barriers to new markets are higher.
Kao's main sunscreen brand Biore UV is ranked 10th worldwide for sales, and second in Asia – competing with the likes of L'Oreal and Beiersdorf, and Japanese rivals such as Shiseido.
The company wants sales from sun protection to reach 35 billion yen (S$308 million) in 2027, up 1.6 times from 2023. It plans to boost overseas production by opening three new sunscreen factories, in Indonesia, Brazil and Germany.
It is technically difficult to develop formulas that block the rays effectively with a smooth texture, as demanded by Japanese consumers, said Mr Takashi Fukui, research and development director for Kao skincare products.
But using scientific know-how to strike this tricky balance is what makes Kao ""different from other European or American makers"".
In Japan, a cultural obsession with light skin dates back to the sixth century and using white powder imported from China later became a status symbol among nobility. Fair skin indicated a life away from outdoor labour and sun exposure, and an old Japanese proverb says ""white skin covers the seven flaws"".
In the 1990s, people began using sunscreen or other cosmetics to avoid tanning – a trend dubbed ""bihaku"" or beautifully white.
These days, Japanese women use sunscreen as everyday protection against sunspots and ageing, caused when UV rays penetrate into the skin, said Mr Fukui.
Tans have long been fashionable in Western countries, but awareness of skin cancer risks is rising, making sunscreen an important healthcare product there, Mr Fukui said.
One fan of Japanese brands is Thai skincare influencer Suari Tasanakulpan, who calls them ""lightweight"" compared to ""heavy and uncomfortable"" Western offerings.
""There are always new technologies and innovative textures that are often ahead of other countries,"" the 40-year-old, who reviews sunscreens on YouTube, told AFP. afp

Guardiola wanted more goals against Al-Ain,"LT
Man City smashed six goals against the Saudi club
Manager Pep Guardiola was a little disappointed that Manchester City were unable to get a seventh goal in their rout of Al-Ain on Sunday despite the English club securing passage to the knockout stages of the Club World Cup.
German Ilkay Gundogan scored two goals as City comfortably dispatched the Emiratis 6-0 at Mercedes-Benz stadium to draw level with Juventus on points and goal difference at the top of Group G.
City play Juventus in their final opening-round match on Thursday to decide who tops the group and who finishes second.
Juventus go into the clash with a slight edge as goals scored is the second tiebreaker after goal difference for teams level on points. Juve have scored nine goals to City's eight.
In the round of 16, the top team in Group G will play the second-placed team in Group H, currently Red Bull Salzburg, while the runners-up will face the top team, currently 15-times European champions Real Madrid.
Guardiola: ""We pushed and pushed to score another goal to try to finish first, but we missed by one goal. But yeah, we know what we need to do against the Italian team to finish as number one.""
Guardiola on substitute Rodri's gradual return from an ACL injury: ""Step-by-step. He cannot play more than 30 minutes. He still struggles a bit in the duels, still needs to be a little bit stronger, but it's normal.
""It's important he played much, much better than the previous game. We miss him a lot. Any team would miss the best player in the world.""
Guardiola on goalscorer Claudio Echeverri: ""It's a pity for the twisted (ankle), which is a little bit sore. It was a problem, that's why he could not continue after halftime. He's an incredible player, a big, big talent in small spaces. I'm happy for him, because it was a great goal.""

Where is Iran's uranium?,"US
.
After President Donald Trump bragged US strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities, officials cautioned it was still too soon to assess the impact on the country's nuclear programme.
Many questions remain after Sunday's strikes, especially about the whereabouts of Iran's sensitive stockpile of uranium enriched to 60 percent -- a short step from the 90 percent required for a nuclear weapon.
The US attacks, carried out by B-2 stealth bombers, targeted three Iranian nuclear sites: Isfahan and Iran's main enrichment plants in Fordo and Natanz.
While significant damage has been reported, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has voiced concern about Iran's stockpile of near-weapons-grade uranium.
Tehran has an estimated 408.6 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to 60 percent, according to the UN nuclear watchdog, whose inspectors last saw that stockpile on June 10.
That material, if further refined, would theoretically be sufficient to produce more than nine nuclear bombs.
IAEA head Rafael Grossi on Monday demanded access to Iran's nuclear sites, saying the agency needs to ""account for"" the uranium stockpile.
Concerns about the fate of the sensitive stockpile have loomed large. On June 13, the day Israel began its Iran offensive, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi sent a letter to the IAEA, announcing the implementation of ""special measures to protect nuclear equipment and material"".
Days before the US attacked, satellite imagery showed vehicles near Fordo's entrance.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel had ""interesting intelligence"" on the matter, declining to elaborate.
Israel announced Monday it had carried out strikes to block access routes to Fordo.
""It will be difficult if not impossible to track down all of Iran's 60 percent enriched uranium, stored in small canisters that are easily transportable by car,"" Kelsey Davenport, an expert with the Arms Control Association, told AFP.
""They (Iranians) no longer have the capacity to turn that stockpile of highly enriched uranium to weapons-grade uranium, and that was really the goal there,"" US Vice President JD Vance told ABC News.
He added the Trump administration would deal with the uranium ""in the coming weeks"".
Analysts have been treading carefully when addressing this issue.
Before the attacks, Iran had about 22,000 centrifuges -- the machines used to enrich uranium. Many of them were damaged when Natanz was hit, the IAEA head said.

Russian barrage kills 10 in Kyiv,"US

Russia fired dozens of drones and missiles at Ukraine on Monday, ripping open a housing bloc in Kyiv, killing 10 civilians and burying others beneath the rubble.
A flurry of diplomatic efforts to end the three-year-long war have stalled, with the last direct meeting between Kyiv and Moscow coming almost three weeks ago and no follow-up talks scheduled.
The Russian army said it had used precision weapons and unmanned aerial vehicles to strike Ukrainian military facilities. ""All the designated targets were destroyed,"" it claimed.
Prosecutors in Kyiv said nine people were killed in the capital's Shevchenkivsky district, including an 11-year-old girl. Another person was killed in Bila Tserkva just outside the capital, officials said.
President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Russia had launched 352 unmanned aerial vehicles -- including Iranian-designed drones -- and 16 missiles at Ukraine, adding that some of the munitions were provided by North Korea.

Shehbaz forms panels for cashless push,"LT
PM eyes digital payments, transparency; RAAST to expand nationwide
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed the formation of three specialized committees – the Digital Payments Innovation and Adoption Committee, the Digital Public Infrastructure Committee, and the Government Payments Committee – to promote cashless economy across the country.
These special sub-committees will present recommendations to facilitate payments between citizens and businesses, raise awareness about digital systems, activate the Pakistan Digital Authority, formulate a national digital master plan, and streamline transactions between the government and the private sector.
The premier was chairing a high-level meeting focused on promoting a cashless economy in Pakistan.
He emphasized the importance of making digital transactions more affordable and accessible for the public compared to cash, as a means to promote a cashless system.
He also instructed that the RAAST digital payment system be established at the federal as well as across all provinces levels.
""Establishing a digital transaction system is crucial for bringing transparency to the economy,"" the prime minister said, adding that cashless systems are being prioritized in developed and successful economies around the world, and modern technology must be used to implement a robust digital payments infrastructure.
The prime minister noted that funds circulating through the banking system can be used for investment in government development projects.
He also directed the transition of all transactions between the public and private sectors to a cashless model.
During the briefing, the premier was updated on progress made toward implementing a nationwide cashless system.
It was shared that currently, over 40 million users are benefiting from the RAAST system, and various initiatives are underway to increase this number.
All financial transactions of the federal government are now conducted through the RAAST system, and steps are being taken to expand it to the provincial level.
The briefing also highlighted that Fintech is a key component of this ecosystem.
The Pakistan Digital Authority has been established and is actively working to transition the national economy toward a cashless model.
It was also informed in the meeting that the Digital Public Infrastructure Committee will function under the leadership of the Federal Ministry of IT, while the Cashless Pakistan Steering Committee has been established within the Prime Minister's Secretariat.

Centre plotting against K-P govt: CM,"US
Gandapur says will dissolve assembly if Imran directs
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Monday said that the provincial government was a trust bestowed by the PTI's patron-in-chief, Imran Khan, warning that if directed, he would dissolve the provincial assembly without a moment's hesitation.
Addressing the K-P Assembly, Gandapur said that the events of May 9 were merely used as a pretext for launching a full-blown assault on the PTI. ""All forces have been bent on eliminating the party and its leader,"" he alleged, adding that those who abandoned the incarcerated party chairman were nothing short of ""cowards and dishonourable"".
He went on to accuse the federal government of conspiring to topple the K-P government through the imposition of a financial emergency. However, he warned that the province would not allow such schemes to succeed.
He shared that the parliamentary party and political committee have granted his government approval to pass the provincial budget, adding that it will implement changes in the budget without delay upon Imran's directives.
Gandapur also accused the establishment of orchestrating PTI's ouster from power through a carefully crafted conspiracy. He lamented that constitutional provisions were violated and elections were deliberately delayed to sabotage the party's position.
""Before the February 8 general elections, our chairman was arrested, and the party was deprived of its electoral symbol,"" the chief minister said. ""Despite all these political injustices, the public handed us a clear mandate, but that mandate was stolen in the Centre and in three provinces.""
Commenting on the financial crisis his government inherited, Gandapur noted that the provincial treasury contained barely enough funds to pay 15 days of salaries when his government took over.
However, through sound fiscal policies, the province's revenue has now surpassed Rs93 billion, and is projected to reach Rs129 billion in the next fiscal year.
The chief minister further revealed that Rs150 billion in cash reserves remain in the province's debt servicing account, generating Rs60 million in daily income. The throw-forward liability of K-P has been reduced from 13 years to just over five years, he added.
""Those who hold sway over the country left no stone unturned in pushing this province towards insolvency and chaos,"" Gandapur claimed.
He said that despite their best efforts, they had not been allowed to meet Imran Khan, and alleged that the budget approval process was being obstructed to pave the way for a federal takeover of provincial authority under the guise of a financial emergency.
""We will never let this conspiracy succeed,"" he said. ""The provincial budget is being passed as per the PTI's parliamentary and political committee's decision, but if the chairman wants anything added or removed, it will be done immediately.""

Jamshoro district council presents tax-free budget,"US
Sindh government is expected to contribute: Rs352.1 million under the tax head
The Jamshoro District Council has presented a tax-free budget of Rs549.8 million for the fiscal year 2025-26. The budget was approved unanimously during a council meeting chaired by District Council Chairman Suhail Ahmed Shoro.
According to documents, the Sindh government failed to release the full allocated funds last year, while employee salaries have increased in the current year. During the session, Accounts Officer Pervez Baloch presented the budget breakdown, highlighting that Rs207 million have been earmarked for development projects.
Additional allocations include: Rs40.88 million for pensions, press clubs, social work, cultural events, and national celebrations; Rs97.3 million for engineering and infrastructure works; and Rs252.5 million for salaries of council employees.
For the current year, the Sindh government is expected to contribute: Rs352.1 million under the tax head; Rs7.05 million from property rentals; and Rs994,308 in other rents.
Chairman Shoro remarked that due to a shortfall in govt grants and the non-transfer of funds for SUG (Sindh Urban Governance) employees, the council had to disburse salaries from its allocated budget. Furthermore, the recovery of rent from district council-owned properties-such as shops and housing units-remained below 100%.
Meanwhile, opposition leader Shahnawaz Barfat advocated for greater allocations in development schemes and recommended awarding more council projects to local contractors.

The man, Usman Raza Khan alias Maan, was discovered after neighbours reported a stench emanating from the locked flat. Police broke down the door and found the body with hands bound with cloth and feet resting on a single-seater sofa directly beneath the fan.
The body was shifted to Civil Hospital for postmortem. According to police, Usman's father, Hussain Raza, claimed his son was a drug addict and had a history of domestic violence. His wife had left him and taken their child, while the family had also distanced themselves. Usman lived alone and had reportedly sold household items to fund his addiction. While the father suspects suicide, police say the tied hands raise doubts, prompting an investigation to rule out foul play.

Ganguly interested in India coaching role,"US
He says England series will be crucial for Gautam and Team India
Former India captain Sourav Ganguly on Monday expressed his interest in coaching the Indian cricket team while making it clear that he has no intention of entering politics.
Speaking to Indian media, Ganguly said that while politics does not appeal to him, he would certainly consider taking up a coaching role with the national side in the future.
""I never really thought about coaching because I moved into different roles. I finished competitive cricket in 2013 and then became BCCI president. I'm just 53, so let's see what happens. I'm open to it. We'll see where it goes,"" he said.
Ganguly also shared his thoughts on India's current head coach, Gautam Gambhir, praising him for his dedication and forthright approach.
""Gautam is doing a good job. He started a bit slowly, losing to Australia and New Zealand, but bounced back strongly with the Champions Trophy win in Dubai. This series against England will be big for him and the team,"" Ganguly said.
Praising Gambhir's honest and transparent nature, Ganguly added, ""I haven't seen him very closely in this role, but he's very straightforward and open about what he feels about the team, the players and people around him.
""From the outside, you can tell he's transparent - what you see is what you get,"" he remarked.
Ganguly, who played alongside Gambhir during his career, expressed confidence that the young coach will continue to grow in the role.
""I've played with him - he was always respectful toward me and the senior players. Even now, I see he's passionate about his job.
""He's only a year into it, and this England tour will be important. He struggled a bit in Australia, but like everyone else, he'll learn and get better,"" he added.
Ganguly, who retired from international cricket in 2013, previously served as Team Director for Delhi Capitals in the IPL from 2018 to 2019 and again from 2022 to 2024.
He also held the influential position of President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
Meanwhile, Former India captain Sunil Gavaskar has voiced strong disapproval over the naming of the Test trophy between England and India as the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, suggesting that the legendary Indian batter's name should have come first.
In his column for Mid-day, Gavaskar acknowledged the England and Wales Cricket Board's (ECB) right to rename the series but questioned the order of names in the title.
""The ECB is fully entitled to call the series by any name they choose,"" Gavaskar wrote. ""But for most, if not all, Indian cricket lovers, it is jarring to know that Anderson's name comes first.""
Gavaskar argued that Sachin Tendulkar, widely regarded as one of the greatest cricketers in history, deserved precedence due to both his seniority and accomplishments.
""Not only is Sachin Tendulkar along with Kapil Dev the greatest Indian cricketer, but also senior to Anderson by more than a dozen years,"" he noted.
Archer makes red-ball comeback to boost Eng hopes
Jofra Archer made his first appearance in a first-class match in four years on Sunday in the County Championship as the 30-year-old quick continues his comeback from a spate of injuries and looks to play himself into a spot in the England test squad.
Archer, who has taken 42 wickets in 13 tests, has not represented England in the longest format since February 2021 as his career stalled due to fitness problems including elbow injuries and back issues that sidelined him for long periods. His latest setback came only last month when a thumb injury ruled him out of the one-day international series against West Indies. National team selector Luke Wright said last month that Archer could be in contention to play in England's second Test against India at Birmingham from July 2 and captain Ben Stokes has been left in no doubt about the bowler's desire to return.
""He's been absolutely desperate to put the white shirt back on,"" said Stokes last Thursday ahead of the first test. ""He's had a torrid run with injuries, but he's managed a fair bit of white-ball cricket recently.

NA body finds fault with hospitals lease,"US
.
A parliamentary panel has called for reviewing the lease granted to big hospitals in the federal capital, stating that there is a need for the Capital Development Authority (CDA) to sign new agreements with the medical institutions in view of public interest.
The National Assembly Sub-Committee for Health convened on Monday. During the meeting, the convener, MNA Amjad Khan, stated that the CDA has provided all relevant documents with regard to land leased to major hospitals in Islamabad.
The convener suggested that all such lease agreements should be reviewed and renewed in the public interest. According to CDA laws, any agreement can be revised or canceled, he said.
He said the Shifa International pays taxes to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and also enjoys certain exemptions while it holds a lease valid until 2052. He said if this lease was signed in 2019, the committee wants to know under what terms it was done.
Committee member Shazia Sobia stated that plots were allocated to the health institutions on a social, not commercial, basis, yet the leases were revised blindly.
The convener proposed referring the issue to the Public Accounts Committee especially since leases were revised without thoroughly checking the status of services provided.
Member Sabin Ghori raised a concern about Shifa International building parking on a green belt, asking the CDA for clarification. The CDA DG Land responded that only the directorate of municipal administration (DMA) could answer that.
The convener stated that under Rule 227, the committee could request data from the FBR. ""Until we have the data, we cannot reach a conclusion,"" he said. However, the FBR representative replied that sharing taxpayer data could create legal issues for him.
Committee members then raised questions about the chairman and members of the Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority (IHRA) board, arguing that if a private hospital owner chairs the board, it would result in a conflict of interest.
The IHRA CEO told the panel that the board consists of seven members and two positions from the federal government remain unfilled. The Ministry of Health can provide more information on how board members are selected, he said.
The convener asked how someone who owns a hospital and a medical college could serve the public interest while holding such a powerful position. He said the board has held only one meeting to date.

Ministry asks for delay in tariff relief for Karachi,"US
Believes power price cut by Rs4.69 per unit will impact uniform tariffs across country
The Ministry of Energy has sought delay in tariff relief for K-Electric (KE) consumers under a fuel cost adjustment (FCA) petition, arguing that it will impact uniform tariffs across the country.
A public hearing was held on Monday and instead of deliberating on the negative FCA request filed by KE, the event became a tug of war between maintaining the uniform tariff and passing on the justified fuel cost relief to power consumers of Karachi. KE had filed a request for a reduction of Rs4.69 per unit in fuel charges for April 2025. If granted, this tariff adjustment will be the eighth successive monthly relief for consumers since September 2024.
The energy ministry cited concerns about the impact on uniform tariffs, stating that there was a need to maintain fiscal discipline and avoid exacerbating financial challenges due to the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. It mentioned that the federal government had already allocated Rs21 billion in subsidies for FCA, which could be affected if any relief was granted at the current stage.
National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) Chairman Waseem Mukhtar responded firmly and expressed strong disapproval of the intervention during a public hearing. He was of the view that timing of the request was highly inappropriate.
He raised questions about the relationship between fuel cost adjustments and subsidies, dismissing the ministry's concerns over uniform tariffs and asked where was such a mechanism. He emphasised that the FCA, by nature, should not be linked to subsidy decisions. He questioned what FCA treatment should be, if the authority agreed to defer the adjustment, considering the motions which could take up to six months before a decision was reached and whether the burden would be borne or passed on to consumers.
Mukhtar also pointed to concerns over questions being raised about transparency in the authority's decision-making, adding that the upcoming billing cycle would be affected because of the confusion. KE CEO Moonis Alvi mentioned that the private power utility would comply with Nepra's decision, following the regulatory process, and ensure justice for consumers. He emphasised that the monthly negative FCA would have provided significant relief to Karachi industries and consumers and halting it now may not be justified.
Drawing a comparison, Alvi pointed out that when KE's fuel cost adjustments were higher in the past, the concept of uniformity at the national level was not considered.
FCA is a key part of the regulatory framework used to adjust electricity prices based on fluctuations in global fuel prices and changes in the electricity generation mix. While KE has already seen reductions in its monthly FCAs due to lower global fuel prices, this delay is seen as a direct interference in a process designed to benefit Karachi consumers.
There are also concerns about the impact this delay could have on economic activities in the city, with customers already facing challenges from the high cost of energy. Moreover, the argument that this adjustment may interfere with the uniform tariff system is seen by many as a thinly veiled attempt to maintain control over pricing at the expense of the public.
As of now, Karachi electricity consumers will have to wait at least another week to learn whether they will receive the much-needed financial reprieve. Nepra has confirmed that it will proceed with the hearing as soon as the ministry's objections are addressed and their letter will be uploaded on Nepra's website for stakeholders' visibility. It, however, remains unclear whether the delay will be extended further.

Quake threat looms as Landhi fault line awakens,"DE
At least 57 minor to mild earthquakes recorded in the past 
23 days
People of the densely populated areas of Landhi, Korangi, Quaidabad and Malir are literally shaken by the repeated, though, minor earthquakes.
In the past 23 days, the city has experienced a total of 57 earthquakes, with most being minor to mild in intensity. However, some of the tremors have been significant, including one earthquake with a 3.8 magnitude, another with a magnitude of 3.7, and two earthquakes with magnitudes of 3.6. This recent surge in seismic activity has raised concerns among experts.
According to the Head of the National Tsunami Centre, Ameer Hyder Laghari, the earthquakes are linked to the Landhi fault line, one of the two active fault lines in the Karachi region. As per Laghari, in 2009, 36 earthquakes were recorded on the Landhi fault line over four months, and the series continued until 2021.
The recent series of earthquakes consisted of 57 tremors recorded so far, mostly of low intensity, but four significant quakes with magnitudes between 3.8 and 3.6. The National Tsunami Centre and Meteorological Department have released data showing that most of these quakes were recorded in Malir, Landhi, and the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) areas.
According to Laghari, the fault line in Karachi is not a recent development, but has existed for centuries. Earthquakes have been recorded in the 18th and 19th centuries as well, although the intensity was not documented the same way as today, due to the lack of modern equipment. In the past, however, the area along the fault line was covered with forests and gardens, but now has been largely converted into residential areas. Laghari stated that converting past forests and gardens into solid constructions and unplanned human settlements is equivalent to damaging the ecosystem, stressing that it is necessary to encourage earthquake-proof constructions in areas near the fault line, similar to Japan's approach. He pointed out that in Japan, people also live near fault lines, but have designed their buildings to withstand natural disasters. He stressed the need for policies ensuring that constructions near the fault line are earthquake-proof, or built to a standard that can withstand earthquakes. This would require a specific approach to construction, and civil work that prioritises seismic resilience.
Laghari mentioned that micro-level studies have been conducted, which recorded the earthquakes on the Richter scale, even if they were not felt by the population, in order to better understand the causes of the recent quakes. He also urged that people be made aware of the earthquake risk, and be guided on safe construction practices, in order to mitigate the associated risks.

Civil Hospital to have high-tech modular Ots,"US
Theatres will provide sterile environment during surgeries
The Civil Hospital Karachi is set to receive three state-of-the-art modular operation theatres, designed to meet international infection-control standards. The project, estimated to cost up to Rs450 million, is expected to be functional within two months.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Medical Superintendent Dr?Khalid Bukhari said that the modular OT plan was under consideration for two years. It has officially been approved in the 2025-26 fiscal year. Credit for the scheme goes to Sindh Health Minister Dr?Azra Fazal Pechuho and Health Secretary Dr?Rehan Baloch. Under the provincial initiative, 15 modular OTs will be built across Sindh, with three at Civil Hospital Karachi.
Dr?Bukhari noted that while private hospitals in Karachi already have modular OTs, this is going to be the first time that such facilities are installed in a government hospital in the city. He explained that these theatres provide a sterile environment during surgery with HEPA filters, ensuring continuous clean air for both the surgeon as well as the patient.
Key features of the modular OTs include airtight doors, dedicated air-handling units, antibacterial flooring, and the use of stainless steel or antimicrobial materials to facilitate cleaning and prevent microbial growth.
Temperature, airflow, lighting, and gas systems are all fully controlled, with shadowless lights and automatic doors aiding surgical precision. Compared to traditional OTs, modular versions drastically cut down the risk of infection.
Currently, the hospital has 14 conventional operating theatres, where surgeons handle complex cancer and other long procedures lasting six to eight hours.
In this context, modular OTs have become essential.
Dr?Bukhari said that approval for the three theatres has been secured and a request for four more will be submitted soon.
He mentioned that all equipment including tables, head lights, and related hardware will be imported. ""These modern OTs will be a boon not only for medical staff but also for patients,"" he added.

K-P's rightful share,"LT
.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa is facing severe financial crisis for the last so many years. Rather than stabilising, the crisis is deepening due to spiraling energy costs, unchecked inflation, a volatile border policy with Afghanistan and persistent threat of terrorism. These challenges have collectively eroded the province's fiscal capacity and stalled both its economic growth and social development.
The situation is further exacerbated by structural issues. The Newly Merged Districts (NMDs), with a population of 24.149 million, and Malakand Division, home to 10 million people, have rising expectations for basic services. Yet, with a limited taxable population and chronic tax evasion, the burden is disproportionately borne by the rest of the province. This fiscal imbalance hampers the government's ability to invest in education, healthcare and infrastructure development - areas that fall squarely within the provincial domain under the Constitution.
While the Constitution entrusts provinces with responsibility for social services and development, these obligations remain unfulfilled due to the federal government's delays and reluctance in releasing constitutionally mandated funds - particularly under the Net Hydel Profit (NHP) mechanism as per the AGN Qazi Methodology.
To break this deadlock and enable meaningful development, K-P, like other provinces, is fully justified in demanding the convening of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC). Article 160 of the Constitution mandates that the NFC Award should consider multiple indicators, not just population size. These include poverty, revenue generation, security expenditure and geographic disadvantages. Moreover, following the merger of tribal districts, K-P's share in NFC Award stands at 19.46% - something that the federal government is constitutionally obligated to accept. But again, in the federal budget for the coming fiscal year, the enhanced share as per the addition of the population is missing.
K-P's case for greater weightage in the NFC Award is grounded in logic and law. The province contributes significantly to national revenue through its oil and gas resources, and bears an extraordinary burden of security-related expenses due to its proximity to Afghanistan and the impact of terrorism. Despite this, K-P continues to suffer from delayed payments and withheld arrears under the NHP mechanism.
Article 161(2) of the Constitution entitles provinces to NHP payments, and the AGN Qazi Committee's methodology - endorsed by the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the Supreme Court - lays down the formula. Yet, the arrears continue to pile up. While the province was paid Rs6 billion in 1992 based on this methodology, inconsistencies have led to an estimated Rs75 billion in unpaid dues, with some sources placing the figure above Rs1 trillion. Under an interim arrangement approved by the CCI in 2016, a rate of Rs1.10 per kilowatt-hour with 5% annual indexation was set. Yet, even this has not been consistently honored.
According to the White Paper on Budget 2025-26, excise duty on oil is not paid to the province, as the rate has not been determined yet. K-P produces more than 50% of the national oil production which means it absorbs the highest loss from the unavailability of this duty.
The federal government collects Petroleum Development Levy on different petroleum products. This collection is not distributed among the provinces as it is excluded from the federal divisible pool of the NFC, which is a violation of the rights of the provinces. Also, despite multiple efforts, excise duty on oil is not determined despite constitutional provision.
K-P government's Adviser on Finance Muzammil Aslam is on record saying that the province had last received Rs90 billion less due to the reduction in tax collections from the federal government.
Similarly, K-P seeks a fairer and more transparent share of royalties on oil and gas produced within its borders. Article 161(1)(b) mandates that these royalties should accrue to the province where the wellhead is located. Moreover, Article 172(3), inserted into the Constitution through the 18th Amendment, clearly states that the ownership of natural resources is to be shared between the Centre and the provincial governments. This necessitates amendments to the Petroleum Act, Rules and Policy, enabling joint decision-making and equitable benefits for resource-producing provinces.
Despite this constitutional clarity, the federal government maintains centralised control, which K-P rightly views as unconstitutional post-18th Amendment. The province's repeated demands for financial autonomy, timely fund releases and greater decision-making in resource governance are not just political rhetoric - they are rooted in constitutional rights and fiscal necessity.
The Chief Minister of K-P has, through a letter, aptly highlighted the province's precarious financial position and urged the federal government to release the pending dues, especially those for the development of NMDs. This is not just about numbers on a balance sheet; it's about ensuring peace, promoting economic activity and healing the wounds of decades of marginalisation.
Justice Munir once observed that the most persistent constitutional challenge in Pakistan has been the equitable distribution of power and resources between the federation and the provinces. Today, the Constitution provides a clear framework for resolving this longstanding issue. What remains is the political will to implement it in both letter and spirit.
K-P is not asking for favours; it is demanding its rightful share under the Constitution. Fulfilling these demands will not only uphold constitutional justice but also help allay longstanding grievances and the deep-rooted sense of deprivation felt across the province.

Salman battling brain conditions,"US
Bollywood star casually revealed serious health concerns on talk show
Do any of you want to learn how to slip in a bombshell with minimum fuss or fanfare? You are invited to study Bollywood hero Salman Khan, who – in between reciting a laundry list of the numerous disadvantages of matrimony – casually revealed that he lives with a life-threatening brain condition during an appearance on The Great Indian Kapil Show this past Saturday.
""I am working despite having trigeminal neuralgia, I am working despite having an aneurysm in my brain, and I have AV malformation and I am still going strong,"" noted the Sikandar star in the matter-fact-tone of one reeling off the symptoms of a cold.
What does this mean?
This is not the first time Salman has mentioned his trigeminal neuralgia in public. The Bollywood legend had opened up about his condition in Dubai in 2017. According to the Mayo Clinic website, trigeminal neuralgia is a long-lasting chronic pain condition that causes intense pain similar to an electric shock on one side of the face. It affects the trigeminal nerve, which carries signals from the face to the brain. Even light touch from brushing your teeth or putting on makeup may trigger a jolt of pain.
However, it was on this latest appearance on The Great Indian Kapil Show that Salman touched upon his other two neurological conditions. A brain aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in a blood vessel in the brain, and can cause bleeding in the brain if it leaks or ruptures, also known as a haemorrhagic stroke.
Meanwhile, arteriovenous malformation (or AV malformation) is a rare defect in the connection between arteries and veins, usually in the brain or spine. In a normal system, arteries carry blood to tissues and veins carry it back. In an AVM, this network is tangled, and blood flows directly from arteries to veins, bypassing capillaries, which can cause bleeding, seizures, headaches, or neurological issues.
What fans say
A section of Salman's fans expressed their concerns for his health and wished him well for the future.
""Praying for his speedy recovery and healing,"" wrote one fan, as another penned. ""Get well soon Salman sir, you are the heartbeat of India.""
However, Salman's casual retelling of his medical diagnoses proved to be yet another chance for netizens to show that they are, by and large, an unsentimental, cynical crowd.
""You should rest because your movies are not performing well. Plus, there is that threat from Bishnoi,"" advised one commenter, referencing the numerous death threats the actor has received from Indian gangster Lawrence Bishnoi.
Yet another Instagram user (or troll) brought back memories of the X post Salman deleted after celebrating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan in May – unlike his fellow Bollywood stars, who had expressed their support for Indian military action on social media. ""Maybe this is why he tweeted about a ceasefire, maybe his brain wasn't working, or maybe his brain has developed a love for Pakistan,"" added the follower.
Not as bad as marriage
Life threatening though his neurological conditions may be, the actor's determined anti-marriage stance shows that in his eyes, the dangers of tying the knot and sharing his life with a woman far outweigh the risk posed by almost anything else. Living his professional life in the public eye, the actor has lost count of the number of times he has been asked why he has never been married, and this time, he did not hold back his loathing of the very concept of marriage.
""I always say, what benefit is it to you if I get married? Do you get any enjoyment from this? What have I done to you that would cause you to take such great joy from my downfall?"" joked the Race 3 star.
Proving that he finds acquiring a wife no laughing matter, however, Salman laid out his argument point by point. ""The thing is, that patience, those fights and the sacrifices a husband and wife would make for one another – that tolerance all gone now. Now people go looking for divorce over their partner's leg coming over on their side of the bed, or for snoring too loudly or other small misunderstandings.""
Salman said ""people"", but his next words proved that what he really meant was ""women"" – as in, it is women who end up causing men the most pain during any relationship. ""And then – divorce is one thing – but then she would also take half your earnings!"" continued a passionate (and disillusioned) Salman before a crowd wracked with mirth at his cutting observations.
Cloaked within this open disdain of marriage came the revelation of Salman's medical difficulties – not that he dwelt on them with half as much passion as as he detailed why he would never be induced to acquire a wife. As a committed action hero where the job description demands dances and stunts, Salman wryly noted that with a career laden with physical risks, taking on board the gamble of marriage is simply not worth it and makes no financial sense.
""In this job, there are so many high octane shots where you may break so many bones and tear so many muscles – and all of this [marital trouble] would also be happening on the side!"" he continued. ""And the minute her mood takes a dip and she snaps, she would be off with half of my money!""
Salman did concede, however, that bowing down to tradition and getting married would have been less trouble in his youth. ""It's easier to put up with when you're younger, because you can earn all your money back! But at this age, it's not so easy.""
In other words, there is no hope for any woman who harbours any romantic fantasies about the way this 59-year-old actor can battle broken bones and neurological conditions. Aneurysm or no aneurysm, Salman remains firmly against marriage, and there is nothing anyone can do to change his mind.

Both fighters hail from Lyari, a gritty, sports-obsessed neighborhood
The boxing gloves are on, and tensions are rising as a fierce rivalry brews in the heart of Lyari - Pakistan's cradle of boxing champions. Alia Soomro, who recently declared herself the first professional female boxer to represent Pakistan internationally, has been publicly challenged to a bout by none other than 19-year-old national silver medallist Gohar Taj.
In a fiery video message, Gohar threw down the gauntlet, saying: ""I openly challenge Alia Soomro to step into the ring with me - anywhere in Pakistan. Let's find out who the real queen of the ring is!""
The confident Gohar Taj, who serves in the Pakistan Navy and holds both Sindh and inter-provincial gold medals dispelled Alia Soomro claim that she secured a professional title belt in Thailand.
The challenge comes after 21-year-old Alia Soomro, who, per Gohar Taj, has only competed at district level so far, made headlines claiming to be the first Pakistani woman professional boxer, citing her international participation and upcoming bout in Dubai against an Indian opponent, backed by the Sindh government.
For sports enthusiasts this high-voltage rivalry is more than just personal pride - it's a battle for recognition, legacy, and the future of women's boxing in Pakistan.
Both fighters hail from Lyari, a gritty, sports-obsessed neighborhood known for producing world-class footballers and boxers. Now, Lyari's gyms may soon give way to a historic clash.
Who will reign supreme in the ring? Pakistan's boxing fans may not have to wait long to witness what could become the most sensational all-female bout in the country's history.

Putin slams attack on Tehran,"US
.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday slammed attacks on Iran as ""unprovoked"" and ""unjustified"" in a meeting with Tehran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, but did not announce any concrete support to his key ally in the Middle East.
Moscow is a crucial backer of Iran, but has not swung forcefully behind its partner even as the United States launched strikes on its nuclear facilities over the weekend.
""This absolutely unprovoked aggression against Iran is unjustified,"" Putin said in televised remarks to Araghchi at the start of their meeting.
The Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov downplayed the exchange after the talks by saying ""they were unlikely to be effective"" during such a ""heated moment"".
Araghchi later said the meeting was ""very good"" and that Russia's stance on the issue remained ""firm"", noting its role in the UN Security Council. He did not provide further details on the talks with the Russian leader.
Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said revealing details of the Putin-Araghchi meeting would have been ""irresponsible"" and that Russia and Iran were working on ""many directions"" when asked if Tehran requested military aid from Russia.
Since Israel launched its wave of strikes on June 13, triggering Iran to respond with missiles and drones, Russia has not publicly offered military help to Tehran.
Russia was ""making efforts to help the Iranian people"", Putin said in the meeting, without elaborating.
Asked what specific support Russia might offer, Peskov told reporters: ""It all depends on what Iran needs. We have offered our mediation services.""
Putin has pitched himself as a mediator between Iran and Israel, an idea rejected by US President Donald Trump last week.
Peskov also said the strikes on Iran would not affect bilateral relations between Moscow and Washington -- with the Kremlin seeking a rapprochement with the United States since Donald Trump returned to power -- saying they were ""different issues"".

Director High-Performance Aaqib Javed, in a statement released by the PCB, had shared that the players were invited to the camp after 'detailed discussions' with newly-appointed white-ball head coach Mike Hesson.
Javed said that the camp would provide the 47 players with an opportunity to fine-tune their skills during a brief pause from competitive cricket.
""We have invited 47 players to the 20-day skills camp at the National Cricket Academy following detailed discussions with white-ball head coach Mike Hesson,"" said Javed.
""This is an invaluable opportunity for the players to take a brief pause from competitive cricket and focus on enhancing their fitness and refining key aspects of their game. With a busy international calendar ahead, this window allows us to provide targeted support to the players, so they can return better prepared for the challenges to come,"" he added.
""There is a complete alignment between the coaching staff at the National Cricket Academy and the national men's team. We are working in close coordination to ensure that every initiative contributes to the long-term progress of Pakistan cricket,"" he concluded.
Hasan Ali joins elite T20 club of Pak bowlers
Pakistan fast bowler Hasan Ali has reached a significant milestone in T20 cricket, becoming the ninth Pakistani and 39th overall player to take 300 wickets in the shortest format.
The 31-year-old achieved the feat while representing Birmingham Bears in the ongoing Men's Vitality Blast 2025. He reached the landmark in just 212 matches, highlighting his consistency and effectiveness in T20 cricket.
With this achievement, Hasan has joined an elite group of Pakistani bowlers that includes Shaheen Shah Afridi and Mohammad Amir. In the ongoing Vitality Blast season, Hasan has been in solid form, picking up 12 wickets in six matches at an average of 17.33. However, his economy rate of 9.38 suggests there's room for improvement in containing runs.
Former pacer Wahab Riaz leads the list for Pakistan with 413 wickets in 348 T20 matches. Meanwhile, Afghanistan's Rashid Khan leads the all-time T20 wicket-takers list with an impressive 643 wickets in 477 matches.
Most T20 wickets by Pakistani bowlers:
Wahab Riaz – 413 wickets, Sohail Tanvir – 389 wickets, Mohammad Amir – 384 wickets, Imad Wasim – 365 wickets, Shahid Afridi – 347 wickets, Shadab Khan – 345 wickets, Haris Rauf – 321 wickets, Shaheen Afridi – 310 wickets and Hasan Ali – 301 wickets.

Double-digit fuelinflation looms,"US
Diesel, petrol prices may see hike up to Rs27 amid Israel-Iran tensions
Pakistan is likely to feel the burnt of the escalating tensions following Israel's attack on Iran, which has been further exacerbated by the United States' involvement. This situation is causing a rise in oil prices, which is expected to significantly affect domestic fuel prices in Pakistan. As global oil benchmarks continue to rise due to the increasing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, Pakistani consumers may face another sharp increase in fuel costs.
According to market data and industry estimates, prices of High-Speed Diesel (HSD) and Petrol (Gasoline) in the international market have recorded significant gains in recent weeks. Between June 2 and June 20, 2025, the price of Gas Oil (Diesel) rose by 16.3% to $91.91 per barrel, while Gasoline (Petrol) increased by 10.9% to $82.31 per barrel. Spot prices further climbed as of June 20, 2025, with Gas Oil touching $93.3/bbl and Gasoline $83.4/bbl - reflecting a sharp 9.6% and 4.5% rise respectively since June 13, 2025, according to data compiled by the Arif Habib Limited (AHL).
In line with these developments, Pakistan's domestic fuel prices are projected to increase substantially in the upcoming fortnightly revision effective from July 1, 2025. Sources suggest that diesel prices may be raised by Rs27.34 per litre, taking the expected price to Rs289.93/litre, up 10.4% from the current Rs262.59/litre. Similarly, petrol prices are anticipated to rise by Rs21.49 per liter, reaching Rs279.92/litre, a jump of 8.3% from the prevailing Rs258.43/litre. A key factor influencing this hike is the depreciation of the Pakistani Rupee (PKR) against the US Dollar. The exchange rate averaged 283.6 per US dollar in the recent period, compared to 284.8 earlier, slightly cushioning the impact, but not enough to offset the surge in global oil benchmarks.
Industry experts attribute the global price rally to heightened uncertainty over supply disruptions stemming from the Israel-Iran standoff. Middle Eastern tensions are historically known to push crude prices upward due to fears of constrained supply routes and production interruptions.
Additionally, recent gains in major oil benchmarks such as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for the US light oil market and sourced from US oil fields,is up 12.8% to $74.8/bbl, Brent, up 14.0% to $76.86/bbl, and Arablight, up 13.0% to $76.79/bbl, reflect a broad-based increase in crude and refined product prices, directly impacting Pakistan's import costs.
If these trends sustain, the forthcoming price revision may put further pressure on inflation and transport costs, affecting various sectors of the economy. The government faces a tough balancing act amid public backlash risks and the need to adhere to IMF-mandated revenue targets.
Meanwhile, Pakistan's petroleum exports displayed a mixed performance in May 2025, marked by a sharp yearly decline but somewhat supported by robust growth in fuel oil (FO) shipments over the cumulative 11-month period of the fiscal year. Total petroleum exports dropped by 39% year-on-year (YoY) to 164,000 tonnes in May 2025, according to AHL. However, this represented a significant 53% month-on-month (MoM) recovery compared to April's volume of 107,000 tonnes, suggesting some improvement in near-term demand.
Fuel oil exports, comprising both high sulfur (HSFO) and low sulfur (LSFO) variants, continued to drive the overall petroleum export performance. During the 11MFY25 period, FO exports surged 63% YoY to reach 1.368 million tonnes, a record high, although May 2025 shipments slipped by 20% YoY to 147,000 tonnes despite posting a strong 51% MoM rebound. In contrast, naphtha exports contracted 13% YoY in May, totalling 17,000 tonnes, while crude condensate exports remained absent for the second consecutive month.

Govt eases curbs on big-ticket purchases,"PK
Aurangzeb winds up budget debate in NA; presents Rs36b new tax measures
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday formally unveiled a Rs36 billion mini budget in the National Assembly and announced to exclude almost the entire population from disclosing source of income before buying a big home, a car or running a bank account.
The limits set for disclosing the source of income before making big purchases would now target only the users of above 1,600 cc cars, and people owning more than one-kanal residential houses in major cities and almost two-kanal houses in other cities.
Effectively, this has rendered the enforcement initiative of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) chairman ineffective, which has also lowered the success rate to catch the tax evaders to just 3.7%.
The FBR does not have the capacity to go after the people once they have made these purchases, thus, the government had planned to pre-empt the purchases.
Aurangzeb made these announcements while winding up the budget debate in the National Assembly. With the winding up speech, the formal process for approval of the next fiscal year's budget and tax measures has begun that will end with the approval of the Finance Act likely on Thursday.
The finance minister presented three more budget proposals before the National Assembly, which also target one-day old chicks, to generate a total Rs36 billion in additional taxes in the fiscal year 2025-26.
He proposed increase in the tax rate on the income derived from the debt portion of mutual funds issued to companies from 25% to 29%. The minister said that the companies' other incomes were already taxed at the 29% rate.
Aurangzeb said that the income tax rate on profits made by corporations and companies on investments in government debt is also increased from 15% to 20%. The government has also proposed tax on the poultry sector, where billions of rupees investments are made, said Aurangzeb.
""It is proposed that a Federal Excise Duty (FED) of Rs10 per day-old chick should be imposed on hatchery chicks, so that this sector can also contribute to the national exchequer,"" he said. The government has estimated that about 1.5 billion chicks are produced every year and it will collect Rs15 billion by taxing a product that is a common diet of the poor and the rich.
The minister said that these three additional measures will not impact the industry and the burden has been passed on to the wealthy people and institutions.
The government proposed the Rs36 billion measures in lieu of reduction in proposed sales tax rate on import of solar panels from 18% to 10% and funding an increase in salaries of the government employees to 10%.
Aurangzeb claimed that the government has presented a balanced budget for the fiscal year 2025-26. On the one hand, we have kept government expenditure under control, while on the other, much emphasis has been laid towards increasing the tax base and its compliance, said the finance minister.
Exclusion
Earlier, the government proposed that all those citizens should be barred from buying major assets, if their declared wealth does not support such purchases. But the finance minister announced the measure to drastically tame these powers.
""On the instructions of the prime minister, this new law will not apply to the purchase of residential plots or houses worth up to Rs50 million, commercial plots or properties worth up to Rs100 million and vehicles worth up to Rs7 million,"" he said.
These limits are ""too generous"" and compromise the objective of linking the purchases with white money, a senior FBR official told The Express Tribune.
Early this year, the FBR chairman had informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that due to almost no capacity of the FBR to audit the tax statements, the rate of success in inquiring the people about the source after making these purchases was only 3.7%.
The government has also agreed to relax the criteria for banning the economic transactions such as buying a home, plot, car, investing in securities and maintaining a bank account by those, whose declared assets do not support these purchases. It had proposed to ban all such transactions if the declared assets do not support these purchases.
The ineligibility condition will be applicable only if the cash in the bank account is more than Rs100 million per annum in all bank accounts of one individual. The ineligibility condition on stock market investment would be applicable, if the cumulative investment in a year is more than Rs50 million.
One of the genuine concerns was that the FBR may end up exploiting the people in the absence of a credible online platform to determine the eligibility of the people to make these purchases. Because of this reason, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance had linked the implementation of these harsh conditions with the effectiveness of the online platform.
The finance minister also announced to exempt a residential property owner from payment of up to 6.5% withholding tax at the time of sale, if the property is sold after retaining it for at least 15 years.
He said that the government would not tax post-retirement benefits in the shape of commutation and gratuity. But the annual pension of over Rs10 million will be taxed at the rate of 5%. On the instructions of the prime minister, pensioners over the age of 75 are exempt from all types of taxes, he added.
The government, in its bid to promote affordable housing, would launch a 20-year loan scheme for the low-income segment, informed Aurangzeb. He stated that individuals earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million annually will now be taxed at just 1% -- from 2.5% proposed in the budget.
He added that the proposed 18% GST on solar panel imports has been lowered to 10% but said that it would increase the prices by only 4.6%.
Aurangzeb informed the lower house that on the special instructions of the prime minister, the existing powers of the FBR regarding tax fraud and the amendments made through the Finance Bill were reviewed again, under which tax fraud has been categorised into cognisable and non-cognisable offences.
""In cases involving up to Rs50 million, the FBR will not be able to arrest without a court warrant,"" he said. In addition, the person can be arrested only if he does not become a part of the inquiry despite three notices; the accused tries to escape; or tampers with the record.
He said that the approval for arrest will be given by a high-level three-member committee of the FBR, instead of an officer, and it will be necessary to present the arrested persons before the court of a special judge within 24 hours,"" he said.

"K-P govt employees protest for pay, perks","US
Seek Rs50,000 wage, 30% disparity allowance
Government employees from across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa staged a protest at Assembly Chowk on Monday, demanding a pay raise in line with inflation, a 30 per cent disparity allowance similar to the federal model, and the implementation of a minimum monthly wage of Rs50,000. Protesters blocked Khyber Road for all types of traffic, leading to significant disruptions in the city.
Carrying placards and banners, the demonstrators chanted slogans against the provincial government. They criticized the recent pay and pension increases10 per cent and seven percent respectivelyas insufficient in the face of soaring inflation. The protesters demanded a 30 per cent disparity allowance similar to federal employees, a 50 per cent increase in salaries in line with inflation, a minimum wage of Rs50,000.
They also demanded transition of CP Fund employees to the GP Fund and withdrawal of the recently imposed pension reform laws.
Opposition leader in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Dr Ibadullah, joined the protest and assured the demonstrators that their demands were legitimate. He pledged to raise their concerns on the floor of the provincial assembly and give voice to their grievances in the legislative forum.
The protest caused major traffic jams on GT Road, creating hardships for commuters in the sweltering heat. Attempts at negotiation between the police and protest leaders failed, prompting the deployment of additional police forces. Law enforcement agencies ultimately resorted to tear gas shelling to disperse the crowd.
Following the police action, the protesters disbanded, and traffic was gradually restored.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Secretary General Muhammad Humayun Khan strongly condemned the use of tear gas and violence against protesting government employees at the Assembly Chowk, calling the incident deeply disturbing and unacceptable.
He said the PPP denounces the brutal treatment meted out to government workers who were merely demanding a raise in their salaries. ""The scenes from Assembly Chowk are painful. Those seeking rightful wage increases should not be treated like enemies,"" he remarked.
Criticizing the PTI-led provincial government, Humayun Khan said it is incapable of delivering anything beyond exploitation. ""Why is the government troubled by demands for fair wages? Even during tough economic times, the PPP increased salaries of public servants,"" he added.
He further stated that lower-grade employees have fallen below the poverty line and that economic exploitation of government workers will only hinder national progress. ""We recognize the protesters' democratic right and stand in solidarity with them,"" Khan affirmed.
He condemned the use of tear gas and batons, particularly against women protesters, terming it a reprehensible act. ""Public servants are not enemies - they are poor Pakistanis asking for their rights. The government's violent response is absolutely intolerable.""
Khan called on the provincial government to accept the legitimate demands of the employees and to immediately release those who have been arrested. ""Every citizen has the right to peaceful protest. It should never be suppressed through force,"" he concluded.

"Glastonbury should drop Kneecap, says UK PM","US
Irish trio stays defiant after support for Palestine
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday said it was not ""appropriate"" for Irish group Kneecap to perform at Glastonbury, one of the country's biggest and most famous music festivals, reported AFP.
Asked in an interview by The Sun tabloid whether the Irish rap trio should perform at the iconic festival next week, Starmer responded: ""No, I don't, and I think we need to come down really clearly on this.
""This is about the threats that shouldn't be made. I won't say too much because there's a court case on, but I don't think that's appropriate,"" he added.
Kneecap has made headlines with their outspoken pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel stance, with one of their members charged with a ""terror"" offence for allegedly supporting Hezbollah.
Last Wednesday, Liam O'Hanna, known by his stage name Mo Chara, appeared in court accused of displaying a Hezbollah flag while saying ""Up Hamas, Up Hezbollah"" at a concert that took place in London last year.
The Iran-backed Lebanese force Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas are banned in the UK, and it is an offence to show support for them.
Glastonbury festival, attracting hundreds of thousands of music fans from around the world, is set to take place in at Worthy Farm in southeast England next week starting June 25.
Kneecap is due to perform on Saturday June 28 on the West Holts Stage.
The government had previously called on the organisers of Glastonbury festival to ""think carefully"" about the band's planned appearance there.
The group has been pulled from a slew of summer gigs since, including a Scottish festival appearance and various performances in Germany.
During their performances, rapping in Irish and English, Kneecap often lead chants of ""Free, free Palestine"" and display the Palestinian flag.
The group apologised this year after a 2023 video emerged appearing to show one singer calling for the death of British Conservative MPs.
But they deny the terrorism charge and say the video featuring the flag has been taken out of context.
O'Hanna, Liam Og O Hannaidh in Gaelic, who has been granted unconditional bail, told London's Wide Awake Festival in May the charge was an attempt to ""silence us"".
The group, which shot to fame with their biting, provocative song lyrics and an award-winning docu-fiction based on them, slammed it as ""political policing"" and ""a carnival of distraction"".

Syria makes arrests after Church attack,"US
.
Syrian authorities on Monday announced arrests over a suicide blast targeting a church blamed on the Islamic State group, as President Ahmed al-Sharaa vowed those involved in the ""heinous"" attack would face justice.
The shooting and suicide bombing Sunday at the Saint Elias church in the working-class Dwelaa district of the Syrian capital killed 25 people and wounded 63, the health ministry said.
The interior ministry reported the arrest of ""a number of criminals involved in the attack"" and the seizure of explosive devices and a booby-trapped motorcycle during a security operation near Damascus ""against cells affiliated with the Daesh (IS) terrorist group"".
The announcement came hours after Sharaa vowed authorities would ""work night and day, mobilising all our specialised security agencies, to capture all those who participated in and planned this heinous crime and bring them to justice"".
The attack follows incidents of sectarian violence in recent months, with security one of the greatest challenges for the new authorities.

Simmering Punjab braces for monsoon,"US
Authorities halt new excavation projects in Lahore
With areas across Punjab gripped by oppressive heat and humidity, weather authorities have forecast the onset of the monsoon season in the province from June 29.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department forecast widespread rain and thunderstorms over several days, offering long-awaited respite after weeks of intense weather.
In Lahore, the temperature hovered around 37°C on Monday, with humidity levels reaching 75 per cent. Wind recorded at just 6km/h provided little relief from the stifling conditions.
While the chance of rain in the provincial capital remains low over the next two days, officials expect monsoon showers to begin late this week, particularly affecting upper and central Punjab, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujrat, and the Pothohar region.
According to the latest weather advisory, pre-monsoon activity has already brought light to moderate showers to some parts of the province, with Lahore Airport recording 37mm of rain in the last 24 hours. Areas such as Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Hafizabad, and Sialkot also received scattered rainfall.
In preparation for the anticipated rains, the provincial authorities have halted all new excavation projects in Lahore and expedited monsoon readiness measures.
Housing Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal inspected various sites, including Saggian, Shahdara, and the under-construction rainwater storage tanks near the Punjab Assembly. These tanks are intended to capture and reuse valuable rainwater, a step officials say will help address urban flooding and water management challenges.
During his site visits, Mengal expressed dissatisfaction over the absence of safety signage and public information in ongoing construction areas. He ordered the immediate installation of warning boards and reinforcement of safety protocols to protect citizens.
""The safety of lives is paramount. No new digging should occur until ongoing works are secured and completed,"" he stated.
Officials emphasised that the underground tanks, once operational, will serve as a key tool in conserving rainwater and reducing pressure on the drainage system. The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) and the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) are coordinating with district administrations to accelerate work ahead of the rains.
However, meteorologists urged the public to adopt heat-safety precautions and minimise exposure during peak sunlight hours. Despite the imminent rains, the coming days will remain hot and humid, with maximum temperatures in cities like Bahawalpur, Multan, and Sahiwal expected to stay above 40°C.

SHC demands appearance over frozen accounts case
The Sindh High Court's (SHC) constitutional bench on Monday issued a show-cause notice to the investigating officer (IO) for failing to submit a response in a case regarding the freezing of former president Dr Arif Alvi's bank accounts.
A constitutional bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, expressed displeasure over the IO's repeated absence and directed the officer to appear at the next hearing on June 25 and explain the delay.
The court adjourned proceedings until June 25, issuing a show-cause notice for non-compliance.
The bench was hearing a petition filed against the freezing of bank accounts belonging to the former president. At the previous hearing, the court had allowed the withdrawal of up to Rs1 million from the frozen account for meeting daily expenses.
Representing Dr Alvi, Barrister Ali Tahir argued that the bank accounts of the former president, his wife and their children had all been frozen.
""Based on an inquiry, the FIA froze the entire family's bank accounts,"" Tahir said, adding that the action had severely impacted their ability to meet day-to-day expenses.
He further informed the court that the family had learned of an ongoing inquiry into alleged money laundering, but had not been provided any formal documentation regarding the case.
""These inquiries appear to be politically motivated,"" the counsel said. ""The former president is being punished for his political affiliations.""
Barrister Ali Tahir also told the court that the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had issued undated letters to private banks ordering the freeze under Section 25 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010, and Section 5 of the FIA Act 1974.

Swati skips NAB in Rs40b case,"US
Senator evades graft probe into Kohistan mega scandal
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) senior leader Senator Azam Swati failed to appear before the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) in connection with the Rs40 billion Kohistan mega corruption scandal, despite being served a notice. Instead, his legal counsel appeared on his behalf.
According to NAB sources, Swati's lawyer was instructed that the senator must appear in person. The lawyer requested a week's extension, but NAB refused the request and instructed Swati to appear without delay. A second notice will soon be issued, NAB confirmed.
The initial notice required Azam Swati to appear on Monday as part of an inquiry into suspicious financial transactions linked to the Kohistan corruption case. NAB alleges that Rs300 million were transferred into Azam Swati's personal bank account, raising serious concerns about financial irregularities.
NAB is investigating the Kohistan scandal following revelations of widespread corruption amounting to Rs40 billion. The bureau has directed Swati to submit the financial records of Kohistan Associates and Builders, including detailed bank account information.
It is worth noting that billions of rupees were reportedly deposited into the company's accounts during the year 2024. The scandal came to light earlier this year, prompting the provincial government to formally request an NAB investigation. Subsequently, a cabinet-level inquiry committee, headed by the chief minister, was also formed to oversee the case.
It may be mentioned here that last month the K-P government launched an investigation into the mega corruption scandal in Kohistan district, where an estimated Rs40 billion has allegedly been siphoned off from the provincial treasury.
The scandal came under intense scrutiny during a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), chaired by Speaker of the K-P Assembly, Babar Saleem Swati.
Officials from the Finance Department and the Accountant General's office admitted during the session that billions had been misappropriated from government funds.
While an official embezzlement figure of Rs24 billion has been confirmed so far, PAC members expressed dissatisfaction with the explanations provided by Secretary Finance and the Accountant General.

EU seeks Gaza progress,"US
Finds Israel in breach of cooperation deal
The EU said on Monday that Israel must improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or else face possible consequences, after a review of a cooperation deal found it fell short of its human-rights obligations.
The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc hopes to use a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement to pressure Israel to ease suffering in the Palestinian territory and allow more aid into the strip.
""We will contact Israel to present our findings and look at how we can improve the situation on the ground,"" Kallas told a press conference after presenting the review's findings at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.
""If the situation does not improve, then we can discuss further measures"", she said, adding this would happen in July.
The bloc last month launched an audit of the EU-Israel deal, which forms the basis for trade ties, under one of its articles calling for respect of human rights.
It marked a milestone of sorts, given the EU has long struggled to have an impact on the Mideast conflict due to longstanding divisions between countries that back Israel and those seen as more pro-Palestinian.
The review found Israel's conduct in Gaza ran afoul of its obligations.
The text seen by AFP cited Israel's blockade of humanitarian aid, the high number of civilian casualties, and the massive population displacements among possible rights violations.
""Our main concern is humanitarian aid distribution,"" Kallas told reporters. ""We see the humanitarian aid behind the borders, but it doesn't reach the people.""
What action Brussels might take if things do not improve is not clear, as the war in Iran has moved the goalposts and pushed some nations to voice renewed support for Israel.
Some countries would like to suspend the EU-Israel accord outright but that would require unanimity among member states -- something diplomats have said is virtually impossible.

Garbage tax to be collected from July,"US
Homes, businesses in rural, urban areas to be charged
The Punjab government will begin collecting 'garbage tax' from urban and rural areas across the province from July 1 under the 'Suthra Punjab' project.
According to sources, the local bodies have started formulating their strategies to collect the service charges to ensure the project's success. The Punjab Cabinet Standing Committee on Finance and Development has already approved the tax collection plan.
After coming into power, the provincial government had initiated the Suthra Punjab project to provide sanitation and waste management facilities with an initial budget of Rs200 billion.
The local bodies and waste management companies purchased machinery and started door-to-door garbage collection in several districts, including Lahore.
However, the facilities have not been fully provided to residents across Punjab due to delays in starting the work by local governments and waste management companies.
Since the Punjab government had set a timeline for the project, with tax collection scheduled to begin from July, instructions have been issued to the local bodies and waste management companies to complete all arrangements for garbage tax recovery by July 1, for which work has begun.
The new tax will be imposed on small and large businesses, as well as residential areas, both urban and rural, across Punjab.
However, residents of all informal settlements in Lahore and other parts of the province will be exempt from the levy.
For residential rural areas, monthly garbage tax of Rs200 will be collected from houses measuring two to five marla. For houses measuring 10 marla or more, the tax would be Rs400. Small businesses of rural areas will be taxed Rs300, medium-sized businesses Rs700 and large enterprises, factories and industries Rs1,000 per month.
The rate is higher for urban areas, where a house measuring up to 5 marla would be taxed Rs300 and houses measuring five to 10 marla Rs500 per month. Houses measuring 10 marla to one kanal would be taxed Rs1,000, one to two kanal Rs2,000, and larger residences Rs5,000 per month.
In commercial areas across Punjab, a tax of Rs500 will be collected from shops. Medium-sized businesses will be charged Rs1,000, while factories, industries and large businesses will pay Rs3,000 per month.
According to Local Government Secretary Mian Shakeel Ahmad, the garbage collection services are part of the Suthra Punjab project initiated on the instructions of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif. Under the project, sanitation facilities have been provided to rural areas on the same lines as cities.
Door-to-door garbage collection is also under way, and service charges will be collected from residents and commercial establishments across Punjab from July 1. All relevant authorities have been issued instructions in this regard, the official said.
Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) Chief Executive Officer Sahibdin Babar said an excellent sanitation system had been launched in the division. Along with sanitation, door-to-door garbage collection is also under way, and the waste is being taken to dumping points.
From July 1, the service charges will be collected from residents and commercial businesses for these facilities, he said, adding that the charges would be collected by the LWMC.

Iran walks the talk,"US
Attacks US base in Qatar in retaliation for strikes on nuclear sites
  Considers suspending cooperation with IAEA  T
Iran announced it had launched missiles at a major US base in Qatar on Monday in retaliation for American strikes on key nuclear facilities, with explosions ringing out in Doha and projectiles seen streaking overhead.
Qatar, which lies 190 kilometres (120 miles) south of Iran and is home to the largest US military facility in the Middle East, said its ""air defences successfully intercepted a missile attack targeting Al Udeid Air Base"".
President Donald Trump dismissed Iran's retaliatory strikes that targeted a US base in Qatar as ""very weak,"" while welcoming ""early notice"" given by Tehran.
""Iran has officially responded to our Obliteration of their Nuclear Facilities with a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered,"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, after multiple missiles were launched toward the Al Udeid base in Qatar.
""I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured,"" he added.
The US president called for Iran to seek peace with Israel, saying he did not expect further retaliation from Tehran against the United States after its attack on an American base.
Iran has ""gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,"" he said.
""Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same,"" Trump added.
Iran's National Security Council confirmed having targeted the base ""in response to the US aggressive and insolent action against Iran's nuclear sites and facilities"".
In its statement, the council said the number of missiles used ""was the same as the number of bombs that the US had used"", in a signal that it had calibrated its response to be directly proportional.
After more than a week of Israeli strikes on nuclear and military targets across Iran, the United States joined its ally's campaign on Sunday, carrying out attacks on three key Iranian nuclear facilities, including on an underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo using massive bunker-busting bombs.
With international concern mounting that Israel's campaign in Iran could lead to regional spilloverconcern that only intensified after the US strikesFrench President Emmanuel Macron said after the Iranian retaliation that ""the spiral of chaos must end"".
Iran's security council maintained that its ""action does not pose any threat to our friendly and brotherly country, Qatar"".
But Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed Al-Ansari said his country ""reserves the right to respond directly in a manner proportional to the nature and scale of this blatant aggression"".
Its much larger neighbour Saudi Arabia, historically a rival of Iran, condemned Tehran's attack ""in the strongest terms"", and offered ""all its capabilities to support the sisterly State of Qatar in any measures it takes"".
AFP reporters heard blasts in central Doha and in Lusail, north of the capital, on Monday evening, and saw projectiles moving across the night sky.
A US defence official said Al Udeid was ""attacked by short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles originating from Iran"", adding there were no immediate reports of casualties.
Ansari said the base had been evacuated as a precaution ahead of time.
Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps said six missiles had hit the base, according to state media.
Iranian official press agency IRNA had reported that missiles were also launched at a US base in Iraq, though the National Security Council made no mention of Iraq in its statement.
Iraqi security and military sources told AFP that Iran had not attacked US bases there ""so far"".
Earlier in the day Qatar had announced the temporary closure of its airspace in light of ""developments in the region"", while foreign embassies there including that of the United States had warned their citizens to shelter in place.
Neighbouring Bahrain and Kuwait also temporarily halted air traffic in the wake of the missile attack.
President Donald Trump boasted that Sunday's strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities, but other officials said it was too soon to assess the impact on Iran's atomic programme.
Just as Iran was announcing the new attacks, blasts were heard in the north of Tehran, according to an AFP journalist, who reported yellow flashes typical of Iranian air defences in the sky over the capital shortly before 9:00 pm (1730 GMT).
Earlier in the day Israel reported carrying out what it said were its most powerful strikes yet on Tehran.
Iran, in turn, fired missile barrages at Israel.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military hit sites in Tehran including Evin prison, which Katz said ""holds political prisoners and regime opponents"", as well as command centres for the domestic Basij paramilitary and the Revolutionary Guards.
Iranian media and the Israeli military said Israel also struck Fordo on Monday ""in order to obstruct access routes"" to the site.
Israel's national electricity company reported ""damage near a strategic infrastructure facility"" in the south that disrupted the power supply, without naming the location or specifying the cause.
The country's military censorship rules bar the publication of some details about damage in Israel.
Iranian media, meanwhile, said Israel's strikes hit a power supply system in Tehran, triggering temporary outages.
Israeli strikes on Iran have killed more than 400 people, Iran's health ministry has said. Iran's attacks on Israel have killed 24 people, according to official figures.
China urged both Iran and Israel to prevent the conflict from spilling over, warning of potential economic fallout.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to help deter Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint for one-fifth of the world's oil supply.
After the Pentagon stressed the goal of US intervention was not to topple the Iranian government, Trump openly toyed with the idea.
""If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.
His press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday that Trump was ""still interested and engaging in"" diplomacy.
She suggested, however, that Iranians could overthrow their government if it did not agree to a diplomatic solution.
Top US general Dan Caine has said early assessments indicated the US strikes caused ""extremely severe damage"" at all three nuclear sites.
Rafael Grossi, director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council that it had not been possible to assess the underground damage at Fordo.
""Armed attacks on nuclear facilities should never take place,"" he added.
Iran has consistently denied seeking an atomic bomb, and Grossi has said there was no evidence to suggest it was doing so despite the Islamic republic being the only non-nuclear armed state to enrich uranium to 60 percent.
Meanwhile, Tehran is considering suspending its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the speaker of Iran's parliament said Monday.
In parliament, ""we are seeking to pass a bill to suspend Iran's cooperation with the IAEA"", speaker Mohammad-Bagher Ghalibaf said on X, accusing the UN's nuclear watchdog of lacking objectivity and professionalism. The IAEA in June adopted a resolution condemning Tehran's failure to cooperate with the agency with regard to its nuclear programme.

"Pant, Rahul put India in command against Eng","US
Pant is first Indian player to score twin tons in a Test in Eng
Rishabh Pant became the first Indian to score twin centuries in Test in England and helped the touring side move into a strong position on 298-4 at tea on day four of the first test at Headingley on Monday.
Resuming the day on 90-2, with a lead of 96 runs, India captain Shubman Gill, who made his highest test score in the first innings, chopped onto his stumps to fall for eight, a second wicket for Brydon Carse. England sensed an opportunity having dragged themselves back into the test on Sunday, but Pant's partnership with KL Rahul swung momentum back in India's favour.
The normally box office Pant started his innings quite conservatively, happy to watch on as Rahul moved smoothly to his century, his ninth in tests. After smashing two sixes in three balls after lunch, however, Pant hit the accelerator and brought out his typically flamboyant shots to all corners of the ground, with his hundred meaning, for the first time, there have been five Indian centuries scored in one test match.
Pant eventually tried one shot too many, caught chasing another six on the boundary by Zak Crawley for 118, but the damage had been done in a 195-run fourth wicket stand, with Rahul still unbeaten on 120 at tea.
Bumrah says 'fate' behind Brook's exit for 99
'He fancies his game and plays aggressive style of cricket'
Leeds
India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah suggested ""fate"" had played a part in England batsman Harry Brook's dismissal for 99 on his Headingley home ground on Sunday as an already gripping first Test took another intriguing twist.
The dynamic Brook slammed Prasidh Krishna for six in the first over of Sunday's play and advanced down the pitch to drive Bumrah, the world's top-ranked Test bowler, through the covers for a sensational four.But on the verge of his ninth century in 26 Tests, but only second on home soil, the 26-year-old pulled Krishna to Shardul Thakur in the deep.
Well though Brook batted, he also had several lucky breaks. He had yet to get off the mark when he was caught off a miscued hook against Bumrah in the last over of Saturday's play, only for technology to reveal the India spearhead had bowled a no-ball that spared the England rising star from being out for a duck.
""I think fate had decided on 99 for him, because he got dropped a few times after (the no-ball) as well,"" Bumrah told reporters after stumps. ""But that is not to take away from him. He assessed the conditions well, he fancies his game and plays an aggressive style of cricket. He makes you think he can play an aggressive shot but he can shut up shop as well.
""Full credit, he played really well and we'll try to have better plans in the next innings,"" added the 31-year-old
Ollie Pope, out for 106 early on Sunday after resuming on exactly 100 not out, said Brook was disappointed in becoming the 14th England batsman to be dismissed for 99 in a Test.
""He was pretty gutted to get out,"" said England vice-captain Pope. ""I think he'd either like to keep it down or hit it for six next time. He was as frustrated as anyone to get out but he plays that shot pretty well.
""It was an unbelievable knock. Even the pull shot he hit in the first over of the day, I was like 'where did that come from?' Everyone knows what a fantastic player Harry is and to be able to put a guy like Jasprit Bumrah off his pace a little bit with a shot like that early on shows the confidence he has in his game.""

PMD forecasts first monsoon showers tomorrow,"FR
The department advised the farmers to manage their agricultural activities considering the rain forecast
The monsoon season this year is set to begin on Wednesday (tomorrow) bringing rain to various regions of the country, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast on Monday, warning of potential flash floods, urban inundation, landslides, and other rain-related hazards.
The weather department said that a strong westerly wave was expected to approach the northern regions on June 25 (tomorrow) and might gain significance by June 26, resulting in heavy rainfall activity across most provinces and territories.
At present, according to the PMD, moist currents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal had already begun to penetrate the upper and central parts of Pakistan and were likely to intensify over the next couple of days.
As a result, the PMD said, rain accompanied by wind and thunderstorms with scattered heavy, and at times very heavy, falls was expected from the evening or night of June 24 until July 2 with occasional gaps in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) and Punjab.
The first monsoon showers in AJK were expected in Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber and Mirpur. Similarly, G-B districts such as Diamir, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, and Shigar might receive rain from June 26-29.
in northern Punjab, moderate to heavy rainfall with wind and thunderstorms would be expected in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Murree, Galliyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Lahore, Sialkot, Sahiwal, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Okara, Khushab, Sargodha, and Mianwali from June 25 to July 1 with intermittent gaps.
In South Punjab, the PMD stated, areas including Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Dera Ghazi Khan, Multan, Khanewal, Lodhran, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur, Rahim Yar Khan, and Layyah were expected to receive rain between June 26 and June 28.
In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), widespread rain with wind and thunderstorm is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Malakand, Bajaur, Shangla, Battagram, Buner, Kohat, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Mohmand, Khyber, Waziristan, Orakzai, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Peshawar, Mardan, Hangu, and Kurram from June 25 to July 1 with occasional gaps.
Balochistan will also receive rainfall during this spell, particularly in its north-eastern and southern districts including Sherani, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibbi, Barkhan, Naseerabad, Kalat, Lasbella, Khuzdar, Awaran, Jaffarabad, Dera Bugti, and Kohlu from the night of June 25 till June 28.
In Sindh, rainfall with wind and thunderstorms was expected in upper and south-eastern districts including Sukkur, Larkana, Jacobabad, Khairpur, Kashmore, Hyderabad, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Thatta, Badin, and Karachi from June 25 to June 28 with brief gaps.
""The heavy to very heavy rains may trigger flash floods in local streams and nullahs particularly in Murree, Galliyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan, northeast Punjab, and Kashmir between June 26 and July 1,"" the PMD said.
""The downpours may also cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Nowshera, and Peshawar during the same period, while similar conditions could affect Hyderabad and Karachi between June 26 and June 28,"" it added.
The PMD warned that heavy rainfall combined with windstorms and lightning could disrupt daily life and cause damage to weak structures such as Kacha houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles, and solar panels.
It added that the continuous wet spell could pose the risk of landslides that might result in road closures in vulnerable hilly areas of K-P, Murree, Galliyat, Kashmir, and G-B. The department advised the farmers to manage their agricultural activities considering the rain forecast.
""Tourists and travellers are urged to plan their journeys carefully to avoid any untoward incidents during the period of intense weather activity. Authorities concerned have been directed to remain on high alert and take necessary measures to safeguard life and property,"" the PMD said.

Bangladesh detains ex-election chief,"US
Commission probing into Hasina-era abuses warns 'impunity' remains
A Bangladesh court on Monday remanded in custody the former elections chief for his alleged role in rigging the vote in favour of now-ousted autocrat Sheikh Hasina.
KM Nurul Huda, 77, was ordered to be detained for four days while questioning continues, a day after a mob who smashed into his home and assaulted him eventually handed him to the police.
On Sunday, the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) filed a case against Huda and other former election commissioners it accuses of rigging past polls in favour of Hasina, whose 15 years in power ended in an-masse uprising in August 2024.
Hours after the case was filed, a mob stormed Huda's home in Dhaka, and dragged him onto the street. They put a garland of shoes around his neck and beat him up before handing him over to the police.
The interim government condemned the incident and urged people not to take the law into their own hands.
""Swooping on an accused and physically assaulting him is illegal, contrary to the rule of law, and a criminal offence,"" the statement read.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus has said elections will be held in early April 2026 -- the first in the South Asian nation of around 170 million people since the student-led revolt ousted Hasina.
Police put a helmet on Huda while taking him to the court for his protection.
Human rights organisations also condemned the attack on Huda. ""It was a complete violation of... the rule of law,"" Abu Ahmed Faijul Kabir from the rights group Ain O Salish Kendra said in a statement.
Meanwhile, a government-appointed commission investigating hundreds of disappearances by the security forces under ousted premier Sheikh Hasina on Monday warned that the same ""culture of impunity"" continues.
The Commission of Inquiry into Enforced Disappearances is probing abuses during the rule of Hasina, whose government was accused of widespread human rights abuses.
That includes the extrajudicial killing of hundreds of political opponents and the unlawful abduction and disappearance of hundreds more.
""Enforced disappearances in Bangladesh were not isolated acts of wrongdoing, but the result of a politicised institutional machinery that condoned, normalised, and often rewarded such crimes,"" the commission said, in a section of a report released by the interim government on Monday. ""Alarmingly, this culture of impunity continues even after the regime change on August 5, 2024"".

PPP leaders' bail extended till July 12,"US
PPP Central Secretary General Humayun Khan condemns attack on Iran
Additional District and Sessions Judge Peshawar, Ismatullah Wazir, has extended the interim bail of Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Central Secretary General Humayun Khan and PPP Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa President Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha until July 12. The two leaders are accused in a case related to a protest on Khyber Road and the alleged torching of a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protest camp.
During the hearing, the petitioners' counsel, Advocate Gohar Rehman Khattak, appeared before the court and argued that his clients belong to a political party and were booked for staging a peaceful protest against the provincial government. He stated that protesting is a constitutional right, and his clients were exercising this right when the police responded with baton charges and tear gas, followed by criminal charges.
The court, after hearing arguments, extended their interim bail and adjourned the proceedings until July 12.
Speaking to the media after the hearing, PPP Central Secretary General Humayun Khan said, ""We have been vindicated in past cases and will be again. FIRs were registered against us during the 'Save the Province' movement. The PPP will continue to raise its voice against this exploitative system on every platform.""
He strongly condemned the recent US attack on Iran, expressing solidarity with the Iranian people. ""PPP stands with the people of Iran. We will continue to play our role in safeguarding the rights of the people in this province.""
He criticized PTI for its ""politics of revenge"" and said, ""We have faced their political victimization before and will do so again. We are not afraid of these fabricated cases and will not abandon our struggle for public rights.""
Humayun Khan also paid tribute to PPP leaders and workers for maintaining peace despite the provincial government's ""brutal crackdown"" during the 'Save the Province' protest. ""PPP workers have always raised their voice against oppression,"" he added.

Refineries warn of 'catastrophic effect',"RO
Advisory body says new levies on furnace oil will raise operation cost, cause hefty losses
Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) Chairman Adil Khattak has cautioned the government that the imposition of carbon and petroleum levies would have a catastrophic effect on refineries.
These refineries use furnace oil in-house as fuel in furnaces, boilers, power generation and other operations. ""Applicability of the proposed carbon and petroleum levies on furnace oil being used in their own processes will result in a phenomenal increase in operation cost, which will cause heavy losses and the closure of refineries,"" he told The Express Tribune. He warned that the two levies would raise furnace oil prices by more than 80%, sounding the death knell for a few industries including refineries, shipping and independent power producers (IPPs), which use it as a fuel or consume it in their own utilities' operations.
""Is it disconnect between power and petroleum mandarins, ignorance of its negative fallout or mischievous intrigue of the import mafia,"" he asked and pinned his hopes on the petroleum minister.
Under the International Monetary Fund's Resilience and Sustainability Facility, the government is expected to impose both carbon levy and petroleum levy on furnace oil from July 1, 2025 to curb excessive fossil fuel consumption and gather additional funds for green energy programmes. This is for the first time the government will impose Rs79.5 per litre in levies on furnace oil including Rs77 worth of petroleum levy and Rs2.5 in carbon levy. This will inflate the price of furnace oil by Rs85,000 per ton (57%) to around Rs235,000 and may impact its demand.
If international crude oil prices stay above $75 per barrel during the remaining days of the ongoing month, the furnace oil price, after adding the proposed levies, may go up by 67% to Rs250,000 per ton.
The government may collect revenue of Rs75 billion on estimated consumption of around 0.9 million tons (950 million litres) of furnace oil during the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25 compared to 1.2 million tons in the previous year.
Over the last three years (FY23-25), Pakistan's furnace oil consumption has dipped sharply by an average of 40% per annum. Interestingly, 10 years ago, the furnace oil demand was around 9.2 million tons as the power sector was a major consumer since furnace oil-based electricity had a share of around 35% in total power generation. Of late, coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG) have substituted furnace oil, which now has a share of only 1.5% in electricity production. Local refineries produce around 2.5 million tons of furnace oil, of which 1.5 million tons are exported annually.
""We believe that the industry will continue to use furnace oil as an emergency fuel while gradually shifting towards renewable sources of electricity generation. We do not expect a major impact on listed firms as most of the companies have already shifted to coal and solar-based power generation,"" Sherman Securities said in a report.
The decline in furnace oil sales may not impact oil marketing companies (OMCs) as the fuel's share in total revenue is negligible. However, this is ""negative"" for refineries, where furnace oil comprises around 24% of production mix, it said.
""It is anticipated that refineries will now focus on exporting surplus quantity of furnace oil as local consumption will further dry down; otherwise they will be compelled to reduce refinery throughput or temporarily shut down production units, which will negatively affect their earnings.""
Similarly, if surplus quantity is exported, their gross revenue margins (GRMs) may be affected as furnace oil usually sells at a discount in the export market. Assuming current industry GRMs of $10 per barrel, every $5 per barrel discount on exports will dent GRMs by 12%.
However, the impact varies on a company-to-company basis (considering the production mix) and depends on availability of the buyer in export markets. For north-based refineries, including Attock Refinery, the cost of export will be higher, hurting their earnings.

Pindi braces for monsoon flooding,"PK
Authorities issue evacuation notices for 285 century-old buildings amid collapse risk
With the onset of the pre-monsoon season, the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), Rawalpindi District Council, cantonment boards, and the Evacuee Trust Property Board have issued final red noticessome for the second timeordering the evacuation of 285 multi-storey buildings across the district that are over 100 years old and prone to leaking during rainfall.
Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema has imposed a ban on dumping garbage, building material, and other waste into the 22-km-long Nullah Leh and 15 stormwater drains.
Station House Officers (SHOs) of area police stations have been directed to register cases against violators.
Following directives from the district administration, residents of low-lying areas along Nullah Leh have started moving valuablesjewelry, refrigerators, sofas, and other household itemsto safer locations.
Some families have already begun temporary relocation.
To deal with potential flooding, the Civil Defence Department, District Administration, and the 111 Brigade have decided to conduct joint full-dress rehearsals next week.
These drills will be carried out in low-lying areas near Rawal Dam, including Nadeem Colony and Javed Colony, and will involve Civil Defence, police, and Rescue 1122.
The Meteorological Department's forecast for pre-monsoon rains next week has caused concern among residents living near the stormwater channels.
Fifteen temporary Civil Defence warden posts have been activated in these areas.
Every year, heavy rains during the monsoon and pre-monsoon seasons cause widespread destruction in Rawalpindi, affecting about 70 per cent of the city's population and commercial areas.
The municipal corporation and the Evacuee Trust Property Board have ordered the evacuation and repair of all dilapidated historical buildingsdating back to British and Hindu erasin the inner city.
According to the chief officer of the municipal corporation, strict notices have been issued to tenants and owners of these buildings due to the risk of collapse during rainfall.
The Evacuee Trust Property Board has also served evacuation noticeseffective until June 30to tenants of both commercial and domestic properties in Raja Bazaar, Sarafa Bazaar, Purana Qila, Bagh Sardaran, Dingi Khoi, Shah Chan Chiragh, Banni Mohalla, Jhanda Mohalla, Jamia Masjid Road, Moti Bazaar, and Trunk Bazaar.
These properties, once owned by Hindus and Sikhs, are structurally unsound and overdue for repairs. The district council has warned building owners that structures not vacated will be demolished.
Three tenants have challenged the notices in court. The court has issued notices to the district council and the chief officer of the municipal corporation to submit responses.
District Civil Defence Officer Talib Hussain confirmed preparations are complete for the full-dress rehearsal in Javed Colony and Nadeem Colony.
The flood season in Rawalpindi has been officially declared from July 1 to September 15.

Who do we grieve for?,"US
.
For a long time, I had believed that most people actually care about others, particularly the loss of civilian lives; and what was often stopping them from expressing that concern, or doing something about it, was information. That is, they were more likely to take action - small as it may be - if they knew what was going on. During the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, as thousands were killed and millions got cholera in a man-made epidemic, I kept telling myself that it was lack of awareness that was stopping us from showing actual support, though there were early troubling signs suggesting that my hypothesis was not true. I came up with a complicated, though quite weak, argument for myself, when the local champions of Muslim unity looked the other way when Afghan refugees were harassed. Eventually, the list of 'exceptions' got so long that my theory collapsed on its own.
Within the recent past, conflicts in the Middle East, North Africa, Ukraine and, more recently, in the Persian Gulf has taken the lives of thousands of innocent civilians - men, women and children - who just happened to live in a particular place and have had no role in shaping the policies of their governments. While ample information continues to come through to us, we are loud about the pain of some civilians, and silent on others.
For me, my evolution has been shaped by personal experiences. Within the last two years, I have interacted with colleagues and friends who are deeply troubled by the rising issues of hate and Islamophobia in many sectors of society, both within the US and elsewhere. Issues of racism and hate, against any group, deserve full attention. Yet, I learned that just underneath that surface of broad statements of care, the concern of my friends and colleagues is exclusive for only specific communities facing hate, and not others who may also be facing similar, perhaps identical, issues of bigotry and racism. Even when faced with strong evidence, a complicated algorithm involving ethnicities, sects and geographies dictates our reaction. This apathy or deliberate silence manifests itself both among the loud champions of human rights on the left, and those who associate with more conservative positions on the right.
My evolution was fast-tracked in the last couple of weeks, as dozens, perhaps hundreds of civilians lost their lives in Iran. One does not need to endorse the policies of the Iranian government, or agree with the politics of any country for that matter, to empathise with the grief of parents, children, family members and friends who have lost a loved one. But complete or near complete silence from those on the left who have historically spoken for causes of human rights, freedom and human dignity and have protested loudly for marginalised communities, is quite telling. Some voices that have come forward are rooted in anti-war rhetoric (which is important), or regional stability, but falling short of caring for the bereaved. Equally troubling is the position of my colleagues in communities of faith. Over the weekend, I spoke to a religious scholar, who I have gotten to know quite well in the last decade and who has often spoken about the causes of justice. In the past he has prayed for people in Yemen, Syria, Gaza, Kashmir and as far as Congo. He has been completely silent about Iranians. When I asked for his stance, it was a complicated set of mental gymnastics on why he has not spoken about the grieving families in Iran. A combination of pragmatism, a hint of sectarian preferences, respecting ""feelings"" of some members of congregation from other countries that do not have friendly ties with Iran, and doubts about what 'actually is happening' has stopped him even offering a customary prayer in his sermons. Other faith leaders who are silent may be making a similar calculation.
I still believe that people care - but the numbers in my mind have reserved. Some care about many, many care about a small number. I hope that one day these numbers change, and our hypocrisy trouble us more than it does today.

Hazlewood responds to Johnson's IPL criticism,"US
Ex-pacer blasts Hazlewood for prioritising the League over national duty
Australia fast bowler Josh Hazlewood has addressed Mitchell Johnson's sharp criticism regarding his decision to prioritise the Indian Premier League (IPL) over national duties in the lead-up to the World Test Championship (WTC) Final.
Following Australia's crushing defeat to South Africa in the WTC Final at Lord's, former pacer Mitchell Johnson had slammed Hazlewood for choosing to participate in the IPL 2025 with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, which concluded on June 3just over a week before the final.
Hazlewood's underwhelming performance, where he managed to claim only two wickets, further fueled Johnson's critique.
Writing in The West Australian, Johnson remarked, ""We've seen concerns about Hazlewood's fitness in recent years, and his decision to prioritise returning to the delayed Indian Premier League over his national team preparations raised eyebrows.""
In response, the right-arm pacer defended his choice during a conversation with the Sydney Morning Herald ahead of the upcoming Test series against the West Indies, stating that the IPL offered the most suitable preparation for high-level cricket.
""I haven't seen any of that, to be honest,"" Hazlewood said when asked about Johnson's comments.
""We know what's going on inside our rooms. It seemed far and away the best place to get ready for any type of cricket that was coming up. The weather was definitely a factor as well. Just getting over there and playing intense competition like that, it's hard to replicate in training,"" he added.
Hazlewood explained that training conditions in Australia at the time were far from ideal due to persistent rain.
""Sydney, it was raining and I had literally nowhere to bowl. I got to Brisbane for three or four days and it was very wet. We were lucky to get on. I just thought the best place to bowl was India,"" he said.
""We were still in the competition, we were going to play semis, and I was going to be there for 10 days. I think it was comfortably the best option,"" he concluded.

Rs28.8tr debt spending bill tabled,"US
Despite lower interest costs, key institutions get double-digit budget hikes
The government on Monday laid a Rs28.8 trillion compulsory expenses bill before the National Assembly for the next fiscal year, which is about 17% lower than this year due to a reduction in interest rates, but key state organs received double-digit increases in their budgets.
The Presidency, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the Senate, the Federal Ombudsman Secretariat for Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace, and the Federal Tax Ombudsman would get substantially higher budgets for the fiscal year 202526 compared to this year, according to the charged expenditure statement.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb laid before the National Assembly a compulsory expenditure bill of Rs28.8 trillion to meet the expenses on debt servicing and the requirements of the President of Pakistan, Supreme Court of Pakistan, the National Assembly, the Senate, and other state organs.
Under the Constitution, these expenses are considered charged expenditures on which the National Assembly does not have the right to vote. The details show that while the cost of debt has reduced due to falling interest rates, the state organs still received significantly higher budgets, except for the National Assembly.
Around Rs1 trillion has been sought to meet the obligatory expenditures of the National Assembly, the Senate, the Election Commission of Pakistan, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the President of Pakistan, the Islamabad High Court, the Federal Tax Ombudsman, Pakistan Post Office, Federal Ombudsman Secretariat for Protection against Harassment of Women, and the Foreign Office.
An amount of Rs27.8 trillion has been sought for Pakistan's debt repayment requirements and interest costs, according to a summary of the spending bill presented by the government before the National Assembly, seeking its endorsement.
The financing needs for repaying maturing debt, interest costs, and funding the next fiscal year's budget deficit have reduced after the central bank cut the interest rates from 22% to 11%, providing some relief to the government and taxpayers.
The government's preference to borrow through long-term debt instruments has also helped reduce domestic debt repayments for the next fiscal year. However, the foreign debt repayments have significantly increased, particularly the short-term debt.
The Pakistani government does not repay principal loans from its budget but instead contracts more debt to repay maturing loans. This is also a reason why debt-related expenditures are significantly higher compared to the Rs17.6 trillion size of the next fiscal year's budget.
The amount of Rs27.8 trillion sought for the repayment of principal loans and debt servicing is lower by Rs5.9 trillion, or 17.5%, compared to the original budget approved for such expenses in June last year, according to the documents.
This is the second consecutive fiscal year where the cost of borrowings and repayments is lower than the preceding year.
Except for the Rs8.2 trillion cost of interest on debt, which will be part of the federal budget, the rest of the amount will not be booked in the budget and will be directly borrowed from domestic and foreign markets to repay loans obtained in the past by successive governments.
Interest payments on domestic and foreign loans will consume roughly 47% of the proposed budget of Rs17.6 trillion for the next fiscal year. This is also lower than in the outgoing fiscal year.
Compared to the original borrowing plan of Rs19 trillion for the outgoing fiscal year, the government has sought the Assembly's endorsement for Rs14 trillion to repay maturing domestic debt in the next fiscal year. This amount is lower by Rs5 trillion or 26% compared to the original allocation for this fiscal year.
The government has also requested Rs8.2 trillion for domestic debt servicing, which is 17% or Rs1.5 trillion less than the outgoing fiscal year.
To repay foreign loans, the government has sought a record Rs5.4 trillion for the new fiscal year, which will be obtained from foreign lenders. The need for foreign loan repayment is up by 11%, or Rs547 billion.
The government has requested an additional Rs1 trillion to pay interest on foreign loans, which is almost at this year's level. It has asked for Rs200 billion from the National Assembly to repay short-term foreign loans, which is up by 577% or Rs177 billion.
There has also been some reduction in the expenses of the National Assembly, as its budget has been reduced by Rs400 million to Rs6.9 billion for the next fiscal year. The Senate, however, received a 19% jump, and its expenses would increase to a record Rs6.2 billion in the next fiscal year.
For the staff, household, and allowances of the President, the government has requested a record Rs2.7 billion budget, which is 17% or Rs400 million higher than the outgoing fiscal year.
It seems that the country's elite ruling class does not care about the deteriorating economic conditions, which will keep Pakistan under the thumb of the International Monetary Fund for times to come.
The government has requested Rs6.6 billion for charged expenditures of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, which is higher by Rs2.2 billion, or 51%. The Islamabad High Court will receive Rs2.2 billion, higher by Rs280 million, or 15%.
The Election Commission of Pakistan will get Rs9.9 billion in the next fiscal year. The Wafaqi Mohtasib will receive Rs1.6 billion. An amount of Rs604 million has been given to the Federal Tax Ombudsman.

"E.coli can turn plastic into painkillers, chemists discover","US
.
Scientists have found a way to use the bacteria E.Coli to convert plastic waste into a popular painkiller, a study said Monday, though outside experts doubted the technique would make a dent in the fight against plastic pollution.
Paracetamol, which is one of the most commonly used drugs worldwide, is made from the derivatives of fossil fuels, often by Asia-based subcontractors using cheap, polluting methods that contribute to climate change.
The world is also facing an escalating crisis of plastic pollution, with countries set for another bruising round of negotiations in August in the hope of sealing an international treaty to reduce plastic waste.
The British team of researchers behind the new study sought to find a solution to the two problems by roping in a third -- E.coli, which is normally known for making people sick when they eat contaminated food.
First the chemists used a molecule derived from PET plastic, which is used in bottles and many other plastic products the world over, to spark a chemical reaction in a strain of E.coli.
This created a molecule they called PABA, according to the Nature Chemistry study, which was partly funded by drug firm AstraZeneca.
By genetically modifying the bacteria, the chemists were able to transform their molecule into acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol.
""This work demonstrates that PET plastic isn't just waste or a material destined to become more plastic -- it can be transformed by microorganisms into valuable new products, including those with potential for treating disease,"" lead study Stephen Wallace said in a statement.
Singaporean researchers not involved in the study praised how it combined synthetic and biological chemistry.
But ""several practical considerations remain"" to take this idea beyond the proof-of-concept stage, they wrote in a linked commentary in the journal Nature Chemistry.
The chemical reaction produces only a limited amount of PABA molecules, which ""may be insufficient for industrial applications"", they wrote.
Melissa Valliant, communications director of the Beyond Plastics project of Bennington College in the United States, expressed scepticism.
""A new 'plastic-eating bacteria' pops up in the news every few months and has been doing so for years,"" she told AFP.
""These discoveries never scale up to anything significant enough to tackle the massive plastic pollution problem.""
This ""crisis needs to be stopped at the source,"" she added, which means ""companies and policymakers must reduce the amount of plastic being produced and used in the first place"".

Seminar highlights crisis in Sindh's public education sector,"US
The participants demanded that the Sindh University Laar Campus be upgraded
An educational and intellectual seminar was organised in Talhar city under the banner of the Student Action Committee, comprising students and youth from various educational institutions of the area.
The speakers expressed grave concern over the deteriorating state of education in Talhar and Sindh at large. They lamented that despite repeated assurances from government representatives and strong demands from students and civil society, the Sindh government had failed to allocate any funds in the current provincial budget for the establishment of quality educational institutions in Talhar and Badin, or for the construction of the Sindh University Laar Campus in Badin.
They termed this neglect an act of ""hostility towards education."" The speakers criticised the Sindh government and PPP leadership for diverting Sindh's funds to Punjab and other provinces for personal and political gain, depriving the people of Sindh of their constitutional and legal rights.
They highlighted the severe lack of basic facilities in schools - broken buildings, absence of teachers, lack of furniture, and no provision of drinking water or washrooms - while many schools exist only on paper.
The participants declared that spending Sindh's education budget in other provinces was tantamount to plundering the rights of Sindh's people.
They also pointed out that thousands of students from Badin district are deprived of higher education simply because there are no local universities, and their parents cannot afford to send them to cities like Karachi or Hyderabad. They stressed the urgent need for a medical college, agriculture university, law college, and engineering university in Badin.
The participants demanded that the Sindh University Laar Campus be upgraded and expanded to include departments such as medicine, law, engineering, and agriculture.
The seminar drew participation from prominent political, academic, legal, literary, and civil society figures, including Sindh United Party's Central Vice President Jami Chandio, Secretary District Bar Association Badin Advocate Amir Azad Phanwar, Professor Dr. Tufail Chandio, Professor Shabbir Memon, Dr. Muhammad Soomar Khoso, Kabir Bheel, Nasir Baloch, Yaseen Kumbar, Faizan Shafiq Jamali, Asadullah Aisar, Hafeez Khaskheli, Ravi Kumbar, Waqas Charan, Siraj Khatti, Abdullah Thebo, Munir Ahmed, Mazhar Hussain Kehri, and a large number of students, including girls.
At the end of the seminar, outstanding students from various institutions were awarded shields and certificates in recognition of their academic achievements.

Road project under fire for corruption,"US
PTI leader Javed Qureshi strongly opposed the decision to use concrete for the Thandiani road.
Serious concerns have been raised over the ongoing 24-kilometer road construction project in five union councils near Thandiani, where plans to convert the road from blacktop to concrete have sparked widespread criticism.
At a press conference held at Abbottabad Press Club, prominent social activist and former PTI leader Javed Qureshi strongly opposed the decision to use concrete for the Thandiani road. Originally intended to boost tourism, the project is now under scrutiny amid allegations of massive corruption and poor planning.
Qureshi warned that the concrete road could become a ""well of death,"" noting that the region remains snowbound for over five months each year. ""How will vehicles be parked on a concrete road under such conditions? Daily accidents and fatalities are inevitable. Who will be held accountable?"" he questioned.
He also alleged that the project's estimated cost has been inflated from Rs2.5 billion to Rs6.5 billion over the past two years, with the revised budget approved by the provincial cabinet. Qureshi accused influential political figures and elected representatives of remaining silent, effectively turning a blind eye to the issue and enabling the contractor's mismanagement.
The project affects nearly 500,000 local residents. Qureshi further disclosed that the Abbottabad-Thandiani road is part of a larger Rs27 billion development initiative supported by the World Bank. However, he claimed that approximately Rs2.75 billion of the allocated funds are being siphoned off under the pretext of project execution.

Amazon bets on luxury cosmetics,"US
New Prime Day strategy to soften tariff blow
Amazon's defence against tariffs for its coming Prime Day? Luxury goods.
President Donald Trump's tariffs have spurred some Amazon sellers who source products from China and other heavily tariffed countries to bow out of the company's Prime Day, one of its biggest sales events of the year, to protect their margins.
The Seattle-based e-commerce company is hoping that recent sales growth in high-margin cosmetics in its Amazon Premium Beauty category will cushion the impact of tariffs on Prime Day sales revenue and consumer sentiment.
""Beauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers' minds,"" even in hard financial times, said Anna Mayo, vice president of NielsenIQ's Beauty Vertical unit.
Amazon Premium Beauty was initially shunned by luxury cosmetic players who feared the platform would harm their image when it was launched in 2013. But those days are gone. Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including Estee Lauder's Clinique, Olaplex and L'Oreal's Urban Decay.
During last year's Prime Day event, US shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11 per cent year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics.
Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods. This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have ""milder"" discounts of 10 to 17 per cent, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14 to 22 per cent off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights.
That, coupled with the ease of shipping small packages of most products, means that Amazon Premium Beauty merchandise has higher margins than other products sold on Prime Day.
Amazon ""doesn't make a huge margin in most of the categories of stuff that it sells online,"" said Renee Parker, co-founder of consultancy firm Invinci and a former Amazon executive. ""They are making a lot of money on premium beauty products because  (they're) small and expensive, and you can ship a ton of them."" Vitamins and supplements are successful for similar reasons.

Ex-education CEO handed over to police,"US
Probe into over Rs3.6m alleged corruption case expands in scope
Duty Judge Waqar Ahmad Sidhu on Saturday granted a two-day physical remand of former chief executive officer of the Rawalpindi District Education Authority Amanullah Cheena and clerk Arshad Mehmood in a corruption case involving Rs36.58 million.
Both were presented in court following their arrest by the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE).
The court rejected the ACE investigation team's request for a seven-day remand and ordered the suspects to be presented again on June 25 after completion of initial interrogation.
According to the FIR, the accused caused financial loss to the national exchequer through alleged corruption in procurement of furniture, stationery, and IT equipment.
Orders were issued to two companiesM/s Malik Traders and M/s Kamran Enterpriseswho were paid in full, but under-supplied the contracted goods.
Details in the FIR alleged that Rs2.5 million was paid for stationery, Rs2.88 million for furniture, and Rs2.68 million were paid for IT equipment.
The anti-corruption prosecutor claimed Rs1.74 million worth of furniture and Rs1.91 million worth of IT items were not delivered.
Defence lawyers opposed the remand, stating that the supplies were being delivered in phases and no corruption had occurred.
They termed the case politically motivated, claiming that Amanullah Cheena, a Grade-19 officer, was arrested even before the FIR was registered18 hours after his detention.
They argued that instead of physical remand, the accused should be sent to jail on judicial remand, asserting their full cooperation with the investigation.
Meanwhile, the investigation has expanded to include eight other education officials and two presidents of the All Pakistan Clerks Association (APCA), who have been issued summons with a warning of arrest in case of non-compliance.
Those summoned include Deputy Education Officers Muhammad Nabeel Naqvi, Dr Gul Ahmed, and Habibullah; Senior Headmasters Muhammad Asif and Muhammad Sajjad; Admin Officer Muhammad Irfan; Administrator of Government Hudaibiya Education Complex; Legal Officer Kamran Saeed; and APCA Presidents Raja Aftab and Irshad Ahmed.
The issuance of a large number of summons has reportedly caused unrest within the education department, prompting many officials to seek political backing.
According to the ACE team, all summoned officials have refused to testify against Amanullah Cheena or become approvers.

Thailand political crisis deepens,"US
Embattled PM reshuffles cabinet as leaked phone call threatens govt
Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra began a cabinet reshuffle on Monday as a political and judicial crisis sparked by a leaked phone call threatens to sink her government.
The 38-year-old daughter of controversial former PM Thaksin Shinawatra began handing out ministerial posts vacated when her main coalition partner quit last week -- a move that nearly took her government down.
Paetongtarn, in office for less than a year, is hanging on by a thread, and on top of the party horse-trading she now faces a Constitutional Court case that could see her barred from office.
She faced calls to quit or call an election last week as critics accused her of undermining the country and insulting the army during the leaked call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, which focused on a festering border dispute.
The conservative Bhumjaithai party quit the governing coalition led by Paetongtarn's Pheu Thai party over the call, leaving it with a wafer-thin majority.
But the crisis stabilised as other coalition partners said they would stay, and Pheu Thai secretary general Sorawong Thienthong told AFP on Monday that all 10 remaining parties were sticking with the government.
""None of the other parties are pulling out -- the remaining parties are staying united with the government,"" Sorawong said.
""The prime minister has discussed the reshuffle with other political leaders.""
The new cabinet line-up will be finalised by Friday but sources said changes are expected in key positions including the defence ministry as the border row with Cambodia rumbles on.
A long-running dispute over several small stretches of the frontier in northeast Thailand flared into military clashes last month that left one Cambodian soldier dead.

Ombudsman orders food price inspections,"PK
.
Responding to public complaints regarding profiteering, violation of official price lists and sale of substandard food items, the Punjab Ombudsman has ordered inspections and immediate action in various districts to safeguard consumer rights and ensure fair market practices.
On the ombudsman's directives, price control magistrates and Punjab Food Authority officials carried out joint inspections in markets and food outlets, reviewing the quality and pricing of essential items, including chicken, fish, meat, milk, eggs, cooking oil, beverages and fried foods. Several instances of overpricing and the sale of unhygienic and unsafe items were uncovered during the inspections.
As a result, fines exceeding Rs600,000 have been imposed on violators. In addition, numerous hotels and restaurants were penalised for poor hygiene, unsafe food handling and unacceptable environmental conditions.
The authorities took strict action against all outlets found breaching health and safety standards.
A spokesperson for the Punjab Ombudsman's Office said the actions were part of an initiative to ensure the availability of safe, hygienic and fairly priced food.
The ombudsman reiterated a zero-tolerance policy against overpricing, adulteration and negligence, directing the officials concerned that the inspections and enforcement drives continue without interruption.

Experts urge safe meat preservation,"DE
Dr Abdullah bin Khalid recommends various precautionary measures
Health experts have advised citizens to adopt proper meat preservation methods, have the know-how to consume fresh meat to keep their health intact, and avoid risks of saving it from heat and loadshedding.
The ritual of Sunnah Ibrahimi (RA) is performed on Eidul Azha by Muslims as a prerequisite for Hajj each year, which is considered the greatest sacrifice in Islam.
Talking to a private news channel, Associate Professor and Gastroenterologist Dr Abdullah bin Khalid of the Aga Khan University Hospital has recommended that the citizens should consume sacrificial meat in the form of steaming or boiling, not in processed form.
He said that the use of red meat in processed form is not good for humans adding that World Health Organization (WHO) had already declared the consumption of red meat can cause many harmful effects on humans' health and quoted American Heart Disease department estimate that only 350 gram of meat per week can be consumed.
Dr Abdullah recommended different precautionary measures i.e. from cutting of qurbani meat till the process of its cooking such as, 1) the meat should be cleared of all the fats, 2) cook the meat in healthy oils i.e. olive oil that is extra virgin oil, canola oil or sunflower oil etc, 3) red meat should not be cooked on high flame, or till prolonged time as it will decrease its nutritive value adding that he said cooking the meat on high flame may be tasty but would be low in nutrition wise, 4) cook meat on low flame will retain its the nutrition value, 5) use meat with salads and chutnies.
Replying to a question, he said that patients with heart issues, angina, and high cholesterol should use red meat in moderate quantity, adding that we do not advise them not to eat meat anyway.

Wife of the famous Sindh poet Dr Akash Ansari who was allegedly killed by his adopted son on February 15 has filed a plea for bail of the accused.
Haleema Ansari in her plea before the trial court in Hyderabad maintained that she being the wife of the slain poet had no objection to the bail of Shah Lateef Ansari.
According to her, Lateef had been falsely implicated in the murder case by some relatives who took advantage of differences between the father and the son. Ansari, who was 70 years old, was brutally stabbed to death at his residence in Citizen Colony in Hyderabad and his body was set on fire after his death. Lateef had sustained minor burns injuries in the fire incident. He had claimed that he tried to break open his father's room which was engulfed by fire.
The police investigation later revealed that the poet had died due to multiple stab wounds and that the body was burnt later. The police had also claimed that Lateef had confessed to killing Ansari and then setting his room ablaze during initial interrogation.

New 'Dragon' scorches competition again,"US
Reboot outflies zombie sequel '28 Years Later'
How to Train Your Dragon, a live-action reboot of the popular 2010 animated film, set the North American box office ablaze again in its second week, industry estimates showed Sunday.
The family-friendly film from Universal and DreamWorks Animation tells the story of a Viking named Hiccup (Mason Thames) who strikes up a friendship with Toothless the dragon.
Its $37 million haul was enough to beat out Columbia Pictures' zombie sequel 28 Years Later, which took in $30 million despite coming nearly two decades after the last release in the trilogy, 28 Weeks Later.
""This is an excellent opening for the third episode in a horror series,"" said David A Gross of Franchise Entertainment Research.
""The weekend figure is above average for the genre, and pending final numbers it's approximately three times the opening of the last episode.""
Critics' reviews and audience ratings have been strong for the Danny Boyle-directed threequel, which picks up - as the title suggests - more than a generation after the initial outbreak of the Rage Virus.
""The long layoff has had no negative impact; in fact, it's given the sequel time to add a new younger age group to the audience,"" Gross added.
Perhaps the biggest surprise of the weekend was the poor performance of Pixar Animation's Elio, which limped into third place with $21 million in ticket sales, on a $150 million budget.
Gross said that while the tally would be respectable for most animation studios, it was the lowliest theatrical debut in Pixar's history - despite excellent reviews.
Disney's Lilo & Stitch, another live-action remake, added $9.7 million in its fifth week, extending a triumphant run for the film about a Hawaiian girl (Maia Kealoha) and her blue alien friend (Chris Sanders).
The fourth-placed entry has now grossed a whopping $910 million worldwide, according to Exhibitor Relations.
In fifth place - and also in its fifth week - is Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning, the latest, and supposedly final, entry in the hugely successful Tom Cruise spy thriller franchise.
The Paramount film took $6.6 million in North America, pushing it to $540 million worldwide. afp

Victim falls off vehicle at speed breaker
A five-year-old boy sitting on a tractor-trolley fell off and was crushed under its wheels.
The police registered a case and launched a search for the child's relatives.
According to local officials, Allah Maufi, a resident of the 375GB area, had returned to her parents' home with their five-year-old son, Hassan Mahmood, following a domestic dispute.
The driver, Ehsaan Yousaf, took Hassan along with him on the tractor-trolley loaded with wheat on Sunday.
As they approached near Chak 429GB, the tractor passed over a speed breaker. The child lost his balance and fell from the vehicle, following which the rear tyre of the tractor ran over his head.
The critically injured child was rushed to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries during treatment.

Upon hearing the news, dozens of villagers laid the bodies on the main road, blocking traffic and demanding the arrest of the bus driver. Following reports of the roadblock, Iqbal Town police officials arrived at the spot and assured the protesters that the driver would be arrested.
The protesters dispersed after the assurance and the police registered a case against the bus driver who had fled after the accident.
Meanwhile, a restaurant worker committed suicide in Tariqabad by hanging himself following a domestic dispute. The police took the body into custody and began an investigation.
Local police officials said 22-year-old Nasir Saleem, a resident of Tandlianwala, who had been working at the restaurant near Tariqabad Railway Gate on Jhumra Road for the past four years, committed suicide following a bitter argument with his mother.
Initial investigation showed that he had spoken to his mother on the phone the previous day. During the conversation, he had a bitter argument with is mother, due to which he committed suicide at night. The deceased lived in a shop.

Billboards pose risk as storm season nears,"DE
Govt, SBCA, others issued notices on illegal billboards
A constitutional bench of the Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued notices to the Government of Sindh, the Director General of SBCA (Sindh Building Control Authority), and others on a petition filed against the installation of billboards.
The petition, filed by Altaf Shakoor was presented by the petitioner's counsel, Khurram Lakhani Advocate. He argued that despite a clear ruling by the Supreme Court, illegal billboards have been installed throughout the city.
With the monsoon season approaching, these billboards pose a serious threat and could lead to major accidents. In some cases, billboards have even been installed on people's homes without their consent.
Taking notice of the concerns, the bench issued formal notices to the concerned authorities. The court remarked that the petition would be heard in detail immediately after the judicial vacation.
Protection ordered
The SHC has ordered protection for a couple who embraced Islam and married of their own free will. The court heard a petition filed by Zainab and her husband Shabbir, who approached the court against harassment.
The couple's lawyer stated that Zainab willingly converted to Islam and married Shabbir Ahmed by choice. However, her family has been harassing them by lodging complaints at multiple police stations against Shabbir. They are reportedly issuing threats of honour killing (Karo Kari).
The petitioner requested the court to stop the police from registering further cases against them and dismiss the existing complaints.

Pakistan will side with peace and ready to play a constructive role in seeking a diplomatic solution to the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict that now the United States has also become part of, raising the spectre of wider regional war, officials said after a civil-military huddle on Monday.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif convened a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) to discuss the deteriorating situation in the Middle East in the wake of the US abandoning its 45-year-old Iran policy and launching direct strikes on its nuclear sites on Sunday.
Senior cabinet members, military chiefs, including Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and others were in attendance.
The direct involvement of the US in the Israel-Iran war has added new and dangerous dimensions to the already volatile region. It has compounded Pakistan's challenge as it has to walk a tightrope in a war that has direct bearing on the country.
Against this backdrop, the civil and military leadership discussed in detail the current situation and Pakistan's strategy.
Sources familiar with the development said that there was complete unanimity of views in the meeting that Pakistan must first protect its own national interests and pursue the path of diplomacy.
They added that Pakistan, given its close ties with Iran and the recent reset with the US, under the administration of President Donald Trump, had a unique position to broker a deal or facilitate a diplomatic solution.
According to sources, Pakistan would avail every opportunity and leave no stone unturned to prevent further escalation.
An official handout of the meeting stated that the prime minister chaired the NSC meeting to review the evolving regional situation following Israeli aggression against Iran.
The committee strongly condemned Israel's acts of aggression and expressed regret that these military attacks coincided with a constructive negotiation process between Iran and the United States.
""These reckless actions have escalated tensions, threatening to ignite a wider conflict and diminishing the opportunities for dialogue and diplomacy. The NSC reaffirmed Iran's right to self-defence as enshrined in the UN Charter,"" it said.
The committee conveyed condolences to the government and people of Iran on loss of innocent lives and prayed for the recovery of injured.
While reiterating Pakistan's stated position, the NSC expressed grave concern over the potential for further escalation after the attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan on June 22, which violated the resolutions of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), relevant international law, and the UN Charter.
Interestingly, the NSC statement did not explicitly mention the US nor condemn its strikes. However, officials referred to the part of a statement where it said that Pakistan reiterated its ""stated position"" implying that previous condemnation statements issued by the Foreign Office and the prime minister were endorsed by the committee. The officials dismissed the perception there was any change in Pakistan's stance.
The NSC also reaffirmed Pakistan's close engagement with relevant parties and endorsed its readiness to further continue efforts and initiatives aimed at promoting regional peace and stability.
The NSC called on all relevant parties to resolve the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, in line with the UN Charter. The committee underscored the need for adhering to international human rights and humanitarian laws.

Varsity employees demand budget hike,"PK
The leaders demanded increase in the allocation of grants for the public sector universities in Punjab.
The Federation of All Pakistan Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA) has demanded and increase in the budgetary allocations for the varsities in Punjab and criticized the federal government's decision to revoke a 25 per cent tax rebate for researchers and teachers.
Addressing a press conference at Punjab University, leaders of FAPUASA and the PU Academic Staff Association leaders expressed concern over meagre funding for the universities and the revocation of the tax relief.
Former FAPUASA president Dr Amjad Abbas Magsi said that despite being the largest province with the highest number of universities, Punjab government has allocated only Rs18 billion as recurring grant for its 51 universities, while 32 institutions in Sindh have been allocated Rs42 billion.
The leaders demanded increase in the allocation of grants for the public sector universities in Punjab.
They said 75 per cent income tax rebate introduced in 2006 was aimed at promoting research and academic retention. It was reduced to 40% in 2013 and now the government was abolishing it.
They said the rebate was a lifeline for university faculty and researchers who routinely pay out of their pockets for journal publication fees, fieldwork and academic travel. Its abolition will demoralise scholars, reduce research productivity and accelerate the brain drain.
The university employees' leaders said that despite the federal budget growing from Rs5.9 trillion in 2018 to Rs17.5 trillion this year, the grant for higher education has remained frozen at Rs65 billion.

CM terms opposition's uproar 'misconduct',"US
Says although PPP has majority and can pass budget, it still wants to take everyone along
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, concluding the budget debate, termed the opposition's uproar during the Sindh Assembly session as misconduct. He said that assembly rules were not followed during the budget session, the opposition behaved inappropriately and tried to disrupt his budget speech.
He said the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) holds a clear majority in the house and can pass the budget, but they still want to take everyone along.
The CM claimed that Sindh government is providing services to the public in every sector. He said this time 135 members delivered speeches on the budget and more than 42 hours were allocated for debate, which reflects the democratic process.
Comparing development budgets of other provinces, Murad said, Sindh's development budget is 30 per cent of the total, which is more than that of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan.
He revealed that at the beginning of the year, the federal government had promised to give Sindh Rs1.9 trillion, but after budget, this amount was reduced to Rs1.796 trillion, which he termed unfair. He mentioned that Sindh collected taxes at a higher rate than federal government.
Speaking on agriculture, the CM raised objections to federal policies regarding agricultural taxes, saying poor decisions led to the need to import wheat. He said that Sindh has set a target of Rs8 billion from agricultural income tax for the next fiscal year.
He listed several initiatives related to education, health, disability support, autism centres, and youth development centres. He also mentioned projects such as the SICH Child Emergency Network, a new IUT in Larkana, new ambulances, and a fisheries support programme.
Murad announced a 10 to 12 per cent increase in government employees' salaries and an eight per cent increase in pensions. He also declared the abolition of professional and entertainment taxes and tax relief on vehicles.
Refuting media reports that Karachi is being ignored, he highlighted mega projects worth Rs12 billion for the city.
In conclusion, the CM said if God and his party willed, he was ready to remain chief minister for 18 years.
Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi, during his budget speech, strongly criticised the PPP's 17-year rule. He said the increase in party seats was not due to performance but due to other factors, as public issues have worsened instead of being resolved. He called for the cancellation of failed and delayed projects, saying old schemes are a burden on the ADP.
Khurshidi pointed out the lack of basic facilities in Karachi and poor solid waste management. He said Karachi generates revenue, but the city is not given its due share. He also criticised the federal government, stating Sindh's rightful share is being withheld.
He further slammed the government over the water crisis, meager allowances for police personnel, and issues related to K-Electric. Khurshidi said the Karachi mayor has full support of the leadership, yet problems remain unresolved.
The session was adjourned until 11am on Tuesday.

Saiful Malook turns into living fairytale amid light rains,"PK
Govt official says littering with plastic bags mars lake's once-pristine reputation
As pre-monsoon rains gently fall on the majestic slopes of Malika Parbat, the serene Kaghan Valley undergoes a breathtaking transformation. Nestled at 3,224 meters above sea level and framed by snow-draped peaks, Lake Saiful Malook enchants thousands of tourists escaping the searing heat of the plains of the Khyber Pakthunkhwa.
More than just a scenic destination, the lake is steeped in legend and poetry. The rainfall here doesn't merely freshen the airit awakens the spirit. Clouds drift in and out, playing hide and seek with the sun, as wildflowers bloom along the lake's oval shoreline, turning the entire landscape into something out of a storybook.
Named after a Persian prince, Lake Saiful Malook gained widespread fame through the Sufi saint Mian Muhammad Bakhsh's poetic epic, Safarnama Saiful Malook, which tells the tale of the prince's love for the fairy princess Badriul Jamala. The narrative has immortalised the lake in both folklore and national consciousness.
""It's like stepping into a dream,"" said Ehsanullah Khan, a Dubai-based Pakistani businessman visiting the lake for the fourth time. ""I've seen lakes in Switzerland and Canada, but the turquoise waters and mythical charm of Saiful Malook offer a peace unlike anywhere else.""
The lake, spanning 1.06 square miles and fed by glaciers from Malika Parbat, leaves an indelible mark on the hearts of visitors.
Muhammad Ali Syed, General Manager of the KP Culture and Tourism Authority, emphasised the immense potential of Pakistan's lake-strewn north. ""Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is home to over 100 lakes, natural and manmade. From the Karambar Lake in Chitral, the world's 33rd highest, to Mahodand in Swat, we are investing in infrastructure to make these wonders more accessible while ensuring ecological sustainability.""
The growing tourist influx to Saiful Malook and the surrounding lakes has also raised concerns about environmental degradation. Littering, particularly with plastic bags and packaging, has marred the lake's once-pristine reputation.""Saiful Malook is the identity of Pakistan. Seeing garbage here is heartbreaking,"" said Ehsanullah Khan. He urged authorities to enforce strict waste management and parking regulations.
In response, the Kaghan Development Authority, with support from the Wildlife Department and District Administration, has rolled out a comprehensive project under the Saiful Malook National Park initiative. According to Divisional Wildlife Officer Salahuddin Khan, the lake area, spanning over 12,000 acres, will soon feature a dedicated parking facility, cleaner access routes, and permanent wildlife management offices under the KP Protected Areas Initiative.
""Saiful Malook has now been brought under the National Parks Act of 1975,"" said Salahuddin. ""This is a major step in preserving its alpine ecosystem and the unique flora and fauna of the region. I came with my family to celebrate my brother's birthday at Saiful Malook, where we enjoyed colourful boat rides in its lake, said Sundas Khayam, a lecturer at Peshawar, while talking to APP.
She said the hide and seek between clouds and sunlight, with chances of rain, impressed her the most. The KP government's broader tourism strategy includes developing four Integrated Tourism Zones (ITZs) in Mankiyal, Thandyani, Ganol, and Madaklasht with World Bank assistance.

Eco-anxiety: Gen-Z facing climatic havoc,"US
.
Imagine a blazing sunny afternoon - the kind that wraps the city in a deceptive calm. You've just finished your final exam, shared a celebratory lunch with friends and are driving back, relaxed and relieved. Suddenly, a deafening burst shatters the peace, as if your rear tyre has exploded. The moment you saw the tyre at the back, it's perfectly intact. But what follows is something far more terrifying. The sound grows louder, harsher - like bullets pounding relentlessly on metal. It isn't gunfire. It is hail - violent, unforgiving and fast - crashing down like a wrathful sky.
You find yourself trapped in your car with no shelter in sight, staring helplessly as tennis ball-sized hailstones batter your windshield, crack your windows and crush everything in sight. The chaos outside mirrors, the panic within. This wasn't an isolated incident. In the past few weeks, we've faced freak weather events, disrupting daily life and exposing the cracks in our infrastructure and climate preparedness.
Pakistan is currently battling a dual climate crisis - soaring heatwaves and sudden, destructive storms. In recent weeks, unprecedented hailstorms and thunderstorms have battered regions across the nation, especially in April and May of 2025. These storms, far from seasonal norms, struck with rare intensity, bringing hailstones the size of golf balls to the heart of Islamabad, causing widespread damage to university zones, vehicles, buildings and infrastructure. The latest storm in Islamabad and Rawalpindi led to a rain emergency, while across Punjab, 18 people were tragically killed and nearly 100 injured. These events aren't mere weather oddities - they are warning signs that Pakistan is entering a dangerous new climate era.
For a generation already burdened by economic uncertainty and political instability, the climate crisis is no longer a distant. Gen Z - Pakistan's largest and most vocal youth demographic - bore the brunt of the damage. They are asking critical questions: Why is climate resilience not integrated into urban planning? Why are early warning systems underfunded? And why is climate education still optional in schools and universities?
What makes this moment even more urgent is Pakistan's geopolitical vulnerability as a lower riparian state. The suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty by India amid escalating tensions has amplified the sense of uncertainty. Climate change is now intersecting with water politics, creating a complex web of insecurity. When upstream water control is politicised and climate unpredictability escalates, the effects cascade downstream - impacting agriculture, drinking water and livelihoods. In a country where more than 60% of the population depends directly or indirectly on water-intensive agriculture, this is not just an environmental issue; it's an existential one.
The recent climatic chaos - whether in the form of brutal hailstorms, suffocating heatwaves or flooding urban streets - is not just an environmental issue but a deeply personal one for Gen Z. Pakistan's youth now find themselves grappling with eco-anxiety, a growing psychological stress rooted in environmental decline.
Despite being on the frontline of this climate emergency, Gen Z is not staying silent. This generation is hyper-connected, mobilising through platforms like Twitter, Instagram and TikTok to share real-time updates, raise awareness and demand accountability. What's emerging is a powerful digital climate-conscious movement - one that's informed, organised and relentless. Gen Z is no longer waiting for permission; they are building solutions, calling out institutional failure and aligning with global climate justice movements. However, this momentum must be matched with structural change.
Pakistan urgently needs to invest in climate-resilient urban planning, enforce early-warning systems, integrate environmental education at all academic levels and, most importantly, give youth a seat at the policy table. Gen Z must be seen not as mere victims of the climate crisis, but as architects of the solution. Their activism, innovation and voice are vital for crafting a future that doesn't just survive climate shocks but grows stronger through them.

NA panel suggests free Cambridge resits,"US
.
The National Assembly's Subcommittee on Education has recommended that students affected by the Cambridge paper leak be given the option to resit the compromised exams during the October/November 2025 session without having to pay any additional fee.
The recommendation came following a meeting between the subcommittee and Cambridge International Education on Monday, where Cambridge officials shared additional details about their internal investigation into the leak of three exam papers in Pakistan.
After reviewing Cambridge's findings, the subcommittee issued a statement, stating that affected students should be allowed a free retake, should they choose to sit the exam again.
The committee noted that students must be given this right to safeguard both their confidence and academic future.
Earlier, Cambridge had proposed awarding full marks for the compromised questions as a remedial measure, an approach that intended to benefit a majority of candidates.
However, the parliamentary panel maintained that students who remain concerned or wish to improve their performance should be granted an opportunity to resit the exams. The committee acknowledged that Cambridge's investigation was transparent and credible, but called for a solution that ensures fairness and reassurance for all students.
""While the full marks policy will benefit most students, those who feel anxious or want to improve their results should also have the option of a free resit,"" the committee stated.
Country Director of Cambridge Assessment International Education Uzma Yousuf welcomed the move, saying that the organisation was committed to upholding global educational standards for Pakistani students.
""Our mission is to prepare students across Pakistan to meet international academic standards. We were pleased to clarify our processes in today's meeting with the subcommittee,"" she said.

PA speaker cautions opposition over 'chaos',"US
Opposition accuses govt of financial mismanagement
Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan on Sunday warned the Opposition against disrupting the House proceedings, cautioning that continued disorder could lead to constitutional consequences.
Speaking during the fourth day of the general discussion on the provincial budget for the fiscal year 202526, Speaker Khan reminded lawmakers that assembly rules prohibit interrupting proceedings or displaying placards during the session.
""No member is allowed to speak or argue without the Speaker's permission, and protest slogans or signage inside the House are also barred,"" he said.
While treasury lawmakers continued to laud the budget presented by the provincial government, Opposition members maintained a harsh critique. Leader of the Opposition Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar and PTI's Farhat Abbas cited the Auditor General's report, which, according to them, highlighted irregularities worth Rs1 trillion across various departments.
Abbas demanded strict action against those responsible for financial mismanagement.
On the treasury side, Law Minister Malik Sohaib Ahmed Bherth and Local Government Minister Zeeshan Rafique defended the budget, citing large-scale development projects.
Minister Bherth announced plans to establish new ring roads and expressways, adding that 12,000 kilometres of roads had already been constructed ""with honesty and dedication.""
Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat said the education budget for universities had been increased six-fold, from Rs3 billion in 2024 to Rs18 billion this year.
He added that ten teachers were sent for training to Scotland and 100 more would follow next year.
""This year alone, 83,000 children have been newly enrolled in schools, and we are working to establish more universities,"" he said.

PIA suspends flights to several Gulf destinations,"US
.
Iranian strikes against a US base in Qatar on Monday forced several airlines, including the PIA, to cancel flights to various destinations in the Gulf region because of the closure of airspace.
The PIA said that its flight operation from Pakistan to Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, Dubai were suspended because of the escalating military situation in the Gulf countries. ""Decision to suspend scheduled flights has been taken in light of the escalating military situation in Gulf,"" it said.
The announcement came as Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait announced the closure of their airspaces, following the Iranian missiles strikes, targeting a US base outside Doha in Qatar. These countries feared Iran's retaliation to US strikes on its nuclear sites on Sunday might expand other countries in Gulf.
Bahrain – home to the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet said that it was shutting down its airspace temporarily as a ""precaution"".
""The Civil Aviation Affairs of the Ministry of Transportation and Telecommunications announced the temporary suspension of air navigation in the skies of the Kingdom of Bahrain as a precautionary measure in light of recent regional developments,"" said the official Bahrain News Agency.

Collapse of higher education,"US
.
The quiet shutdown of postgraduate programmes at Karachi University should concern anyone still holding out hope for public education in Pakistan. More than 10 departments, including Criminology, Health and Physical Education, and Islamic Banking, will not be accepting MPhil or PhD students in 2025. The reason is embarrassing: the university no longer has the faculty to teach them.
Earlier, its School of Law had already suspended admissions. One department after the other. Higher education is receding rapidly. There is no shortage of evidence explaining how we got here. Universities have been underfunded for years. Hiring processes are politicised. Promising scholars, many of them trained at public expense, find no jobs or no institutional support upon return. Some leave. Others give up. A growing number never come back at all. In this environment, what incentive remains for academic excellence? Certainly not in the public sector, where research is poorly funded and administrative dysfunction is the norm. Karachi University's case is simply more visible - many smaller universities have been facing similar pressures, just less publicly.
Our policymakers have long treated higher education as a numbers game: more campuses, more enrolment, more degrees. But when institutions are forced to stop producing scholars altogether, the collapse can no longer be hidden behind annual convocation speeches. This is not a loss we can afford to normalise. The federal and provincial governments must treat faculty recruitment and retention as a priority through structural reform. This requires competitive salaries, transparent hiring processes and clearly defined tenure and promotion pathways that reward merit. Returning PhDs should be absorbed into the system through properly funded positions, not left in administrative limbo. Without scholars, there can be no universities. Without universities, there can be no innovation, no critical thinking, no meaningful progress.

Rawalpindi deports over 45 aliens,"US
Afghan national implicated in several cases still in jail to 
face trial
The repatriation of Afghan nationals from Rawalpindi continues, with more than 45 individuals, including the family members and associates of an Afghan national, Wali Jan, deported to Afghanistan.
These individuals were residing illegally at the incarcerated suspect's home in Pakistan.
Wali Jan is currently imprisoned in Adiala Jail and will be deported to Afghanistan upon completion of legal proceedings.
Sources said Wali Jan is involved in several serious criminal cases registered at various police stations in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. These include charges related to terrorism, attempted murder, resistance to law enforcement, aerial firing, and display of weapons on social media.
In the first week of this month, CCD and Mandrah police arrested Wali Jan and his accomplices for brandishing weapons on TikTok.
Authorities recovered three rifles, including Kalashnikov and M4, along with 13 magazines, bullets, and other items. Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Khalid Hamdani stated that promoting weapons is a criminal offense and will not be tolerated.
""No one will be allowed to become a symbol of fear for citizens,"" he asserted.
Following his arrest, Wali Jan was declared a proclaimed offender in a case registered at Sadar Bairooni Police Station.
During the investigation, authorities discovered more Afghan nationals residing illegally at his camp. A joint search operation was conducted by Sadar Division Police in the Mandira area, during which illegal Afghan residents were taken into custody.
Among those detained were two men, 12 women, and 35 children. Wali Jan's own Afghan identification card was found to be expired. Upon confirmation of their illegal status and the suspect's involvement in criminal activities, Rawalpindi police transferred the individuals to a holding camp before completing their deportation via land route under tight security.
A senior police officer confirmed to The Express Tribune that all individuals associated with Wali Jan, totaling over 45, have been repatriated to Afghanistan.
Legal formalities for Wali Jan are ongoing, and he will be deported once the process is completed.

Fragility of diplomatic engagement,"US
.
In his book, Diplomacy, former US Secretary of State Dr Henry Kissinger writes that diplomacy is the ""art of enhancing power."" Further, he states, ""When statesmen want to gain time, they offer to talk."" He believes, ""The bargaining position of the victor always diminishes with time. Whatever is not exacted during the shock of defeat becomes increasingly difficult to attain later.""
Termed the art of negotiations, diplomacy however failed to prevent the recent conflicts - between Israel and Iran war; Russia and Ukraine; and, India and Pakistan.
According to AI ""Diplomatic engagement refers to the practice of actively communicating, negotiating, and building relationships with other nations and their representatives to achieve specific foreign policy goals. This engagement can involve governments, international organisations, and even non-state actors, and it plays a crucial role in maintaining peace, promoting cooperation, and addressing global challenges.""
When US President Donald Trump abruptly left the G-7 summit held in Canada this past week and used highly undiplomatic language threatening Iran of dire consequences for not surrendering unconditionally, it shows how fragile the power of diplomacy is. By rendering support to the Israeli aggression against Iran, the US President adheres to what Jewish state wants: complete destruction of the Iranian nuclear programme and regime change in Tehran. Other G-7 leaders also supported Israel and its attack on Iran. It seems, the West instead of 'peace' wants to promote 'war' diplomacy. But using diplomacy to coerce Iran and relegate before Israel will have adverse implications on global affairs.
The failure of diplomacy led to war as it happened in the case of the US attack on Iraq in January 1991 when the United Nations failed to seek a peaceful solution to the Gulf crisis. 'War diplomacy' cannot work in the case of Iran because it is a country which is resilient and the custodian of an ancient civilisation. Instead of declaring Israel an aggressor because of its highly unjustified attack on Iran launched on June 13, the West, particularly the US, wants the regime in Tehran toppled and Iran's nuclear installations destroyed. Iran has so far faced Israeli attacks and can also cope with the US military intervention. Trump's highly irresponsible threat to Iran to unconditionally surrender is a reflection of war diplomacy. Why didn't he criticise Israel for scuttling the US-Iran nuclear talks scheduled to be held in Oman on June 15?
The US-Israel nexus for regime change in Iran and dismantling of its nuclear installations is well-planned and well-timed. Both the US and Israel know that Russia is bogged down in Ukraine and cannot come for Iran's rescue. Tehran has lost its support in Syria. Hamas and Hezbollah stand neutralised too because of the regime change in Syria. Barring Yemen, no Arab or Muslim country is standing behind Iran in this critical moment. The US-Israeli confidence in targeting Iran also got an impetus because of the domestic political schism and severe economic crisis. The enemies of the Iranian regime believe that in the event of an US-Israeli attack there would be no help from outside, and the Iranian people will rise against the clergy and topple the regime. It may be wishful thinking but one needs to ponder how Mossad penetrated deep into Iran which helped Israel eliminate several Iranian nuclear scientists and generals.
The only power which has come openly against American threats to Iran is China making it clear that Washington cannot succeed in its pursuits. Certainly, despite its overt policy not to get itself involved in armed conflicts, China is capable of helping Iran in confronting a joint US-Israeli attack. Iran is the last bastion of anti-Americanism and its anti-Israeli stance is quite clear. If there is a regime change in Iran, it will mean failure of diplomacy. Like Libya, Syria and Iraq, Iran would be plunged into chaos with adverse regional ramifications.
When there are no rules and principles in international relations and when Israel and the US use rhetoric to justify regime change in Tehran, there is little time for the Iranian regime to act. If the US militarily sides with Israel, will Iran not retaliate by targeting American forces deployed in the Gulf and closing the strategic Strait of Hormuz? Faced with a do or die situation, will Iran not take extreme measures for its survival?
When diplomacy failed and the Iran-US nuclear talks were sabotaged by the Israeli attacks, the G-7 countries, instead of using diplomatic channels to de-escalate the situation, sided with the Jewish state. Iran is not like Iraq under Saddam Hussein or Afghanistan under the Taliban which can be easily occupied by American forces. Any attempt for regime change by subjugating Iran would have devastating implications. An ordinary Iranian would resist a foreign occupation. Furthermore, despite the years of sanctions, Iran has managed to erect a command and control system underground capable of meeting any foreign occupation.
Fragility of diplomatic engagement in contemporary global scene focusing on the Israel-Iran war needs to be examined from three angles.
First, for a long period of time, Iran has favoured diplomatic engagement by reaching a nuclear deal in 2015 under Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with five permanent UNSC members - China, France, Russia, the UK, the US - as well as Germany together with the European Union. Diplomatic engagement worked till 2018, but then the first Trump administration withdrew from the deal and imposed sanctions on Iran. It means diplomatic engagement cannot be a one-way traffic. The US and Israel preferred the use of force over diplomatic engagement.
Second, why was Israel, which has more than 200 nuclear weapons, allowed by the West to carry out an attack on Iran? Diplomacy was used as a tool of hypocrisy by the US and West to deprive Iran of its nuclear capability but allowing Israel to remain as the only nuclear state in the Middle East and go ahead with its genocidal acts against the Palestinians in Gaza and West Bank.
Third, it's not only Israel and the US which violated rules of diplomatic engagement; India also undermined diplomacy when it carried out attacks against Pakistan on May 7. Diplomatic efforts by the US, Russia and Saudi Arabia worked for a ceasefire in the case of Indo-Pak conflict, but there is no such effort as regards the ongoing Iran-Israel war.

Art Basel paints picture of a planet in peril,"PK
Artists explore collapse, memory, and collective hope
This year's Art Basel, the world's top contemporary art fair, paints a portrait of a troubled planet, with works embodying the relentless pursuit of happiness and the fragility of democracies.
The four-day event in the northern Swiss border city of Basel, which closes on Sunday, features more than 280 galleries presenting works by around 4,000 artists.
The monumental works section features an 85-metre-long installation entitled The Voyage - A March To Utopia.
Created by the studio of Dutch artist Joep van Lieshout, it features 80 large sculptures forming a procession of absurd objects, where ""everybody walks in the same direction... on their way to a happy place"", the artist told AFP.
The journey begins with a team of oxen, followed by all means of getting to that better world, including a walking stick, a cart, a toilet on wheels, a wheelchair and a mobile surgical theatre for those struggling to keep up.
Next come objects representing everything the convoy is carrying, followed by sculptures of ghosts symbolising those who didn't make it to the end. It ends with machines set to destroy the road behind them, so that ""there's no going back"", the artist explained.
A stone's throw away, Spanish artist Jaume Plensa presents a work composed of 21 aluminium doors engraved with the articles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948.
Entitled Forgotten Dreams, it invites viewers to contemplate collective aspirations and not forget the horrors of the past.
Vietnam-born Danish artist Danh Vo has installed a huge US flag made from hundreds of logs and 13 steel stars, referencing the first version of the flag from 1777.
Reconstructed at Art Basel, In God We Trust was first created in 2020, during the presidential election campaign between Donald Trump and Joe Biden.
The logs were removed one by one and burned in fireplaces, gradually causing the flag to disappear. The work serves as an allegory of the fragility of US democracy.
Art Basel is above all a commercial event, where artists and galleries come to meet wealthy collectors. But the fair is also very popular with art lovers who come for the simple pleasure of browsing the works on show.
Its Unlimited section brings together monumental pieces intended for museums and major collections.
It includes recent as well as older works, including a performance created in 1991 by Felix Gonzalez-Torres, a US artist from Cuba who died of AIDS in 1996.
Called 'Untitled' (Go-Go Dancing Platform), it features a man dressed in silver shorts dancing on a podium for a few minutes, twice a day. afp

"Diljit, Hania shine together","US
Trailer of 'Sardar Ji 3' has drawn lots of love and hate
The trailer for Sardaar Ji 3 is out, officially marking Hania Aamir's Indian film debut. The film stars Diljit Dosanjh as a ghost hunter called to exorcise a spirit from a haunted UK mansion. Neeru Bajwa and Hania appear as supporting leads, both drawn to Diljit's character in a romantic subplot. The film also has three more Pakistanis in the cast: Nasir Chinyoti, Daniel Khawar & Saleem Albela.
The first two instalments were box office successes and loved for their absurd humour and fantasy-driven plots. This third part, directed by Amar Hundal and produced by White Hill Studios, updates the franchise for a global audience. Filmed largely in London and Birmingham in late 2024, the film leans heavily on overseas locations and diaspora appeal.
Hania was missing from the film's teaser, which focused only on Diljit and Neeru, sparking speculation about the extent of her role. But the full trailer confirms her central presence.
To no one's surprise, the trailer's release has quickly escalated into a political controversy in India. Though the teaser and songs are still available to Indian audiences, the trailer is now geo-blocked, showing the message: ""The uploader has not made this video available in your country.""
India bans Pakistan, again
The ban stems from renewed India-Pakistan tensions following the April terror attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 Indian tourists dead. In response, the Indian government launched a military response, ""Operation Sindoor,"" a move that froze all cultural collaboration with Pakistan. While Pakistan denied any involvement in the attack, Indian authorities proceeded with a hardline stance, launching a series of anti-Pakistan campaigns.
Pakistani forces responded to Operation Sindoor by launching Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, shooting down six Indian fighter jets and attacking major military bases and stockpiles. The clash ended after both parties agreed on a ceasefire.
Amid the political unrest, several Pakistani celebrities spoke out against what they saw as India's rash accusations and escalation of conflict. Among them was Hania, a popular figure in Indian households for her TV series, including Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum, collaborations with Indian fashion designers, and a publicised friendship with rapper Badshah. Her Instagram account was subsequently blocked in India as the entertainment industry began systematically distancing itself from Pakistani talent. This fallout also led to the shelving of Abir Gulaal, the long-awaited film starring Fawad Khan and Vaani Kapoor.
While Hania's involvement in Sardaar Ji 3 remained speculative for a long time, the trailer's confirmation has pushed the film into controversy. According to Hindustan Times, the Central Board of Film Certification has refused to clear the film due to Hania's involvement. Indian film bodies FWICE and AICWA backed the decision, calling it an issue of national sentiment.
Ashoke Pandit, President of the Indian Film and Television Directors' Association, told Hindustan Times, ""We had written a letter to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) earlier, and they refused to give it a certificate. I had seen Hania's tweets as well during the time of Operation Sindoor."" He added that they will also be taking action against Diljit, "" We are going to take action and tell the producers not to work with him. He should be fully boycotted in the country by music labels and the Punjabi film industry. Diljit is a compulsive Pakistani lover.""
The film is now banned from Indian cinemas and will not stream on Indian platforms. It is still set for a June 27 release in international markets, including the UK, Canada, and the Gulf regions.
Internet weighs in
Reactions online have been sharply divided. Some Indian users harshly criticised Diljit for collaborating with a Pakistani actor and demanded he be removed from patriotic roles, like his rumoured casting in Border 2. Diljit has not responded to the backlash. This is a recurring trend among nationalist circles in India, where cultural and creative collaborations with Pakistan are frequently framed as threats to national security. ""After the Pahalgam attack, Diljit Dosanjh neither tweeted nor gave any statement in the media,"" one critic penned on X. ""Why? Because his upcoming film Sardaar Ji 3 features Pakistani actress Hania Aamir and he doesn't want to upset his Pakistani and Khalistani audience.""
Another X user posted, ""Why the surprise seeing a Pakistani actress with Diljit Dosanjh? Indian celebrities are loyal to just one thing - money. Partnering with Pakistanis will get them more popularity and money. With Diljit, we are talking about a guy who wore the flag of Punjab to the Met Gala right after Pahalgam. Of course, he isn't a patriot.""
Joining the horde of critics, one post declared, ""Diljit Dosanjh has a fake personality. He doesn't care about the feelings of Indian people. By taking Hania in his film, he has slapped every Indian.""
However, the criticism is not universal. Supporters flooded the trailer's comments section on the YouTube page and both actors' Instagram accounts with praise and excitement. ""You deserve all the success and the biggest stages! Can't wait to see the magic on the screen,"" wrote one fan under Hania's post. Another comment insisted, ""This is a slap on the faces of all channels uploading false news!"" People also had great praises for the pairing, ""You both look amazing! Can't wait, this is such a breath of fresh air. Lots of love.""
Under Diljit's IG post, an Indian user wrote, ""Oh wow, Hania is finally here! Now, no one better create any drama. Everyone listen up - no one is allowed to say anything to Hania."" Another user joked, ""Releasing overseas? Just send me the document on WhatsApp. I want to watch the full movie, okay!""
YouTube comments echoed cross-border support, ""I don't understand the Indo-Pak politics around this film, it's two Punjabis across the border collaborating on a Punjabi project. Best of luck to Hania and Diljit!"". Another user echoed this, ""Lots of love, from Pakistan. The film will be a super hit, even if it is not released in India. Only Diljit is working on resolving all the hate in this world!""
Pakistani celebrities Mahira Khan, Mehwish Hayat, Anoushey Ashraf and Aiman Khan are among the celebrities sharing their love for Sardar Ji 3 on social media. Zara Noor Abbas wrote on her IG Story, sharing the trailer, ""I am so happy and proud of you, Hania. Our superstar is on her way to Hollywood!"" Yasir Hussain applauded Hania's bravery ""Many actors have done films in Bollywood, but Hania releasing a film in these political conditions is historic!""

'Legislation key to support family planning',"IN
Experts at Pindi moot warn population bomb ticking, threatening development
The gap between Pakistan's economic growth rate and its rapidly increasing population is just one per cent, experts warned during a seminar held in Rawalpindi.
They described the unchecked population boom as a ""blast"" that has already occurred, severely affecting progress in health, education, employment, and overall national prosperity.
Speakers urged the public to become champions of family planning and help the country escape the looming threat of overpopulation.
They also called on lawmakers to introduce effective legislation to support family planning efforts.
Suggestions included offering incentive packages to parents who practice family planning, ensuring better opportunities in health, education, and employment for their children.
The seminar, titled Family Planning Champions, was organised by Greenstar's Challenge Initiative Programme in collaboration with the District Health Authority.
It featured contributions from doctors, civil society members, journalists, and social activists.
Dr Asif Arbab Niazi, Chief Executive of the District Health Authority Rawalpindi, Dr Naveed Akhtar Malik, District Coordinator IRMNCH, Shireen Sukhan from the Population Welfare Department, and Greenstar's Alia were among the key speakers.
A robust Q&A session was also held.
Dr Niazi and Dr Malik stated that family planning champions are true benefactors of the nation. They emphasised that no country can achieve development, security, and prosperitynor access to science, technology, quality healthcare, or educationwithout population control.
Pakistan now ranks second only to Afghanistan in terms of rapid population growth. While its population growth rate stands at 2.5pc, economic growth is at 3.8pc.
In contrast, China's growth rate is just 0.5pc, despite having a significantly larger population.
Speakers stressed the need for awareness alongside access to family planning services. Encouragingly, from June 2022 to May 2025, around 350,000 clients have availed family planning services in 15 districts of Punjab.
The seminar concluded with a consensus on the need to raise voices in legislative assemblies through elected representatives and to push for lawmaking around effective family planning.
It was also proposed that making all contraceptive methods tax-free would encourage broader adoption.

'Depriving people of livelihood will push them to crime',"US
Multi-seater rickshaw owners, drivers announce protest against road ban
Depriving people of livelihood will push them to crime, said All Pakistan Qingqi Rickshaw Welfare Association President Haji Iftikhar.
Ban on multi-seater rickshaws on 20 roads in the city is akin to pushing thousands of people into starvation, said Iftikhar addressing a press conference flanked by the general secretary of the association Haji Aamir at Karachi Press Club on Monday.
The president and general secretary of the association demanded that the notification banning Qingqi rickshaws on 20 roads of Karachi must be withdrawn. Otherwise, they said that sit-in protests will be held across the city.
They said that traffic police are issuing fines even on roads where the ban does not apply. They also mentioned that the notification issued by Commissioner Karachi imposing the ban has been challenged in court.
The city administration is pushing the hardworking Qingqi rickshaw drivers and owners towards agitation, they said, and asked will it take a sit-in and roadblock across the city to make the government hear our views against ban on Qingqi rickshaws.
Iftikhar and Aamir said that the Commissioner Karachi has imposed a ban on Qingqi rickshaws on 20 roads in the city. The ban has further increased the hardships for Qingqi rickshaw drivers amid rising inflation.
They said that protests have been held before as well, but no one paid attention to their complaints or contacted them. They also mentioned that they had written multiple letters to commissioner and relevant departments regarding the issue, but received no response.
They said that the situation has become so dire that Qingqi rickshaw drivers are now facing starvation at home. The drivers are being subjected to mistreatment by the traffic police, issuing fines even on roads where the ban is not in effect, causing severe distress among the drivers. The association has challenged the Commissioner Karachi's notification, and court hearing is still pending.

Maid who allegedly stole Rs50m over 14 years arrested,"PK
Cars, flat, and cash discovered; son arrested, husband and accomplice still at large
Clifton police arrested a long-serving domestic maid, Shehnaz, who allegedly stole valuables worth Rs50 million, over a period of 14 years, from the home where she was employed. She was arrested following a complaint filed by her employer and the victim, Anusha Jaleel, a resident of Khayaban-e-Tanzeem, Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
Reportedly, Shehnaz had gradually stolen cash, jewellery, and other expensive items from the house without raising suspicion. A search of her home led to the recovery of Rs600,000 in cash, while two of her bank accounts were found to contain Rs3.5 million. It was also revealed during interrogation that the accused owns a luxury vehicle worth Rs6.5 million, along with two other cars and a motorcycle. She also possesses a residential flat in the Gizri area. Police confirmed that all properties and vehicles were purchased using stolen money, with steps initiated to seize these assets.
Further, acting on information revealed by the accused, police arrested her son, Asif, while her husband Mohsin, and an accomplice, a woman named Naseema, are absconding. Search operations have been initiated in Lodhran, Punjab, to locate the absconding accused, with further investigations ongoing.

War on children,"DE
.
The latest UN report citing violence against children in conflict zones paints a harrowing picture of the world we currently live in. According to the report, abuses against children in armed conflict reached ""unprecedented levels"" in 2024, with around 36,000 grave violations verified in just one year. The number of grave violations surged by 25 per cent this year, shattering last year's record which had already marked a 21 per cent rise from the year before. This devastating pattern reveals a sinister truth about our present climate: the global conscience towards innocent lives is also deteriorating at unprecedented levels.
Behind every number is a child from Palestine, Lebanon, Congo, Somalia, Haiti, and many other places from all corners of the world who has been robbed of a normal life - or even a life at all. Children are no longer the collateral of war, but rather deliberate targets as schools and hospitals have been bombed incessantly. Places that were once protected under international law are open targets as the rule of law has now become hollow. The war on Gaza alone has killed over 1,200 children. In Sudan, gender-based violence service providers have verified more than 220 reported cases of child rape, including some as young as one. Haiti has witnessed a gruesome 1,000 per cent rise in sexual violence against children - a tenfold rise from 2023.
The annual report outlines a ""blacklist"" of countries committing these abuses, including Israel for the second time in a row, Haitian gang coalition Viv Ansanm, and Columbian drug cartel Clan del Golfo, among others. But unfortunately, a 'blacklist' alone does little to deter impunity. Unless consequences are enforced onto the violators, merely naming them renders justice performative. International outrage has become cyclical and meaningless, and the children are paying its price.

Residents celebrate transformer installations with 'bhangra',"US
Despite such moments of relief, protests persist.
The residents of Hyderabad are facing prolonged power outages due to the delayed replacement and repair of faulty transformers, turning these devices into unexpected symbols of both frustration and celebration. Frequent transformer failures-often left unrepaired for days-leave entire neighborhoods without electricity and water, particularly unbearable during extreme heat.
When new transformers finally arrive, affected communities celebrate with drums, dancing, garlands, and even cash being thrown in the air as a mark of joy and gratitude to those who helped restore power. Videos of these celebrations have gone viral on social media, sparking widespread commentary.
A notable example occurred in Shah Faisal Colony of Kacha Qila, where residents celebrated the installation of two transformers after a ten-day blackout. Similarly, residents of TMC Hussainabad's UC-140 honored their chairman, Zulfiqar Janwari, with garlands and money for facilitating transformer replacement.
Despite such moments of relief, protests persist. In Phuleli's Kachchi Mohalla, residents-many of them children-blocked roads and burned tires in protest of a ten-day blackout caused by a non-functional transformer. The situation highlights not only systemic inefficiencies in HESCO's response but also the emotional and social toll of chronic power failures on communities.

Stocks slump in panic selling,"US
KSE-100 index plunges 3,856 points as regional conflict sparks sell-off
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) faced a sharp sell-off on Monday as escalating geopolitical tensions rattled investor confidence and triggered panic selling. Mounting fears of retaliation following the US attack on Iran spurred concerns of supply disruptions, inflationary pressure and a downbeat export outlook.
The benchmark KSE-100 index plunged to the intra-day low of 4,135 points, touching 115,887 before trimming some of the losses and settling at 116,167, a plunge of 3,856 points, or 3.21%. It marked one of the steepest single-day declines in recent months.
Analysts warned of continued volatility over unfolding developments in the Middle East, however, they added that global markets were yet to react, despite the fact that they were facing worst-case scenarios with oil, gold and the US dollar index only rising around 1%, 0.25% and 0.6%, respectively.
According to Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp, stocks slumped amid a sell-off in global equities due to escalation in Middle East tensions. Supply disruptions driven by expected retaliation to the US attack on Iran contributed to a weak export outlook and high inflation worries, which played a major role in selling activity at the PSX, he said.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a sharp decrease of 3,855.77 points, or 3.21%, and settled at 116,167.47.
In its review, Topline Securities commented that the PSX experienced a subdued trading session in line with the cautious mood seen across global markets. The KSE-100 index dropped sharply, falling as much as 4,135 points during intra-day trading, before wiping off some of the losses to settle at 116,167, down 3,856 points.
Investor sentiment was dampened by rising geopolitical tensions, especially the intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran, which led to heightened uncertainty and widespread risk aversion. The nervousness triggered broad-based panic selling, it observed. Topline added that major index-heavy stocks, including Engro Holdings, Pakistan Petroleum, Lucky Cement, OGDC and Mari Petroleum, were among the top laggards, dragging the index down by 1,054 points.
In its commentary, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) stated that the week started with strong selling following escalation in the Middle East over the weekend. Only five shares rose while 93 fell, with Engro Holdings (-5.02%), Pakistan Petroleum (-6.3%) and Lucky Cement (-4.02%) being the biggest drags.
Oil prices were being closely watched where a $5-per-barrel increase was estimated to raise Pakistan's annual import bill by $996 million and add nearly 22 basis points to the headline inflation, AHL noted.
The brokerage house observed that the KSE-100 ""is now trading back below 120,000, which will serve as resistance"". Equities would react to news flow from the Middle East, however, it should be noted that global markets had not yet reacted to an extreme situation. Oil prices were up less than 1%, gold was only marginally higher by 0.25% while the dollar index was up 0.6%, AHL pointed out. ""Any diplomatic resolution this week can see risk assets rally sharply.""
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala remarked that the PSX suffered heavy losses amid a sharp sell-off, opening with a steep 2,000-point gap down amid panic selling. The index failed to recover throughout the session, touching the low of 115,887 and eventually closing with a massive loss of 3,856 points at 116,167.
Total traded volume stood at 595 million shares, with top activity in WorldCall Telecom, Sui Southern Gas Company, Pervez Ahmed Consultancy, K-Electric and Kohinoor Spinning Mills, he noted.
The sharp decline reflected heightened fears driven by uncertainty and external pressures. ""We advise investors to remain cautious, focusing on risk management and selective accumulation,"" the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes increased to 595 million shares compared with Friday's tally of 421.6 million. The value of shares traded was Rs23.5 billion. Shares of 468 companies were traded. Of these, 56 stocks closed higher, 386 fell and 26 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 53.3 million shares, falling Rs0.10 to close at Rs1.35. It was followed by Sui Southern Gas Company with 36 million shares, losing Rs4.2 to close at Rs38.8 and Pervez Ahmed Consultancy with 24 million shares, dropping Rs0.12 to close at Rs2.72. Foreign investors bought shares worth Rs162 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

CB issues notice on CSS exemption plea,"PK
Summons federal, provincial education secretaries in a case related to life skills education
A constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Monday issued notice to the federation on a petition filed against induction of officers from armed forces in the civil bureaucracy without any written examination.
A five-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan took up a petition filed through Ali Azeem Afridi.
During the hearing the lawyer contended that civilian candidates desirous of joining the Central Superior Services (CSS) are mandated to sit a written exam as well as an interview. However, officers from armed forces are exempted from the written exam.
When Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, a member of the bench, asked the counsel as to which of his fundamental rights are violated by this provision, he replied that this provision was discriminatory.
The CB issued notice to the federation under Section 3 of the Civil Services Rules, 1956 and adjourned the case for three weeks.
The CSS refers to the elite civil service of Pakistan through which bureaucrats and government officers are recruited to various federal departments and ministries.
Conducted by the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), the purpose of the CSS exam is to recruit officers for the Grade-17 posts in various federal government services. This exam includes written tests of compulsory and optional subjects, psychological assessment and a viva voce or interview.
The bench, while hearing a petition regarding the inclusion of life skills education in schools, summoned the federal and provincial education secretaries.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar remarked that the presence of all secretaries would help develop a joint strategy.
The additional attorney general informed the court that life skills education is already being taught in Islamabad's schools. Justice Mazhar emphasized that all provinces must formulate a policy in coordination with the federal government.
Salman Akram Raja pointed out that Punjab and the federal government have submitted their responses but copies have not been provided to them. The court expressed displeasure over the absence of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's representative.
The court directed that copies of all provincial responses be shared with the petitioner's counsel and adjourned the hearing for an indefinite period.
During the hearing of an appeal related to the appointment of vice-chancellors in universities, Justice Mazhar inquired whether the rector and president of Islamabad's International Islamic University had been appointed.
The lawyer responded that the rector has not been permanently appointed and currently holds an acting charge. The university's lawyer informed the court that the president of the International Islamic University has been appointed but he has not yet taken charge due to being in Saudi Arabia.

The Peshawar High Court has sought a response from the Inspector General of Police in a contempt of court petition filed against the Lakki Marwat Police for sharing derogatory content against a civil judge on its official social media account.
Justice Syed Arshad Ali, who presided over the single-member bench, expressed concern during the hearing, remarking, ""It is not appropriate for such content to be shared from an official police account.""
The hearing took place on Monday, with DPO Bannu and Additional Advocate General Naveed Bashir appearing before the court. The Additional Advocate General informed the court that a written reply had already been submitted on behalf of the DPO.
Justice Arshad Ali questioned the use of social media by the police, asking, ""How are you managing official social media pages and allowing such posts to be shared?""
The DPO Lakki Marwat informed the court that the post had indeed been shared from the official police page and that the responsible officer had since been suspended.
Justice Arshad Ali noted that this was not an isolated incident, adding, ""We have issued a notice to the government regarding such accounts and have demanded an explanation regarding official social media usage.""

Oil falls nearly 4% as Iran retaliates,"US
Brent crude futures were down $2.91, or 3.8%, at $74.09 a barrel by 1713GMT
Oil prices slipped more than $3, or 4%, on Monday after Iran attacked the US military base in Qatar in retaliation for US attacks on its nuclear facilities, and took no action to disrupt oil and gas tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz.
Brent crude futures were down $2.91, or 3.8%, at $74.09 a barrel by 1713GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) eased $2.8, or 3.8%, to $71.06.
US President Donald Trump said he had ""obliterated"" Iran's main nuclear sites in strikes over the weekend. Israel also carried out fresh strikes against Iran on Monday.
At least two supertankers made U-turns near the Strait of Hormuz following US military strikes on Iran, ship tracking data shows.
About a fifth of the global oil supply flows through the strait. However, the risk of a complete shutdown is low, analysts have said. A telegraphed attack on a well-defended US base could be a first step in reducing tensions, provided there are no US casualties, Energy Aspects said in a post.

"Rupee continues to weaken, slips 17 paisa","US
Gold prices ease by Rs300, though global market rises on Mideast conflict
The Pakistani rupee continued its downward trajectory against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Monday, slipping 0.06%. By the close of trading, the local currency settled at 283.87 against the greenback, reflecting a loss of 17 paisa.
On a weekly basis, the rupee also posted a decline, weakening 0.26%, or 74 paisa. It ended the previous week at 283.70 compared to 282.96 in the prior week, as per data released by the State Bank of Pakistan.
Over the past six months, the euro has appreciated 12%, the British pound has strengthened 9% and the US dollar has increased 2% against the rupee, according to Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail.
The rupee has remained under pressure against the dollar in recent months, though it has shown some stability compared to its sharp historical declines. After hitting an all-time low at 307.1 in September 2023, the rupee recovered somewhat, but has faced renewed depreciation pressure in 2025.
Short-term trends show minor fluctuations, with a 0.07% daily fluctuation and a 0.41% monthly decline, suggesting some stabilisation. However, the local currency remains vulnerable due to ongoing economic challenges, including rising inflation, external debt repayments and fluctuating forex reserves.
While recent IMF support has provided temporary relief, a sustained recovery will depend on structural reforms and improved fiscal management to prevent further weakening in the coming months.
""Despite this softening, the rupee's recent movement reflects a more stable and sustainable path,"" noted Sohail.
Unlike the abrupt and destabilising devaluations seen before mid-2023, this depreciation phase has been gradual and market-driven, backed by IMF-supported reforms. Such a controlled adjustment is considered healthier for the economy as it minimises uncertainty, bolsters investor confidence and better aligns with underlying economic fundamentals.
The dollar fell on Monday after Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said that the US central bank should consider rate cuts soon, reversing the dollar's earlier rally following the US bombing of some nuclear sites in Iran, according to Reuters. Meanwhile, gold prices in Pakistan edged lower, diverging from the international market, where rates inched up amid rising Israel-Iran tensions, which offset the impact of a stronger US dollar. Globally, investors remained cautious, closely monitoring Iran's potential response. According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, the price of gold in the local market settled at Rs358,165 per tola, reflecting a slight decrease of Rs300. Meanwhile, the price of 10-gram gold fell Rs257 to close at Rs307,068.
Internationally, gold prices nudged higher as escalating Israel-Iran tensions outweighed pressure from a stronger dollar, with markets closely watching Iran's next move, according to Reuters. Spot gold was up 0.2% at $3,375.79 an ounce as of 1339 GMT. US gold futures gained 0.2% at $3,391.70.

Ten-man Real Madrid show class in Pachuca win,"US
The result leaves Madrid on top of Group H
Real Madrid shrugged off an early red card to defeat Mexico's Pachuca 3-1 and take a big step towards the knockout stage of the Club World Cup on Sunday.
The result leaves Madrid, under new head coach Xabi Alonso, on top of Group H with four points while Pachuca are eliminated after two defeats.
Saudi club Al Hilal, who held Real in their opener, face second-placed Salzburg later on Sunday.
The Spanish giants were in trouble after just seven minutes when Raul Sencio was shown a straight red card after he pulled down Salomon Rondon with the Venezuelan clear on goal.
That left the Liga MX team sensing the chance for an upset in front of 70,248 fans at the home of the NFL's Carolina Panthers.
Pachuca quickly went close when Brazilian Kenedy saw a shot parried out by Thibaut Courtois and the Belgian keeper did brilliantly to deny Alan Bautista's follow up shot.
But Real were able to get a grip on the game in midfield and slow the pace down, limiting opportunities for Pachuca.
It was a superbly worked team goal that provided the breakthrough for Madrid in the 35th minute.
Gonzalo Garcia's clever flick released Fran Garcia down the left and he looked inside to Jude Bellingham who took the ball in his stride and then buried a left-foot shot into the corner.
Pachuca were not disheartened through and Courtois had to be alert again to push away a low drive from the dangerous Kenedy.
But two minutes before the break Real doubled their advantage when Trent Alexander-Arnold drilled a low cross in from the right and Arda Guler collected Gonzalo's deft lay-off and fired home.
Pachuca created a pile of chances after the break, peppering Courtois's goal, but the Belgian was up to the task denying Brazilian substitute John Kennedy and efforts from Rondon and Bryan Gonzalez.
Javier Eduardo Lopez missed the best opportunity for the Mexican side, firing wide after some sloppy defending from Madrid.
The outcome was put beyond doubt in the 70th minute when Federico Valverde slid the ball home after a smart exchange with Brahim Diaz.
Pachuca finally got some reward for their determined effort when Elias Montiel's shot on the turn was deflected off Aurelien Tchouameni and flew past the wrongfooted Courtois.

"Teen bride tortured, murdered at home","US
.
A 17-year-old Afghan bride, identified as Aram Bibi, was found murdered inside her home in the Afghan Basti area. The deceased was a mother to a baby girl, and her body, reportedly, bore signs of severe physical assault.
SHO Gulshan-e-Maymar, Inspector Ghaffar Korai, reported that Aram Bibi's body was discovered just as her family members were quietly preparing for her burial. However, police intervened, halted the burial, and took the body into custody.
Investigators allege that Aram Bibi was killed by her husband Muhammad Afghani, her father Yasin, and other suspects, who beat her mercilessly. Yasin was arrested at the scene, but Afghani, and other accused, remain at large. Inspector Korai reported that the motive behind the killing appears to be a domestic dispute turned deadly.

Yildiz stars as Juve beat Wydad at CWC,"US
The victory put Igor Tudor's side in an excellent position with a final group game to come on
Kenan Yildiz scored two goals and had a hand in another as Juventus beat Wydad Casablanca 4-1 at the Club World Cup on Sunday to close in on a place in the last 16.
The Turkish international forward was unlucky not to be credited with Juve's early opener which went down as an own goal by Abdelmounaim Boutouil.
However, there was no doubt that Yildiz was the scorer of the second with a tremendous strike from outside the box.
Thembinkosi Lorch pulled one back for Wydad before the break, but Yildiz got his second of the afternoon on 69 minutes before a late Dusan Vlahovic penalty sealed the victory for the Italian side.
Having already defeated Emirati side Al Ain 5-0 in their opening match, Juve have scored nine goals and have the maximum six points after two outings in Group G.
Their qualification for the knockout phase will be assured if group rivals Manchester City avoid defeat against Al Ain later.
That puts Igor Tudor's Juve in an excellent position with a final group game to come on Thursday against City in Orlando.
""I'm happy. It was not easy. It was hot, but it was a good win. At the end our quality came out,"" Tudor told broadcaster DAZN, before hailing the performance of Yildiz.
""He has great potential. He has a lot of skills but more important than skills is his brain, that is the key. A wonderful player, so there is a big future in front of him.""
Fast start
Meanwhile Moroccan giants Wydad are eliminated with this defeat following a 2-0 loss at the hands of City in their first outing.
Yildiz, the 20-year-old German-born winger, was among the scorers against Al Ain and he was the star of the show here in front of 31,975 fans at Lincoln Financial Field.
Juve, who finished fourth in Serie A in the campaign just finished, went with an unchanged starting line-up meaning the likes of Vlahovic and Manuel Locatelli began the game on the bench.
Prolific against Al Ain, they wasted no time in putting the team that finished third in the Moroccan league to the sword.
The opening goal came on six minutes as Khephren Thuram teed up Yildiz and his shot beat goalkeeper El Mehdi Benabid with the aid of a slight deflection off Boutouil.
It was 2-0 on 16 minutes via a superb effort, as Andrea Cambiaso went on a piercing run in from the left before laying the ball off for Yildiz to smash in a shot on the half-volley into the top corner.
Wydad quickly pulled one back as veteran Nordin Amrabat's fine pass in behind the defence released South African winger Lorch to control and clip a shot past the goalkeeper.
Yet Juventus were well on top and Cambiaso hit the post just prior to the hour mark before Randal Kolo Muani somehow failed to turn in Lloyd Kelly's ball across the face of goal.
Their third goal did arrive just after the midway point in the second half when France forward Kolo Muani collected possession on the left and then slipped in Yildiz who finished into the corner.
It was his third goal at the tournament so far, and his 12th in all competitions since the season began.
Yildiz had been withdrawn before the fourth goal arrived in stoppage time, substitute Vlahovic stroking in a spot-kick awarded after he had been hauled down by Guilherme Ferreira.
