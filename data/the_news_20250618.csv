Analysis: How much damage has Israel inflicted on Iran’s nuclear programme?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322363-how-much-damage-has-israel-inflicted-on-iran-s-nuclear-programme,"VIENNA: Israel’s strikes on Iran have targeted several of its nuclear facilities as it claims the country is seeking to develop nuclear weapons--an accusation Tehran denies.
Experts told AFP that while the attacks had caused some damage to Iran’s nuclear programme, they are unlikely to have delivered a fatal blow.
Here is an update on Iran’s nuclear sites as of Tuesday.
What is the extent of the damage? - Israel’s operation included strikes on Iran’s underground uranium enrichment sites at Natanz and Fordow, and on its Isfahan nuclear site, the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said, citing Iranian officials.
A key, above-ground component of Iran’s Natanz nuclear site has been destroyed, including its power infrastructure, the IAEA reported Monday.
The UN watchdog added Tuesday that satellite images indicated possible “direct impacts” on the underground section of the plant, where thousands of centrifuges are operating to enrich uranium.
At the underground Fordow enrichment plant, Iran’s second uranium enrichment facility, the IAEA said it observed “no damage” following the attacks.
At the Isfahan nuclear site, however, “four buildings were damaged”—the central chemical laboratory, a uranium conversion plant, the Tehran reactor fuel manufacturing plant, and a metal processing facility under construction, the IAEA said. Significant uranium stockpiles are believed to be stored around the Isfahan site.
Ali Vaez, the International Crisis Group’s Iran project director, told AFP that if Iran managed to transfer significant quantities to “secret facilities,” then “the game is lost for Israel”.
Iran’s only nuclear power plant, the Bushehr plant, was not targeted, nor was the Tehran research reactor.
Can the programme be destroyed? - While “Israel can damage Iran’s nuclear programme... it is unlikely to be able to destroy it,” Vaez said, saying that Israel did not have the massively powerful bombs needed “to destroy the fortified, bunkered facilities in Natanz and Fordow”.
Destroying those would require US military assistance, added Kelsey Davenport, an expert with the Arms Control Association.
She also noted that Israel’s unprecedented attack would not erase the expertise Iran had built up on nuclear weapons, despite killing nine Iranian nuclear scientists.
What are the risks to the Iranian population? - The IAEA has not detected any increase in radiation levels at the affected sites. “There is very little risk that attacks on Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities would result in a harmful radiation release,” Davenport said. But an attack on the Bushehr plant could “have a serious impact on health and the environment”, she said. After Israel launched its strikes, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi said that nuclear facilities “must never be attacked” and that targeting Iranian sites could have “grave consequences for the people of Iran, the region, and beyond”.
Is Iran close to developing a nuclear bomb? - After the United States under President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from a landmark deal that sought to curb Tehran’s nuclear activities, Iran has gradually retreated from some of its obligations, particularly on uranium enrichment.
As of mid-May, the country had an estimated 408.6 kilogrammes (900 pounds) enriched to up to 60 percent—just a short step from the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead.
Iran theoretically has enough near-weapons-grade material, if further refined, for about 10 nuclear bombs, according to the definition by the Vienna-based IAEA. Iran is the only non-nuclear-armed state producing uranium to this level of enrichment, according to the UN nuclear watchdog. While the IAEA has been critical of Iran’s lack of cooperation with the UN body, it says there are “no credible indications of an ongoing, undeclared structured nuclear programme”. Tehran has consistently denied ambitions to develop nuclear warheads.But Davenport warned that the strikes could strengthen factions in Iran advocating for an atomic arsenal. “Israel’s strikes set Iran back technically, but politically the strikes are pushing Iran closer to nuclear weapons,” she said.

Finance Minister Mir Shoaib Nosherwani tabled the budget in the Balochistan Assembly. In his budget speech, the minister said this budget, which was prepared in consultation with all stakeholders, provides a roadmap for sustainable economic development of the province.
The finance minister said the provincial government successfully utilised the entire development budget of the current fiscal year. He further said the government will continue to prioritise sectors such as education, health, law and order and climate resilience.
He said Balochistan will receive Rs801 billion as its share from the divisible pool while the provincial own source revenue was estimated at Rs101 billion, including Rs48 billion from levy on services.

He said the budget preparation was guided by financial realities, the province’s economic capacity, and the urgent need to address inflation and employment challenges. The government has enhanced its revenue target to Rs226 billion for the next fiscal year, he said, adding that the budget is the result of consultation with all political parties.
The finance minister announced a 10 percent salary increase for government employees from grade 1 to 22, while a 7 percent pension raise for retired workers.
In addition, the government proposed a 20 percent disparity reduction allowance for provincial employees from grade 1 to 16.

To address urban security and development, Rs18 billion has been allocated for the installation of Safe City projects in eight more cities, while Rs20 billion will be used to meet public needs at the district level. The government has set aside Rs3 billion each for urban sanitation and the installation of one thousand filtration plants to provide clean drinking water.
A key highlight of the budget is the allocation of Rs25 billion for the construction of Mashkhel Dam in Chagai, aimed at enabling water sales to foreign companies and supporting local industrial zones with solar grids.
In the development sector, the Communication and Works Department received top priority with an allocation of Rs55.2 billion, accounting for 19 percent of the total development budget.

PTI puts off protest drive for two weeks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322365-pti-puts-off-protest-drive-for-two-weeks,"RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan has postponed his protest movement for two weeks in the light of ongoing global developments.  This announcement was made by his sister Noreen Khanum while speaking to the media on Tuesday after meeting the former prime minister at the Adiala jail. She said it was very difficult to obtain permission for the meeting. According to her, Imran Khan is fully aware of the current international situation and believes that global events will inevitably impact Pakistan. “He emphasized that this was a time for all Pakistanis to stand united,” she said, adding that Imran Khan has decided to delay the protest movement for two weeks due to the evolving global scenario. “We are currently waiting for policy statements from the president, the prime minister and the field marshal regarding the situation,” she added and quoted Imran Khan as saying that the federal budget would be passed only after consultation with senior PTI leaders, including Ali Amin Gandapur, Taimur Jhagra, Muzzammil Aslam and Shibli Faraz. “This is a budget for the elite, while the condition of poor is worsening. The salaried class is bearing the entire burden,” she conveyed. Noreen also pointed out that 3.3 million educated Pakistanis left the country over the past three years, taking approximately $30,000 each, resulting in a significant outflow of foreign exchange. She emphasized that the KP budget would be finalized only through consensus.
Meanwhile, Imran Khan’s other sister Uzma Khan commented on the PTI founder’s stance on Israel. “The entire world knows what Imran Khan’s position is regarding Israel. He believes what is happening in Gaza is deeply distressing.” She said Imran Khan has called upon the Pakistani nation to unite during these critical times. Addressing recent political rumours, she clarified that Ali Amin Gandapur has not distanced himself from the protest movement. “Now that these 17-seat holders have come to power, it’s their responsibility to speak up and clarify the nation’s direction,” she concluded.
Meanwhile, the family members of Imran and his wife Bushra Bibi held separate meetings with them at Adiala jail on Tuesday. In a separate meeting, former first lady Bushra Bibi was visited by her sister-in-law Mehr-un-Nisa Ahmed.

Iran will never yield to US pressure: envoy to Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322366-iran-will-never-yield-to-us-pressure-envoy-to-pakistan,"ISLAMABAD: Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri on Tuesday categorically ruled out any possibility of Iran yielding to US pressure, saying that if Americans “tell us to leave Iran, it will never happen.” His remarks came as the US mounted pressure to abandon the nuclear programme and following President Donald Trump’s call for an immediate evacuation of Tehran. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’, Amiri said that since 1989, every American president has delivered similar threats and demands, aiming to drive Iran’s leadership out of power. “But we are still there,” he said.
He was responding to recent remarks made by Trump, who said: “Iran should have signed the deal I told them to sign. What a shame and waste of human life. Simply stated, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. I said it over and over again! Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!” The Iranian ambassador noted that during the Zionist regime’s missile or drone attacks on Tehran, ordinary citizens often go to their rooftops and joke about the situation. “They do not take such actions seriously,” he added.
Recalling a powerful moment from the recent escalation, Amiri noted that when Israeli missiles struck the state broadcaster in Tehran, a prominent anchor, Sehar Emami, was live on air and continued her broadcast despite the building being under attack. “She didn’t leave the burning studio,” he remarked, portraying it as a testament to Iranian resolve.
On the matter of nuclear negotiations, the ambassador reiterated that Iran had already entered a comprehensive agreement in 2015 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the deal during his first term in office.
“Trump refused to honour the previous US administration’s agreement because he believed that ‘America is America only when he is in power’,” Amiri said. He further said that former president Joe Biden did attempt to restore the 2015 nuclear deal, but his efforts failed, largely due to resistance from Israel. “Now Trump is back and demanding a new agreement again,” he added, making it clear that Iran views these repeated calls for renegotiation as disingenuous.

"Senate panel backs move to collect GST from former Fata, Pata",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322367-senate-panel-backs-move-to-collect-gst-from-former-fata-pata,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Finance has unanimously recommended for approval and collection of GST from erstwhile FATA/PATA areas and refrain from backing out at the time of approval of the budget from parliament.
It was interesting to witness that while senators belonging to PTI were staunch supporters of the imposition of 10 percent GST on industrial units located in FATA/PATA areas, in the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance, MNAs belonging to the same party opposed its imposition.
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenues held its meeting under chairmanship of Saleem Mandviwalla here at the Parliament House on Tuesday in which Senator Mohsin Aziz from PTI stated that there were four major beneficiaries of this GST exemption for industries of FATA/PATA and he knew how this exemption was kept intact at the last moment of the previous budget for 2024-25.
He was of the view that the lobbyists were still roaming around the parliament, but let’s make a commitment that the government would not back out of the imposition of this tax. He said a special committee was constituted, which had recommended 12 percent GST for the FATA area, but the government proposed it at a rate of 10 percent GST. “If you are going to drop it again, please do inform us here because I don’t want embarrassment again from those who are well entrenched and connected,” Senator Mohsin Aziz said.
The senators also opposed the FBR’s move to increase the reduced rate of 12.5 percent GST to 18 percent for 850cc vehicles in the budget. The Chairman FBR, Rashid Mehmood Langrial, said that the IMF placed a principle that wherever the reduced GST rate was 5 percent, it would go up to 10 percent, and any rate of over 5 percent would go to the standard rate of 18 percent.
Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that under the direction of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the government would incorporate four major safeguards for allowing arrests on tax frauds to avoid misuse of powers. In the first pre-requisite, the minister said that the accused of tax fraud would be arrested where there was a fear of his escape, but it would be done with the approval of three members of the Board, in Grade 21, notified by the FBR.
The tampering of proof could be the second reason, and the third reason could be tax fraud amounting to Rs50 million. The fourth condition of the arrest, he said, would only be possible if someone received three notices but not bothered to respond. Later, during the NA Standing Committee on Finance held under the chairmanship of Syed Naveed Qamar here, the FBR shared its plan to expand its enforcement plan for bringing 3 million retailers into the tax net. He said that the FBR will extend the Tier-1 retailers regime to large retailers.
The stringent requirements with opportunity of safeguards will be placed, and all those who do not get themselves registered their utilities will be blocked besides freezing of bank accounts, attachment of properties, sealing of premises, and appointment of a receiver.
MNA Nafisa Shah from the PPP stated that the FBR was moving towards measures like martial law and taking very tough measures against businesses. On this, the chairman FBR said that tax matters did not have any relation with martial law, as he served as a civil servant under the democratic regime. He further said that there was a potential to bring one million retailers into the tax net.

"President, PM discuss political, economic situation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322368-president-pm-discuss-political-economic-situation,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called on President Asif Ali Zardari at the Aiwan-e-Sadr on Tuesday and discussed the present political and economic situation in the country.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister for Planning and Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla were also present.
The prime minister briefed the president on his recent visit to the United Arab Emirates and also shared the key features of the federal budget. Zardari emphasized that the federal budget should prioritise the welfare and uplift of the common man, particularly workers and low-income groups.
He underscored that the salaried class, pensioners, labourers and underprivileged segments of society are facing serious challenges, and effective measures must be taken to alleviate their burden.
The president highlighted the need for employment generation and social protection initiatives to support the poor and vulnerable sections of the society.
Meanwhile, chairing a meeting on Pakistan Railways upgradation, the prime minister directed the relevant authorities to link the Reko Diq project with the Pakistan Railways line network by 2028 to meet the requirements of future transportation and cargo services.
He directed to form an inter-ministerial committee to look after the financing matters for the up-gradation and development of Pakistan Railways. The committee will present recommendations with regard to financing required for development of Pakistan Railways and its extension to Reko Diq. During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the up-gradation of ML-1 and ML-3 railway and the overall development of Pakistan Railways to meet the requirements of future transportation and cargo services.
Pakistan Railways is a cheap, fast and environment friendly source of transportation, he said, adding that the mines and mineral sector of Balochistan will develop and new employment opportunities for the people of the area will also be created after linking railways with Reko Diq.

NA body rejects 18% solar panel tax amid IMF pressure,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322369-na-body-rejects-18pc-solar-panel-tax-amid-imf-pressure,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s NA finance committee rejected a controversial proposal to impose an 18 percent sales tax on solar panels, the revenue drive by tax authorities attempting to meet IMF-backed fiscal targets.
The move, which would have generated an estimated Rs20 billion ($71 million), was struck down unanimously during a meeting chaired by MNA Syed Naveed Qamar on Tuesday. “Solar is not a luxury, it’s a necessity,” he said. “We won’t allow taxation that discourages clean energy.”
The decision signals growing political resistance to the stringent fiscal consolidation required under Pakistan’s new $7 billion IMF programme. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, defending the tax push, told lawmakers the government had little room for sector-specific relief. “All subsidies will be phased out,” he said.
FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial defended the proposal, citing massive solar imports of 32,000 MW over the past five years — of which 13,000 MW remain unutilised — and instances of over-invoicing. But, lawmakers from all parties pushed back, with MNA Shahida Akhtar Ali urging the government to “tax sugary drinks instead and spare solar.”
The tax authority also revised its controversial arrest powers for tax fraud suspects, restricting detentions to high-value cases involving over Rs50 million and only if suspects ignore three official notices or risk destroying evidence. This move follows Senate recommendations for checks on arbitrary arrest powers. Critics like MNA Nafisa Shah warned the FBR against overreach, calling for safeguards to prevent abuse. “These are harsh laws,” she said.
Separately, the FBR also unveiled plans to tighten enforcement against unregistered businesses. “We’ll start by blocking their bank accounts. If they still don’t register, we’ll freeze accounts and seal premises,” Langrial warned.
On illicit cigarette sales, he asked for permission to involve local administrations in enforcement, prompting pushback from lawmakers. “This will only fuel bribery,” said Sharmila Faruqi. PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan warned that giving police powers in tax matters would “do more harm than good”.
Committee members urged the FBR to fix its systems first. “Let the framework mature before tightening the noose,” Qamar advised.

FBR eyes Rs65bn from e-commerce tax measures,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322370-fbr-eyes-rs65bn-frome-commerce-tax-measures,"ISLAMABAD: The FBR’s proposed two taxation measures on domestic e-commerce and international platforms flooding their goods in Pakistan will fetch additional revenues of Rs65 billion in the budget 2025-26.
Previously, fees of advance tax on offshore digital services were 10 percent, which have now been proposed to be 15pc. This tax has been proposed on Google and YouTube with the purpose of convincing them to open their offices in Pakistan.
Withdrawal of exemption on import of solar panels and parts with imposition of 18pc GST will yield additional revenues of Rs20 billion. However, PPP is extending full-fledged opposition to block approval of GST on solar panels. If parliament does not grant its assent, the government will have to propose some alternate measures to bring Rs20 billion into the national kitty.
Both income tax and sales tax have been slapped on digital platforms through different means. To tax international e-commerce flooding their goods in Pakistan, FBR proposed Digital Presence Proceeds Tax to fetch Rs39 billion with effect from July 1.
Taxing domestic e-commerce business through both Income Tax and Sales Tax will fetch Rs26 billion into the national kitty.
In the budget 2025-26, FBR slapped additional taxation measures of Rs312 billion. Major revenue spinner is to increase rates of advance tax on rendering of services which will bring an additional Rs70 billion.
Withdrawal of GST exemption on imports and supplies for erstwhile FATA/PATA will fetch an additional Rs30 billion. The FBR’s move to slap increased tax rate on profit on debt will cough up Rs56 billion. The proposal to withdraw exemption on pension will help FBR to collect additional Rs2 billion. Withdrawal of lower GST rate on local motorcars, having engine capacity of 850cc, will bring an additional Rs7 billion in the budget for 2025-26. Increase in tax rates on advance tax on payments to Non Residents will fetch Rs10 billion. Rationalisation of second schedule will bring an additional Rs19 billion.

"Pakistan’s factory output rises 2.3% in April, but 10-month trend still negative",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322371-pakistan-s-factory-output-rises-2-3pc-in-april-but-10-month-trend-still-negative,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s large-scale manufacturing sector expanded by 2.29 per cent in April 2025 compared to the same month last year, according to official data released Tuesday, offering a glimmer of growth even as the broader industrial landscape remains under pressure.
Despite the April uptick, overall LSM output shrank 1.52pc during the July-April period of fiscal year 2024-25, underscoring persistent headwinds across key industries such as food, chemicals, machinery, and iron & steel. Despite the year-on-year growth, the sector posted a month-on-month contraction of 3.2 percent from April 2025. However, manufacturing activity continues to face significant challenges that are impeding broader sectoral growth.
The LSM sector is crucial to Pakistan’s economy, accounting for 67.5 percent of the country’s total manufacturing and contributing 8.0 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP). The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) from multiple sources, including the Oil Companies Advisory Committee (OCAC), Ministry of Industries and Production and provincial bureaus of statistics, compiles the data.
Comparing the April 2025 performance with April 2024, several major industries faced a sharp decline. The iron and steel sector saw a contraction of 1.82pc, machinery and equipment 50.7pc, wearing apparel (garments) 8.55pc and chemicals with 1.3pc, including 10.78 per cent contraction in chemical products output.  Other notable contractions included fabricated metals output that shrank by 0.14pc, furniture 40.3pc and football production squeezed by 41.5pc over the same month of last year.
Textiles output surged by 7.9 percent, automobiles by 60.2pc, leather products increased by 1.8pc, and pharmaceuticals 7.5pc. Cement output also increased by 3.6 percent. Other sectors that reported growth included coke and petroleum products, up by 5.54pc, computer, electronics and optical products by 5.13pc, food 3.47pc, beverages 4.27pc, and sugar by 184pc. Cotton yarn output rose by 8.66 percent, tobacco 9.1pc, fertilizers 5.07pc, and cotton cloth production increased by 0.74 percent.

Senators slam budget over provincial funding concerns,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322372-senators-slam-budget-over-provincial-funding-concerns,"ISLAMABAD: Senators on Tuesday questioned the government’s budget proposal, citing concerns that it may violate the Constitution and laws by denying provinces of their rightful share of resources, since it was presented without a new National Finance Commission award. “Those sitting on the other side (treasury) have been facing criticism for the last 50 years for they make budgets on the dictation of global lenders, leaving nothing for the masses, as the economic independence has been lost,” said Awami National party chief Aimal Wali Khan while taking part in the budget debate.
He asked the Chairman Senate, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, who was the prime minister at that time, as to how many years ago, the 18th Amendment was passed but a new NFC Award was not thrashed out. He also questioned why Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were not being paid gas and net hydel power royalties despite the Centre’s pledge to do so. Likewise, he emphasized Sindh and Punjab should also get their share of resources. He insisted that if Pakistan was to be strengthened, then the federating units must get their rights besides Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan should also be given their constitutional and legal rights.
PMLN’s Saadia Abbasi believed the proposed budget was a non-starter for being anti-poor and anti-business and that it was meant to fulfill the IMF conditionalities and give the global lender full control of Pakistan’s economy and sovereignty. She claimed that the budget has ignored the critical areas of health, education and socio-economic well-being of the people. Empowering FBR with the powers to arrest, she feared, will not only lead to greater corruption but also create conditions that will force people not to engage in business. Rejecting the budget, she requested the prime minister to review the budgetary policies, take into account sentiments of the people and address needs of the people.
PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz said two political parties have ruled the country for over four decades but still have the audacity to hold his party responsible for all that has gone wrong. He wondered who signed the devastating agreements with IPPs, initiated IMF programme, shut down the Pakistan Steel Mills which was in profit since 2008 and ruined PIA.
PTI Senator Aon Abbas Bappi, at the very outset of his speech, urged Chairman Gilani to again issue production orders for his party’s jailed lawmaker Ejaz Chaudhry.
JUI-Fazl Senator Kamran Murtaza pointed out incidents of terrorism in KP and Balochistan and contended that “you may claim everything is fine, but the threat is lurking.” Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi of PPP described the budget as not people-friendly and invited the finance minister to spend a day with labourers. He called for doubling the EOBI pension and devolving its funds to the provinces in line with the Constitution. He also called for enhancing allocations for Karachi.
Senator Bilal Ahmed termed the Rs15 billion allocated for the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway as a joke. The House will now meet again Wednesday morning.

Reserved seats case: SIC asks SC to dismiss ECP review petitions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322373-reserved-seats-case-sic-asks-sc-to-dismiss-ecp-review-petitions,"ISLAMABAD: The Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) Tuesday requested the Supreme Court to dismiss the review petitions filed against its July 12, 2024 judgement in reserved seats case.
An 11-member Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed hearing in the review petitions filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) against the apex court judgement.
Faisal Siddiqui, counsel for the SIC, concluded his arguments in rebuttal requesting the apex court to dismiss the ECP review petition.
Advancing his arguments, he submitted that the case carries constitutional and public importance, arguing that the Peshawar High Court did not have the option to provide complete justice to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), while the Supreme Court had full authority to grant relief and it provided the PTI complete justice under Article 187 of the Constitution.
Justice Mazhar questioned whether relief could be granted without being a party to the case. “Has the Supreme Court ever granted relief to a third party.” The SIC counsel replied affirmatively and cited a precedent from the court’s own decisions.
Justice Mandokhail questioned why the powers of the high court were being downplayed, stating that the court has the authority to include any necessary party.
Faisal Siddiqui contended that the 11 judges granted relief to the PTI, adding that the issue before the court was the will of the people.
Justice Aminuddin, however, noted that the issue is not that simple, adding that the 80 individuals (referring to PTI members) have never denied the absence of SIC.
Siddiqui questioned as to if tomorrow someone takes over the Supreme Court, will it become theirs after 40 years. “Then it seems you are the ones who have taken over these 80 people,” Justice Aminuddin told the counsel, adding that the counsel claimed the ECP and the high court are wrong, asking the counsel as to clarify his own side.
Siddiqui admitted his mistake. Justice Aminuddin said if he has accepted his mistake, he must also face consequences. “Whether the court should do something that doesn’t exist,” Justice Aminuddin asked the counsel to which Siddiqui responded that they are demanding the same thing Fatima Jinnah once demanded.
Justice Aminuddin observed that that no one has refused joining the SIC, but in reality, the party seems to have taken over the PTI. He questioned whether the court should ignore all events and simply grant relief.
Justice Mandokhail, citing the example of Balochistan, said that in disputes between two parties, the land would often turn out to belong to the government, and the courts would rule in favor of the government. He questioned how the court can revoke the independent status of those who have clearly declared themselves independent.
Justice Rizvi summoned ECP officials to the rostrum and asked how many members had submitted affidavits and documents to the commission. He inquired whether 39 members had been notified, to which officials responded that the notifications were issued on court orders.
The SIC counsel argued that the ECP had not issued notifications for the reserved seats. Justice Mandokhail asked whether those seats remained unallocated. The commission’s officials responded that notifications were not issued for the disputed seats.
Siddiqui maintained that the ECP did not implement the Supreme Court’s order. Justice Rizvi asked whether the instructions issued to the PTI in the majority judgement were followed.
Siddiqui submitted that all members had submitted their credentials and party affiliations. “The real question should be why the commission failed to comply with the Supreme Court’s decision.”
Justice Mazhar noted that although the ECP notified 39 members as PTI members, it did not allocate reserved seats accordingly. He asked whether reserved seats were distributed proportionally among these 39 members. The ECP director general (law) said that they couldn’t allocate seats based on that formula as there was a formal method for that.
Justice Mandokhail inquired about the formula while Justice Rizvi asked the ECP official as to why other parties were allocated reserved seats if such a rule exists. Justice Rizvi added that the decision should have been finalised first before allocating any reserved seats. The DG responded that all other political parties were already allocated their reserved seats.
At this, the SIC counsel claimed this was injustice to the PTI and emphasized the sanctity of Supreme Court decisions. He submitted that the issue is not just the case, but the integrity and future of the Supreme Court itself. Therefore, the ECP’s review petitions should be immediately rejected.
Justice Mandokhail remarked that all these are our institutions. “Today I sit here; tomorrow, someone else will.” He asked the counsel as to whether unconstitutional laws or acts must be obeyed. Siddiqui replied that unless declared void, they should be followed. At this, Justice Mandokhail responded saying that then that is exactly what the ECP had done. Meanwhile, the court adjourned further hearing until today (Wednesday).

Maryam satisfied as budget has ‘biggest’ uplift outlay,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322374-maryam-satisfied-as-budget-has-biggest-uplift-outlay,"LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has expressed satisfaction over presenting a tax-free budget with biggest development outlay.
“Neither new taxes were imposed nor their rates increased,” she said while expressing gratitude to Allah Almighty for presenting a tax-free budget with the biggest development program in the history of the province. She said: “We will eliminate the gap between development and facilities in cities and villages. Fruits of development will now reach every village and 1,800 villages will be made model villages. Besides the Lahore Development Program, the Punjab Development Project is also being brought in. Development will no longer see a difference between the rich and the poor. It will be rather equal for all. We have come with a spirit of serving the common man, may Allah Almighty grant us success.”
She said: “We are sincerely trying to fulfill the mission of welfare of the people of Punjab. We will fulfill promises made to farmers. More than Rs129 billion are being allocated for the purpose. Not thousands but millions of farmers will benefit from the Green Tractor Scheme.
Rs15.5 billion are being given for more tractors. The construction and expansion of more than 12,000 kilometers of roads will be a record. The Nawaz Sharif Cancer Hospital and Sargodha’s Nawaz Sharif Institute of Cardiology will be completed this year. The Nawaz Sharif Medical District will be the first centre in Pakistan where all deadly diseases will be treated, and research will also be conducted.”
The chief minister said: “Students will be given meritorious scholarships and laptops. Children will not sit on floor in any school in Punjab. Rs40 billion are being given to provide them with all missing facilities. Layyah and Bhakkar along with other remote districts will be given access to the motorway, besides extending better communication links to Muzaffargarh and Mianwali. We will not let the children of labourers sleep hungry and will give Rs40 billion for their ration cards.”
Maryam Nawaz said in her message on the World Day to Combat Desertification & Drought: “Land is not an inheritance but a trust of future generations, its protection is our first and foremost duty. Cimate change, indiscriminate cutting of trees and water scarcity are rapidly affecting agricultural resources and soil fertility. Drought is not just a name of increasing layers of sand but is a precursor to a serious crisis. The Punjab government is fully aware of every challenge related to the environment.”

SC judge regrets transferred judges called ‘deputationists’ by plaintiffs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322375-sc-judge-regrets-transferred-judges-called-deputationists-by-plaintiffs,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court adjourned until Wednesday (today) hearing into identical petitions challenging the transfer of judges to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) as well as the judges seniority issue.
A five-member constitutional bench of the apex court — headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar — heard the petitions of five IHC judges against the transfer of judges to the high court from other provinces and formation of a new seniority list based on the transfers.
The other members of the bench included Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar and Justice Shakeel Ahmed.
On Tuesday, Hamid Khan, counsel for the Lahore High Court Bar Association and Lahore Bar Association, as well as Faisal Siddiqi, counsel for the Karachi Bar Association and four former presidents of Islamabad High Court Bar Association, completed their arguments.
The court then adjourned the hearing until today (Wednesday) when Idrees Ashraf, counsel for former PTI chairman Imran Khan will commence his arguments, while Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan will argue.
On Tuesday, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar remarked that in their representation, the IHC judges had referred to the incoming judges as “deputationists,” which, he said, was regrettable.
Hamid Khan, representing the Lahore High Court Bar Association and Lahore Bar Association, argued that only the cabinet had the authority to advise on the transfer of judges from one High Court to another. He cited the Mustafa Impex case, asserting that according to that verdict, the “Federal Government” refers to the Federal Cabinet.
Justice Mazhar pointed to Article 48 of the Constitution, noting that it includes the mention of prime minister. He questioned whether Mustafa Impex ruling has nullified the role of the prime minister under Article 48.
Justice Salahuddin Panhwar noted that the IHC chief justice’s decision did not highlight any illegality. Justice Mazhar remarked that since the five judges and petitioners had challenged the decision of the IHC chief justice, they also should have identified the illegal aspects of the decision.
Justice Shakeel said Faisal Siddiqui Advocate will address that point in his rebuttal. After Hamid Khan had completed his arguments, Faisal Siddiqui began his rebuttal, stating that sub-clauses 1 and 2 of Article 200 of the Constitution pertain to the transfer of judges. He further submitted that the matter involved three former chief justices, a prime minister, and the president, so it could not be ignored. He likened the situation to a blind man searching for a hidden hole in a dark room.
Referring to the attorney general’s stance, Siddiqui said if a transfer was temporary, sub-article 2 applies, while for a permanent transfer, sub-article 1 stands alone. He submitted that an appointment is not considered valid until the summary is signed.
Siddiqui further submitted that the attorney general says, ‘we won’t write it; you should just understand.’ “But only God knows what’s in someone’s heart,” Siddiqui said, adding that Article 194 is key to this case; when a judge is transferred, he/she must take a new oath.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned as to what happens to the judge’s previous service upon taking a new oath and further inquired whether the judge then becomes junior.
Siddiqui replied that since the transfer is temporary, taking a new oath does not affect the judge’s previous service. “When judges return to their original High Court, they resume their original seniority,” Siddiqui added. He emphasized that a judge’s transfer is not a new or permanent appointment; under the Presidential Order, a transfer can only be temporary.
Justice Mazhar pointed out that the IHC judges didn’t object to the transfer procedure itself but to the seniority issue. He added that the seniority was determined by the IHC chief justice, and that decision affected the petitioner judges.
Justice Mazhar also asked Siddiqui if the judges’ representation had been accepted, will his clients still have filed the petition. “Absolutely”, Siddiqui replied, saying they would still have challenged the transfers.
Justice Mazhar reiterated that the affected parties in this case are the judges themselves and clarified that the main case from the outset has centered on those judges. Later, the court adjourned the hearing for today (Wednesday).

"PPP, MQM trade barbs in NA budget session",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322376-ppp-mqm-trade-barbs-in-na-budget-session,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly proceedings on Tuesday witnessed an exchange of harsh remarks between parliamentarians from two government allies — Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) -- during the speech of PPP member Shazia Marri on the federal budget.
“Karachi is very much part of the Sindh province and no one can separate it from the province,” Shazia said. MQM’s Asiya Ishaq rushed to Aseefa Bhutto Zardari to register protest over the PPP parliamentarian’s remarks. MQM member Javed Hanif remarked: “You abandoned Karachi and are now threatening us.” Shazia said if Hafizabad, Gujranwala and other cities could not be separated from Punjab, why Karachi, Hyderabad and Mirpur Khas are considered entities separate from Sindh.
The PPP parliamentarian, while complaining that none of development schemes of the abolished Pak PWD have been transferred to the Sindh province, asked the federal government to stop treating Sindh as its colony. “Read the Constitution. Sindh is a province and federating unit of Pakistan and not its colony,” the PPP parliamentarian said, adding that the federal government transferred development schemes of the Pak PWD to three other provinces, but the same was not done in case of Sindh. How the federal government can handle the schemes of a province, she said.
Shazia said the imposition of 2.5 per cent carbon levy would badly impact the common man, particularly those who use public transport. She opposed the proposal to impose 18 per cent GST on solar panels. At the same time, she gave a clear message that her party would not allow the government to pass the budget as it is. However, she said that opposing any of the government decisions would not create anarchy in the country.
The two main allies of the PMLN-led government in the Centre have been at loggerheads since the start of the budget session. On Monday, another PPP MNA Nabeel Gabol advised the MQM leadership to change their party’s name to MQMN for blindly supporting every government decision.
Shazia pointed out that two federal budgets have been announced, one by the finance minister and the other, which is a shadow budget, by Khalid Maqbool. She regretted that the government has failed to announce increase in minimum monthly wages.
Taking part in discussion, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan of PTI said the federal budget had not been announced while keeping in view the problems of people.
He said the government has also not been able to start major projects or provide relief to the masses, adding that the largest percentage of population was living in Pakistan below the poverty line. He demanded that people earning up to Rs2,200,000 should be exempt from tax and that the budget should allocate funds for emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence, as it is essential. He suggested that there should be no stamp duty on sale and purchase of property. He contested the government claims of reducing the inflation rate to 3.7 per cent.
Shahida Akhtar Ali of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal Pakistan (MMAP) demanded a special risk allowance for fighter pilots and greater relief measures for low-income groups. She stressed the need to reduce income tax for the salaried class.
Mian Khan Bugti of PMLN commended Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for allocating substantial funds to improve Balochistan’s road infrastructure. Aminul Haque of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan welcomed key economic indicators such as decline in inflation, rupee stabilization and 31% rise in remittances.
However, he criticized the provincial government’s neglect of urban centres and called for a dedicated development package for Karachi and Hyderabad.
Tehmina Daultana called for special steps for women empowerment. Anwar Ali Taj proposed conducting a new survey of the BISP to include more deserving people. Nikhat Shakeel Khan proposed the best transport facilities to the residents of Karachi.
Minister for Water Resources Moeen Wattoo congratulated the government’s financial team for presenting an ideal budget. He emphasized the government’s commitment to enhancing the country’s water storage capacity, allocating 130 billion rupees for this purpose.

‘Changing IHC rules without full court meeting is unlawful’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322377-changing-ihc-rules-without-full-court-meeting-is-unlawful,"ISLAMABAD: A new controversy has arisen over amendments to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) rules. Justice Babar Sattar has written to the acting chief justice and all the judges of the high court, saying that changing the rules without a full court meeting is against the law, and steps need to be taken to rectify the mistake immediately.
Justice Sattar has written to all his fellow judges of the IHC, including acting Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and senior puisne judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, saying that he has received the gazette notification of the IHC Rules 2025.
He said that under Article 208 of the constitution, the authority has the power to make rules. According to Article 192, the authority means the chief justice and the judges of the high court. He said that neither can this power be given to anyone else nor can it be exercised in any other way.
He said that it is a settled principle that the law under which discretionary power is given cannot be given to anyone else without a change in the law. In the Lahore High Court (LHC) Rules adopted by the IHC, the power of Article 208 was not given to anyone else.
Justice Sattar wrote that to his knowledge, no such full court meeting took place in which the IHC Rules 2011 were repealed or discussed. These IHC Rules 2025 are without legal authority and are made in violation of Article 208.
The letter states that this is against the law, according to the LHC Rules adopted by the IHC, and that the mistake should be rectified immediately.
The high court has made its own rules in violation of Article 208, which apart from affecting the rights of the employees, will also be a source of great embarrassment for the high court, Justice Sattar concluded.

US envoy inaugurates restored mosque and temple at Lahore Fort,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322353-us-envoy-inaugurates-restored-mosque-and-temple-at-lahore-fort,"LAHORE: US Consul General in Lahore, Ms. Kristin K. Hawkins, on Tuesday inaugurated the restored Imperial Zenana Mosque and the Sikh-era temple at the historic Lahore Fort, marking another milestone in the enduring cultural partnership between the United States and Pakistan.
The restoration of the two heritage sites was funded by the US government in collaboration with the Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA) and the Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan (AKCSP).
These structures are part of a broader conservation effort encompassing seven major sites within the Lahore Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
Speaking at the ceremony, Ms. Hawkins emphasized that heritage conservation extends far beyond preserving physical structures. “Through this US-Pakistan partnership, the preservation project has gone well beyond stones and mortar,” she said. “Preservation work strengthens communities, builds a sense of belonging, contributes to economic development, and educates future generations about the tremendous heritage that has existed here for centuries.”
The US Mission termed the project a reflection of wider bilateral cooperation that includes trade, innovation, education, and cultural preservation. Officials noted that such initiatives not only foster interfaith harmony and community resilience but also generate economic opportunities through tourism and skilled heritage conservation.
Since 2001, the United States has invested approximately $8.4 million in 35 cultural preservation projects across Pakistan, ranging from Gandhara archaeological sites to Mughal-era monuments—underscoring what the US Mission calls its “enduring commitment” to Pakistan’s cultural legacy. A joint statement from project partners highlighted the symbolic importance of conserving sites that represent the region’s pluralistic past.
“These restored sites—bearing Islamic, Sikh, and colonial histories—serve as powerful reminders of the rich and diverse heritage that defines Lahore’s cultural fabric,” it read. Officials from WCLA and AKCSP praised the initiative, stressing that extensive research and community involvement were crucial to the project’s success. The newly restored monuments are now expected to attract both domestic and international tourists, giving a fresh boost to heritage tourism and local economic activity in the Walled City.
The event concluded with a guided tour of the restored structures, where guests were briefed on the conservation process, the historical significance of the sites, and the challenges encountered during restoration.
This initiative comes amid a growing global recognition of cultural preservation as a tool for soft diplomacy, sustainable development, and international collaboration. Observers note that such projects are vital in fostering mutual understanding and lasting partnerships.

"Zardari praises PAF’s exemplary professionalism, commitment",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322354-zardari-praises-paf-s-exemplary-professionalism-commitment,"ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari Tuesday visited the Air Headquarters to boost the morale of PAF following its resounding success in defending the aerial frontiers of Pakistan and delivering a decisive response to the recent Indian aggression.
The president met with Chief of the Air Staff Pakistan Air Force Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu.
Air Chief Marshal Sidhu shared insight into various ongoing modernisation projects of Pakistan Air Force’s operational construct, force goals and plans for the force structure with a keen focus on future warfare.
In the recent standoff against India, he attributed the PAF’s success to the matchless training, smart inductions, seamless operational readiness and a homegrown kill chain sharpened by the mastery of modern warfare.
The air chief highlighted that for the first time in its history, the Pakistan Air Force conducted full spectrum operations during the recent conflict, employing multi-domain warfare capabilities. This included the integration of space, cyber and electronic warfare, alongside the strategic application of niche and disruptive technologies, which collectively generated decisive effects that significantly contributed to Pakistan’s victory over India.  The president expressed his profound appreciation for the exemplary professionalism, unwavering commitment and indomitable spirit demonstrated by the personnel of Pakistan Air Force.
He acknowledged the pivotal and decisive role played by the PAF in safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan during the recent conflict, which culminated in a historic and resolute victory.
He also lauded the leadership of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, recognizing his role in modernizing the PAF and swiftly integrating advanced technologies that have significantly enhanced the operational readiness of Pakistan Air Force and have recalibrated the region’s deterrence landscape.
The president highlighted that the bold and visionary leadership of Pakistan’s armed forces had enabled Pakistan to deliver a firm and timely response to the Indian aggression, ensuring the Air Force remains at the forefront of technological and strategic advancement. He also expressed his satisfaction over the PAF’s combat readiness and reiterated all-out support from the government to the PAF in its pursuit of excellence.
Later, the president also visited the National ISR & Integrated Air Operations Centre where he was briefed about the overall operational capabilities of Pakistan Air Force.

Ministry of Law and Justice removes Section 354 from Anti-Rape Act,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322355-ministry-of-law-and-justice-removes-section-354-from-anti-rape-act,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Law and Justice has officially removed Section 354 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) from the schedule of offences under the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021, following recommendations from a special committee.
Section 354 of the PPC pertains to assault or criminal force aimed at ‘outraging the modesty of a woman’ -- an offence traditionally tried in magisterial courts and broadly applied to cases involving women that may not meet the high threshold required for sexual violence prosecutions.
Previously, this section had been classified as a scheduled offence under the Anti-Rape Act, bringing it within the jurisdiction of special courts established to try rape and other serious sexual offences. However, legal experts and officials have noted that including Section 354 within the Act’s purview has led to a disproportionate number of minor assault cases being tried in courts meant for graver crimes.
According to government data, Section 354 accounted for nearly 31 per cent of the caseload in special courts designated under the Anti-Rape Act. Barrister Ali Tahir, speaking to The News, explains that “Removing Section 354 as a scheduled offence is a step in the right direction”, adding: “This will enable the special courts to concentrate their resources and time on prosecuting more serious sexual violence cases.”
Legal experts say that the decision aims to streamline the judicial process under the Anti-Rape framework and ensure that special courts remain focused on offences involving significant harm and trauma, including rape and gang rape, rather than lower-threshold assault cases.

Israeli terrorism put region in chaos: JI,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322356-israeli-terrorism-put-region-in-chaos-ji,"LAHORE: Jamaat-e-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has said Israel’s terrorism has put the entire region in chaos while the US president is playing a hypocritical role.
Addressing a press conference at Mansoorah on Tuesday, he urged the government not to pin any hopes on Trump. He regretted that neither the ruling alliance nor the opposition parties dared utter a word against Washington or protest Israeli atrocities. He praised Iran’s resilience in the face of Israeli aggression and assured Iran’s supreme leader and government of Pakistanis’ moral support.
He welcomed the government expression of solidarity with Iran and appreciated Saudi Arabia’s stance on the matter. “Pakistan must play a leading role on Gaza and Iran. If the Muslim Ummah fails to unite and resist Israeli aggression in these two regions, the Zionist regime will target other Muslim countries next,” he warned and said Hindutva and Zionism, backed by the US, were trampling humanity. He said those trying to sow sectarian discord in current circumstances are serving Israeli interests.
Criticizing the government, Rehman denounced its anti-poor economic policies which he said made life miserable for the common man, farmers, labourers and salaried classes. “Instead of targeting the masses, the rulers should curb their luxuries, cut unnecessary protocol and slash perks and privileges,” he said. He demanded significant reductions in electricity, gas, and petrol prices and proposed the formation of a commission to restore peace and resolve the issue of missing persons in Balochistan. He criticized the Punjab government for destroying agriculture and handing over schools and hospitals to the private sector. He said Sindh was under the control of criminal elements, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were plagued by unrest. “The federal finance minister claims economic improvement while imposing endless taxes. Under the cover of global price hike, petrol prices are increased overnight. If energy costs keep rising, how will industries survive?”
He pointed out that the salaried class paid Rs500 billion in taxes and asked how much the government had collected from the feudal elite. “The government is squeezing the people to enrich the privileged class. Health, education and peace are not the ruling elite’s priorities. Over Rs2,000 billion of provincial education budgets are lost to corruption and three crore children remain out of school. He said Punjab’s performance was just media hype and fake PR. Governments should function through policies, not advertisements.
He shared that the Jamaat-e-Islami’s Central Shoora had held a three-day session to discuss national and global issues, and presented key policy suggestions. These included ending petroleum levies to reduce prices by up to 40 per cent and forming an independent commission on Baloch missing persons. He emphasized that Pakistan must assert a principled stance on Kashmir and reject any Trump-led mediation.
“In light of regional tensions, we have postponed our anti-IPPs movement, but our struggle for public rights continues,” he added. To a question, he replied that the JI stood firm against the establishment interference in politics, unlike other parties that collaborated with it.

Alarm as militants intercept car of Maulana Fazl’s son,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322360-alarm-as-militants-intercept-car-of-maulana-fazl-s-son,"PESHAWAR: An attempt to intercept the car of the son of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman by a number of armed militants in Dera Ismail Khan has set the alarm bells ringing for police and other security forces.
Senior police officials told The News the case was being investigated while the regional police officer Dera Ismail Khan had been directed to launch joint patrolling along with National Highways and Motorway Police for improved security on highways and CPEC routes.
According to senior JUIF leadership, Maulana Asjad Mahmood, a son of Maulana Fazlur Rehman, was intercepted by dozens of armed militants when he was on way from Dera Ismail K to Lakki Marwat to condole the death of a party worker a few days back. The guards of the JUIF leader also took positions to defend Maulana Asjad at all costs.
The JUIF leader was stopped for some time on the main national highway in the limits of Yarik Police Station in Dera Ismail Khan before the armed men talked to their commander and later allowed him to go.
The JUIF Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Tuesday expressed serious concern over the law and order in the province, particularly Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu divisions, for the last few years. The JUIF KP leadership said the security situation in southern districts was a big question mark for the chief minister and governor, both belonging to Dera Ismail Khan.
A number of religious scholars have come under attack in KP and Balochistan in the recent months.
According to police, a major attack was thwarted on a JUIF rally in Peshawar in May when police intercepted a suicide bomber on the route to the venue of the rally, addressed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman. Two policemen were martyred in the blast and three others wounded.
There were reports that shots were fired at the vehicle of former MPA Aghaz Gandapur in Dera Ismail Khan the other day. There was no casualty in the incident as Aghaz was not in his car. Shots were fired at his residence a few months back in which a policeman was martyred.
Father and uncle of Aghaz Gandapur, Ikramullah Gandapur and Israr Gandapur, both former provincial ministers, were martyred in separate suicide attacks in the past.
The spokesman for the KP Police Shahzada Kokab Farooq said that police had been directed to launch investigation and increase patrolling in the area.
He said the KP Police had adopted an aggressive policy and most of the attacks had been repulsed. He said security would be ensured on CPEC and other routes as well as to senior political leadership.
He added RPO had been directed to set up joint checkposts and increase joint patrolling along with NHMP.

"Rabbani opposes power given to FBR to arrest CEOs, CFOs, board directors",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322361-rabbani-opposes-power-given-to-fbr-to-arrest-ceos-cfos-board-directors,"ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani strongly opposed the power to arrest CEOs, CFOs and board directors being given to the Federal Board Revenue (FBR) through a Money Bill and such amendments do not fall within the scope of Clause (2), Article 73, Constitution, 1973, and cannot be part of a Money Bill/Finance Bill.
“The National Assembly (NA) Speaker should not certify these amendments to constitute a part of the Money Bill, under Clause (5), Article 73, Constitution, 1973,” he demanded in a statement on Tuesday while condemning giving the powers to FBR to arrest CEOs, CFOs and board directors.
Rabbani said such amendments amount to giving the powers of the CrPC to the FBR,” he said. He said such amendments also empower the tax commissioner to issue notices of money laundering. “This will adversely affect businesses,” he said. He said wide powers all exist with the state under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The former Senate chairman said there is a grave risk of misuse of the powers to arrest and to issue notices. “This can lead to businesses shutting down,” he said.
He said the manner in which the government is amending various laws and empowering various state agencies, is in violation of the fundamental rights in the Constitution, 1973.
Rabbani said Pakistan is gradually being converted into a police state at the calling of international financial imperialist, like the IMF.

JI to stage sit-in outside PA on June 21 for Karachi’s rights,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322287-ji-to-stage-sit-in-outside-pa-on-june-21-for-karachi-s-rights,"Karachi Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) emir Munem Zafar Khan has announced a protest rally will be staged outside the Sindh Assembly on June 21 for the rights of Karachi and Karachiites.
Addressing a press conference at the JI Karachi headquarters, Idara Noor-e-Haq, he said even the Pakistan Peoples Party’s nominated mayor complained that Islamabad was neglecting Karachi.
He said the PPP was a coalition partner of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in the centre, yet Karachi was badly neglected in both the federal and provincial budgets, the budget allocated for the much needed K4 water supply project was quite inadequate and no new mega project was launched for the megalopolis.
Zafar also criticised the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) for its policy to seek votes in the name of Karachi, enjoy all perks and privileges available in any government and never deliver to Karachi and Karachiites.
He said both the PPP and the MQM were coalition partners with the PML-N in the center, but they never went beyond occasional statements for Karachi and Karachiites. The two parties show keen interest in ministries but not in any development project for Karachi, and, as a result, all such projects are found in limbo in the mega city, he said.
Zafar went on to say that all the ruling parties showed exemplary unity when it came to increase the pay for legislators by 180 percent and 600 percent for chairman and deputy chairman Senate and speaker of the National Assembly. He added that the same coalition partners don’t change the status quo as the city was facing power, water, health and educational crises.
He said the JI will continue its legal, constitutional and democratic struggle for the rights of Karachiites. He said a protest will be held outside the assembly building against neglecting the mega city in the federal and provincial budgets, inadequate budgets for K4 water supply and lack of new mega projects.
Further talking about the K4 project, he said that it had been in limbo for the past 22 years. In this budget, he said, Rs40 billion were asked for completion of the project but only Rs3.2bn were allocated. It was nothing less than an anti-Karachi policy of the coalition government in the centre.
Talking about Israeli cold blooded attacks on Iran and other Muslim countries, he stressed the need for the Muslim Ummah to get united. He strongly condemned the United States for using veto in favour of Israel.
He also highlighted that the United Nations had lost the very purpose of its inception as it couldn’t play any role in the recent developments despite the fact that Israeli aggression not only jeopardized the stability in the region but also attempted to open the hellfire gates towards the Third World War.
He also dubbed the OIC as a dead horse and asked the 57 Islamic countries to put their house in order as they themselves would have to safeguard themselves against rogue states like Israel.

Auqaf Chief Administrator Farukh Shehzad Qureshi welcomed the acting governor upon his arrival. Shah recited Fateha and offered special prayers for the peace, progress, and prosperity of the nation. He also interacted with devotees and reviewed the arrangements made for them.
Speaking at the event, acting governor Shah said that the teachings of the saints are a source of humanity, peace, brotherhood, and spiritual purification.
Great Sufi saints like Hazrat Abdullah Shah Ghazi (RA) promoted love, tolerance, and unity in society through their teachings and character. In today’s age, following their path is a collective need, he remarked.
He further said that the Sindh government considers providing facilities to the devotees visiting the shrines of saints as a top priority. The Department of Auqaf and other relevant institutions are constantly working to provide a better, safe, and dignified environment for the visitors.
He stated that the Urs of Hazrat Abdullah Shah Ghazi (RA) is a spiritual gathering that unites people from different schools of thought. Moreover, Sindh is the land of Sufis, dervishes, and people of heart, where the values of love, tolerance, and public service have always flourished, he said.

Court orders Preedy SHO to take action for removal of encroachments,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322289-court-orders-preedy-sho-to-take-action-for-removal-of-encroachments,"A judicial magistrate has ordered the Preedy SHO to take immediate action for removal of all unauthorised carts, encroachments and obstructions from Daudpota Road in the Saddar area.
The order came on an application filed by Advocate Imran Ali, who named the South District deputy commissioner, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) Anti-Encroachment Cell director, SSP South and SHO Preedy as respondents.
The applicant stated that a number of pushcarts and encroachments had unlawfully occupied the public road in the Garden area, falling within the jurisdiction of the Preedy police station.
He said encroachments and unauthorized carts were causing serious obstruction to the free flow of traffic and pedestrian movement, creating nuisance and posing a risk to public safety and convenience. He pleaded with the court to order the respondents to remove all these encroachments from the road.
The magistrate noted that a report received from the Preedy police admitted the version of the applicant and said FIRs had been lodged against illegal and unauthorized cart dealers. He, therefore, directed the Preedy SHO to take immediate action to remove all unauthorized carts, encroachments, and obstructions from Daudpota Road, particularly in the Garden area. The magistrate instructed the SHO to ensure that such encroachments do not appear again and submit a compliance report before July 30.

SHC tells govt to ensure funds to release special judicial allowance,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322291-shc-tells-govt-to-ensure-funds-to-release-special-judicial-allowance,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday directed the provincial government to ensure the disbursement of the funds to release special judicial allowance to all the cadres of the SHC, its benches and its circuit courts.
The direction came on a contempt-of-court application filed by high court employees seeking the implementation of the SHC’s June 21, 2024, order that directed the government to unfreeze and release the special judicial allowance within two months.
The additional advocate general, and the counsel for the chief secretary and the finance secretary informed the court that the cabinet has approved the budget proposal, which includes the funds for paying judicial employees in accordance with the court’s June 21, 2024, order.
They said that it is anticipated that this amount would be approved in the upcoming budget by the provincial assembly. An SHC division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha said if this is the case, the government should ensure the disbursement of the funds pursuant to the court orders.
The court in the meantime suspended the show-cause notices issued to the alleged contemners until August 15, when the provincial law officer will submit a compliance report, failing which the alleged contemners must show up in court.
The SHC had earlier set aside the government’s office memorandum and the cabinet’s decision as regards the freezing of the judicial allowance of the high court and its subordinate judiciary employees.
The court had directed the government to unfreeze and release the amount of the special judicial allowance to all the cadres of the SHC, its benches and its circuit courts within two months.
Regularisation plea
The SHC also reserved its judgment on a petition of over 500 contract employees of the Pakistan Steel Mills (PSM) seeking regularisation. The petitioners said they have been working on contract since 2009 in different departments of the PSM, but they are not being regularised despite the Supreme Court’s orders.
Their counsel said that some other contract employees had been regularised on the court’s orders. The SHC asked how contract employees can be regularised when the PSM has been closed since 2015, and who will pay these employees if they are regularised. The counsel for the PSM requested the court to dismiss the petitions as not maintainable. After hearing the arguments of the counsel, the court reserved its judgment.

Sharjeel asks JI chief to stop levelling baseless allegations against Sindh govt,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322292-sharjeel-asks-ji-chief-to-stop-levelling-baseless-allegations-against-sindh-govt,"Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said on Tuesday that leveling accusations against the Sindh government for political point-scoring during the budget session has become a routine habit of Hafiz Naeem.
He said the Jamaat-e-Islami chief’s remarks about “Nura Kushti” are, in fact, a reflection of his own political irrelevance. Reacting to a statement of the JI leader, Sindh Senior Minister and Minister for Information, Transport, and Mass Transit, Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government had always given top priority to the education sector.
He added that no government in history had taken as many concrete steps for the improvement of education and healthcare as the Pakistan Peoples Party had. Memon said the development work being carried out in the sectors of education, health, water, and infrastructure in Sindh was not the result of any Nura Kushti, but a testament to the PPP’s consistent commitment to public service.
He stressed that if Hafiz Naeem were genuinely concerned about the state of education in Sindh, he would have questioned why, despite the 18th Amendment, the federal government had failed to release Sindh’s rightful share of funds on time. Senior Minister Memon said Sindh’s education budget is not just reflected in figures but is evident on the ground through the rehabilitation of schools, recruitment of teachers, and various educational programs.
He suggested that Hafiz Naeem should adopt a constructive approach for the betterment of the people of Sindh instead of indulging in the politics of baseless accusations.

According to jail officials, a total of 225 prisoners had escaped from Malir Jail on the night of June 3 amid a riot triggered during an alleged earthquake scare. Since then, many fugitives have been brought back either through police raids or by their families voluntarily surrendering them.
On Thursday, Steel Town Police arrested one of the escapees, Jan Muhammad, and returned him to Malir Jail. In a recorded video statement, the prisoner said, ""When the earthquake struck on June 3, I fled with the others out of panic.""

"One dead, three hurt in Korangi factory roof collapse",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322295-one-dead-three-hurt-in-korangi-factory-roof-collapse,"A tragic incident occurred on Tuesday near Vita Chowrangi in Korangi Industrial Area, where the roof of a leather factory collapsed, resulting in the death of a teenage worker and injuries to three others.
According to police, the roof of a room at the factory made of cement tiles and already in a deteriorated condition suddenly fell while repair work was underway. A large pile of debris on the rooftop further contributed to the collapse when a central support beam snapped.
Rescue teams from welfare organisations and police personnel reached the scene promptly after being informed about the incident. Bystanders gathered at the site were moved back by police to allow rescue operations to proceed.

Nadeem Afzal Chan said that the Information Wing will be strengthened up to the Tehsil level and the Information Bureau will create its own software in which the data of all people will be safe. He clarified that politics is a profession that does not charge any fee. The first task is to restore communication between the workers and the leadership. No one can work alone, a team has to be formed. He said that the information wing of Central Punjab will be strengthened up to the Tehsil level.

Fumigation key to safety of agri products,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322272-fumigation-key-to-safety-of-agri-products,"Islamabad:Fumigation is a vital element and reliable method for treating all imported agricultural products to prevent the spread of invasive pests and diseases, said agriculture experts.
They said this here at a seminar held to highlight the importance of The Methyl Bromide (MeBr) fumigation treatment in the agriculture sector. The participants included as agricultural scientists, plant protection officer, insect specialists, plant disease specialists, fumigation specialist, pest control experts and others.
They said that as a powerful fumigant, MeBr protects commodities like grains, fruits, and wood, eliminating harmful insects, larvae and eggs that may threaten local ecosystems in the country.
“This treatment is mandated under international phytosanitary regulations to ensure bio-security and protect domestic agriculture from contamination. Without MeBr fumigation, countries risk introducing foreign pests that could devastate crops, cause economic losses, and disrupt food supply chains,” they stated. It should be avoided by quarantine lapses in the rice, sesame and corn export sectors.
While explaining technicalities of the MeBr fumigation, the experts stated that it is a broad-spectrum fumigant that targets insects, nematodes, fungi, bacteria, and weed seeds, making it a reliable method for ensuring that agricultural products are free from harmful organisms.
Using the fumigation method is also necessary to fulfilling the international phytosanitary standards, they said, adding that many countries have strict regulations on the import and export of agricultural commodities to prevent the entry of pests and diseases. “Fumigating with MeBr ensures compliance with these standards, helping exporters avoid trade barriers, shipment rejections, or bans,” the experts claimed.
In addition to its use in trade, fumigation is also applied in pre-plant soil treatment. This is common in high-value crops such as strawberries, tomatoes and peppers, where soil-borne pests and pathogens can significantly affect yield and quality.
The experts also expressed their  surprise over recent move of national agri-trade and food security authority to ban Methyl Bromide.As per information, major trading partners of the country for these agri products are Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, USA, Russia, Thailand, Korea, and Mexico and they strictly enforce phytosanitary import conditions that require effective quarantine treatments like methyl bromide fumigation.
Moreover, neighboring countries with similar or superior agricultural profiles continue to rely on methyl bromide fumigation in compliance with international standards. India, Thailand, the Philippines, and Bangladesh carefully apply MeBr to disinfect agricultural commodities, recognizing that alternatives such as heat treatment, controlled atmosphere, or irradiation remain largely infeasible or unapproved by IPPC for broad-spectrum use.Afghanistan - often cited as less resourced - continues to mandate methyl bromide fumigation for agricultural imports.

Meeting focuses on leveraging global alliances to fight poverty,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322273-meeting-focuses-on-leveraging-global-alliances-to-fight-poverty,"Islamabad:Federal Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety, Syed Imran Ahmed Shah chaired a strategic meeting at the ministry here on Tuesday with Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Romina Khurshid Alam, Chairman Standing Committee on IT & Telecom Ameenul Haque and former member of the NCRC Dr. Rubina Feroze Bhatti.
The discussion focused on leveraging global alliances, digital infrastructure, and skills-based approaches to fight poverty in Pakistan. Minister Imran Shah said poverty alleviation efforts must be rooted in international collaboration, transparent data exchange, and innovative social protection models.
He noted that the Ministry is committed to sharing verified program data and outcomes with reputable international entities working for poverty alleviation and social development in Pakistan.
""Through Public-Private Partnership model, we can equip brick kiln workers with exportable skills, allowing them access to international labor markets such as South Korea, and facilitating economic rehabilitation of bonded labour,"" he said. The minister said with digital innovation, global support and transparent practices, Pakistan aimed to uplift its people with dignity and opportunity.
Highlighting examples of global innovation, SAPM Romina Khurshid Alam underscored the need to localize successful international models. She cited Rwanda’s example, where poverty was reduced by 70–80% through digital economic reforms and data-driven strategies. She also referred to China’s Global Development Initiative, noting its eight foundational pillars—especially corporate social safety measures—as guiding tools for Pakistan’s inclusive development.

CDA terminates parking system contract,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322276-cda-terminates-parking-system-contract,"Islamabad:The Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) has terminated its contract with AJCL, the company responsible for digitizing Islamabad's parking system, due to repeated violations, negligence, and financial irregularities, the spokesman of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Tuesday said.
The decision follows AJCL's failure to meet its contractual obligations, compromising public safety and causing significant revenue losses.  Investigations revealed that AJCL failed to install the promised digital payment systems, engaged in unrecorded cash transactions, and neglected essential security measures, leading to thefts and public inconvenience.

"Prolonged loadshedding: KP people being punished for supporting PTI, says Asad",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322298-prolonged-loadshedding-kp-people-being-punished-for-supporting-pti-asad,"SWABI: Criticising the federal government for prolonged power outages, former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser on Tuesday said the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were being punished for voting supporting Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf.
“The Constitution and law give the people the right to choose their representatives, but today the country is under a government that is a product of Form 47 and has only secured 17 seats,” he told reporters here.
The severe and unjust loadshedding of electricity in Swabi continues unabated, he said, adding, he had also raised the issue of the electricity crisis and public hardship in Swabi at the floor of the National Assembly, but no relief was provided so far.
He said that Pesco was facing a 57percent shortage of staff and there were no meter readers and linemen in some areas.He said that both Pesco and the federal government had failed to fulfill their responsibilities. He said that according to NEPRA’s records, Pesco’s recovery rate was 91percent, yet loadshedding was still being carried out in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
He demanded that the federal government immediately release the dues of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said that Rs123 billion were owed by the federation under Net Hydel Profit, while Rs 478 billion in Fata funds have still not been disbursed, despite commitments. He said that after the merger of Fata, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s share in the NFC Award increased from 14percent to 19 percent, yet the province is still not being given its rightful share. He said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made the greatest sacrifices in the war against terrorism, yet it continues to be ignored.
He warned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that if Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was not given its constitutional rights, then no one should complain about the consequences. He rejected the imposition of new taxes on tribal districts, stating that a 10percent tax was being imposed on the region, which is completely unacceptable.
He demanded that the government immediately end the oppressive loadshedding in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, pay the net hydel profit dues, and fulfill the promises made at the time of the Fata’s merger.

If this information had been provided on time, he wouldn’t have been dragged into a second round. You seek time when asked for answers and still don’t submit complete reports.”
Advocate Moazzam Butt informed the court that his client was being constantly harassed, and it was necessary for the high court to issue a comprehensive judgment clarifying under what circumstances a citizen can be arrested.
In response, Justice Sahibzada Asadullah remarked, “The dignity and freedom of all citizens are protected under the Constitution - there is no room for ambiguity. Everything is clearly outlined in the Constitution.”
The petitioner’s lawyer also said that they were willing to submit an affidavit to the court declaring that Afridi would appear whenever summoned, provided he was informed of the charges.Justice Sahibzada Asadullah reiterated, “Everything is defined in the Constitution and law - it now depends on the institutions as to how much they abide by it.”

JI slams govts for ignoring Malakand,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322302-ji-slams-govts-for-ignoring-malakand,"PESHAWAR: Criticising the federal and provincial governments for neglecting Malakand Division in the recent budgets, Jamaat-e-Islami Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (North) president and former senior minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inayatullah Khan on Tuesday announced to hold an All-Parties Conference on June 25 to decide the future course of action.
Addressing a press conference here, he warned that the KP government’s attempt to collect taxes from Malakand Division was a violation of the previously agreed tax exemption. He was accompanied by president of Tehreek Huqooq-i- Malakand and former KP Finance Minister Shah Raz Khan, ex-MNA from Upper Dir, Sahibzada Tariqullah, former District Nazim Upper Dir Sahibzada Fasihullah and Tehsil Chairman Upper Dir Rafeeullah Khan.
The JI leader said that the provincial government was breaching the tax exemption agreement by imposing taxes in Malakand, while the federal government has ignored the salaried class in its budget and awarded big relief to industrialists and feudal elites. He termed the imposition of an 18 percent sales tax on solar panels oppression, which he said, was a bid to force the people to have the expensive electricity.
Inayatullah Khan said that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Revenue Authority (KPRA) had already collected Rs 200 million in taxes from Malakand, despite its exempt status. Jamaat-e-Islami, he emphasised, would not leave the people of the region alone and would unite all segments of society on one platform to resist these injustices.
Criticising Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Inayatullah called his claims of offering loans to the federal government a ‘bundle of lies.’ He ridiculed the provincial government’s claim of generating a revenue of Rs 129 billion internally. “Will such a huge amount be collected through illegal taxation from the people of Malakand,” he questioned.
The former minister described the KP budget as a deficit one disguised as surplus. He said that although Rs 45 billion had been allocated for local governments this year, no funds have been released to elected local representatives during the past three years.
He also accused the chief minister of allocating Rs 34 billion worth of development projects for his home district, Dera Ismail Khan, while ignoring the merged tribal districts completely. “Every year, funds are earmarked for the merged districts in the budget but never released and utilized,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Shah Raz Khan said that all political parties would be brought together on a single platform to defend the rights of Malakand. He said that withdrawal of tax exemption for Malakand was a grave injustice to the poor people of the region.
He said that the provincial government has badly failed to deliver for the well-being of the people of the province despite being in power for 13 long years. He said that the people of Malakand division would give a strong and united response to the injustices being done to them.

PAL’s regional offices proposed merger opposed,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322305-pal-s-regional-offices-proposed-merger-opposed,"PESHAWAR: Literary and cultural organisations have opposed the proposed merger of regional offices of Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) and termed the move of federal government against national unity and linguistic diversity.
In a joint statement on Tuesday, office-bearers of various literary and cultural organisations said that PAL for decades had been unifying national thought through conferences, symposia, workshops and exchange visits both national and international levels but was being merged.
They added that PAL was the lone institution that stood out for promoting the cause of national unity through linguistic diversity to carry on the legacy of national narrative. “KP is home to more than a dozen languages and PAL regional office is the only institution connecting poets and writers their preserving linguistic heritage,” Prof Abaseen Yousafzai, a noted poet and research scholar said while expressing his concerns over the PAL merger.
He said that merger or limiting scope of functional framework of the regional offices of the academy would be a serious blow to national identity.He said that the PAL regional offices across the country were unifying threads for strengthening the network of mentors of Pakistan national identity and served as an excellent liaison among literati, intellectuals and scholars countrywide.
Muhammad Zaman Sagar, executive director Gawari community remarked he had been working on 30 languages being spoken in KP and GB.He said that PAL and a few other national institutes were serving the cause of connecting writers and linguistics communities, any move to merge or defunct them would lead to harming national identity.
“I think PAL is playing a significant role in brining literati, researchers at one platform to create space for all languages on equal footings, it should be strengthened and its scope be widened,” he suggested.
Bushra Farrukh, a noted Urdu and Hindko writer said the move of federal government to merge or limit working space of PAL was deemed as sheer injustice to writers’ community of the entire country across the board.She said that any plan to squeeze space for literati would prove detrimental to national heritage.

Saif says Centre drops ‘petrol bomb’ on people,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322308-saif-says-centre-drops-petrol-bomb-on-people,"PESHAWAR: Adviser to Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif on Tuesday accused the federal government of “dropping a petrol bomb” on the public ahead of the new fiscal year.
In a statement, he said the federal budget imposed an additional 2.5 per cent tax on petroleum products, warning that prices would soar once the new financial year began in July.  “With every rise in fuel prices, the cost of essential food items shoots up,” he added.
Calling the national budget “anti-poor and pro-elite,” the adviser claimed that the Punjab budget followed the same pattern, and completely ignored the agricultural sector and offered no relief to farmers.He said that flawed federal policies caused Punjab’s cultivators an estimated Rs2,200 billion loss, adding that only “commission-driven” projects received priority.
He said that, unlike Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab “failed to muster the courage” to provide free healthcare.  “If Punjab faces difficulty in extending health facilities, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stands ready to assist,” he added.
Barrister Saif warned that the taxes and levies on petroleum products, along with surcharges on electricity would unleash a new wave of inflation.  “The poor will be crushed as the budget was framed to protect elite interests and offered nothing for low-income citizens,” he remarked. He said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government presented a tax-free, welfare-oriented budget, prioritizing social sector schemes.

"Oil prices climb 2%, stocks slide as traders track Israel-Iran crisis",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322209-oil-prices-climb-2pc-stocks-slide-as-traders-track-israel-iran-crisis,"LONDON: Oil prices jumped and stocks mostly fell Tuesday after US President Donald Trump abruptly departed G7 talks to monitor the conflict between Israel and Iran and called for Tehran residents to evacuate.
Investors’ optimism the previous day that the conflict would not spread throughout the Middle East gave way to fears of further escalation as the conflict entered its fifth day.“Middle East tensions are showing no signs of easing back, putting investors on high alert,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.
Trump said he was aiming for a “real end” to the conflict, not just a ceasefire after he departed the G7 summit in Canada.“Iran should have signed the ‘deal’ I told them to sign,” he said on social media, referring to nuclear talks that were taking place.
Wall Street opened lower, with a larger-than-expected 0.9 per cent drop in May US retail sales also dampening sentiment.Worries about tariffs hurting consumer spending and uncertainty over Iran “has buyers holding back their own firepower at the moment”, said Briefing[dot]com analyst Patrick O’Hare said.
European equities also struggled in afternoon trading, while Asia turned in a mixed performance: Hong Kong fell, while Shanghai was flat and Tokyo advanced.Despite mounting calls to de-escalate, neither side has backed off from the missile blitz that began Friday, when Israel targeted Iranian nuclear and military facilities.
Oil prices climbed two percent on Tuesday after swinging between gains and losses since Friday’s initial surge. But gains were tempered after the International Energy Agency said in its 2025 report that global demand would fall slightly in 2030 for the first time since the start of the Covid pandemic in 2020.
“We don’t expect high oil prices to be with us for a very long time,” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol. He added that the IEA is “monitoring the situation” and is “ready to act” in the case of a supply disruption.

FDI falls 8% to $1.97bn in July-May,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322210-fdi-falls-8pc-to-1-97bn-in-july-may,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s net foreign direct investment (FDI) dropped 8.0 per cent to $1.979 billion in 11 months of the current fiscal year, the central bank data showed on Monday.
The country saw an FDI inflow of $193.9 million in May, marking a 37 per cent decrease compared to the same month last year. However, there was a significant increase of 38 per cent in investments compared to the previous month.
China remained the largest source of FDI, with investments from the mainland rising to $790.4 million from July to May of FY25, up from $598.6 million during the same period a year earlier.
Sector-wise, cross-border investments in the financial sector increased to $628.9 million from July to May FY25, compared to $570.4 million in the same timeframe last year. Conversely, FDI inflows in the power sector decreased to $562.8 million, down from $613.2 million last year, indicating a decline in investments in energy-related projects. The oil and gas exploration sector experienced a drop in FDI inflows, totalling $265.6 million over the 11 months of the fiscal year, compared to $320.8 million a year ago.
Pakistan’s Economic Survey for FY24-25, published last week, said that a key reason for a decline in Pakistan’s FDI was heightened global risk aversion, with investors shifting capital towards safer markets amid geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty.
“Another key reason was the slowdown in global trade and investment flows, affecting developing economies, as multinational firms scaled back expansion plans,” it said.“Furthermore, China’s outbound investments declined, reducing FDI inflows to economies like Pakistan, which historically benefited from Chinese investment,” it added.

Modi misses chance to push for US trade deal as Trump leaves G-7,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322211-modi-misses-chance-to-push-for-us-trade-deal-as-trump-leaves-g-7,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had no opportunity to push for a US trade deal with Donald Trump after the American president left the Group of Seven leaders’ summit early, a potential setback for New Delhi as recent tariff negotiations hit hurdles, according to Bloomberg.
Modi was expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Trump on the sidelines of the G-7 meeting in Canada this week. Trump said Monday he was leaving the summit a day early because of the unfolding tensions in the Middle East.
A Trump-Modi meeting was widely expected to take place this week to give much-needed political direction to trade negotiators as they race to conclude a deal ahead of a July 9 deadline when higher US tariffs take effect. US and Indian trade officials have hardened their positions in recent talks, with India’s restrictions on genetically modified crops emerging as one of the key sticking points.
“A meeting would have been helpful” to clarify the trade deal, said Harsh Pant, a lecturer in international relations at King’s College London and vice president of the New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation. Negotiating with Trump is difficult, especially now when the president has other pressing concerns, he said. It’s unclear if India is a priority for the US given the latest developments, he added.
India isn’t a member of the G-7 but Modi was invited by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney to attend the leaders’ summit in Kananaskis given the country’s size and importance as a major developing economy. Indian officials had previously indicated Modi wouldn’t attend the G-7.
Trump held a bilateral meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Monday, but failed to reach an agreement on a trade package. The US leader also met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and signed a document as a follow-up on the trade framework agreed in May.
A bilateral meeting with Trump wouldn’t have been without its hazards for Modi. The US leader has repeatedly said the US had mediated a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following last month’s military conflict that brought the two South Asian neighbors to the brink of war. Trump has also insisted that he used trade as a negotiating tool to clinch a peace deal, comments disputed by Indian officials.
Modi is expected to hold a bilateral meeting with Carney on the sidelines of the G-7 meeting, where the two leaders may announce a new initiative to combat cross-border crimes. The Indian prime minister is also expected to meet with leaders from Germany, Ukraine and Italy.
The Indian leader had a stopover in Cyprus for a state visit on Monday en route to Canada, and will visit Croatia on Wednesday on his way back, according to an official schedule.

IT exports decline marginally in May; 11MFY25 still posts 19% growth,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322212-it-exports-decline-marginally-in-may-11mfy25-still-posts-19pc-growth,"KARACHI: The IT export sector recorded a slight year-on-year (YoY) decline of 1.0 per cent in May 2025, with exports standing at $329 million. However, the figure represents a 4.0 per cent month-on-month (MoM) increase and remains higher than the 12-month average of $314 million, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan on Tuesday.
This is the first YoY decline in IT exports after 19 consecutive months of growth. Export proceeds averaged $16.5 million per day in May, compared to $15.9 million in April.Cumulatively, IT exports for the first 11 months of the fiscal year 2025 (11MFY25) reached approximately $3.5 billion, reflecting a 19 per cent increase compared to the same period last year.
Commenting on the trend, Nasheed Malik, analyst at Topline Research, attributed the growth in 11MFY25 exports to multiple supportive developments. “The surge is driven by expansion in global client bases, especially in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region, relaxation in the permissible retention limit by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) from 35 to 50 per cent in Exporters’ Specialised Foreign Currency Accounts, permission to make equity investments abroad, and the relative stability in the Pakistani rupee, which has encouraged exporters to repatriate a greater share of profits,” Malik explained.
In a bid to capture further international business, Pakistani IT companies have been actively participating in global events. Notably, several leading firms attended LEAP 2025 in Saudi Arabia and Web Summit Qatar 2025, making a strong case for Pakistan’s digital capabilities on the global stage.
The Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) highlighted in a recent survey that 62 per cent of IT companies are utilising specialised foreign currency accounts, a sign of growing confidence in official policy measures.
A significant policy initiative in FY25 was the SBP’s introduction of a new category, Equity Investment Abroad (EIA), tailored specifically for export-oriented IT firms. This allows companies to acquire equity in overseas entities using up to 50 per cent of the funds held in their foreign currency accounts. The move is expected to further bolster confidence among exporters and stimulate inflows.
Net IT exports (exports minus imports) stood at $294 million for May 2025, reflecting a 1.0 per cent YoY increase and a 2.0 per cent rise over April. This also surpassed the 12-month average net export figure of $272 million.
Industry sources suggest that full-year FY25 exports are expected to close at around $3.8 billion, marking a 17 per cent increase over FY24. Under the government’s economic vision, branded as the ‘Uraan Pakistan’ plan, authorities have set an ambitious IT export target of $10 billion by FY29, requiring a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 28 per cent over the next four years.

However, the market witnessed selling pressure later in the session amid geopolitical tensions, and the benchmark KSE-100 index dropped by 254 points.
The index closed lower by 254.32 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 121,971.04 points, down from 122,225.36 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 122,891.61 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 121,815.39 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said, “Stocks closed lower due to a global equities sell-off driven by geopolitical uncertainty, as well as the State Bank of Pakistan’s decision to maintain the policy rate amid concerns over inflationary fallout from the Israel-Iran conflict.”
He said that a weakening rupee due to Middle East tensions and rising imports played a catalytic role in the negative close at the PSX.The KSE-30 index decreased by 43.14 points or 0.12 per cent to 36,912.96 points from 36,956.1 points.
Traded shares dropped by 72 million shares to 1,152.012 million shares from 1,224.178 million shares. The trading value increased to Rs27.983 billion from Rs25.75 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs14.78 trillion against Rs14.801 trillion. Of the 473 companies active in the session, 193 closed in green, 244 in red and 36 remained unchanged.
Maaz Mulla, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the PSX witnessed a volatile session, closely tracking global market cues.Amid growing geopolitical uncertainty surrounding tensions between Iran and Israel, investors opted to stay cautious, leading to a lack of clear direction throughout the session. Sentiment remained fragile as the market struggled to find firm footing, he said.
On the upside, index-heavyweights UBL, HBL, SYS, and OGDC provided some support, jointly contributing 219 points. However, losses in PKGP, LUCK, ENGROH, and HUBC offset those gains, dragging the index down by a combined 291 points.
The highest increase was recorded in Macter International Limited, which rose by Rs42.47 to Rs467.18 per share, followed by SS Oil Mills Limited, which increased by Rs39.02 to Rs794.89 per share. A significant decline was noted in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which fell by Rs1,700.02 to Rs15,300.17 per share; Khyber Textile Mills Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs158.06 to Rs1,457.04 per share.
Analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala at JS Global said the market opened on a positive note. However, profit-taking pressure erased all gains, pulling the index into the red. Trading was dominated by small-cap stocks, reflecting speculative short-term interest.
He said the broader trend remains uncertain, with investors showing caution ahead of key developments. “We advise maintaining a defensive approach and avoiding aggressive exposure for now,” he said. “Risk management is crucial amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic headwinds.”
WorldCall Telecom remained the volume leader with 239.756 million shares, which closed lower by one paisa to Rs1.61 per share. Pervez Ahmed Co, with 97.496 million shares, followed it, which closed lower by 5 paisas to Rs3.88 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included Sui South Gas, Ist Capital Sec, BO Punjab, Bank Makramah, Kohinoor Spinning, Prud Mod1st, PIA Holding Company, and First Dawood Prop.         In the futures market, 317 companies recorded trading, 125 of which increased, 189 decreased and 3 remained unchanged.

REER index depreciates to 97.8 in May,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322214-reer-index-depreciates-to-97-8-in-may,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate (REER) fell to 97.8 in May, down from 99.3 in the previous month, data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) showed on Tuesday.
Both the Pakistani rupee’s depreciation and lower inflation compared to trading partners have contributed to the decline in the REER index in recent months, according to Optimus Capital Management in a brief note.
REER shows the competitiveness of the local currency against its trading partners.The rupee continued to weaken, closing at 283.41 per dollar in the interbank market, compared with Monday’s close of 283.17. In the open market, the rupee fell to 285.4, down from 284.34 in the previous trading session.
Analysts said that the local currency was under pressure due to concerns about the impact of fluctuations in global commodity markets, exacerbated by the current conflict between Israel and Iran, on Pakistan’s inflation and external sector outlook.
“Investor sentiment remains cautious, particularly due to concerns over oil prices and their potential impact on the broader macroeconomic landscape. Interestingly, despite the geopolitical tensions, oil prices have remained relatively stable so far, with no significant spike witnessed,” said Chase Securities.

"Retailers seek revisions to e-commerce, retail tax measures in Finance Bill 2025-26",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322215-retailers-seek-revisions-to-e-commerce-retail-tax-measures-in-finance-bill-2025-26,"LAHORE: The Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP) has expressed serious concern over the lack of meaningful retail tax reforms in the Finance Bill 2025-26, warning that several compliance-heavy proposals targeting domestic e-commerce could inadvertently damage the formal retail sector and derail momentum in Pakistan’s emerging digital economy.
While endorsing the government’s objectives of broadening the tax base and formalising the economy, CAP maintains that inconsistent and short-term policymaking has unfairly burdened tax-compliant retailers already integrated with the Federal Board of Revenue’s Point of Sale (POS) system. It also highlighted the absence of a clear, three-to-five-year taxation roadmap developed in consultation with stakeholders, which continues to fuel uncertainty in the sector.
“This year, the retail ecosystem hoped for a strategic, long-term approach in the Finance Bill,” said CAP Chairperson Asfandyar Farrukh. “Instead, we see a repetition of past practices. Our proposals to support formal retail growth and encourage broader documentation have been ignored.”
Despite its growing contributions, organised retail accounts for only 10 per cent of Pakistan’s retail and wholesale trade -- considerably below the 15-20 per cent share seen in comparable economies. CAP argues that informal competition, rising compliance costs and unbalanced enforcement are suppressing the sector’s growth, investment and employment potential.
CAP Patron-in-Chief Tariq Mehboob noted that last year’s withdrawal of the GST concession for customers of tax-compliant retailers further tilted the playing field in favour of the informal sector. He added that government initiatives such as the Tajir Dost scheme had failed due to poor planning and a lack of consultation with key stakeholders. There is still time, he said, to revisit and revise the Finance Bill before it is finalised; without such action, the country risks missing yet another year of genuine reform.
To encourage digital payments and strengthen documentation, CAP has proposed a reduced GST rate for consumers transacting digitally with any retailer, regardless of business size. It argues that these rates, supported by simplified compliance mechanisms and built on successful provincial-level incentives, would reduce costs, foster formalisation and help shift the economy away from cash dependency.
In parallel, CAP has suggested introducing a fixed quarterly advance income tax regime for small retailers. This would be payable via branchless banking channels and adjustable against annual tax filings. The association believes that a stable three-to-five-year tax framework -- combined with positive incentives such as cashback rewards and fast-track services at NADRA offices and passport centres -- would help build trust and encourage SME registration across the country.
Citing data from the State Bank of Pakistan, CAP noted that the country’s e-commerce sector is growing by more than 35 per cent annually, empowering over 100,000 micro and small sellers, generating jobs in technology and logistics, and facilitating over Rs538 billion in digital payments in 2024 alone.
The association welcomed progressive steps such as the introduction of a 5.0 per cent digital presence levy on imported goods sold via foreign platforms like Temu, as well as the implementation of transaction-level reporting to improve documentation within the sector.
However, CAP cautioned that other tax compliance measures proposed in the Finance Bill risk reversing these gains. It raised particular concern over the blanket imposition of sales tax withholding on already documented businesses -- without allowing for input tax adjustments -- as well as the mandatory sales tax registration for micro-sellers, which could disproportionately impact youth-led and women-led entrepreneurial ventures. CAP also criticised the proposed introduction of a complex, multi-rate income tax withholding structure affecting digital platforms, payment service providers and courier companies, arguing that such policies would create operational bottlenecks, complicate payment recovery and raise compliance costs throughout the value chain.
In its statement, CAP urged the Ministry of Finance, the Federal Board of Revenue, and the Ministry of Commerce to pause the implementation of these measures and immediately initiate consultations with a broad range of stakeholders, particularly online sellers, digital platforms, and service providers. Among its key recommendations, CAP suggested limiting the 2.0 per cent sales tax withholding to sellers not appearing on the Active Taxpayers List (ATL); recognising income tax registration as sufficient compliance for small, home-based online sellers; adopting a simplified, single-rate income tax withholding structure at 0.25 per cent; and restructuring the penalty regime in a way that promotes, rather than punishes, compliance. It further recommended rationalising provincial-level taxes on essential digital services and allowing a transition period of at least two to three months to enable e-commerce businesses to adjust to the proposed regulations.

FPCCI warns of shutdown over business harassment,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322216-fpcci-warns-of-shutdown-over-business-harassment,"LAHORE: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), the country’s top business body, has strongly opposed the recently introduced Section 37AA, which authorises the arrest of business owners under tax laws.
Addressing a press conference at the FPCCI office in Lahore, President Atif Ikram Sheikh, UBG Patron-in-Chief SM Tanveer, Vice Presidents Zaki Ijaz and Tariq Jadoon, along with other senior business leaders, condemned what they described as growing harassment of the business community.
“We are prepared to shut down our factories and hand over the keys to the government,” said Sheikh. “We are willing to cooperate, but not under threats and fear.”The FPCCI called for urgent economic relief measures, including reducing electricity tariffs to 9 cents per unit, reversing the 18 per cent sales tax on solar systems, restoring the final tax regime (FTR), reinstating the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) in its original form, and cutting interest rates in light of falling inflation.
The federation has given the government a seven-day deadline to act. An eight-member committee, led by President Sheikh and comprising senior figures such as Zubair Tufail, Mian Zahid Hussain, and representatives from Sialkot, Faisalabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has been formed to engage in negotiations.The FPCCI also plans to raise the matter directly with the prime minister.

Exporters warn budget measures threaten $11bn value-added sector,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322217-exporters-warn-budget-measures-threaten-11bn-value-added-sector,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s $11 billion value-added export industry -- contributing nearly one-third of the country’s total exports -- has issued an urgent appeal to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, warning that recent budgetary measures risk derailing the sector at a critical juncture.
In a joint statement, the Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA), alongside leading export-oriented associations including PHMA, SIMAP, PSGMEA, PGMEA, PLGMEA, PCSUMEA, and the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce, demanded the immediate reinstatement of the final tax regime (FTR) and the restoration of the export facilitation scheme (EFS) to its original structure.
The appeal was backed by industry leaders, including PRGMEA Chairperson Dr Muhammad Ayyaz Uddin; former central chairperson of PRGMEA Sohail A Sheikh; President of the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Ikram ul Haq; Chairperson of PSGMEA Khawaja Masud Akhtar -- whose company’s footballs are used in FIFA World Cup tournaments; Chairperson of SIMAP Zeeshan Tariq, Chairperson of PLGMEA Syed Ahtisham Mazhar; Chairperson of PHMA Abdul Hameed; former chairperson of PHMA Khawaja Mushraf; Chairperson of PGMEA Annas Raheel Barlas; Chairperson of PCSUMEA Muhammad Jamal Bhutta, as well as Majid Bhutta, Ansar Aziz Puri, Sheikh Luqman Amin and other prominent exporters.
They expressed serious concern that despite the government’s rhetoric around “export-led growth”, the practical measures fall far short. “The government consistently claims to support exports, but in reality, no department appears aligned with this goal,” they stated.
They noted that during the entire budget speech, the finance minister mentioned the word “export” only once -- and that too in a negative context while announcing duties on imported yarn under the EFS.
Addressing the prime minister directly, the joint statement urged the prime minister “to intervene without delay. If the current situation continues, Pakistan’s most dependable source of foreign exchange will face irreversible harm.”
They warned that in the present policy environment, the government’s “Uraan Pakistan” vision of boosting exports to $100 billion is unattainable.
The exporters clarified: “We are not seeking subsidies, exemptions or special treatment -- only a level playing field to compete globally. Current policies have significantly raised the cost of doing business and eroded ease of doing business.”
They called for urgent action to rebuild industry confidence and streamline procedures. “International buyers are demanding long-term clarity and consistency in the EFS framework. Pakistan is strategically positioned to benefit from global shifts away from China -- this opportunity must not be lost.”
They said the abolition of the FTR and the breakdown of the EFS had thrown the industry into disarray. The FTR, once a simple and predictable tax mechanism, has been replaced by cumbersome procedures, audits and refund delays -- particularly harming small and medium-sized exporters.
Meanwhile, the EFS -- previously essential for importing raw materials not produced locally or required by international buyers from nominated suppliers -- has been burdened with excessive conditions, restricting access to critical inputs and damaging export competitiveness.
Business leaders stressed that Pakistan must move beyond reliance on cotton and embrace a diversified, innovation-driven approach to value-added apparel exports.
“We do not have time for bureaucratic delays when international buyers are waiting. These policy shifts are making us uncompetitive, raising costs, and driving us out of global markets,” they said. The consequences, they warned, would be cancelled orders, factory closures, and widespread job losses.
The exporters reiterated that restoring the original FTR and EFS mechanisms would not cost the government anything, but would directly bolster exports and increase foreign exchange inflows. “This is not merely about survival -- it is about Pakistan’s economic stability. We are united and ready to cooperate, but we require urgent and decisive action from the government.”
“Pakistan stands at a crossroads. With the right policy support, our exporters can generate growth, employment, and stability. But time is running out -- and the damage has already begun.”

Prolonged Israel-Iran conflict could derail Pakistan’s economic stability,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322218-prolonged-israel-iran-conflict-could-derail-pakistan-s-economic-stability,"LAHORE: If the Israel-Iran conflict continues and global oil and shipping prices remain elevated, Pakistan’s economy could face significant external shocks.
Such a development could undermine key assumptions underpinning the budget, affect its implementation, and alter the expected outcomes of levies such as the petroleum development levy and the proposed climate tax. The budget appears to rely on the assumption of stable or slightly declining international oil prices to meet macroeconomic projections, including inflation, the fiscal deficit and the trade gap.
A sustained spike in global oil prices -- possibly pushing Brent crude to $90-$100 per barrel or more -- would increase the cost of imports, devalue the rupee and jeopardise fuel subsidy forecasts. This scenario would also distort the projected import bill and adversely affect inflation and interest rate trajectories. The State Bank of Pakistan, in its latest monetary policy announcement on Monday, chose to maintain the policy rate at 11 per cent, despite earlier expectations of a rate cut prior to the escalation in Middle East tensions.
The proposed increase in the petroleum levy -- from Rs60 to Rs100 per litre -- would become politically difficult to implement. Even without this hike, a combination of rising global oil prices and a weakening rupee could see petrol and diesel prices climb to Rs310-330 per litre. With the full levy increase, prices could exceed Rs350 per litre, potentially triggering public backlash and protests, particularly from the transport sector. This would likely fuel an inflationary spiral, as elevated fuel prices ripple through the broader economy.
The government may be compelled to phase in the petroleum levy or delay it altogether, depending on how the oil markets evolve in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, the proposed 2.5 per cent climate tax on electricity and other items -- an indirect and regressive measure -- would further raise utility costs. With energy prices already elevated, any additional pass-through resulting from oil and gas hikes would add to the burden, intensifying load-shedding and worsening the circular debt crisis. While the government may still move ahead with these plans, pressure from industry groups and political allies could lead to revisions or delays, particularly if international energy prices remain high.
An extended conflict would drive up prices of imported oil and LNG, pushing inflation back into double digits despite the current tight monetary stance. If fiscal measures like the petroleum levy are rolled back under political pressure, revenue shortfalls may force the government to borrow more or delay development spending. In such a scenario, the IMF may insist on alternative tax measures or expenditure cuts to ensure targets remain on track.
Even if the Israel-Iran conflict does not escalate into a full-scale war, another week of heightened tensions could have a substantial impact on commodity prices. Iran controls access to the Strait of Hormuz, through which nearly 20 per cent of global oil supply passes. This chokepoint introduces a “risk premium” into oil futures. Should tensions persist, prices could rise by $3-$10 per barrel depending on developments such as missile strikes, tanker seizures, or disruptions to shipping.
As a key OPEC+ member, any disruption to Iranian oil exports -- whether through conflict or renewed US sanctions -- would further tighten global supply. LNG shipments from Qatar may also be affected if vessels perceive heightened risks in the Gulf. Meanwhile, gold and silver typically benefit from increased demand during geopolitical uncertainty.
The conflict could also erode investor appetite for risk, leading to weaker prices for commodities like copper, aluminium and zinc, especially if global economic slowdown becomes a concern. However, short-term supply chain disruptions could produce price spikes in certain industrial materials.
Although Iran and Israel are not major exporters of food grains, any disruptions to shipping through the Red Sea or the Strait of Hormuz could increase freight costs globally, raising the prices of commodities such as grain, sugar, and edible oils. Countries like Pakistan, India and China may see volatility in prices of palm oil, wheat, and pulses, depending on changes in shipping routes and insurance premiums. Industrial raw materials -- including petrochemicals and fertilisers -- would also face upward pressure due to higher input costs.

"UK automakers cheer US trade deal, as steel tariffs left in limbo",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322219-uk-automakers-cheer-us-trade-deal-as-steel-tariffs-left-in-limbo,"LONDON: Britain’s auto sector on Tuesday welcomed news that the US and UK have agreed to implement key parts of their tariff-cutting trade deal, as levies on steel remain.
US President Donald Trump signed off on the first truce in his trade offensive on Monday, on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada.The agreement will slash tariffs on British carmakers by the end of June and remove them completely on British aerospace imports.
Britain in return has agreed to open its markets to US beef, other farm goods and ethanol.“This is great news for the UK automotive industry, helping the sector avoid the severest level of tariffs and enabling many manufacturers to resume deliveries imminently,” said Mike Hawes, chief executive at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Tariffs of 25 per cent on the UK steel industry remain however, despite a bilateral agreement in May to completely remove the levy for British aluminium. “We are still working at pace to make sure we can address the issue of tariffs for the steel industry,” British Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told Sky News on Tuesday.
According to the Financial Times, talks have stalled because a significant portion of British steel is processed using imported materials.Trump in June increased tariffs on aluminium and steel imports to 50 per cent from 25 per cent for other key trading partners around the world.

SITE Association criticises SBP’s decision to hold policy rate at 11pc,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322220-site-association-criticises-sbp-s-decision-to-hold-policy-rate-at-11pc,"KARACHI: The SITE Association of Industry has voiced strong disappointment over the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) decision to maintain the policy rate at 11 per cent in its latest monetary policy announcement.
President of the SITE Association Ahmad Azeem Alvi said the central bank had missed a critical opportunity to reduce the rate to single digits. He noted that even a modest cut of 2.0 per cent would have sent a much-needed positive signal to the business community, particularly in the wake of the recently announced federal budget. He stressed the urgent need for the government to engage qualified economic advisers who understand both macroeconomic principles and ground realities. This, he said, is essential for achieving economic stability without harming trade and industry.
“If positive decisions are taken, they will yield positive results and generate goodwill,” he added.Alvi expressed hope that the SBP would consider bringing the policy rate down to single digits in its next monetary policy announcement.

Pakistan marks its first-ever conviction for insider trading,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322222-pakistan-marks-its-first-ever-conviction-for-insider-trading,"KARACHI: Sindh Special Court (Offences in Banks) handed out the first-ever conviction for insider trading in a case filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the commission said in a press release on Tuesday.
The court convicted Zakir Hussain Somji of insider trading in violation of Section 128 of the Securities Act, 2015.Chairperson of the SECP Akif Saeed applauded the legal team, adding that the judgment will boost investor confidence in Pakistan’s capital markets and, in turn, facilitate capital formation. He also expressed hope that the ruling will set a precedent for pending cases and ongoing inquiries into insider trading and market manipulation.
The case originated from the SECP’s inspection of suspicious trading activity identified through analysis of Karachi Automated Trading System (KATS) data from January 1, 2014 to February 2, 2016. It was suspected that the accused, by virtue of his position at a financial institution, misused insider information for personal gain.
An investigation revealed that the accused purchased 11,795,100 shares of various companies. Through a small fraction of his investment (10.43 per cent), he earned an unlawful profit of Rs2,866,646.
Following the investigation, the SECP filed a formal complaint under Section 128, punishable under Section 159 of the Securities Act, 2015. After a full trial and hearing arguments from the SECP’s Special Public Prosecutors and the defence, the Special Court delivered its judgment on June 14.
The court imposed a penalty of Rs8,599,938 -- three times the unlawful gain. The amount is to be deposited within seven days, failing which the convict will be remanded to jail until full payment is made.

Samsonova downs Osaka as Keys crashes out in Berlin,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322239-samsonova-downs-osaka-as-keys-crashes-out-in-berlin,"BERLIN: Russia´s Liudmila Samsonova came from behind to beat Naomi Osaka while Australian Open winner Madison Keys crashed out in the first round of the Berlin Open on Tuesday.
World number 20 Samsonova, who won the tournament in 2021, edged past the four-time Grand Slam champion 3-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-4. Samsonova´s victory sets up a last-16 clash with American world number three Jessica Pegula on Wednesday.
“I was just trying to fight until the end,” Samsonova said of her struggles early in the match, adding she wanted “to push and try to find my game.” Osaka broke her opponent twice in the opening set but Samsonova held her serve throughout the second before winning the final five points of a tie-break.
Both exchanged breaks in the final set before the Russian 26-year-old broke a second time, putting her on track for victory. Former world number one Osaka´s defeat is the latest setback in her comeback since returning from maternity leave last year, having also lost in the first round of the French Open.
Sixth-ranked Keys also failed to make it past the opening round, losing to 2023 Wimbledon winner Marketa Vondrousova 7-5, 7-6 (8/6). The victory was Vondrousova´s first over a top-10 opponent this year as she battles her way back from a shoulder injury.
One of the oldest women´s tournaments in the world, the Berlin Open switched from clay to grass courts in 2021 and has since become a popular warm-up event for Wimbledon, which starts at the end of the month.
World number four Zheng Qinwen pulled out of the tournament through injury on Tuesday. She was replaced by lucky loser Ashlyn Krueger, who faces 2022 Wimbeldon champion Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan.
The top four seeds at the tournament, including French Open winner Coco Gauff and runner-up Aryna Sabalenka, along with Pegula and Jasmine Paolini, all enter at the last-16 stage on Wednesday.

"Roma not aiming for Serie A title ‘but you never know’, says Gasperini",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322240-roma-not-aiming-for-serie-a-title-but-you-never-know-says-gasperini,"MILAN: Gian Piero Gasperini said Tuesday he does not expect Roma can challenge for the Serie A title in his first season after leaving Atalanta “but you never know”.
The 67-year-old has replaced local hero Claudio Ranieri in the Roma dugout and is gunning for a first top-four finish since 2018. “Our best result would be Champions League qualification. Right now Roma can´t win the Scudetto but you never know,” Gasperini told reporters.
“My goal is to make this team better... create a strong core group of players who can give us consistency, and form the basis into which the following season you can add more players who raise the level. That´s the first thing I´m aiming for.”
Gasperini turned Bergamo club Atalanta from provincial also-rans in the shadow of the Milan giants down the road to one of Italy´s best teams and even Europa League winners last year. He signed a three-year contract with Roma, one of Italy´s biggest clubs with a large and passionate support but who have only won Serie A three times, the last coming exactly 24 years ago on Tuesday.
They have been overtaken by fierce rivals Napoli whose recent Scudetto triumph took their tally to four, and two in the past three seasons. Roma finished fifth last season and missed out on the Champions League on the final day of the campaign after Ranieri came out of retirement to drag them away from near the relegation places.
Gasperini chose Roma over Juventus who tried to convince him to move to Turin after failing to snatch club icon Antonio Conte from Napoli. Ranieri will work alongside Gasperini and Roma´s American owners the Friedkin Group, and he confirmed to reporters that sporting director Florent Ghisolfi will be replaced.
“The club is assessing a few names, you will know as soon as possible the next sporting director,” said Ranieri. Gasperini is a spiky character prone to angry outbursts at journalists and he will have to deal with both an expectant, highly-strung fan base and an intense media environment in the Italian capital.
There are a slew of radio stations, websites and even a daily newspaper entirely dedicated to Roma, which have caused bust-ups with previous coaches and can create enormous pressure if results are not good.
“Ever since I arrived people have been warning me about the atmosphere here in Rome, that it´s a difficult place to obtain yor goals, football-wise, for a whole different range of reasons,” said Gasperini.
“I believe that this should be a strength rather than a weakness. There are a lot of you, and then people talk about the radio stations and the pressure. “What I see is great enthusiasm, a great passion for football and a huge desire to reach certain goals. I think all that energy needs to be channelled in the right direction.”
Roma begin their first Serie A season under Gasperini with the visit of Bologna, currently scheduled for Sunday August 24, while the first Rome derby of the season comes in the fourth week of the campaign.

Pak cueists’ global participation uncertain as PBSA faces financial crisis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322241-pak-cueists-global-participation-uncertain-as-pbsa-faces-financial-crisis,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Billiards and Snooker Association (PBSA) has plunged into a severe financial crisis, threatening the participation of Pakistani cueists in upcoming international competitions.
In a statement issued on Monday, the PBSA appealed to the federal government to take immediate notice of the situation and release urgently needed funds before the start of the 2025–26 snooker season.
“The Association is just around the corner to start its snooker season for the fiscal year 2025–2026 with a critical financial situation,” the PBSA said. The statement revealed that the PBSA had self-financed Pakistan’s participation in four major international events over the past year — held in Mongolia, Qatar, Sri Lanka, and the IBSF World Championship. However, without government support, future participation remains uncertain.
The association expressed concern over sending its players to key international events this season, including the Asian Team & 6 Red Championship in Sri Lanka later this month, the Commonwealth Championship in Mauritius in July, and the World Games in China scheduled for August.
“Due to the present situation prevailing, the PBSA foresees difficult times ahead to fulfill its international commitments for the year 2025–2026,” the statement warned, adding that the domestic snoo-ker circuit and secretariat operations are also at risk.
Despite strong performances by national players, the PBSA said it is still awaiting the release of special grants needed to cover international expenses. It called on the Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) to intervene. “This will enable the Association to start the current snooker season with a firm commitment to further promote the game of snooker in Pakistan,” the PBSA added.

Club World Cup ‘tough’ but ‘beautiful’ for Mamelodi Sundowns,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322242-club-world-cup-tough-but-beautiful-for-mamelodi-sundowns,"Orlando, United States: Mamelodi Sundowns coach Miguel Cardoso knows the Club World Cup will be a huge test of his side´s credentials and said Monday making it out of the group stage would be “an incredible achievement” as they prepare for their opening game.
“I don´t believe there is one single team before the competition that doesn´t believe they can make the next stage,” Cardoso said when asked about his team´s tournament prospects ahead of their Group F clash with Ulsan HD of South Korea.
“Obviously for us it would be an incredible achievement to go through the group stage but before we achieve that we need to get points so we need to play a very complete match tomorrow.”
Perennial South African champions Sundowns qualified for FIFA´s lucrative new tournament on the back of their record over the last four years in African competitions. However, they travelled to the United States still reeling after losing to Pyramids of Egypt in the final of the CAF Champions League two weeks ago.
Putting in a good showing in a group also featuring German giants Borussia Dortmund and Brazilian powerhouses Fluminense would help make up for that disappointment. “I know it´s going to be tough but I expect it to be beautiful,” said the 53-year-old Portuguese Cardoso, who has also coached in France, Spain, Greece and Tunisia. “We need to take it to the limit. There is a ceiling you need to go through at this Club World Cup.
“We need to understand what level we are playing at, and now just show what we can do and take the results as they come.”
After Sundowns meet Ulsan in Orlando they will head to Cincinnati to face Dortmund this weekend before taking on Fluminense in Miami on June 25. “I am pretty excited to see an African team against an Asian team and am curious to see how we deal with playing Dortmund and a Brazilian team,” Cardoso said. “It´s three different tests and in the end they should all help us develop.”

New Zealand women’s captain Sophie Devine to retire from ODIs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322244-new-zealand-women-s-captain-sophie-devine-to-retire-from-odis,"Wellington: New Zealand women´s cricket captain Sophie Devine said Tuesday that she will retire from one-day internationals after the World Cup later this year, adding it was the “right time” to step away.
Devine, who has been captain since 2020, led New Zealand to T20 World Cup glory last year in Dubai. “It feels like the right time for me to start stepping away,” said the 35-year-old Devine, who has played in 152 ODIs and 146 T20 internationals.
“It´s important that everyone knows I´m focused and dedicated to giving this group everything I can before I step away. “I´m really excited by where this young group´s going and I´m looking forward to playing my part in the next six to nine months.”
Devine, who will remain available to play T20 internationals, took a break from international cricket earlier this year to prioritise her mental health, having taken two months out in 2021 for similar reasons. The Women´s World Cup will be played in India and Sri Lanka from September until November.

Chelsea defeat LAFC in poorly-attended Club World Cup opener,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322245-chelsea-defeat-lafc-in-poorly-attended-club-world-cup-opener,"Atlanta: Chelsea kicked off their Club World Cup campaign with a solid 2-0 victory over Los Angeles FC on Monday in Group D, although there were nearly 50,000 empty seats in the stadium in Atlanta.
Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez´s goals got the Blues off to a good start in a competitive clash against one of the three qualified MLS teams. New signing Liam Delap made his debut as a substitute and helped set up Fernandez´s strike, with Chelsea hoping to go far after their UEFA Conference League triumph and Champions League qualification, looking to re-establish themselves among the elite.
After a solid start to the tournament regarding attendance numbers over the opening weekend, a sparse crowd of just over 22,000 settled in at the stylish 71,000 capacity Mercedes-Benz Stadium.
Behind former Tottenham Hotspur stopper Hugo Lloris´ goal in the first half, a couple of hundred LAFC ´ultras´ helped provide an atmosphere with a drum beat and constant song. Although the closed stadium roof offered refuge from the Georgia humidity and mid-afternoon summer sun which Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid stars roasted under on Sunday at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, the attendance suffered badly because of the 3:00 pm local time kick-off.
Despite regular strong crowds for MLS side Atlanta United, the best supported US team, few locals decided to take a Monday off work for the tournament´s first weekday afternoon game, seemingly chosen to suit a British television audience.
After beating Club America in a play-off to qualify for the competition as late as May, LAFC took the place of the banned Mexican side Club Leon, and play none of their three group games in California.
The top ring of the stadium was entirely shut and other levels were only partly filled, despite ticket prices dropping in the days ahead of the game. Lloris rated his team´s chances against Chelsea as “really thin” on the eve of the game and was called into action several times as the Blues took control from the start.
The French stopper saved from Nicolas Jackson and then Noni Madueke after the Senegalese forward set him up, while Cole Palmer whistled a strike narrowly over. With new signing Delap looking on from the bench, Jackson played like a man determined to keep his starting spot.
The striker was instrumental in Neto´s opener, releasing the Portuguese winger with an excellent through ball. Neto chopped in the box to leave LA defender Ryan Hollingshead stumbling helplessly out of sight and then buried a powerful strike past Lloris low at the near post.
Former Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud came on at half-time for the Americans, hoping to threaten Robert Sanchez´s goal more than Steve Cherundolo´s team managed in the first half.
Jackson came close with a header and LA almost levelled but Sanchez made a fine save with his outstretched leg to thwart 2023 MLS golden boot winner Denis Bouanga after he shook off Neto. Maresca brought on 22-year-old striker Delap for his Chelsea debut after the hour mark, having begun the game with all of the club´s new faces on the bench.
The forward drove into space and tried to tee up Fernandez with a promising first move in a Chelsea shirt since his arrival from relegated Ipswich Town. Chelsea star Palmer, who had shown occasional flashes of brilliance, hammered over.
LA threatened increasingly, with Marc Cucurella blocking well from David Martinez, before Fernandez grabbed Chelsea´s second. Running into the six-yard box the Argentine midfielder controlled Delap´s cross from the right and beat Lloris to put the game to bed. Elsewhere in Group D Esperance Tunis face Brazil´s Flamengo later on Monday.

"PSB serves legal notice on POA, OCA-recognised federation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322247-psb-serves-legal-notice-on-poa-oca-recognised-federation,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) has served a legal notice on the President Bodybuilding Federation recognized by the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) and the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).
In a notice served to federation President Tariq Pervez, the PSB has warned him against using the title of ‘Pakistan’. The PSB is gearing up to hold the bodybuilding federation elections on June 20. In response, the POA has written a letter to all the bodybuilding federation’s affiliated units against participating in these elections.
“We have written a letter to all the affiliated units against participating in such elections that do not have the POA’s backing,” a POA official, when contacted, said. The PSB in its legal notice served on Tariq Pervez states that non-affiliated entity, presenting itself as the “Pakistan Bodybuilding and Fitness Federation,” is misusing the name “Pakistan” in its operations, promotional activities, social media, and other materials, despite not being affiliated with or recognized by the PSB.
The notice highlighted that this act constitutes a serious violation of the PSB Constitution and national laws, and misleads athletes, sponsors, institutions, and the general public. Such conduct creates confusion regarding the official status of the organization and undermines the integrity of the national sports governance structure, potentially resulting in reputational and legal complications.
The notice further clarified that the Pakistan Sports Board is the sole competent authority to register and recognize national sports federations in the country. “No organization can claim to represent Pakistan in any sport without PSB’s prior approval or formal recognition,” the legal notice stated.
PSB has directed the concerned entity to immediately stop using the word “Pakistan” in its name and all related materials, and to remove all publications, signboards, websites, and social media content that give an impression of affiliation with PSB or the Government of Pakistan.
Furthermore, the organization has been strictly instructed not to make any future claims of being a national federation or representing Pakistan in any capacity.
The notice requires the submission of a written explanation and confirmation of compliance within seven (07) days from the date of receipt.
Failure to comply will compel the Pakistan Sports Board to initiate appropriate legal and administrative action, which may include approaching relevant courts, the Pakistan Telecommunication Auth-ority (PTA), and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for regulatory intervention. Despite efforts, Tariq Pervez was not available for his comments.

Record stand puts Bangladesh in command in first Sri Lanka Test,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322248-record-stand-puts-bangladesh-in-command-in-first-sri-lanka-test,"Galle, Sri Lanka: A record-breaking fourth-wicket partnership between captain Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mushfiqur Rahim put Bangladesh in control at 292-3 on day one of the first Test against Sri Lanka on Tuesday.
After a wobbly start at Galle, the pair stitched together 247 runs -- the highest fourth-wicket stand for Bangladesh in Tests against Sri Lanka -- steering the tourists to a commanding position at stumps.
Having elected to bat first, Bangladesh were reeling at 45-3 when the duo came together. What followed was a gritty rescue act -- a partnership built on sound temperament, clever shot selection and an unflinching resolve as they dug their team out of early trouble.
Mushfiqur, the most capped Test player in Bangladesh history with 97 appearances, silenced his critics with a timely ton. The veteran, under the pump after a lean patch spanning 13 innings without a half-century, rolled back the years with a knock of poise and purpose.
The 38-year-old has fond memories of Galle, having struck a monumental double hundred there in 2013, and once again turned tormentor-in-chief for the Sri Lankan bowlers. He did enjoy a slice of luck -- a tough chance spilled by debutant Tharindu Rathnayake on 25 -- but made it count, navigating a nervy passage in the 90s, before scampering a quick single to notch up his 12th Test hundred.
Playing his third match in Galle, Rahim said he had “always done well” at the ground and it was “very pleasing to get another hundred here”. “We know that Galle always spins but for some reason when we have played here, we have been lucky to bat when conditions were good,” he said after the day´s play.
His partner, Shanto, positive from the outset, kept the scoreboard ticking with deft footwork and a keen eye for the loose ball. He brought up his sixth Test century -- and second against Sri Lanka -- with a cheeky paddle sweep off Prabath Jayasuriya, marking his first ton since November 2023.
Sri Lanka made early inroads with right-arm quick Asitha Fernando drawing first blood, removing opener Anamul Haque for a duck. Off-spinner Rathnayake, handed his Test cap on the back of a prolific domestic season, struck twice in quick succession. But once the Shanto-Mushfiqur duo got their eye in, it was one-way traffic. The match is the first in the new two-year World Test Championship cycle.
The second Test begins in Colombo on June 25.
Brief scores:
Bangladesh: 292-3 (Najmul Hossain Shanto 136 not out, Mushfiqur Rahim 105 not out)
Toss: Bangladesh

Alcaraz and Raducanu sign up for US Open mixed doubles,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322249-alcaraz-and-raducanu-sign-up-for-us-open-mixed-doubles,"New York: Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu plan to team up in a star-studded and radically overhauled US Open mixed doubles competition set to include most of the top men´s and women´s singles players.
Tournament organisers on Tuesday announced 16 pairings for the new-look format, with Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek all named on the entry list. US tennis chiefs announced sweeping changes to the mixed doubles earlier this year, unveiling plans to stage the competition as a standalone event in the week before the singles draws begin.
The tournament will be made up of 16 teams, with eight teams earning direct entry based on their combined singles ranking playing alongside eight wild-card entrants. “Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited,” said Lew Sherr, the CEO and executive director of the United States Tennis Association. “It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.”

Hockey clubs’ activities hit hard by ground fee hike,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322250-hockey-clubs-activities-hit-hard-by-ground-fee-hike,"ISLAMABAD: The government’s ongoing efforts to revive Pakistan’s national sport, hockey, have taken a major hit as the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) sharply increased usage charges for the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium -- shifting its focus from athletes’ development to revenue generation.
According to details, the PSB has raised the daily usage fee of the stadium in Islamabad from Rs1,500 to Rs5,700 -- a staggering hike of nearly 300% affecting registered hockey clubs in the federal capital.
In response, the affiliated clubs under the Islamabad Hockey Association (IHA) have written a letter to the Advisor to Prime Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) Rana Sanaullah and IPC Secretary Mohyuddin Wani, urging them to intervene and reverse the increase. They warned that the steep fee poses a serious financial burden on young players and grassroots training programs.
The clubs emphasized that this move directly contradicts the government’s declared commitment, especially by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, IPC Minister Sanaullah, and Secretary Mohyuddin Wani to promote and revive hockey at the grassroots level.
“The Rising Stars Hockey Club along with other clubs, have been actively promoting hockey by offering free training sessions for schools and colleges boys and girls over the past several years,” Club letter to the high-ups says.
The club stressed that such initiatives are crucial for youth development and for rebuilding Pakistan’s legacy in international hockey. “The youth are the future of Pakistan,” the letter stated, “and engaging them in structured, healthy activities like hockey is essential not just for personal growth but also for restoring the sport’s national pride.”
The letter concluded with a plea for immediate action, stressing that easing the financial burden on local clubs is key to sustaining the momentum for a national hockey revival. In response to the queries raised by local clubs over the recent increase in ground charges, the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) says that increase in charges was formally approved during the 33rd Board Meeting of the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) held on March 26, 2025. “These revised rates came into effect from March 28, 2025,” PSB says.

"Alcaraz wins testing Queen’s opener, Draper cruises",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322251-alcaraz-wins-testing-queen-s-opener-draper-cruises,"LONDON: Carlos Alcaraz came through a testing first-round match against Australia´s Adam Walton at Queen´s on Tuesday as the top seed returned to action for the first time since his dramatic French Open triumph.
The Spaniard, back on grass for the first time since winning his second Wimbledon title last year, beat his 86th-ranked opponent 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) on a sweaty day in west London. Alcaraz, who overcame Jannik Sinner in a five-set thriller at Roland Garros earlier this month, edged ahead after a hard-fought break in the seventh game of the first set.
Walton clung on his next service game but the 2023 Queen´s champion closed out the set on his own serve. The Australian rallied impressively and had two set points to level the match but could not covert either of them and Alcaraz pulled level at 5-5.
The second set went to a tie-break, which was a tight affair until a Walton backhand into the net gave Alcaraz two match points and he fired a forehand cross-court winner to progress. British second seed Jack Draper dispatched American Jenson Brooksby 6-3, 6-1 to reach the second round.
The left-hander, who has previously beaten Sinner and Alcaraz at Queen´s, won 93 percent of first-serve points and did not face a break point in a dominant display. Draper, who will be under huge pressure to perform in front of home fans at Wimbledon, is chasing his second title on grass after winning in Stuttgart last year.
He will next face Alexei Popyrin in the second round after the Australian beat compatriot Aleksandar Vukic. Earlier, Czech world number 30 Jiri Lehecka upset rusty fifth seed Alex de Minaur 6-4, 6-2 in the opening match on the Andy Murray Arena. Australia´s De Minaur, who was playing on grass for the first time this season, committed 28 unforced errors.

The Greenshirts began the match with high energy and dominance, taking the first two sets comfortably with scores of 25-18 and 25-12, thanks to clinical execution and tight defensive play.
However, Philippines bounced back in the third set, taking advantage of a few errors and winning it 25-18. Undeterred, Pakistan responded strongly in the fourth set, sealing the match with a hard-fought 25-22 win, demonstrating their resilience and teamwork.

France urged to apologise for Polynesia nuclear tests,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322322-france-urged-to-apologise-for-polynesia-nuclear-tests,"PARIS: Paris should apologise to French Polynesia for the fallout of nuclear tests there over three decades, which led to harmful radiation exposure, a French parliamentary report released on Tuesday said.
France conducted 193 nuclear tests in French Polynesia from 1966, especially at the Pacific archipelago´s Moruroa and Fangataufa atolls, to help build up its atomic weapon arsenal. These included atmospheric and underground tests which had severe health impacts.
Tens of thousands of people in the French overseas territory are estimated to have been exposed to harmful levels of radiation, leading to a significant public health crisis that has been largely ignored.
The tests remain a source of deep resentment in French Polynesia, where they are seen as evidence of racist colonial attitudes that disregarded the lives of islanders. “The inquiry has strengthened the committee´s conviction that a request for forgiveness from France to French Polynesia is necessary,” the report said.
“This request is not merely a symbol, nor a request for repentance. It must be a... fundamental step in the process of reconciliation between French Polynesia and the State,” the authors said.
The report said the apology must be added to a 2004 law on French Polynesia´s semi-autonomous status. Residents in the south Pacific Ocean islands are hoping for compensation for radiation victims.
The investigative website Disclose, citing declassified French military documents on the nearly 200 tests, reported in March that the impact from the fallout was far more extensive than authorities let on.

"Charred bodies, shattered lives after gunmen kill 100 in Nigeria",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322323-charred-bodies-shattered-lives-after-gunmen-kill-100-in-nigeria,"YELWATA, Nigeria: The gunmen attacked after dark and chased farmer Fidelis Adidi away from the central Nigerian village of Yelwata. The next morning he returned to find the charred remains of one of his two wives and four of his children.
They had been living in a room he had rented in the market, in an attempt to keep them safe from a wave of clashes between cattle herders and farmers in the country’s Middle Belt region. His second wife and another child were badly wounded in the assault that began on Friday night and, according to Amnesty International, killed around 100 people in the town in Benue region.
“My body is weak and my heart keeps racing,” the 37-year-old told Reuters as he stood outside the room, surveying the damage. “I lost five of my family members.” In another room in the market, bodies lay burned beyond recognition next to blackened piles of food and farm equipment.
Authorities have struggled to contain the violence that has simmered for years, fuelled by competition over land as well as ethnic and religious divisions. President Bola Tinubu - who called the recent upsurge in attacks “depressing” on Monday - is due to visit Benue on Wednesday, his first visit there since coming to office two years ago.

"UK parliament votes to decriminalise abortion, repeal Victorian-era law",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322324-uk-parliament-votes-to-decriminalise-abortion-repeal-victorian-era-law,"LONDON: Britain’s parliament voted on Tuesday to decriminalise abortion in England and Wales to stop a growing number of women from being investigated by police for terminating pregnancies under legislation dating back to the mid-19th century.
Abortions have been legal in England and Wales for almost 60 years but only up to 24 weeks and with the approval of two doctors. Women can face criminal charges if they decide to end a pregnancy after 24 weeks under a Victorian-era law that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
In Britain, criminal convictions for breaking this law are rare, but the number of prosecutions has increased following the Covid-19 pandemic when a change in the law allowed abortion pills to be taken at home to end pregnancies within 10 weeks of conception.
In a free vote in parliament, when politicians were not ordered to vote along party lines, lawmakers gave an initial approval by 379 votes to 137 for an amendment to stop prosecutions for women who end pregnancies in all circumstances.
Medical professionals who assist women in obtaining an abortion outside the 24-week limit could still face prosecution. The proposal could still be altered or even voted down as it is a part of a greater bill that is making its way through the House of Commons and the unelected upper chamber of parliament.
Labour Member of Parliament Tonia Antoniazzi, who proposed the amendment, said the current law had been used to investigate 100 women in the last five years, including some who had given birth prematurely or had been forced into abortions by abusive partners.
“Each one of these cases is a travesty enabled by our outdated abortion law,” she told parliament. “This is not justice, it is cruelty and it has got to end.” The vote was part of a broader government criminal justice bill that if passed in its entirety would bring the abortion laws in England and Wales in line with other Western countries including France, Canada and Australia.

Tom Cruise to receive honourary Oscar in career first,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322325-tom-cruise-to-receive-honourary-oscar-in-career-first,"LOS ANGELES, United States: US actor and film producer Tom Cruise will receive an honourary Oscar ahead of the 2026 Academy Awards, the organisers said on Tuesday, marking a career first for the Hollywood veteran.
Cruise was selected to receive a statuette for his contributions to cinema, along with choreographer Debbie Allen and production designer Wynn Thomas. Dolly Parton will also be awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her decades-long humanitarian work, with the trophies presented at the Academy´s 16th Governors Awards event in November. Cruise, 62, has had four Oscar nominations but has never won the prestigious prize, despite achieving global fame for his roles in action films “Mission: Impossible” and “Top Gun.”

Dutch suggest social media ban for under-15s,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322326-dutch-suggest-social-media-ban-for-under-15s,"THE HAGUE: The Dutch government on Tuesday advised parents to forbid children under 15 from using social media apps like TikTok and Snapchat, the latest country to propose curbs over mental health concerns.
The advice, which is non-binding, comes after Australia and New Zealand proposed social media bans for under-16s, and several European countries have issued similar guidelines. “Intensive screen and social media use can be bad for the (mental) health and development of children,” said the Dutch ministry for health, wellbeing and sport.
“Think of sleeping problems, panic attacks, depressive symptoms, reduced concentration and a negative self-image.” The ministry distinguished between smartphone use, messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal, and social media apps like TikTok. Children younger than their last year of primary school (typically 11 or 12) should not be allowed a smartphone, the government advised.
From secondary school (age 12 or 13), message apps should be permitted but no social media apps before 15, according to the guidelines. “A step-by-step approach helps: first learn to communicate via chat, then get acquainted with social media,” said the government. The ministry also issued guidelines on screen time: none at all before the age of two, while children over 12 should not be in front of a screen for more than three hours.

Hungary scraps campaign spending limits ahead of 2026 vote,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322327-hungary-scraps-campaign-spending-limits-ahead-of-2026-vote,"BUDAPEST: Hungarian lawmakers voted in favour on Tuesday of a law that ends limits on campaign spending, a measure critics say will allow Prime Minister Viktor Orban to reap unlimited contributions from his allies in elections set for 2026.
Since Orban´s return to power in 2010, Hungary´s governing coalition has frequently modified the country´s electoral system, prompting opposition groups to accuse it of changing democratic rules to their benefit.
Ahead of elections scheduled for spring 2026, recent surveys show Orban´s nationalist Fidesz party lagging behind the TISZA party of former government insider Peter Magyar, now a prominent opposition leader.
Spending limits until now were set at five million forints (12,380 euros) per candidate per campaign, a measure Orban introduced in 2013. The new amendment passed the 199-seat National Assembly on Tuesday with 133 votes in favour and 46 against.
The governing coalition argued that spending limits had become obsolete as “campaigning is increasingly taking place in the digital and online space, where national regulations cannot be enforced”.
The government also said scrapping the spending caps would level the playing field, claiming that in the 2022 elections, the opposition benefited from “foreign influence” via contributions that were not accounted for.
Several NGOs criticised the amendment. “Oligarchs who have enriched themselves with public money will be able to contribute unlimited funds as private individuals to the ruling parties´ campaigns,” the K-monitor anti-corruption group said before the vote.

"India regulator asks Air India for training data of pilots, dispatcher of crashed plane",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322328-india-regulator-asks-air-india-for-training-data-of-pilots-dispatcher-of-crashed-plane,"NEW DELHI: India’s aviation safety watchdog has asked Air India for the training records of the pilots and dispatcher for the plane that crashed last week as part of its investigation into the incident that killed at least 271 people, government memos showed.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation also asked all flying schools to conduct training compliance checks, according to the confidential memos, seen by Reuters. The DGCA said the requests were part of a “regulatory” review of the accident, and also sought details of action taken following the watchdog’s audits of Air India in the last few months. It asked for the details to be provided by Monday.
It was not clear whether Air India had complied with the directive. The airline and the DGCA did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London with 242 people on board began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday before crashing into nearby buildings. Everyone on board was killed, bar a single passenger, along with about 30 on the ground.

Russian strikes kill 16 in ‘horrific’ attack on Kyiv,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322329-russian-strikes-kill-16-in-horrific-attack-on-kyiv,"KYIV, Ukraine: Russia launched dozens of drones and missiles at Kyiv in the early hours of Tuesday, killing at least 16 people and wounding dozens of others, as negotiations between Kyiv and Moscow break down.
President Volodymyr Zelensky described the latest overnight barrage as “one of the most horrific attacks” on Kyiv since the Kremlin launched its brutal invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.
Zelensky said a total of 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched in the strikes nationwide and urged the international community not to “turn a blind eye”. Russian President Vladimir “Putin does this solely because he can afford to continue the war. He wants the war to go on,” he said.
AFP journalists saw smoke billowing over the capital´s skyline at dawn and a multiple-storey housing block gutted by the attack. Rescue workers were scrambling to find any survivors buried beneath the rubble.
“It was probably the most hellish night in my memory for our neighbourhood,” 20-year-old student Alina Shtompel told AFP. “It is indescribably painful that our people are going through this right now.”
More than three years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has stepped up attacks despite efforts by the United States to broker a ceasefire. Talks have stalled. Moscow has rejected the “unconditional” truce demanded by Kyiv and its European allies, while Ukraine has dismissed Russia´s demands as “ultimatums”.
Zelensky had been hoping to speak with US leader Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, but the US leader cut short his visit, amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.
Russia hit some 27 sites in Kyiv overnight and some residents were left without electricity, officials said. Tymur Tkachenko, the head of Kyiv´s military administration updated an earlier toll of 14 dead, saying two people had been pulled from the rubble at the scene of one strike.
“The search continues, as there may still be people under the ruins,” he said. One person was also killed and 10 wounded in the southern port city of Odesa, while attacks on the Sumy and Kherson regions later in the day killed two others, authorities said.
The Russian defence ministry said it had carried out precision strikes on “military-industrial facilities in the Kyiv region,” in a statement similar to those releases after major attacks. Germany vowed in response to “increase the pressure” on Russia. The strike showed that “Russia is using diplomacy merely as a facade,” the foreign ministry wrote on X. “Putin doesn´t want a solution, he wants capitulation.”
Dozens of residents took shelter in a metro station in central Kyiv, sleeping on mats, exchanging information on attack or reassuring pets, AFP journalists reported, while drones buzzed and explosions echoed out over the city.
“I was asleep. There was a loud bang. The window was smashed, and glass rained down on me,” Sergii, another Kyiv resident, said. Kyiv´s mayor reported earlier that a 62-year-old US citizen had died in a Russian strike on the capital´s Solomyansky district.
Zelensky´s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the new attacks showed Moscow was “continuing its war against civilians”. Tens of thousands of soldiers have been killed on both sides since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, according to independent monitors and Western intelligence agencies.

G7 rallies behind Ukraine after abrupt Trump exit,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322330-g7-rallies-behind-ukraine-after-abrupt-trump-exit,"KANANASKIS, Canada: Group of Seven powers, holding talks on Tuesday at a summit that Donald Trump left early, promised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fresh support as Russia stepped up attacks on its neighbour.
Prime Minister Mark Carney, the host of the summit, welcomed Zelensky and announced Can$2 billion ($1.47bn) of military support, including drones and helicopters, for Ukraine. “This underscores the importance of standing in total solidarity with Ukraine,” Carney told him.
“We underscored the importance of using maximum pressure against Russia, who has refused to come to the table,” Carney said.
Carney also announced a new Can$2.3 billion loan to Ukraine to help rebuild its infrastructure and public systems and joined Britain in tightening sanctions on Russia´s so-called shadow fleet of ships used to circumvent international sanctions on its oil sales.
Britain said it wanted to ramp up economic pressure to show Russian President Vladimir Putin it was in his interest to end the war. “These sanctions strike right at the heart of Putin´s war machine, choking off his ability to continue his barbaric war in Ukraine,” Prime Minister Keir Starmer said in a statement.
US lawmakers have also drafted a package of new sanctions on Russia but Trump has been hesitant, saying he wants to preserve relations with Putin, whom he spoke to by telephone on the eve of the G7 summit.
Trump infamously berated Zelensky in the Oval Office on February 28, saying he was ungrateful for US aid, but has since voiced disappointment that Putin has rebuffed a US proposal for at least a temporary ceasefire.
Zelensky, his voice choked with emotion, told Carney that the latest Russian attack was a “big tragedy” for Ukrainian families and it showed the need for allies´ support -- and made clear that he still backed Trump-led calls for negotiations. “It´s important for our soldiers to be strong in the battlefield -- to stay strong until Russia will be ready for the peace negotiations,” Zelensky said next to Carney.

Parliamentarians gathered in Strasbourg voted 599 to two to do away with time limits for victims to bring their abusers to justice. Last year the European Commission suggested setting a common minimum across Europe -- 20 or 30 years depending on the crime -- to allow equal access to justice, but lawmakers wanted to go further.
“There cannot be a deadline for justice when it comes to child sexual abuse,” said Dutch lawmaker Jeroen Lenaers, of the centre-right EPP group. The change to the commission proposal sets out the parliament´s position and will now have to be negotiated with member states.
Statutes of limitations vary widely among the EU´s 27 countries. Critics say short terms deprive victims of justice because many only speak up years later after the offence occurred and might find it impossible to mount a case.

Spain says ‘overvoltage’ caused huge April blackout,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322332-spain-says-overvoltage-caused-huge-april-blackout,"MADRID: A major power outage that paralysed the Iberian Peninsula in April was caused by “overvoltage” on the grid that triggered “a chain reaction”, according to a government report released on Tuesday.
The April 28 blackout had “multiple” causes, Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen told reporters, adding that the system “lacked sufficient voltage control capacity” that day. Overvoltage is when there is too much electrical voltage in a network, overloading equipment. Potential causes include surges in networks due to oversupply or lightning strikes, or when protective equipment is insufficient or fails.
When faced with overvoltage, protective systems shut down parts of the grid, potentially leading to widespread power outages. Aagesen singled out the role of Spanish grid operator REE and certain energy companies she did not name that disconnected their plants “inappropriately... to protect their installations”.
She also pointed to “insufficient voltage control capacity” on the system that day, due in part to a programming flaw, insisting that Spain´s grid was theoretically robust enough to handle such situations. Due to these misjudgements “we reached a point of no return with an uncontrollable chain reaction” that could only have been managed if steps had been taken beforehand to absorb the overvoltage problems, she added.
Asked if the head of the grid operator should resign, Aagesen said the report was “not any kind of trial. It set out to determine the causes and to make recommendations”. Authorities had scrambled to find answers after the outage cut internet and telephone connections, halted trains, shut businesses and plunged cities into darkness across Spain and Portugal as well as briefly affecting southwestern France.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced the formation of an inquiry commission led by the ecological transition ministry shortly after the blackout, urging residents not to speculate until detailed results were available.
He had warned that the probe´s conclusions could take several months given the complexity of the incident. The government, which has been mired in a corruption scandal involving a close aide of Sanchez, sped up the timeline in recent days.

"24 rescued as oil tankers collide off UAE, sparking fire",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322333-24-rescued-as-oil-tankers-collide-off-uae-sparking-fire,"DUBAI: At least 24 crew have been rescued after two oil tankers collided off the UAE, sparking at least one fire, the United Arab Emirates coastguard and a shipping company said on Tuesday.
British maritime security monitor Ambrey said the incident, which took place at a time of high tensions as an air war rages between nearby Iran and Israel, was “not security-related”. Shipping company Frontline said a fire was extinguished on its Front Eagle tanker after the collision with Adalynn, another oil transporter, 15 nautical miles off the UAE´s Gulf of Oman coast. “We are (also) aware of reports of a fire onboard the Adalynn following the collision,” a Frontline statement said, adding: “There have been no reports of pollution at this time.”
