India's role in South Asia: time to honour Delhi Agreement,"PL
The depiction of Pakistan as a perpetual antagonist gained momentum after the Kargil War
South Asia, with its intertwined histories and complex relationships, remains one of the most volatile regions in the world. The 1974 Delhi Agreement, signed between Pakistan, India and Bangladesh, was envisioned as a step towards lasting reconciliation, one that would help the nations move beyond historical grievances and forge a path toward cooperation.
However, decades later, rather than fostering regional stability, India has positioned itself as the dominant power, often at the expense of Pakistan. From perpetuating the terrorism narrative to influencing Bangladesh's policy against Pakistan, India's approach has largely contributed to the fragmentation of South Asian unity.
The latest military standoff between India and Pakistan, which erupted in May 2025, was yet another reminder of the fragile peace between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. The conflict began after India launched missile strikes on Pakistan, citing retaliation for an April 22 terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir that left 26 people dead.
Pakistan denied any involvement, but India proceeded with Operation Sindoor, targeting alleged militant infrastructure deep within Pakistani territory.
Pakistan responded with Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, striking Indian military sites in a show of force. The skirmishes escalated further, with both sides engaging in drone warfare, marking a new chapter in their military confrontations. The conflict ended with a US-brokered ceasefire, but the damage - both physical and diplomatic - was already done.
The depiction of Pakistan as a perpetual antagonist gained momentum after the Kargil War, when India aggressively pushed the idea that Pakistan was solely responsible for regional instability. Following the 2008 Mumbai attacks, this narrative reached new heights, with India successfully framing Pakistan as a state sponsor of terrorism in international forums.
This rhetoric served multiple purposes. Firstly, it justified India's refusal to engage in third-party mediation over Kashmir, despite Pakistan's repeated calls for international arbitration. Secondly, it enabled India to diminish the legitimacy of the Kashmiri freedom movement, recasting it as a product of Pakistan-based extremism rather than a genuine struggle for self-determination. Thirdly, it created an atmosphere in India that fostered hostility, ensuring that any peace initiatives would be met with suspicion or outright rejection by the Indian public.
Beyond its own borders, India actively exported this narrative to Bangladesh, a country with historical grievances against Pakistan dating back to 1971. India played a significant role in ensuring that Bangladesh remained firmly within its sphere of influence, cultivating an anti-Pakistan sentiment that has led to strained relations between Dhaka and Islamabad.
Under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's Awami League government, Bangladesh increasingly aligned itself with India's position. One of the most visible manifestations of this was the controversial war crimes trials that had targeted pro-Pakistan elements.
However, the political landscape in Bangladesh underwent a dramatic transformation in 2024 when mass protests and military intervention led to the ousting of Sheikh Hasina. The uprising, fueled by public dissatisfaction with her government's authoritarian policies and economic mismanagement, culminated in her exile to India. With Hasina gone, Bangladesh has taken significant steps to mend its relations with Pakistan, marking a new chapter in regional diplomacy.
The new Bangladeshi leadership has actively sought to rebuild ties with Islamabad, recognising the mutual benefits of economic and strategic cooperation. Trade agreements have been revisited, diplomatic channels reopened, and a renewed sense of partnership has emerged. This shift has not only strengthened Pakistan-Bangladesh relations but has also challenged India's long-standing influence over Dhaka.
India's influence over Bangladesh was evident in its support for Hasina's government, particularly in the controversial war crimes trials that targeted pro-Pakistan elements. India actively encouraged Bangladesh to distance itself from Pakistan, reinforcing the idea that Pakistan was the perpetual antagonist in South Asia.
Moreover, India's economic and military dominance left Bangladesh with little room to maneuver independently. Trade agreements, defence collaborations and diplomatic pressure ensured that Bangladesh remained within India's sphere of influence, often at the expense of its relations with Pakistan. However, with Hasina's removal, Bangladesh has begun to assert its independence, signaling a shift away from India's shadow.
India's strategy of isolating Pakistan and asserting its dominance in South Asia has reached a breaking point. The recent military conflict demonstrated that Pakistan is capable of defending itself, and India's aggressive posturing has only fueled instability. The Delhi Agreement was meant to foster cooperation, not perpetuate hostility. If India truly wishes to be a responsible regional power, it must abandon its antagonistic approach and engage in genuine dialogue.
Confidence-building measures, such as reopening diplomatic channels, restoring trade relations and allowing third-party mediation, could pave the way for a more stable South Asia. Instead of using neighbouring countries as a tool to weaken Pakistan, India should encourage regional unity based on mutual respect and shared economic interests.
India's role in South Asia has largely been defined by its desire for dominance. By fueling anti-Pakistan sentiment and leveraging neighbouring countries as a tool for regional influence, India has perpetuated instability rather than fostering cooperation. The time has come for India to rethink its strategy and embrace diplomacy over aggression.
Honouring the 1974 Delhi Agreement would be a step in the right direction — one that acknowledges the shared history of South Asia while paving the way for a future built on peace and mutual respect. The region's prosperity depends not on rivalry, but on the ability of its leaders to recognise that cooperation, not conflict, is the way forward.

Police claim 69% drop in serious crimes in Lahore,"US
Lahore DIG Operations Faisal Kamran announced while releasing the comparative crime statistics
The city police have claimed a 69 per cent reduction in major crimes over the past two years, with official data indicating a decline in robberies, kidnappings and vehicle thefts.
Lahore DIG Operations Faisal Kamran announced while releasing the comparative crime statistics for May 2023-25 that the number total reported crimes had plummeted from 6,836 in May 2023 to 2,136 last month.
The most striking improvements included robberies down by 83% from 1,305 to 357, motorcycle theft by 61%, and car snatching and dacoity eliminated.
""This is a validation of our data-driven policing model,"" DIG Kamran said, crediting the success to visible policing, technological integration and a crackdown on organised crimes.

Brutality behind rejection,"US
The Islamabad IG has rightly called this a case of 'repeated rejections'.
Another young woman has been silenced, not by society's disapproval of her ambitions, but by its refusal to protect her from male entitlement and rage. The brutal murder of 17-year-old social media influencer Sana Yousaf in Islamabad, allegedly by a man who could not handle rejection, is a terrifying reminder that Noor Mukadam was not a tragic anomaly, but a chilling precedent.
Sana, a teenager with a growing presence on TikTok and Instagram, had the right to chase her influencer dreams without fear of intimidation or harassment. But in Pakistan, a woman's visibility often becomes her vulnerability. Her very presence in the public eye — even digitally — is seen as an open invitation by men who equate admiration with ownership.
And when denied, they turn violent. The Islamabad IG has rightly called this a case of 'repeated rejections'. But one cannot ignore the undoing of a society that fosters impunity for such acts. The problem lies not only in the crime, but in the culture that enables it. We raise boys without teaching them boundaries.
We valorise hyper-masculine behaviour and mock the emotional vulnerability. We do not talk about consent — and when women enforce it, we call them arrogant or wayward.
It is time for state institutions to implement strict online surveillance mechanisms to monitor stalking, bullying and digital harassment. We do not need to wait for the violence to spill into the physical world before we act. Digital footprints can and must be tracked, and red flags raised early before lives are lost.
Cybercrime laws do exist, but enforcement is weak and inconsistent. Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram also lack sufficient local responsiveness. Moreover, in such cases, policing must be swift and firm. But justice cannot end at an arrest or a death sentence. It must include reform — of laws, of police procedures and, most importantly, of minds.

"Military notes; Indo-Pak conflict: deterrence, pre-battle manoeuvres","PK
The future India-Pakistan conflict scene will no longer be unilateral.
We continue to discuss various aspects of the recent Indo-Pakistan military standoff.
Third, deterrence per se. More than a billion lives escaped Modi's madness in a closer than ever nuclear Armageddon. Besides the conventional side of warfare, the more dangerous 'nuclear parity' still overhangs South Asia perilously. With deterrence in 'conventional terms re-established', one hopes India under Modi would avoid another wasteful adventure of humiliation, and resume talks over the table, rather than in the skies and through brinkmanship.
The future India-Pakistan conflict scene will no longer be unilateral. It will be dictated and decided by Sino-Pak military alliance especially in collaboration with China's Western Theater Command. And this would augment deterrence for rational players on the Indian side, if any. Pakistan's Military, in South Asia's modern history, showcased the most integrated defensive strategy and real-time coordination.
And just to reiterate, in military literature, a weaker side is supposed to have won an asymmetrical contest, if it denies outright victory or the attainment of war's aims and objectives to the stronger side, which Pakistan did to a larger India.
So perceptually speaking, deterrence in the Indo-Pakistan context would, henceforth, be defined by the conventional military capabilities plus nuclear arms, and the fragility of psychological threshold on both sides, as discussed in my piece, 'India, Pakistan — redefining deterrence', printed in this space on May 22, 2025. And in Pakistan's context, deterrence would remain to be fortified by the Sino-Pakistani alliance, and the resolve of Pakistan's civil and military leadership, through Islamabad's 'quid-pro-quo Plus' strategy, to never let India prevail.
So, peace, the perusal of which now squarely lies with a mellowed but bellicose India that still pursues its intended water wars, would remain elusive if we do not recognise each other's capabilities, and do not engage each other with dignity, mutual respect and patience, and not with ignorance or arrogance.
Fourth. The Exterior Manoeuvre. Without going into the nuts and bolts of the diplomatic war, the Indian efforts to paint Pakistan into endemically bad light and as a state sponsor of terrorism, had very few takers, regionally and internationally.
Indian diplomatic overtures focused on painting itself taller by telling the world its military response was calculated and non-escalatory and that this 'new India' would respond muscularly to the so-called terrorist attacks, without wanting a wider war with Pakistan and its people. Essentially contradictory iterations.
No country condemned Pakistan for the 'alleged' terrorism; none appreciated India's 'carefully calibrated' military response. The world, contrarily, was preoccupied with the IAF's French Rafael jets being shot down by PAF's Chinese J-10C fighters using PL-15 E air-to-air missiles.
Even the US after some initial ambivalence from VP Vance had to forcefully intervene to affect a ceasefire, without giving India the blank cheque of unilateralism and brinkmanship. Russia, India's traditional friend, withheld the 'expected' diplomatic support for India. And Türkiye, Azerbaijan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar and the entire OIC, the UNall called for restraint and then ceasefire.
Major capitals responded with studied neutrality despite India sending seven diplomatic delegations to 32 countries. Beijing's signalling and posturing in support of Pakistan were overtly clear. Washington's ceasefire appeal re-hyphenated the two nuclear neighbours, to India's great chagrin. New Delhi even refused to acknowledge any US role, for which Trump had publicly taken credit.
The paradox of Indian 'Exterior Manoeuvre' was laid bare, as to why was it accepting a ceasefire, irrespective of whether it was reached bilaterally (as India claimed) or under US interlocution (as Trump tweeted), if it had an upper hand militarily.
During the conduct of operations, fiasco after fiasco derided New Delhi's aspirations and outsized ego. From denial to acknowledging downing of planes including Rafaeles, to persistent lies on the state and social media, greatly diminished India's shine, sheen and diplomatic weight. New Delhi's comical effort to influence the World Bank under its Indian-origin president, Mr Ajay Banga, from sanctioning loan to Islamabad failed spectacularly.
The extent of India's hostility towards Pakistan permeated not only its body politics, but also its cultural elite (read Bollywood), its state behaviour; and resulted in a compulsive obsession with Pakistan, whom India's intellectual wizards proudly claim to have pushed into irrelevant ignominy.
This paradox - Pakistan's irrelevance and Islamabad being an uncomfortable reality - remains unresolved and has been damaging India's 'perceived' important power aspiration and status, without pundits realising it.
Fifth, The Inner Front. India whipped up its jingoist anti-Pakistan narrative in order to jell its inner front, silencing opposition, muzzling rationality and suppressing truth in the process. And it failed. The Modi Government had to launch Operation ""Tiranga Yatra (tricolour journey)"" for intense domestic messaging, to manipulate outcomes during Operation Sindoor.
From annihilating Pakistan to dominating South Asia as the new hegemon, its efforts, however, could not convince most of its 200 million Muslims, who constitute 10.9 per cent of its population, is the world's 3rd largest Muslim population, and the largest Muslim-minority globally.
Its illegally occupied Kashmir, the expected battle zone, simmers with hate, discontent and a resurgent anti-India sentiment, making operations and rear-area security a nightmare for the Indian Military. Assam, Christian Mizoram, Nagaland, the Naxalite insurgency in the 'Red Corridor', Khalistan Movement in Punjab and abroad, and other insurgencies drive wedges in the India Union.
Even the Brahman-dominated decision-making elite had and have reservations on the direction secular India has taken under Hindutva-laced Modi Sarkar. Indian security sector and armed forces saw removals, arrests and demotions during the stand-off; and its population is still experiencing arrests for supporting Pakistan, as per press reports.
By comparison, Pakistan's inner front jelled like it always does in a crisis with India. RAW-financed terrorism in KP and Balochistan, and the expected political uprising by some political forces against the armed forces, in hilarious formulation of Indian intelligence, failed and failed miserably. Pakistan's national will, determination, resolve and motivation across the political spectrum and across the nation was tougher and firm.
Pakistan's 'relative' demographic homogeneity compared to India's heterogeneity is always an asset and a force-multiplier. Such demographic truism also permeates Pakistan's armed forces, making it a formidable fighting machine.

'Carrie' going from page to Prime,"PK
Everything we know about latest adaptation of Stephen King's first novel
Great news for horror lovers: Amazon has officially announced that it will be producing a series based on Carrie, one of Stephen King's most iconic and widely acclaimed novels, originally published in 1974.
As reported by Variety, the show is described as a ""bold and timely reimagining of the story of misfit high-schooler Carrie White (Howell), who has spent her life in seclusion with her domineering mother. After her father's sudden and untimely death, Carrie finds herself contending with the alien landscape of public high school, a bullying scandal that shatters her community, and the emergence of mysterious telekinetic powers.""
Cast and crew
The upcoming series will be directed by acclaimed horror filmmaker Mike Flanagan, known for his work on projects such as The Haunting of Hill House and Midnight Mass. Flanagan will also serve as executive producer, showrunner, and writer, alongside Trevor Macy as executive producer. The show, produced by Amazon MGM Studios, is set to premiere on Amazon Prime, adding to the platform's growing list of original horror content.
In April, in an interview with Variety, Vernon Sanders, head of television for Amazon MGM Studios, said: ""Carrie is an iconic story that has withstood the test of time with continued cultural relevance. With Mike Flanagan at the helm and the accomplished team assembled, including executive producer Trevor Macy, this provocative series is sure to captivate our global customers.""
According to Variety, ten actors have already been confirmed as series regulars. Leading the cast as the titular character Carrie White, Summer H Howell brings with her an impressive background in the horror genre. She began her acting career at the young age of eight, when she was cast as Alice in the cult horror film Curse of Chucky (2013), directed by Don Mancini.
Since then, Howell has gone on to appear in several other horror and thriller films, including Cult of Chucky (2017), The Midnight Man (2016), All Fun and Games (2023), and Spirit in the Blood (2024), among others. Her experience in the genre gives hope for a stellar performance in the lead role.
Playing her mother, Margaret White, is Samantha Sloyan who has been a recurring collaborator of Flanagan. She has starred in his shows The Haunting of Hill House, The Fall of the House of Usher, The Midnight Club, and Midnight Mass. Sloyan also appeared in Flanagan's 2016 film Hush.
Joining them are Siena Agudong as Sue Snell, Alison Thornton as Chris Hargensen, Thalia Dudek as Emaline, Amber Midthunder as Miss Desjardin, Josie Totah as Tina, Arthur Conti as Billy, and Joel Oulette as Tommy.
According to Variety, the Carrie series was first reported to be in development at Amazon in October 2024. After several months of planning and pre-production, the show officially received the green light in April 2025. Amazon has ordered a total of eight episodes for the first season, with production scheduled to begin in Vancouver, Canada, in the coming weeks.
A rich legacy
King's Carrie has previously been adapted multiple times. The first adaptation was directed by Brian De Palma in 1976, starring the award-winning actor Sissy Spacek. A sequel to the 1976 film, titled The Rage: Carrie 2, was released in 1999. It was directed by Katt Shea and featured Emily Bergl in her debut role.
In 1988, a musical theatre adaptation by the Royal Shakespeare Company was performed five times at the Virginia Theatre before closing. This proved to be one of Broadway's most infamous failures, losing $7 million. However, in 2012, an off-Broadway revival of Carrie as a musical was staged to more favourable reviews. Later, in 2018, the popular television series Riverdale aired an episode inspired by the musical.
In 2002, another adaptation of Carrie was produced as a television film, also filmed in Vancouver. It was created by Trilogy Entertainment Group and MGM Television, intended as a pilot for a potential TV series.
In 2013, Carrie was adapted again for film, this time directed by Kimberly Peirce. This version featured a star-studded Hollywood cast, with Chloë Grace Moretz as the titular character and Julianne Moore as Margaret White. The ensemble also included Judy Greer, Portia Doubleday, Gabriella Wilde, Ansel Elgort, and Alex Russell.

The UK is open for business,"US
The UK and Pakistan share a longstanding and evolving trade partnership
Kickstarting economic growth is the number one mission of the UK government. We know that this is also a goal that many of our partners, including Pakistan, share and one that can only be delivered by working together.
Britain has always been an outward-looking trading nation with an open and stable economy. But with three new trade deals signed in May, we have taken a major step forward in driving prosperity at home and overseas.
An economic deal with the Trump administration will reduce tariffs across a range of sectors, from steel and aluminium to automotives, and cut costs for businesses operating here in the UK.
And a new agreement between the UK and the European Union will give more certainty to businesses, providing opportunities for companies to expand their operations with some of the UK's closest neighbours.
Our message is simple. We are a trusted partner ready to negotiate constructively. We have one of the largest economies in the world, with cutting-edge businesses, brilliant universities and a talented workforce. And we have an innovative economy embracing new trends like AI.
The UK and Pakistan share a longstanding and evolving trade partnership rooted in mutual opportunity and trust. With over £4.7 billion in bilateral trade, the UK is Pakistan's largest trading partner in Europe.
And it's not just foreign leaders and decision-makers that recognise this. A recent survey of global CEOs ranked the UK as the second most attractive country to invest in. In March, companies from around the world, including Blackstone, Amazon and DP World, collectively committed to invest £63 billion in the UK at the Global Investment Summit.
It is as a result of this work that just last month, the UK's growth rate was upgraded to the highest within the G7.
And we're building on these strengths. Earlier this year the UK announced £13 billion of capital investment over the next five years to deliver the projects needed to catalyse private investment, boost growth and drive forward the UK's modern industrial strategy. This follows £100 billion of capital investment announced last autumn.
We are also ripping up unnecessary regulation to cut the administrative costs on business by a quarter over the next five years. And soon we will unveil a new Industrial Strategy which will give businesses even greater confidence to invest and expand in the UK.
There are already several businesses from Pakistan in the UK, including firms like Abacus. A leading tech consulting firm, Abacus exemplifies the potential of cross-border enterprise, showcasing how Pakistani innovation and British collaboration can fuel shared prosperity. But with the offer of certainty, stability and simplicity, we will give more firms the confidence to expand and invest in the UK.
The US and EU both recognised the huge potential of a closer trading relations with the UK under this government. And they are not the only examples. The UK is now an active member of CPTPP after becoming the first European member earlier this year. We're also building new partnerships with the emerging markets of the future.
These deals are just the beginning. Our diplomats and trade negotiators have sent a signal — the UK is open for business.

Spain target Nations League defence,"US
They are aiming to become the first side to defend the Nations League trophy
Spain are aiming to become the first side to defend the Nations League trophy, with Luis de la Fuente's side going from strength to strength on the international stage ahead of next year's World Cup. The coach enjoys recalling La Roja's triumph at the 2023 tournament, which was an early sign that a young Spain side were heading back to the top.
It proved the springboard to Euro 2024 glory and De la Fuente wants to continue Spain's resurgence by retaining it this summer in Germany.
It would bode well ahead of the 2026 World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada next summer where Spain will be among the favourites.
They face France in the Nations League semi-finals in Stuttgart before a potential final against Germany or Portugal.
""We attach enormous importance to it – it's almost more difficult than a European Championship, and we want to be the first team to win it twice,"" De la Fuente told reporters last week.
""We want to continue competing at the highest level with these teams.""
After European Championship wins in 2008 and 2012, sandwiching their World Cup 2010 triumph in South Africa, the Spanish national team slumped.
Poor outings at the Russia and Qatar World Cups started to fade from memory, though, as De la Fuente's side beat Italy and Croatia to win the Nations League.
It helped him on a personal level too, with many doubting his credentials and blaming him for an embarrassing defeat by Scotland in Euro 2024 qualifying.
The Scots beat De la Fuente's Spain in March 2023 in what was their last competitive defeat, 23 matches ago.
Spain beat Italy, Germany and France on the way to the Euro 2024 final, where they got the better of England to claim their first major trophy for 12 years.
The worrying thing for the rest of the world is that De la Fuente's Spain team remains hungry, with many players yet to reach their peak.
The side is led by Barcelona's teenage winger Lamine Yamal, who turned 17 on the eve of the Euro final, and on the opposite flank Athletic Bilbao's Nico Williams, 22, also has his best years ahead of him.
Barcelona midfield maestro Pedri, 22 as well, pulls the strings, while there are emerging talents in other areas including Porto striker Samu Aghehowa and new Real Madrid signing Dean Huijsen.
Isco's return
Despite a focus on younger players, De la Fuente showed he is not stubborn by turning to Real Betis midfielder Isco.
After a superb season in which the former Real Madrid playmaker took the Andalusians to the Conference League final, the 33-year-old finally got the call he craved.
Some said De la Fuente should have given Isco a chance last summer but the coach was proven right as his team went on to win the Euros.
""He's going to add a lot – if we had any doubts, he wouldn't have been here,"" said De la Fuente.
""He could have been at the Euros, or not, but those who had to be there, were there.""
Isco's presence gives Spain even more depth in a midfield packed with quality, and one which is still without Manchester City's Rodri Hernandez who has yet to return to action after missing most of the season injured.
""In Spain, we are privileged to have many very good footballers,"" De la Fuente said during the Euros.
""I think they are the best players in the world for many reasons.""
In almost every position the coach is blessed with multiple strong options, with the team perhaps only short of one elite striker – although it has not held them back.
Aghehowa, 21, could develop into that player, although De la Fuente ran through all of his possible options there, including veteran Alvaro Morata, Dani Olmo as a false nine, or Mikel Oyarzabal, who scored the winner against England.
""This is a team, and in that team, everyone contributes their bit to make a stronger, more solid group,"" said De la Fuente.
""Samu is fantastic, Alvaro, Mikel, Dani... we can play in many ways with different players and that is exactly what our strength is.""

Cashless economy at crossroads,"SG
PM to choose between reward or penalty to curb informal economy
As Pakistan's informal economy swells to $140 billion, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif faces a choice between incentivising people by offering lower taxes to encourage digital payments or imposing higher costs on cash transactions for government payments and utility bills.
An expert committee on the cashless economy, made up of public and private sector representatives, recently submitted recommendations to the PM. Their approach centres around a ""carrot and stick"" policy.
If the PM chooses incentives, he will have to lower sales tax and petroleum levies. But if he opts for penalties, people will pay more when making payments to the government or buying fuel and other utilities. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is set to announce the new budget on June 10. It will be clarified whether the government will focus on incentivising digital payments or punishing cash use. Previous punishment policies targeting non-filers with higher taxes have failed to deliver results. ""It is up to the government whether to incentivise digital payments or punish cash users,"" said a committee member in background talks.
The committee offered four key recommendations, presenting both options to the government. The first calls for mandating acceptance of digital payments by empowering district authorities to enforce the use of the RAAST QR code — an instant payment method — at all retail outlets.
Local authorities should ensure the presence of RAAST QR codes and penalise merchants for inactivity. The committee expects that within a year, one million active RAAST QR codes could be operational if enforced effectively. ""The solution lies with QR codes, not credit cards,"" said a committee member. ""There are only 2 million credit cards and 50,000 card readers, but Pakistan has five million retail outlets.""
Merchants charge 1.5% fees on credit card payments, but only 1% on RAAST payments, the member added. The committee estimated that the informal economy makes up 35% of the economy, translating to $140 billion today. The government must choose to incentivise or punish, but past experience shows punishments don't work.
One major recommendation is to reduce the sales tax on digital payments from 18% to 5%, along with a three-year tax audit break for digital transactions. The committee also proposed eliminating customs duties on digital payment-related equipment. They believe these incentives could double digital transactions within six months.
When the committee approached the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) about tax cuts, the FBR said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) would oppose it. However, the IMF told the committee it had no objection and threw the ball back in FBR's court. On the punishment side, the committee suggested making cash payments more expensive. They recommended imposing a surcharge on over-the-counter government payments, capping cash-on-delivery payments, and removing sales tax incentives on cash-on-delivery.
One punitive proposal is to increase petrol prices by 1% or Rs3 per litre for cash payments. With 12,000 petrol stations nationwide and 70% of customers on motorcycles, this could be a significant deterrent.
The committee believes the punishment policy could cut cash circulation by 2% of GDP, about Rs2.6 trillion. It also suggested that all government paymentssuch as those to Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) beneficiaries or contractorsshould be made digitally. This would require mandatory installation of RAAST QR codes at all government payment points within six months and creating digital wallets for every government disbursement, starting with BISP. If successful, this could add 20 million new bank accounts within 18 months, the committee said. The government introduced the non-filer category in 2013 to broaden the tax base. However, over 12 years, it has become a tool to extract higher taxes rather than expand the base.
Utility bills are also being used to collect taxes, hurting sectors like telecommunications.
The telecom industry demands exemption from withholding tax deductions, similar to the banking sector. Telecom companies face deductions on thousands of transactions, such as electricity bills for cell towers. This raises compliance costs and administrative burdens. Verifying tax claims on these bills is also difficult for authorities, adding to the operational load.
The industry argues withholding tax on telecom services should not be treated as a minimum tax, which applies even during loss-making years. Current harsh recovery measures disrupt business and undermine taxpayer confidence. CMOs pay advance or withholding tax on hundreds of thousands of transactions, including electricity bills and imports. Maintaining documents and handling audits demand significant effort and cause verification issues.
They want the 4% withholding tax on telecom services to be adjustable rather than a minimum tax. The shift from adjustable income tax to minimum tax has effectively turned income tax from direct to indirect, the industry said. The sector also demands removal of the 10% advance income tax on auctions or renewals of telecom licenses. This advance tax raises business costs and capital expenses, hindering 4G/5G expansion and rural coverage.
Further, the telecom sector wants the 75% advance tax on non-filers abolished, along with measures like SIM blocking, which have not produced meaningful results.
Operators would need costly and time-consuming billing system upgrades to manage two tax rates. Since telecom services are essential, SIM blocking could deprive people of basic access. In April 2024, mobile operators were ordered to block SIM cards of over 500,000 non-filers. The Finance Act 2024 increased the advance income tax rate for non-filers to 75%. Additionally, non-compliance carries penalties of Rs50 million for the first offence and Rs100 million for subsequent violations. These punishments have failed, with the FBR shifting responsibility onto others.
The withholding tax under Section 236 rose from 10% to 15% in the 2021 supplementary Finance Act. It applies only to tax filers, yet most telecom consumers are non-filers. The industry wants this rate reduced to 12.5% in the next budget.

Doctors reject imposition of professional tax,"US
Medics bodies demand withdrawal of 'oppressive' levy
Various medics associations in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have rejected professional tax imposed on doctors by the provincial government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
President of the Pakistan Doctors Council K-P chapter, Dr Majid, addressed a joint press conference at the Peshawar Press Club Wednesday alongside leaders from doctors' organizations, including Dr Janbaz Afridi of the Peoples Doctors Forum, Dr Adil of the Young Doctors Association, and Dr Wasim of the Allied Doctors.
Dr Majid strongly condemned the provincial government of PTI for imposing an oppressive professional tax on doctors. He said the Doctors Council categorically rejects this tax and has formed a three-member committee to negotiate with the government for its immediate withdrawal. He also demanded the cessation of ongoing actions related to this tax.
The council called on the government to immediately revoke letters issued by the Excise and Taxation Department directing deductions from doctors' salaries, particularly concerning finance directors and accountants of Medical Teaching Institutes (MTIs) in K-P.
He further demanded salary increases for all doctors in the province, including house officers, trainee medical officers, and medical officers, in keeping with the current inflation rate in the provincial budget.
He urged the Health Care Commission to immediately stop imposing heavy fines on doctors under the pretext of registration and to develop a proper, consultative procedure for such matters.
Highlighting ongoing harassment of doctors over drug sales licenses, Majid demanded a halt to these practices and urged the government to implement court rulings favoring doctors in this regard.
The president criticized the Public Service Commission (PSC) for not advertising any job vacancies since 2017, calling it a grave injustice to aspiring medical professionals. He demanded that job postings resume immediately to recruit new doctors.

Asif declares Simla agreement a 'dead document',"US
.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has declared the 1972 Simla Agreement ""dead"" in the current geopolitical context, stating that Pakistan has effectively returned to the 1948 position regarding Kashmir, and the Line of Control (LoC) should now be viewed as a ceasefire line.
In an interview with a private television channel on Wednesday, the minister said that while the Simla Agreement had initially committed both India and Pakistan to resolving disputes bilaterally, that framework had collapsed due to unilateral Indian actions in recent years.
""The Simla Agreement is now a dead document. We are back to the 1948 position, when the United Nations declared the LoC a ceasefire line following the ceasefire and resolutions,"" he said, referring to the UN-mediated cessation of hostilities in the first India-Pakistan war. ""Going forward, these disputes will be dealt with multilaterally or internationally.""
He also cast doubt over the status of other bilateral arrangements, stating that ""whether the Indus Waters Treaty is suspended or not, Simla is already over.""
Commenting on regional tensions, Asif said the threat of war with India remains present. ""Pakistan does not desire war, but if it is imposed on us, the response will be even stronger than before,"" he warned.
The minister touched upon post-conflict developments, stating that Pakistan had emerged as a strengthened defensive power after its past wars with India. ""We have become a defensive force. Orders for our JF-17 Thunder fighter jets are coming in,"" he said, highlighting Pakistan's growing defence capabilities.
On the issue of Afghan refugees, Asif reiterated that Afghans should now return to their homeland. ""Afghans must settle in their own country. They have no loyalty to our soil,"" he remarked, adding that the time had come to address this issue firmly.

Govt decides to tighten solar net metering rules,"US
DISCOs will pay only Rs10 per unit to solar meter owners compared to existing Rs27 per unit
The government has decided to tighten regulations for solar net metering users in a second attempt, after the first one faced a strong backlash and was blocked by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Under the new plan, the government will abolish the zero-bill facility for solar net metering by introducing various measures. Additionally, consumers will be allowed a sanctioned load of 1.0x, down from the current load of 1.5x. This means they will be forced to switch to hybrid solar systems by using lithium batteries.
Under the current net metering system, the consumers share electricity with power distribution companies (DISCOs) at a buyback rate of Rs27 per unit. However, as part of the new plan, the government is seeking to end this electricity sharing system and DISCOs will pay only Rs10 per unit to the rooftop solar owners who have a net metering system.
Experts believe this will lead to an additional expenditure of $1 billion on the import of lithium batteries every year.
The plan was discussed during a meeting held between different stakeholders and power ministry officials. Power Division minister chaired the huddle.
The Power Division has proposed several measures that will kill the spirit of net metering. According to the proposed plan, the concept of net metering has been abolished and a new concept of net billing with a revised buyback rate is being introduced.
This means there will be no exchange of electricity units; rather DISCOs will pay a reduced buyback rate of Rs10 to consumers instead of the existing Rs27 per unit.
At present, DISCOs offer a credit billing facility on a quarterly basis, which is being abolished. In its place, a cash facility will be available for the excess electricity exported to the national grid by the solar meter owners and the time period has been reduced to a monthly basis.
However, no change has been proposed in the categories of consumers as commercial, domestic and all other consumers will be eligible to take benefit of the new policy. The contract period for a licence has been reduced from seven years to five years. Meanwhile, Federal Minister for Energy Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari, in a statement, said that the government was not abolishing the net metering policy, but was considering changing its current mechanism to a more effective, transparent and sustainable model.
He recalled that in 2017-18 he himself played a key role in introducing net metering and at that time the system was in its infancy. ""Now, the scope of net metering has expanded and it is having a serious impact on the grid, which must be addressed in a timely manner.""
He stressed that the government did not intend to harm any consumer or business, but all decisions were being taken while keeping in mind the national interest and long-term sustainability of the energy system.
""If we mention the purchase of units, then this is also being considered and there is talk of bringing it to the energy purchase price, so that the system automatically adjusts with fluctuations in rates. All these suggestions are under consideration,"" the minister said.
He pointed out that if the payback period for net metering customers was about three years or less, it would be suitable for any investment. ""If a customer is consuming 40% of the electricity himself, the return of money in three years is an acceptable business model. These reforms are not a deterrent, but a step towards a better, balanced and sustainable system,"" he added.
During the meeting, the energy minister presented a comprehensive outline of the ongoing energy reforms. In this regard, the government has eliminated 9,000 megawatts of expensive and unnecessary projects, which were a burden on the system.
He said that a levy was imposed on the captive power consumers to bring them back to the grid, which resulted in an increase in electricity demand. Since June 2024, the cross-subsidy given to the industry has reached Rs174 billion, which has reduced industrial tariffs by 31% and caused a significant rise in industrial consumption.

PR announces 20% Eid travel discount,"US
Preliminary report shows poor maintenance in Pakistan Express mishap
Pakistan Railways on Wednesday announced a significant fare reduction for passengers during the upcoming Eidul Azha holidays.
The rail service will offer a 20% discount on fares for all trains under its management across all travel classes. This discount will be applicable specifically on the first three days of Eid.
However, the railway administration clarifies that this discount will only be available for 'current bookings', meaning tickets purchased specifically during the Eid travel window for journeys on those three days.
Notably, the discount will not apply to any additional Eid Special Trains, that are scheduled to handle the holiday rush.
Pakistan Express
A preliminary inquiry report into the derailment of the Pakistan Express, which was en route from Karachi to Rawalpindi, has revealed that poor maintenance of a bogie led to the near-disastrous accident.
According to railway sources, the bogie suffered a ""hot axle"" malfunction, an overheating issue that caused a critical pin to snap. As a result, the entire trolley beneath the bogie broke free and veered off track.
The incident occurred on Sunday morning near Mubarakpur, in the Multan railway division. While the train avoided a major catastrophe by sheer luck, damage was inflicted on at least two bogies and the track infrastructure.
According to railway officials, a dining car and a standard air-conditioned coach of the 45-Up Pakistan Express derailed. However, no passengers were injured in the incident.
As a result, several Up and Down trainswere delayed for hours at various stations within the Bahawalpur district.

"Bangladesh says India pushes back 1,200 people","US
.
Bangladesh said on Wednesday that neighbouring India has pushed more than 1,270 people across its border in the past month, mainly Bangladeshis, but also Indian citizens and Rohingya refugees.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy since a mass uprising toppled Dhaka's previous government last year.
""Between May 7 and June 3, Indian authorities pushed in 1,272 individuals, including a few Indian citizens and Rohingya, through 19 bordering districts"", Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) officials said.
""Only yesterday, they pushed 50 individuals.""
India's Hindu nationalist government has often described undocumented immigrants as ""Muslim infiltrators"", accusing them of posing a security threat.
India has not commented on the recent returns across their shared border.
Bangladeshi Jahidul Molla, 21, said he was among those sent back, saying he had been living in India's western state of Gujarat since he was 14.

Alarm grows as China restricts mineral export,"PK
Automakers warn of production halts; Trump and Xi expected to talk this week
Alarm over China's stranglehold on critical minerals grew on Tuesday as global automakers joined their US counterparts to complain that restrictions by China on exports of rare earth alloys, mixtures and magnets could cause production delays and outages without a quick solution.
German automakers became the latest to warn that China's export restrictions threaten to shut down production and rattle their local economies, following a similar complaint from an Indian EV maker last week.
China's decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets has upended the supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.
The move underscores China's dominance of the critical mineral industry and is seen as leverage by China in its ongoing trade war with US President Donald Trump.
Trump has sought to redefine the trading relationship with the US' top economic rival China by imposing steep tariffs on billions of dollars of imported goods in hopes of narrowing a wide trade deficit and bringing back lost manufacturing.
Trump imposed tariffs as high as 145% against China only to scale them back after stock, bond and currency markets revolted over the sweeping nature of the levies. China has responded with its own tariffs and is leveraging its dominance in key supply chains to persuade Trump to back down. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to talk this week, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday, and the export ban is expected to be high on the agenda.

Three 'robbers' killed in alleged crossfire with CCD,"US
Police claim suspects were involved in bank heists
Three suspected armed robbers were killed, allegedly by the gunfire of their accomplices, during a late-night encounter with the Crime Control Department (CCD) near Jallah Araain in Lodhran.
According to a spokesperson for the CCD, a patrolling team was stationed near Pul Behishti on the Multan, Lodhran Road when five unidentified men on two motorcycles approached from the direction of Multan in suspicious circumstances.
Upon being signalled to stop for a routine check, the suspects reportedly broke through the checkpoint and fled towards the government forest area.
The CCD team pursued them, after which the suspects allegedly took cover behind trees and opened fire on the police.
In response, the CCD officers returned fire while taking cover behind trees and irrigation channels.
The police claim they repeatedly warned the suspects to surrender, but the suspects continued firing while moving around each other.
Once the firing ceased, the police searched the area using torches and found three suspects severely wounded.
Upon inspection, all three were found dead, reportedly shot by their own accomplices during the crossfire. Near the bodies, police recovered two 30-bore pistols, a rifle, and a motorcycle.
The deceased remain unidentified and the bodies have been sent to a hospital for post-mortem examination. Officials said efforts are under way to confirm their identities.
CCD sources suggest the suspects were allegedly involved in recent bank robbery attempts and armed assaults in Karachi, Muzaffargarh, and Dera Ghazi Khan. The group was also suspected of shooting a boy during a robbery in Jallah Araain and firing at a vehicle during a failed bank robbery attempt in Dunyapur last week.

Maryam promises measures to protect children in Punjab
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has said that millions of children in Palestine and Kashmir have unfortunately become victims of Israeli and Indian aggression.
She stated in her message on the International Day of Innocent Children Victims of Aggression that when the smiles of children turn into sighs and sobs, humanity feels heartfelt grief and sorrow over it.
She said thousands of small bodies buried under the rubble of buildings in Gaza are a testament to global apathy over Israeli aggression. In Gaza, the buildings destroyed due to Israeli bombing have not only turned into rubble but buried thousands of innocent children under it.
The chief minister said the atmosphere of Kashmir is filled with heavy sobs of children whose voices have been muted forever.
She regretted that this human tragedy being faced by the innocent children who have become victims of aggression across the globe speaks volume of the dark side of human history.
The chief minister denounced the fact that children unfortunately become victims of aggression not only in wars but also in peacetime.
She highlighted that all possible measures will be taken to protect the children from becoming victims of all kinds of exploitation and aggression in Punjab.
She outlined that the provincial cabinet has approved the Child Protection Policy for the first time in Pakistan. Every institution, every law and every step of the Punjab government is aligned for the rights, protection and welfare of the children. She emphasised that a society that cannot guarantee and provide peace to the children can never achieve sustainable peace itself.

Kohli dedicates IPL title to fans,"US
Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by six runs in the final
Virat Kohli said it was ""as much for the fans"" after he finally won the IPL at his 18th attempt, with Bengaluru's ecstatic supporters preparing to welcome home their heroes.
Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by six runs in a roller-coaster IPL final Tuesday in Ahmedabad in front of more than 91,000 fans, who erupted in joy when Kohli lifted the trophy at the world's biggest cricket stadium. The 36-year-old Kohli, the only man to have played all 18 years for the same IPL team since its inaugural season in 2008, fittingly top-scored with 43 to anchor Bengaluru to victory.
Kohli, who captained Bengaluru in 143 matches between 2011 and 2023, had been on the losing side in three previous IPL finals.
Later Wednesday he will celebrate with his teammates at the main stadium in the southern city of Bengaluru.
Police said that initial plans for an open-top bus parade would not take place in Bengaluru's notoriously bad traffic.
""I said it straight away -- this title is as much for the fans as it is for us,"" said Kohli.
""These people have backed us relentlessly for 18 years.
""We've had horrible seasons and great ones too, but they turned up for every game in Bengaluru.
""I've never seen loyalty like that. That's what made me stay.""
India cricket great Sachin Tendulkar led the tributes for Kohli and Bengaluru.
""Congratulations on their first-ever IPL title. Fitting that jersey no. 18 lifts the trophy in the 18th edition,"" Tendulkar posted on X.
Bengaluru head coach Andy Flower said: ""Virat in his 18th year of competing in the IPL, I think that makes it really special for everyone involved.
""I am really happy for him and really proud of the way that he's driven the side forward.""
'Monkey off the back'
The tech city of Bengaluru erupted in midnight celebrations after RCB, who scored 190-9, restricted Punjab to 184-7.
Thousands of fans wore Kohli's number 18 shirt and danced in the streets as fireworks lit up the sky.
""It's not an easy tournament to win,"" Punjab head coach Ricky Ponting said.
""You have to think long and hard about that, think how many good teams they have had over the years.
""You can see what it meant to (Kohli), his wife and all the RCB fans to finally get the monkey off the back and win an IPL title.""
Former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden said on broadcaster JioHotstar: ""The IPL 2025 will be forever etched in the annals of cricket -- not just for Virat Kohli, but for the RCB fans who stood by them through thick and thin.
""It shows how consistency and belief can finally lead to a title. Over the past five years they've always been close, and now they've crossed the line.""
Two-time World Cup winner Kohli had done it all in an incredible career but an IPL crown eluded the batting great until Tuesday.
He cried, laughed and then lifted the glittering gold trophy for his first IPL title -- in his 18th year in the league and with the number 18 on his back.
Kohli top-scored with 43 in his team's 190-9 and the crowd of 91,000 erupted when victory was secured.
Affectionately called ""King Kohli"", he was again a key player for Bengaluru this season with 657 runs, including eight half-centuries, in 15 innings.
An emotional Kohli, 36, said he gave his ""youth and prime"" for this moment.

Audit flags 'unauthorised allowance' to ECP staff,"US
Issue surfaces as the PAC subcommittee reviewed the 2013-14 election supervisor audit objections
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) faced audit objections regarding the ""unauthorised payment"" of a 20 per cent election allowance to its employees, calculated on their running basic pay, starting from March 1, 2013, according to the audit officials.
The issue came to limelight as the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) subcommittee reviewed the 2013-14 audit objections of the election supervisor. The session was chaired by Shahida Akhtar Ali.
The audit officials noted that the allowance had neither been approved by the prime minister nor endorsed by the Finance Division's Regulation Wing. They added that the matter is currently under consideration in the Supreme Court.
The ECP officials, however, stated that the Peshawar High Court had ruled in their favour, maintaining that employees are receiving the 20 per cent allowance. They also noted that no stay order had been issued by the Supreme Court.
According to the ECP, employees are entitled to the allowance under the high court's judgment and the prime minister's summary.
The polls supervisory body emphasised that the 20 per cent allowance is a part of employees' salaries.
The audit officials recommended referring the matter to the Review and Implementation Committee, which should implement any decision made by the Supreme Court.
The ECP secretary, Omar Hamid, concluded that there is no irregularity in this matter.

Eastwood slams 'phony' Austrian daily interview,"US
Kurier published 'round-table' quotes as interview
An Austrian newspaper came under fire Tuesday after Hollywood star Clint Eastwood said an alleged interview with him published by the paper to mark his 95th birthday was ""entirely phony"".
The row was sparked by a purported interview with the Oscar-winning actor and director carried by the German-language Kurier newspaper Friday.
In the interview, which was picked up widely by American media over the weekend, Eastwood criticises a lack of fresh ideas in the current film industry as ""we live in an era of remakes and franchises"".
""I long for the good old days when screenwriters wrote films like Casablanca in small bungalows on the studio lot. When everyone had a new idea,"" he was quoted as saying. ""My philosophy is, do something new or stay at home.""
In a statement to Deadline magazine published Monday, Eastwood said ""I thought I would set the record straight"".
""I can confirm I've turned 95. I can also confirm that I never gave an interview to an Austrian publication called Kurier, or any other writer in recent weeks, and that the interview is entirely phony,"" he added.
On Tuesday, the Vienna-based Kurier's editorial team said its freelancer Elisabeth Sereda had compiled the interview by citing from ""a total of 18"" round table conversations with Eastwood.
But since the article was published as an interview and not as a profile, the daily said it would cut ties with the author.
""Even though no quotes have been fabricated, the interviews are documented and the allegations of falsification can be refuted, we will not be working with the author in the future because transparency and our strict editorial standards are paramount to us,"" Kurier said in a statement published on its website.
The newspaper had recently published interviews by Sereda with celebrities such as Jude Law and Elton John. afp

PHC slams inaction over climate crisis,"US
Lashes out at govt over poor infra, pollution
Senior Judge of the Peshawar High Court, Justice Ijaz Anwar, has strongly criticized government inaction on climate change, remarking that while authorities hold meetings in luxurious hotels and talk endlessly about climate change, no real progress is being made on the ground.
""If no one intends to do any actual work, then let it all go. Just let whatever is happening continue as is,"" he stated sharply during a hearing.
Justice Anwar made these remarks while presiding over a case regarding environmental pollution. The hearing was conducted by a two-member bench comprising Justice Ijaz Anwar and Justice Fazal Subhan.
The court noted that roads have deteriorated significantly due to canal expansion. ""Take a look at the road along the Bara River - it's in terrible condition. Heavy traffic runs on Canal Road, yet its condition remains abysmal. Forty years ago, even a tree branch encroaching on the road would be promptly cut down. Today, with all our machinery and resources, we can't even maintain basic infrastructure,"" Justice Anwar lamented.
The bench issued notices to relevant departments, demanding explanations in response to several environmental petitions.
During the proceedings, Director General of the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA), Muhammad Naeem, appeared in court alongside legal counsel Sabahuddin Advocate and officials from the Environmental Protection Agency.
The PDA's lawyer informed the court that both the Secretary of Local Government and the DG PDA had been summoned. He further stated that the High Court had previously issued directives regarding the canals and had appointed a commission for oversight. Work is currently underway on five key canals, he said.
However, Justice Anwar expressed dissatisfaction: ""These canals have ruined the roads. There was supposed to be a separate drainage system. Instead, sewage water has been mixed with irrigation canals, rendering farmland unsuitable for growing vegetables.""
The DG PDA admitted that only 15 per cent of the work has been completed since 2020 and that a treatment plant would be constructed after separating drainage from canal water. He cited a lack of funding as a major hurdle.
Justice Anwar responded critically, ""The government talks about climate change every day, while officials are busy in meetings at five-star hotels. If no work is being done, then what is the point of all this?""
Counsel for the petitioner told the court that five years have passed, and the pollution has rendered agricultural land barren. Justice Anwar also inquired about progress on regulating stone-crushing plants.
The Legal Officer from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) told the court that reports have been requested from the district administration and the industry department regarding the crushing plants, and these would be submitted once received. The EPA also reported that 12 brick kilns have been converted to zigzag technology to reduce pollution.
A representative of the Irrigation Department informed the court that steps are being taken to prevent sewage from entering canal systems along Canal Road.
The court has summoned responses from all relevant parties and adjourned the hearing until the next scheduled date.

"'Toot Gaya' gives 'Love Guru' a heartfelt, melancholic kick","US
Mahira, Humayun starrer unveils new track
Anticipation for Love Guru grows the closer we get to the release date. And that's not just because Eid is within reach but also thanks to every snippet and song from the romantic comedy that is being unveiled prior to the big day. The creators are back to break our hearts with a melancholic number from the soundtrack, titled Toot Gaya.
The stirring song strums its way into your soul before sweeping you off your feet with the lyrics, floating over clips of the yearning love interests. Mahira Khan and Humayun Saeed's wistful chemistry adds an extra kick as the harmonic blend of vocals from Yashal Shahid, Farhan Saeed, Zain and Zohaib take you on an emotional ride.
While the song departs on a high note, leaving you aching for more, it's a fulfilling tease for fans lying in wait for the film. Many of Farhan's fans stormed the comments section, with one user writing, ""This man just rips your soul apart with that smooth, honey-like voice of his. It's so raw and rich in emotion. It's like flames setting water alight.""
Meanwhile, Mahira's fans noted that the song brought out the best in the actor, as a user gushed, ""Oh, my God. Perfect. This is purely Mahira-coded. The depth, impact, and gravity – this is where our Mahira shines the brightest! This video left me craving for so much more! Cant wait for the release!""
Yashal and Humayun's fans were also not to be taken lightly as they sent their many compliments to the artists for elevating the song with their presence, confident that the film will impress audiences far and wide after it hits theatres.
Tracks that were unveiled before Toot Gaya included Pashto dance song Sada Ashna, groovy party number Aa Tenu, and title track Dil Toran Waleya.
What to expect
The official trailer for Love Guru dropped in May, flaunting a star-studded cast of Humayun, Mahira, Javed Sheikh, Marina Khan, Mira Sethi, Sohai Ali Abro, and more. Helmed by Nadeem Baig, the film is slated to hit theatres this Eidul Azha.
Set in London, the romantic comedy follows Humayun's love-hopping character as he vows to rescue all women one romantic connection at a time. ""My love isn't for one woman. I want to save them all through this love,"" he says.
Enter Mahira's Sophia Khan, an architect who is all set to get married, oblivious to the interference that's going to change everything. Signing on his new assignment, our love expert conspires with Sophia's father to prevent the marriage from happening.
Cue a montage of meet-cutes, comedic moments, and banter that amps up the chemistry between our two leads, promising the audience a film packed with heart-swelling moments. The trailer also teases the film's music, from upbeat dance numbers to romantic ballads, as the two groove to the rhythm or take to the skies in a hot air balloon.
Much like the shot of the two soaring through the clouds, the film is infused with scenic moments that add to the adrenaline kick that the love story offers. From an intimate boat ride to road trips across a winding landscape, the film lands a lasting visual impression on its wonderstruck audience.
With a screenplay penned by Vasay Chaudhry, a key appeal of the film is the reunion of the Bin Roye stars in what appears to be another tale packed with obstacles that challenge the leads' affection for each other. We'll find out soon whether or not Humayun and Mahira's characters will trump the odds dividing them.

IHC issues last warning to respondents in PECA case,"US
Says court would proceed even if responses are not filed
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday issued last warning to the ministries of law and information technology, the FIA and the PTA to submit their replies in petitions challenging the controversial amendment to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas stated that the court would proceed with the case even if responses were not filed.
The IHC heard joint petitions filed by the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), anchorpersons and journalist bodies.
During the hearing, Justice Minhas remarked he believed that this case would take a long time and suggested scheduling it after Eid.
Advocate Imran Shafique argued that the federal government had only submitted replies through the ministries of interior and information but not from the Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs or the PTA.
He further noted that the government had filed an unusual reply questioning the court's jurisdiction, claiming that after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, only a constitutional bench of the high court could hear this case.
Advocate Shafique rejected the government's argument, calling it an attempt to delay the proceedings. He pointed to a second objection that cited a Quranic verse, suggesting that one should verify information before sharing it. ""People are being booked in FIRs and the court should expedite the case,"" he argued.
Justice Minhas questioned whether journalists were currently able to report news freely. He asked whether any news was being blocked or anyone was stopping from giving or publishing news.
Advocate Raisat Ali Azad requested the court to issue a stay order to prevent journalists from being arrested or having FIRs registered against them for reporting news.

'Eidi' complaints mar Eid travel,"US
Official says special squads formed to monitor transport activities during peak hours
As intercity travel increases and a huge rush of travellers was seen ahead of Eid, complaints are surfacing against transporters charging more than the fixed fares at some bus terminals while some passengers claimed they were being asked to pay extra in the name of ""Eidi.""
Many passengers who were heading to Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other parts of the country expressed concern about fare hikes. A few said that despite the presence of officials, some transporters still attempted to overcharge, especially during evening hours.
When contacted the Islamabad district administration, the spokesman said that the authority has taken notice of the issue and launched monitoring operations at all major bus stands.
According to officials, several teams led by assistant commissioners are visiting terminals, including Faizabad and 26 Number stop, to prevent overcharging. In this regard, Islamabad Deputy Commissioner, Irfan Nawaz Memon has directed that all assistant commissioners and magistrates remain on duty at bus stands throughout the Eid rush.
He said that any transporter caught demanding more than the approved fare will face immediate action. He also urged citizens not to pay even one rupee above the official fare.
""If any driver or operator asks for extra money, report it on the spot,"" he said, adding that passengers should cooperate with the administration to stop illegal practices. The administration's move is aimed at ensuring smooth travel and protecting passengers from fare manipulation during the busy holiday period, the spokesman added.
DC Irfan Memon also emphasised the need to ensure that the passengers treated with respect. ""Providing a fair and decent journey to all travelers is our responsibility,"" he said.
Operations at the terminals include random checks, inquiries from passengers about fares, and verification of fare charts displayed at ticket counters. In several instances, transporters were warned or fined for failing to follow the rules.
The deputy commissioner has appealed to the public to report any violations directly to the assistant commissioners present at the terminals.
He said such complaints are being addressed immediately, with transporters either being penalised or barred from continuing their services. The administration has also set up helpline numbers and complaint desks at major terminals to facilitate passengers.
Special squads have been formed to monitor transport activities during peak hours. The administration has also warned transport companies and terminal managers that strict action will be taken if any violations are reported.

According to a report aired on a local news channel, the race to find the perfect sacrificial animal is now accompanied by a growing trend: adorning animals with stylish accessories. Families - especially children - are actively taking part in this festive ritual, eager to make their animals stand out.
The report showcased bustling markets and roadside stalls offering a wide array of decorative items, ranging from colourful garlands and beaded jewellery to ornate halters and embroidered blankets. The demand for such accessories has seen a sharp rise in recent years, with many willing to spend generously to dress up their animals.
""We've seen an increasing interest in eco-friendly and sustainable decorations,"" said a vendor. ""People want to celebrate Eidul Azha in a more environmentally conscious way.""
Children, too, are enthusiastic participants. ""I love decorating our goat with colourful garlands and bells,"" said an 8-year-old boy shopping with his father at an Islamabad market. ""It makes our qurbani animal look so happy and festive!"" Another child chimed in, ""I'm going to decorate our sheep with a crown and a sparkly blanket - it will be the most beautiful sheep on the street!""
Vendors say customization is now in demand. ""Customers often ask for personalized decorations like custom garlands and embroidered blankets,"" said a roadside seller. ""It's a great opportunity for us to showcase our creativity.""
An online seller echoed the sentiment: ""Many buyers come with their own ideas, and we love bringing their designs to life. It's not just business - it's art and celebration combined.""

Surging plastic pollution poses environmental crisis,"US
City generates over 14k tons of solid waste daily, of which only 50% reaches landfill sites
World Environment Day is observed globally on June 5, with this year's theme, ""Beat Plastic Pollution,"" drawing attention to the growing crisis of plastic waste. Environmental experts have warned that without immediate intervention, the consequences of unchecked pollution could be catastrophic for both human health and the ecosystem.
While speaking to The Express Tribune, Dr Amir Alamgir, Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies at the University of Karachi, said that plastic pollution has emerged as one of the most serious environmental challenges in recent decades. ""Plastic products are inexpensive and widely available, which encourages excessive use without regard for their harmful effects,"" he added.
Dr Alamgir stressed the health hazards posed by plastic use, particularly during the summer. ""Storing drinking water in plastic bottles and refrigerating them can release microplastics that enter the human body,"" he said. ""These microscopic particles can severely damage the respiratory and digestive systems, blood vessels, and other vital organs. Prolonged exposure may even lead to fatal diseases such as cancer.""
He also warned against the widespread practice of waste burning, particularly plastic waste, which releases toxic gases into the atmosphere. ""These gases are absorbed into the lungs and bloodstream, affecting human health in ways that are still being understood - but we know they pose grave risks,"" he said.
Karachi, one of the most densely populated cities in the country, is at the centre of Pakistan's environmental crisis. The city generates an estimated 14,712 tons of solid waste daily, of which only 50 per cent is transported to landfill sites. The remainder is discarded in open spaces, water bodies, and streets, polluting both air and water sources.
According to Dr Alamgir, 60 per cent of Karachi's solid waste is composed of plastic, much of which ends up in the Arabian Sea, endangering marine life. ""If the current trend continues, Karachi could face irreversible ecological damage within the next 15 years,"" he warned.

Soaring cotton imports,"US
The cotton crisis is emblematic of the overall rot in the agriculture sector
Pakistan's textile sector, the backbone of our economy, faces an existential threat as cotton imports skyrocket to alarming levels. Recent data reveals a 114% year-on-year surge in the cotton import bill, already over $2.5 billion in the first 10 months of FY25, compared with $1.2 billion in the first 10 months of 2024 and a full-year target of just $1.9 billion.
This dependency is not merely a trade imbalance but a symptom of deeper structural failures that threaten the stability of the broader economy.
Domestic output is down by about one-third this year, currently standing at just under 5.5 million bales. Part of the blame is on climate shocks, including erratic monsoons and temperature fluctuations which have disrupted yields.
However, while policymakers and industry groups love to blame invisible enemies, the worst offenders are still homegrown — obsolete farming practices, substandard seeds and unchecked pest infestations, which have been aggravated by the crash of wheat prices in the previous season depriving many farmers of revenue that could have been reinvested into the cotton crop.
The combination of high, expensive imports and a bad domestic crop has increased prices for the textile sector which will, in turn, undercut exports as profit margins will take a hit, and some buyers may not be willing to pay higher prices if textile producers cannot fully absorb the additional cost.
The cotton crisis is emblematic of the overall rot in the agriculture sector, especially since cotton is the key raw material in our most significant export sector. The government needs to find cost-effective ways to modernise agriculture by facilitating the use of high-yield seeds, precision farming and climate-resilient practices, while also making it easier to import raw materials such as seeds. Imports should be a stopgap solution for bad crop seasons rather than the norm.
Without decisive action, the textile sector's $16.6 billion export engine could seriously stall, with repercussions echoing across Pakistan's fiscal and social landscape.

No country for journalists,"US
Israel blocks access to Palestinian Oscar-winner's village
Israeli forces on Monday blocked an international media tour in the occupied West Bank, preventing journalists from entering the village of Oscar-winning Palestinian director Basel Adra who decried worsening Israeli violence, as reported by AFP.
Adra's film No Other Land chronicles the forced displacement of Palestinians by Israeli troops and settlers in Masafer Yatta, an area in the southern West Bank that Israel declared a restricted military zone in the 1980s.
Journalists from AFP and other international media travelled to Tuwani at the invitation of Adra, who lives in the village, and co-director Yuval Abraham, seeking to draw attention to a spate of house demolitions and violent incidents in recent weeks.
At the entrance to Tuwani, the journalists as well as a Palestinian Authority delegation were blocked by Israeli forces, who said they had a warrant to set up a one-day checkpoint.
Abraham called the roadblock a ""good example"" of what he said was Israeli authorities' involvement in attacks against Palestinians in Masafer Yatta.
Adra said the violence was ""getting worse and worse"".
""Settler violence increased, the demolitions carried out by Israeli soldiers and authorities against our homes and schools and properties is increasing in very crazy and high numbers,"" he told AFP.
An Israeli officer who refused to give his name told AFP the force was at the entrance to Tuwani to ""keep the public order"".
""There were violent clashes between settlers, Jews, Arabs, journalists, and to prevent these violent clashes, we decided not to allow passage today,"" the officer said.
Adra said that last week, settlers had entered the nearby Palestinian hamlet of Khallet al-Dabaa, which was bulldozed by the Israeli army in early May, with the Israelis harassing the residents who remained despite the destruction.
""These police officers and soldiers that are here now to prevent the international media, not only do they not come to prevent the settler violence, often they partake in it,"" the Israeli co-director told AFP.
According to the Palestinian health ministry, Israeli forces or settlers have killed at least 937 Palestinians in the West Bank since October 7, 2023.
Abraham said he had been trying to hold on to hope that the film's success would bring change on the ground.
""Unfortunately, the world now knows, but there is no action,"" he said.

"Sacrificial animals robbed, drivers protest 'police-robber nexus'","US
Robbery trend in Karachi damaging the spirit of Eidul Azha
A city where gunpoint snatchings have become a daily occurrence is now witnessing the robbery of sacrificial animals. On Eidul Azha, Muslims sacrifice animals in remembrance of Hazrat Ibrahim's (AS) practice. However, the robbery trend in the metropolis is damaging the festival's spirit.
The soaring cost sacrificial animals have attracted robbers to the meaty bonanza. In one go, a bull worth two million rupees or more can be kidnapped and sold with no questions asked about any document or legal papers.
Armed robbers on bikes snatched two cows along with the vehicles transporting them near the Northern Bypass cattle market on Wednesday. The drivers of the loading vehicles blocked the road and staged a protest. They alleged that a police mobile patrol was stationed nearby but refused to assist, citing duty restrictions.

Slain child's uncle attempts self-immolation,"PK
Citizens present at the scene prevented the act.
In protest over alleged police inaction, the uncle of a child killed in crossfire between two groups in Faisalabad's Saddar area attempted to set himself on fire outside the office of the DSP. Bystanders intervened and foiled the attempt.
Muhammad Shaban, a resident of Fort Abbas, had submitted a complaint to the SSP investigation alleging that the investigation officer, Alamdar, appointed in the case, had developed ties with the suspects in the murder of his nephew.
Shaban claimed that the suspects enjoy backing, which has compromised the investigation.
He alleged that the IO is stalling the case and refusing to properly document the family's statements or pursue justice.
Taking notice of the complaint, the SSP ordered the DSP of Saddar to conduct a separate inquiry.
However, on Tuesday, in a desperate act of protest, Shaban arrived at the DSP's office, doused himself in petrol, and attempted to set himself on fire.
Citizens present at the scene prevented the act.
Speaking to reporters, Shaban said, ""The investigation officer refuses to listen to us or record our version in the case file. If we don't get justice, I will set myself on fire in front of senior officers' offices.""
Senior officials have yet to comment publicly on the matter.

Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain and Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib has met with US President Donald Trump's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets Executive Director Robert Bo Hines at the White House and discussed strategic alignment of digital assets, bitcoin integration and the future of decentralised infrastructure.
During the meeting, both sides expressed shared interest in fostering collaboration between the US and Pakistan on digital asset innovation, regulatory coherence and emerging financial technologies, said a press release issued by the Ministry of Finance on Wednesday.
They also deliberated on ways to support innovation ecosystems that empower youth and accelerate economic inclusion through blockchain. Bo Hines leads the national policy development on digital asset innovation, regulation and emerging financial technologies. The meeting comes following Pakistan's announcement of creating the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, which positions the country as one of the first in Asia to incorporate bitcoin into its sovereign asset strategy.
""I envision Pakistan to be a leader in the Global South for digital assets,"" Bilal Bin Saqib remarked. ""From launching our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to unlocking national infrastructure for crypto mining and AI data zones, Pakistan is building a real framework for digital asset adoption and economic modernisation.""
The minister of state also visited the White House counsel office. Pakistan's broader strategy includes allocating 2,000 megawatts of electricity for bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence-driven data zones with the aim of converting surplus energy into economic growth, job creation and digital infrastructure.

"AI, drones and thousands of cameras to keep pilgrims safe","US
.
Working day and night in front of maps, screens and seemingly endless data, Saudi officials have harnessed artificial intelligence to help manage the million-strong sea of pilgrims during the Hajj.
The technology has proven pivotal to track the overwhelming amount of footage from more than 15,000 cameras in and around the holy city of Makkah.
The systems are tuned to spot abnormal crowd movements or predict bottlenecks in foot traffic -- a potential life-saver at a packed event with a history of deadly stampedes.
Software is also used to help guide more than 20,000 buses deployed to transport pilgrims between holy sites during one of the world's biggest annual religious gatherings.
It is all part of the tech arsenal that Saudi Arabia is deploying as 1.4 million faithful from across the globe descend on Makkah and its surrounds.
""In our traffic control room, we use specialised cameras that have AI layers to analyse movements, crowded areas"" and predict behaviours, said Mohamed Nazier, chief executive officer for the General Transport Centre at the Royal Commission for Makkah.
The centre has a main control room in Makkah filled with screens and maps, where staff use high-tech tools including AI for round-the-clock monitoring.
About a dozen staff members sit in rows before desktop computers with a large display at the front, zooming in on crowd movements around the holy sites.
On hillsides nearby, cameras that resemble little white robots film buildings, roads and pathways along the Hajj route, which winds more than 20 kilometres (12 miles) between Makkh and Mount Arafat.
Nazier said the constant monitoring is aimed at averting traffic collisions with pedestrians on crowded routes while also making sure there are buses available to minimise walking time in the desert heat.
It is a decade since the Hajj suffered its worst disaster, a stampede that killed up to 2,300 people during the ""stoning of the devil"" ritual.

"Provinces demand NFC, agri tax review","US
NEC prefers politics over fiscal prudency
The National Economic Council on Wednesday approved an enlarged national development outlay of Rs3.9 trillion, as some of the provinces have demanded reviewing the National Finance Commission and reopening the agriculture income tax issue with the International Monetary Fund.
The NEC-approved the federal Public Sector Development Programme 2025-26 shows the government's political priorities to appease allies and spend more on roads. It approved reduced budgets for Pakistan's space and atomic energy programmes, health and education but increased allocations for the Sindh-specific projects and the parliamentarians' schemes.
Headed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the NEC also set the economic growth target at 4.2% and inflation at 7.5% for the next fiscal year 2025-26. The NEC is the nation's constitutional body having mandate to approve the macroeconomic and development plans.
The NEC also expressed concerns over growing population and showed resolve to find a solution, as the economic growth in this fiscal year was almost equal to the population growth rate.
The NEC approved the Rs1 trillion for the federal Public Sector Development Programme and Rs2.9 trillion for the provincial annual development plans. The cumulative budgets of Rs3.9 trillion negate the harsh fiscal ground realities, as the federal government even went to the extent of further reducing some critical proposed allocations to make room for more politically oriented development spending.
As against its earlier plan to allocate Rs50 billion for discretionary spending on the parliamentarians schemes, the allocation has been approved at Rs70 billion, showed the NEC document. Not only that, the federal government further increased the spending on provinces' development project from three-day old allocation of Rs93.4 billion to nearly Rs106 billion.
The room has been created by further reducing the spending on health and education from the level approved by the Annual Plan Coordination Committee on Monday. The Higher Education Commission's allocation is drastically reduced to Rs39.4 billion whereas the Ministry of health's budget is cut to Rs14.3 billion. To make room for political projects, the allocation for power sector projects was reduced from the earlier proposed Rs104 billion to Rs90 billion. But the water sector allocation has been increased to Rs133 billion, from earlier proposed Rs119 billion.
Compared to the budget approved by the APCC on Monday, the Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission's (SUPARCO) budget has been reduced from Rs24.2 billion to just Rs5.4 billon while the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's budget is reduced from Rs4.7 billion to Rs781 million.
The budget has been finalised by a committee comprising Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and PM's political Advisor Rana Sannuallah Khan.
Such large allocations for the provincial projects are in breach of commitments to the IMF for reducing federal expense on provincial projects.
The sources said that some of the NEC members discussed the low agriculture sector growth of mere 0.6% in this fiscal year and urged to change the economic policies, including high cost of inputs. The participants of the meeting said that Sindh asked to review the agriculture income tax and take it up with the IMF.
Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal did not comment on the question whether the Ministry of Finance will take up the matter with the IMF.
The four provincial governments have passed the new agriculture income tax laws but these have not yet been enforced. There is high chance that the IMF would not entertain any such request.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government took up the issue of delay in reopening the NFC award, as the provincial government is demanding higher share in the light of merger of the tribal districts. The prime minister assured the K-P government to convene the NFC meeting in August.
However, the government has further reduced the K-P merged districts allocation from Rs70 billion to Rs65.4 billion that had been approved by the APCC on Monday.
The Punjab government raised the issue of higher taxes on agriculture machinery.
The NEC approved Rs2.86 trillion for the four provincial governments, with the highest spending outlay of Punjab worth Rs1.2 trillion. Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa will spend Rs417 billion. Sindh government plans to spend Rs995 billion and the Balochistan government is proposing Rs280 billion for development.
The proposed development allocations by the four provinces are roughly Rs860 billion more than what the IMF has included in its plan. It means either the provinces will not be able to spend the entire allocations or the IMF cash surplus target will not be met.
The NEC also reviewed the implementation of the annual plan for this fiscal and approved the economic targets for the next fiscal. It also took a review of the implementation of the PSDP for the current fiscal year, taking note of low utilization of the funds.
The NEC also discussed the progress report of the CDWP & schemes approved by CDWP and ECNEC in the past one year. The NEC authorized the publication of 13th Five Year Plan 2024-29 and approved the URAAN Pakistan Implementation Framework.
Exports are projected at $35.3 billion, while foreign remittances are expected to exceed $39.4 billion in the next fiscal year. Imports are projected at $65.2 billion with the current account deficit estimated at $2.1 billion for the next fiscal year.
Currently, 1,071 development projects with a total cost of Rs13.4 trillion are under implementation. These projects require an additional Rs10.2 trillion to be completed, and the planning ministry estimates it would take more than a decade to finish them all.
The NEC also approved to publish the Five-year economic plan 2024-29. The NEC was told that 13th Five-Year Plan has been updated as a result of stakeholders' consultations and is ready for publication
the five year's plan is aimed at a balanced regional and equitable development, enhance export orientation of the economy - vibrant SMEs sector - social protection and poverty alleviation - improve the quality of human resources - moving into the knowledge economy - adaptation and mitigation strategy to combat climate change.
The Prime Minister had launched 'URAAN Pakistan' on 31st December, 2024 and the NEC on Wednesday approved its implementation framework.

A-listers unleash fury on IG after Sana Yousaf's murder
It has happened again.
There are no words that can fully convey the raw horror of the senseless murder of 17-year-old influencer Sana Yousaf. On Monday evening, a girl on the brink of adulthood embracing the promise of all the milestones her eighteenth year would bring, was gunned down in her home on what should have been a birthday celebration.
Why? As revealed by video press conferences from investigating officers, the shocking – but paradoxically unsurprising – answer is rooted in rejection. Sana's fresh-faced youthful perkiness lit up the screens of her over a million followers across both TikTok and Instagram combined. Along the way, this young influencer crossed paths with a man she had no interest in meeting. Ill equipped to deal with a 'no', that man broke into Sana's home on her 17th birthday. We all know what happened next.
Mahira, Sajal take to IG
Vocal showbiz A-listers with a keen finger on the pulse for justice rose united in horror across Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) to condemn this latest instance of gender-based violence – made all the more horrific by Sana's age and the cruel irony of her murder coinciding with her birthday.
Mahira Khan, taking a horrified pause from promoting her upcoming Eidul Azha film Love Guru, wrote on Instagram Stories, ""Can't get myself to stop thinking about Sana Yousaf. A 17-year-old beautiful girl. She had just blown out candles, made wishes, maybe danced a little. And then in seconds gone. Shot dead. Over a bloody 'No'.""
Digging to the rotten core of a society where a feminine rejection can lead to murder, the Maula Jatt star continued, ""But is it really about one moment? One second? One word? It's not. It's the system. The way we've raised men to believe they are owed something – attention, affection, obedience. The way we fail, again and again, to protect the girls who dare to have a voice, a choice.""
As with any incidence of female murder, misogynist comments across Facebook under the news of Sana's murder ranged from ""Yes, every female TikTokker deserves this"" to ""These TikTokkers advertising their stupidity make people leave Islam.""
With such fuel for the fire, Mahira was far from the only Pakistani star making public her disgust and despair over Sana's tragic murder as fellow actor Sajal Ali also turned to IG Stories to register her horror.
""A girl lost her life simply for saying no. What kind of world are we living in?"" wrote the Dil Wali Gali Mein star under the banner of the haunting hashtag #JusticeForSanaYousaf. ""The lack of empathy is terrifying. I just hope that we, as a society, learn to truly feel for others. To respect boundaries. To value life. May we grow in empathy, in understanding, and in basic humanity. #JusticeForSanaYousaf.""
Mawra, Maya join in
An equally enraged Mawra Hocane pointed to the devastating frequency with which women in Pakistan fall afoul of men they no longer wish to liaise with – and the justification offered up by social media users hinting that they asked for it.
""Another story we will forget in a few days, when a new story takes over — we've failed as a society, as humans. I see no return from this point,"" lamented the Jafaa star. ""I hear victim blaming. I hear how a woman should've behaved to evade this. It's all of us. We've contributed to men not being able to hear a NO!""
Pointing fingers at an entertainment industry that perpetuates problematic societal norms, Mawra added, ""Our content still romanticses forced relationships, toxic love, dominating male behaviours. Well, this is the impact. A 17-year-old was killed because a boy thought it would be okay to do so when rejected. I hope and pray that the authorities make an example out of the perpetrator.""
Similarly, Sunn Mere Dil actor Maya Ali, also taking to IG Stories, wrote that although she had never known Sana's family, she, too, shared in the vicarious grief felt by every woman who knows that it could have been them.
""I don't care about the reason. I don't want explanations. I want justice,"" penned Maya. ""I want the people who did this to be arrested or hanged. No mercy. No more waiting.""
Questioning why women must always be the gatekeepers of upholding a cultural facade, the actor continued, ""Why is it always a girl or a woman who has to pay the price for so-called 'honour'? It's heartbreaking. It's unbearable. And it must stop. I strongly urge the higher authorities to take strict and immediate action against this cruel and inhuman act.""
Male celebs speak up
Whilst the majority of celebrities who voiced their dissent on social media were predictably women, two male stars stood out. Maya's close friend and fellow actor Osman Khalid Butt voiced a similar sentiment to the former about authorities taking action.
""Umar Hayat must be prosecuted without delay. No loopholes, no leniency. All eyes on our law enforcement. All eyes on the courts,"" posted Osman on X alongside the hashtag #JusticeForSanaYousaf.
Chahat actor Imran Abbas was also amongst the first to raise his voice against the shocking incident. On Tuesday, Imran posted a widely circulated image of a beaming Sana, writing, ""I'm deeply saddened by the tragic news of the 17-year-old girl's murder. The government needs to take immediate action against these horrific crimes, particularly those committed against girls under the guise of personal vendetta, honour or other pretexts. This is the fifth one in [the] last few months.""
Anoushey spotlights trend
Perhaps the most outraged reaction came from recently married former VJ Anoushey Ashraf, whose heartfelt video and accompanying harrowing caption said it all and could also be found reposted in the IG Stories of Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum star Hania Aamir and Aiman Khan.
""Another young woman silenced. Another life stolen for being seen,"" began Anoushey in her caption. ""The murder of 17-year-old Sana Yousaf — vibrant, confident, full of promise shatters the illusion that women in Pakistan can exist freely, even in the digital world. She was a teenager creating joy for millions. To mourn her is not enough. We need to rage, to speak, to keep pushing for a world where women don't have to fear simply being. Sana, you deserved so much better. We will not forget you.""
To illustrate the rhetorical point that this is by no means an isolated incident, Anoushey turned the spotlight on her followers and asked women to speak up about the times they have felt unsafe, promising anonymity in return. Floored by the ""countless"" stories she received, the VJ posted a screenshot of at least 30 she had received, all depicting in grim detail how they had been harassed or assaulted by either strangers or men in their families.
Coming on the heels of the upheld guilty verdict of the horrific Noor Makaddam case last month (nearly four years after the fact), Sana's murder is no isolated case of gender based violence. And as Anoushey's simple Instagram exercise highlights yet again, although we may be in 2025, it will be far from the last.

Need for water reservoirs,"PK
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was on the mark as he called for building new reservoirs
Pakistan is in a realpolitik puzzle in terms of its water scarcity. The issue has aggravated since India unilaterally suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty, and went on to deny the lower riparian state its due of lifeline. Likewise, on the domestic front, the nation is engaged in a debate on how to overcome the pestering shortage of the essential commodity, as India has virtually stopped water discharges from Chenab River into Pakistan, resulting in a decrease from 35,000 cusecs to about 3,100 cusecs.
Last but not least, India is also laying its hands on altering capacity at hydroelectric projects in the Occupied Jammu and Kashmir to adversely impact Pakistan's share of downstream water. All that is needed at this juncture is to marshal a new water policy, and come up with enough reservoirs for self-sufficiency in electricity and agriculture; and that requires increased water storages and efficient water usage.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was on the mark as he called for building new reservoirs, and completing the ongoing Diamer-Bhasha Dam. The proposed dam, initially estimated at Rs479 billion, has been in limbo for six years; its timely commissioning will provide 6.4 maf water. But that is just one instrument of water holding.
Pakistan needs to build many more such reservoirs, as has been done by Iran, India and Turkiye over the last few decades. The tongue-in-cheek call from the PM that other reservoirs to store water must be considered in national interest might have a referral to Kalabagh Dam, and other projects, that fell pretty to political bickering.
Now is the time for greater inter-provincial coordination on a masterplan to secure water needs by eulogising indigenous geological potential.
While Pakistan has launched a successful diplomatic offensive to browbeat India on its water terrorism, the need is to effectively take it up in the lawfare domain too. Pakistan must knock at relevant international courts, and raise the IWT's suspension with the World Bank too. Pakistan has a genuine and lawfully-ordained stance, and all it needs is professional cajoling to put down India on its hegemonic mat.

PM writes to opposition to confer on new CEC,"US
Impasse now rests at the feet of both the treasury and opposition
After months of dead air and no movement on key electoral appointments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday extended an olive branch to National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub, inviting him for consultations on the appointment of a new Chief Election Commissioner (CEC).
In a letter, the premier stated that the term of the CEC, as well as that of two other members of the ECP, ended on January 26. However, all three have continued their duties under Article 215 of the Constitution.
He stated that, according to Article 218, proposals for the CEC and its members must be submitted to the parliamentary committee.
The letter comes as the constitutional logjam has been festering since January, as the five-year terms of CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja, Sindh Member Nisar Durrani and Balochistan Member Shah Muhammad Jatoi ended on January 26.
The process, laid out clearly in Article 213, requires a consensus between the prime minister and the opposition leader. In the event of no agreement, both sides are supposed to send separate lists of three names to a 12-member bipartisan committee, which would then pick one and send it to the president for formal appointment.
However, the process has been gathering dust. Though the seats of the CEC and two members expired in January, the government allowed the 45-day constitutional deadline for new appointments, which lapsed on March 12, to come and go without resolution.
The impasse now rests at the feet of both the treasury and opposition, with neither side making serious contact until the PM's letter.
On the other hand, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has already taken the government to court in March. A petition filed in the Islamabad High Court by Ayub and Senate Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz lambasts the inaction as a constitutional violation. It names the federal government, Senate chairman, National Assembly speaker and the ECP as respondents.
The petition urges the court to compel the National Assembly speaker to constitute the required parliamentary committee and calls on the Senate chairman to provide names of senators for the same.
It further asks the court to order the prime minister to hold meaningful consultations with Ayub, as required under Article 213, and to declare the continued presence of the CEC and two expired members as illegal.
Constitutional experts point to the 26th Amendment, which altered Article 215(4) to allow officeholders to continue ""till successors are appointed"". Both opposition and observers allege the amendment is a legislative patch over executive indecision, especially when key posts meant to guarantee fair elections remain in limbo.
Of the four members of the ECP, only the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa representatives - Babar Hassan Bharwana and Justice (retd) Ikramullah Khan - still have valid tenures, both stretching till mid-2027.
It is worth noting that CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja's tenure has been full of political minefields.
Opposition parties, particularly the PTI, have accused him of everything from election mismanagement to open partisanship. He has been criticised for failing to ensure timely general elections and for stripping the PTI of its iconic 'bat' symbol ahead of the 2024 polls.
The ECP has also come under fire for failing to implement the Supreme Court's verdict on reserved seats and for not holding Senate elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a delay denounced by critics as undermining federal parliamentary integrity.

"PM, field marshal to visit Saudi Arabia","PK
Pakistan wants talks but not desperate: Dar
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir would travel to Saudi Arabia for a day-long trip on Thursday, said the deputy prime minister on Wednesday, who added the visit is part of Pakistan's ongoing diplomatic outreach in the wake of brewing tensions with India.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar told the media that the prime minister accompanied by the army chief would thank the Saudi leadership for expressing solidarity with Pakistan in the recent military escalation with India.
Saudi Arabia was one of the main players that not only played a role in averting a crisis after the Pahalgam attack but was also instrumental in brokering the ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The prime minister and the field marshal earlier travelled to Turkey, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan to thank them for their support to Pakistan in the face of Indian aggression.
Surprisingly, Pakistan not only had an upper hand in the battlefield but also outshined India on the diplomatic front. India despite having enormous economic clout could not win support of its even closest allies, including the United States.
Dar told reporters that India's attempt to set a 'new normal' had been buried and the world witnessed its claims of hegemony blown into the air during the recent conflict with Pakistan.
The foreign minister revised the number and said Pakistan shot down six Indian fighter jets including four French made Rafale. Earlier, Pakistan said three Rafale jets were among the six aircraft shot down by Pakistan on the night of May 7.
The Indian chief of defence last week admitted publicly for the first time that a number of Indian aircraft were downed by Pakistan on the night of 7th May. However, Anil Chuhuan insisted that numbers did not matter, something that drew a strong reaction from the Indian opposition and government critics.
Dar said Pakistan's kinetic action had been appreciated, its diplomatic efforts also earned international recognition. He noted that there was even an outcry within India over Pakistan's successful diplomatic outreach.
He said ceasefire was holding but regretted the political rhetoric on the part of India, saying the Indian leaders were doing so in view of the upcoming elections.
The foreign minister said Pakistan was ready for a dialogue with India, but not desperate for it. ""Pakistan seeks a composite dialogue that includes terrorism as well as other issues, including the Indus Waters Treaty.""
He said if India tried to divert or stop water, it would amount to an act of war. He said the Indus Waters Treaty cannot be suspended or amended as per the international law.
Turning to the recent four-nation tour, Dar said the prime minister undertook a visit to Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan to express Pakistan's gratitude for the solidarity expressed by these countries during the conflict with India.

Indonesia mulls buying China's J-10 jets,"DK
.
Indonesia is weighing buying China's J-10 fighter jets, given their relatively cheaper price and advanced capability, as it also considers finalising a purchase of US-made F-15EX jets, a senior official said on Wednesday.
Southeast Asia's most populous country has in recent years embarked on efforts to modernise its ageing military hardware. In 2022 it bought 42 French Rafale jets worth $8.1 billion, six of which will be delivered next year.
""We have had talks with China and they offered us a lot, not just J-10, but also ships, arms, frigates,"" said Deputy Defence Minister and retired Air Marshal Donny Ermawan Taufanto.
""We're evaluating J-10,"" Taufanto said, adding that Jakarta was reviewing system compatibility and after-sales support as well as pricing.
A potential purchase has been considered for over a year, before the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, but Taufanto said Indonesia would factor in reports that a Pakistani J-10 plane shot down multiple Indian jets last month.
Jakarta also continues to consider whether to proceed with the next step for its purchase of F-15EX fighters, he said, following the defence ministry's deal with planemaker Boeing for the sale in 2023.
Taufanto said the US jets' capabilities were well recorded, but suggested the offered price of $8 billion for 24 planes remained in question.
French President Emmanuel Macron said after meeting Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto in Jakarta last week that they had signed a preliminary defence pact that could lead to new orders of French hardware including Rafale jets.
""We're considering (France's) offer. We're considering our own budget, we're evaluating, especially given we have other options like J-10, F-15,"" Taufanto said.

Former Foreign Minister and Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said Pakistan wants to resolve all outstanding disputes with India.
Talking to journalists at Pakistan's consulate in New York, Bilawal said all stakeholders will suffer during a war between Pakistan and India. ""Who requested for ceasefire after a war broke out between Pakistan and India, Indian politicians should ask this question from Modi,"" said the former FM.
Bilawal said either US President Donald Trump or Modi is telling a lie, adding, ""We want to tell the world that Modi is lying.""
He said Pakistan will continue its support for Palestine on political and diplomatic fronts. ""Our delegation talked in detail with the UN secretary general and he was very receptive,"" said Bilawal.
The PPP chairman said Pakistan will force India morally to refrain from stopping the flow of water. If India stops water for five days, the crops will be destroyed, said Bilawal, adding stopping water is not permissible in any law of the world.

Govt urged to restore EFS in original form,"US
Row between yarn, fabric producers and apparel sector deepens
Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers Association Chairman Babar Khan has emphasised that the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) should be restored in its true spirit and local supplies should also be included in its scope as the scheme has contributed to boosting exports not only in the value-added sector but also across several non-traditional areas.
Speaking at a press conference in Karachi on Wednesday, he noted that the process of depositing sales tax and receiving refunds was taking five to six months, which created liquidity issues. He was of the view that the spinners' lobby was demanding duties on yarn and fabric to maintain its monopoly and was misleading the government. ""We make up to 70% value addition in imported cotton; therefore, we demand a long-term policy,"" Babar Khan said, adding that there was constant anxiety before every budget over possible policy changes.
Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Jawed Bilwani claimed that the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (Aptma) chairman had acknowledged during a Planning Commission meeting that the quality of their yarn was substandard. He emphasised that imported cotton was both cheaper and of better quality, which enabled exports of non-traditional products. The EFS supported exports after the downturn caused by Covid-19 and should continue as originally envisioned, he said and mentioned that all textile composite units were supporting their stance.
In response to a question, Bilwani stated that the value-added sector had not misused the EFS and a real-time audit could be conducted, alleging that the misuse occurred in the iron and steel sector. He stressed that the scheme had opened up new export opportunities.
Bilwani questioned how exports were increasing when hundreds of spinning units had shut down. He proposed that the government should give sales tax exemption on local cotton and yarn sales as well.
Furthermore, he urged that utility tariffs for the spinning and export industries be aligned with those in the regional competitor countries. He recommended introducing a final tax regime instead of a normal one for export sectors and abolishing the advance tax collection.
Meanwhile, at a joint press conference held at the PHMA Lahore office, the hosiery manufacturers and the Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) demanded urgent action to restore the EFS in its original spirit. The request comes after local yarn and fabric producers demanded the withdrawal of the scheme, citing its misuse.
The leadership jointly called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and halt policy shifts that were threatening to dismantle the EFS. They warned that the ongoing bureaucratic distortions, compounded by lobbying from the spinning sector for new tariffs, were pushing the small and medium enterprise (SME)-based apparel export industry towards serious crisis.
PHMA Zonal Chairman Abdul Hameed and PRGMEA Regional Chairman Dr Ayyazuddin said the EFS had been introduced to allow duty-free import of raw material for exporters, giving Pakistan's apparel sector a competitive edge.
""Instead of simplifying exports, the EFS has become bogged down by manual procedures and is now under threat from proposed tariff changes,"" said Abdul Hameed.
Ayyazuddin stressed that the SMEs, which formed the bulk of the value-added industry, could not survive under such conditions. ""We operate on thin margins and short timelines. The EFS was a breakthrough for us, but now it's being reshaped to serve upstream interests. These tariffs, reportedly pushed by the spinners' lobby, protect a narrow segment at the cost of Pakistan's largest job-creating export base.""
The industry leaders expressed concern over reports of potential imposition of duties on raw material like synthetic yarn, man-made fibre, technical fabric and accessories – none produced locally. ""Any tariff on items under HS Chapters 54, 55 and 96 is unacceptable,"" said Hameed. ""These are essential production inputs and taxing them means taxing exports at the very beginning."" Speaking virtually, former PRGMEA chairman Ijaz Khokhar said the entire value chain had welcomed the EFS as a much-needed correction in policy. ""But distortions are creeping in. The original vision of a seamless, transparent system is being hijacked,"" he said.

"HEC, Sindh HEC at odds over VCs forum in Morocco","GB
Sindh bars use of provincial grants for foreign travel
A dispute has emerged between the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the Sindh Higher Education Commission (Sindh HEC) over the participation of university vice chancellors in an upcoming international forum scheduled to be held in Rabat, Morocco.
HEC has invited vice chancellors from across the country to attend the forum, asking universities to cover the travel expenses themselves. However, the Sindh HEC has refused to allow universities in the province to use provincial grants for this purpose.
Sindh HEC Chairman Dr Tariq Rafi has issued an advisory to the heads of all public sector universities advising them not to undertake foreign trips using public funds, with a warning that any such cases will be reported to the Chief Minister, the Chancellor or Controlling Authority of Universities in Sindh.
""The Sindh government provides grants to universities strictly for academic and research purposes. These funds cannot be spent on foreign trips,"" said Rafi. He added that while vice chancellors are free to attend the forum at their own expense, they are not permitted to use university or government funds for the trip.
Sindh HEC reminded that it was difficult for many public sector universities in Sindh to even pay salaries of the teachers and staff. Even essential expenditures were covered by loans, he said.
If such expenditures for international travel is of dire need, then they can only be incurred after approval of the same has been given by the Chief Minister.
The Sindh HEC quoting the existing policy of the Universities and Boards Department of Sindh says, that the leave notifications issued for foreign tours explicitly mention that the expenses of such tours will not be borne by the Government of Sindh or university funds.
The Vice Chancellors' Forum was originally planned to be held in Islamabad last month, but it was relocated to Rabat due to escalating tensions between Pakistan and India, sources said.
Sindh HEC emphasized that most universities in the province are already facing financial deficits, and spending scarce resources on international travel would be irresponsible.

Opposition leader fires back at CM's notice,"US
Ebad defends Kohistan scandal remarks, demands apology
The Leader of the Opposition in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Dr Ibadullah Khan, has issued a formal written response to the legal notice sent by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
In his reply, Dr Ibadullah stated that his press conference regarding the financial scandal in Kohistan was held in the public interest and not aimed at personally attacking the chief minister. He emphasized that instead of reacting with legal threats, the CM should take the issue seriously and initiate action against those responsible.
Ibad, through senior legal expert Advocate Sultan Muhammad Khan, addressed the legal notice and included both the chief minister and his counsel, Ali Azim Afridi, as parties in the response.
According to the reply, Ibad received the legal notice on May 24, 2025, which accused him of discussing the Kohistan financial scandal during a press conference.
The reply clarifies that the press conference was held on May 16 with other MPAs, during which Dr Ibad expressed his views in good faith and in the public interest.
As an elected representative and Leader of the Opposition, he stated it is his constitutional duty to highlight public issues and hold the government accountable for its policies and actions. Criticism of government performance, especially when it involves public funds and governance, is a fundamental responsibility of the opposition in any democratic setup, the response added.
Advocate Sultan Muhammad Khan further noted in the written reply that the chief minister should respect constructive criticism and use it as an opportunity for improvement. As a public officeholder entrusted by the people, the chief minister should not respond in a dictatorial manner or view such criticism as a personal attack. In a democracy, criticism is a necessary and healthy part of governance.
The written response also pointed out that the issue raised in the press conference is based on facts, with the matter having been taken up by both the Provincial Assembly's Public Accounts Committee and the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). Moreover, the press talk was conducted within the Assembly premises, which provides it with legal immunity.
As the province's chief executive, the chief minister is constitutionally responsible for governance, and rather than leveling allegations against others, he should fulfill his constitutional obligations. The purpose of the press conference, Dr Ibad stated, was to remind the chief minister of his duty as the custodian of the provincial treasury and the head of anti-corruption efforts.

'Russia will respond to Ukrainian attacks',"US
Putin discusses drone strikes with top ministers
Russian President Vladimir Putin told US President Donald Trump on Wednesday that he would have to respond to high-profile Ukrainian drone attacks on Russia's nuclear-capable bomber fleet and a deadly bridge bombing that Moscow blamed on Kyiv.
After Ukraine bombed bridges and attacked Russia's fleet of nuclear-capable bombers deep in Siberia and Russia's far north, Putin on Wednesday said he did not think Ukraine's leaders wanted peace. He accused the leadership in Kyiv of terrorism.
Shortly after the Russian president discussed the attacks with his top ministers in Moscow, Trump said he had spoken by telephone with Putin for one hour and 15 minutes, and that they had discussed the Ukrainian attacks and Iran.
""We discussed the attack on Russia's docked airplanes, by Ukraine, and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides. It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate Peace,"" Trump said on social media.
""President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,"" Trump said, adding that he hoped Putin could be helpful in US negotiations with Iran over Tehran's nuclear programme. He accused Iran of ""slowwalking"" regarding the nuclear talks.
Trump has been unusually silent on the Ukrainian attacks on the Russian bombers – one of the three pillars of Russia's nuclear arsenal – though Moscow demanded that the United States and Britain restrain Ukraine.
The Kremlin said Trump had told Putin that Washington was not informed in advance of the Ukrainian attacks. Trump's Ukraine envoy said the risk of escalation from the war in Ukraine was ""going way up"" after the strikes.
In some of his most hawkish remarks in recent months on the outlook for peace, Putin on Wednesday said the bridge attacks had been directed against civilians and accused Ukrainian leadership of being a ""terrorist organisation"" supported by powers who were becoming ""terrorist accomplices"".
""The current Kyiv regime does not need peace at all,"" Putin said at a meeting with senior officials. ""What is there to talk about? How can we negotiate with those who rely on terror?"" Ukraine has accused Moscow of not seriously wanting peace, citing as evidence Russian resistance to an immediate ceasefire.
Putin, in his public remarks, did not mention the bomber attacks, which came just before Russia and Ukraine met for direct peace talks in Istanbul on June 2 where Moscow set out what the United States has called ""maximalist"" aims.
Putin also discussed the war in Ukraine with Pope Leo in a telephone call, the Kremlin said. The president ""reaffirmed his interest in bringing about peace by political and diplomatic means"", the Kremlin said, describing the call as ""constructive"".
Putin's remarks at a televised meeting with senior officials came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed implementation of a ceasefire until a meeting can be arranged with Putin. Zelenskiy also sought support from US President Donald Trump for the idea.
""My proposal, which I believe our partners can support, is that we agree a ceasefire with the Russians until the leaders meet,"" Zelenskiy told a briefing in Kyiv. ""At this time, people will understand that the nations, Europe, Ukraine and the whole world have a chance to end the war,"" he added.

Pak airspace ban costs Air India Rs8.2b,"TR
Air India's Chief Executive Officer has formally written to Indian government, highlighting scale of financial damage
As the airspace ban Pakistan slapped on Indian carriers drags on for forty days, the cost for Air India is turning from heavy to near-unsustainable, aviation sources said on Wednesday.
The Indian national carrier has already taken a hit of over Rs8.2 billion since the closure began.
According to well-placed aviation insiders, Air India is bleeding approximately Rs200 million each day due to longer alternate routes, increased fuel consumption and delays triggered by the airspace detour.
In a sign of rising frustration, Air India's Chief Executive Officer Campbell Wilson has formally written to the Indian government, highlighting the scale of financial damage.
In the letter, Wilson reportedly warned that continued restrictions could render airline operations unsustainable if not addressed soon.
According to The Economic Times, an internal presentation showed that Air India had, late last year, set a target to become profitable by FY 27. However, the closure of Pakistani airspace for Indian carriers is likely to delay that.
""It will still take a little bit more time to achieve what we want to achieve, but it was a five-year project in the beginning,"" Wilson said in the interview to the Economic Times, referring to the five-year transformation plan 'Vihaan' announced in September 2022.
""The closure of Pakistani airspace, which started on April 24, has forced Air India's flights to North America to take detours and stop in Vienna or Copenhagen to refuel, leading to increased expenses,"" the report noted.
""It's not insignificant, butas long as it covers the cost of operation, we will continue to operate,"" Wilson said. ""We don't know the extent to which the bottom line is going to be affected. We will try to minimise the effect.""
The CEO's concerns are not limited to Air India alone. Other Indian carriers have also reportedly suffered billions of rupees in cumulative losses, though precise estimates remain undisclosed.
""This isn't just turbulence, it's a full-blown storm for Indian aviation,"" a senior aviation official remarked, noting that the 40-day closure has upended flight logistics, increased operational costs, and complicated international schedules for Indian carriers.
The airspace restrictions, which came into effect in the wake of heightened diplomatic tensions, have now completed 40 days, with no breakthrough in sight. For airlines forced to circumvent Pakistani airspace, the sky is not only the limit but also a costly detour.
As the ban continues, industry experts warn that Indian carriers might soon be compelled to cut routes or hike fares, passing the burden onto passengers, unless diplomatic channels find a way to clear the air.

"Djokovic, Sinner chase FO semis","US
The Serbian will compete in a record 19th French Open quarter-final
Big guns Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic both chase semi-final berths at the French Open on Wednesday, but the spotlight will be on home hope Lois Boisson in the women's tournament.
French wildcard Boisson, ranked 361st in the world, steps up against Russian sixth seed Mirra Andreeva with a chance to write her own chapter in French tennis history.
Handed a wildcard to enter the tournament, the 22-year-old kept home hopes alive by battling past US third seed Jessica Pegula to reach the last eight.
""Obviously, it's a dream to begin with. I hope to go further,"" said the player from Dijon.
""This is my favourite surface. As soon as the clay season starts, this is when I feel best and when I feel happiest.""
Second seed Coco Gauff will play seventh seed Madison Keys in an all-American quarter-final, looking to join world number one Aryna Sabalenka and three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek who are already through to the final four in the other half of the draw.
Djokovic will compete in a record 19th French Open quarter-final against last year's runner-up Alexander Zverev.
The German third seed will be well rested after his last-16 opponent Tallon Griekspoor retired on Monday with an abdominal injury while trailing 6-4, 3-0.
Zverev, who lost to Carlos Alcaraz in last year's final, continues his latest bid for a maiden Grand Slam title after three runner-up finishes.
""For me, Carlos is the favourite. Then I would say the next three in line are Jannik, myself, and Novak, right? I still believe that,"" said Zverev, who could meet world number one Sinner in the semi-finals.
Zverev has made at least the last four at the past four French Opens and is into his seventh quarter-final.
The 28-year-old has won five of his 13 career matches with Djokovic, including in Melbourne in January when the Serb retired injured from their semi-final.
'Pretty dominant'
Djokovic, a three-time champion at Roland Garros, is just the second player to record 100 wins at the event after 14-time winner Rafael Nadal (112).
""It's a very pretty number, but 101 victories sounds better,"" said 38-year-old Djokovic who has reached the quarter-finals at the clay-court major for a 16th consecutive year.
""I will continue to search for another victory, it's clearly not finished for me here. I'm very honoured to make history in this sport, which has given me everything in my life.""
World number six Djokovic is chasing a record 25th major title and has a 100-16 record at Roland Garros.
Italian Sinner takes on unseeded Kazakh Alexander Bublik, who hailed his emotional four-set win over fifth seed Jack Draper in the last 16 as the ""best moment of his life"".
Sinner leads 62nd-ranked Bublik 3-1 in previous meetings.
Both Sinner and Djokovic have not dropped a set so far.
The Italian reached the semi-finals last year where he lost a five-set battle to Spaniard Alcaraz.
Australian Open champion Keys plays Gauff against whom she has a 3-2 record winning their only meeting on clay in Madrid last year.
""It feels great to be back in the quarters here, and really happy with how I played today and hopefully can keep going,"" said Gauff who has 15 wins on clay this year.
Former US Open champion Gauff puts her success on the surface down to her unwavering belief that she can turn a match in her favour no matter the score.
She is hoping to make it third time lucky at the French Open, after losing in the finals in Madrid and Rome last month.
Gauff made her first Grand Slam final in Paris in 2022 at the age of just 18.
""I remember meeting Coco for the first time, and in my head she was, like, nine years old,"" joked 30-year-old Keys, who won her maiden Grand Slam title in Melbourne in January.
""And just kind of watching her play, I knew that she was going to be someone that was going to be pretty dominant pretty quickly.""

Jam Kamal unveils new pharma export council,"US
Eyes increasing exports to $3b, boosting trade with Afghanistan; health minister backs local ingredient production
Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan has reaffirmed the government's resolve to boost pharmaceutical exports, announcing the near-operational launch of PharmEx Pakistan — a new Pharma Export Promotion Council — under the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP).
""The pharmaceutical sector has huge export potential, and PharmEx Pakistan is just one or two steps away from becoming operational,"" the minister said on Wednesday, while praising the industry's rapid growth. He assured continued government support to help the sector meet international export targets.
Speaking during a presentation by Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Association (PPMA) Chairman Touqeerul Haq, the commerce minister also expressed optimism about trade with Afghanistan, noting that ""with every passing day, our relations are growing stronger and more streamlined — pharmaceutical exports will rise accordingly.""
Haq briefed the commerce minister on PharmEx Pakistan, a new public-private initiative designed to manage and promote pharmaceutical exports. He credited the minister's swift action on urgent issues for preventing significant financial losses in the sector and projected that PharmEx Pakistan could help raise exports from $700 million to $3 billion. The push builds on steady sectoral growth. According to industry figures, pharmaceutical exports climbed from $270 million in 2020-21 to $355 million in 2024-25. PharmEx Pakistan is expected to improve regulatory compliance, expand international market access, and enhance global visibility for Pakistani pharmaceutical products.
To further aid exporters, the commerce minister announced a dedicated Exporter Facilitation Desk within the ministry to address time-sensitive matters requiring direct government intervention.
Separately, the federal minister for national health services met with a PPMA delegation to discuss critical sector issues, including amendments to drug rules, local production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and enhanced bilateral trade with Afghanistan. He stressed the importance of fostering the local pharmaceutical manufacturing industry and reiterated the strategic importance of domestic API production.
The minister directed the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) to develop a concept note on establishing a Naphtha Cracker facility, a key step toward self-sufficiency in pharmaceutical raw materials.
To ensure drug quality, the health minister also announced a new trace and track system using barcodes for medicine verification via mobile phones.

Atkinson likely to miss first India Test,"US
England are already without Mark Wood, Olly Stone and Jofra Archer
England's key fast bowler Gus Atkinson is likely to miss the first Test against India, starting at Headingley, due to a right hamstring strain, international media reported on Wednesday.
According to a report, Atkinson sustained the injury during England's one-off Test against Zimbabwe last month and has since missed the ongoing ODI series against the West Indies.
While hopes had been high for his availability in the series opener on June 20, sources indicate he is still struggling to regain full fitness.
This setback adds to England's growing list of seamers sidelined by injury. Key fast bowlers Mark Wood and Olly Stone remain unavailable, while Jofra Archer's anticipated return to red-ball cricket has been delayed by a thumb injury.
Meanwhile, Chris Woakes is making steady progress in his comeback from an ankle injury and is expected to feature for England Lions against India A this week.
Brydon Carse, who recently recovered from a foot injury, has returned to action in the ODI series against the West Indies.
In Atkinson's potential absence, other bowlers may be called upon to fill the void. Essex's Sam Cook, who debuted during the Zimbabwe Test, and Durham's Matthew Potts are strong candidates.
Nottinghamshire's Josh Tongue, who impressed with two wickets against Zimbabwe, could also be added to the Lions squad to face India A in order to maintain match readiness.
The 27-year-old has quickly become a key figure in England's bowling lineup following the retirements of Stuart Broad and James Anderson.
Since his Test debut last summer, he has played in 12 of England's 13 Tests, claiming 55 wickets - the highest tally among bowlers worldwide during that period.

Local gold prices steady despite global surge,"PL
Global tensions, weak dollar push gold up; rupee slides 10 paisa to 282.22/$
Gold prices remained unchanged in Pakistan on Wednesday, despite a notable rise in the international market, where safe-haven demand and a softer US dollar buoyed prices amid heightened geopolitical concerns.
According to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), the price of gold per tola in the local market held steady at Rs354,100. Similarly, the rate for 10 grams remained unchanged at Rs303,583.
This stability comes after a sharp increase of Rs5,900 per tola on Monday when prices had surged to Rs353,100.
Globally, gold prices rose on Wednesday, buoyed by a softer dollar and persistent geopolitical tensions across multiple fronts, keeping investors alert amid a range-bound market awaiting fresh catalysts.
Spot gold rose 0.9% to $3,381.32 an ounce, as of 1143 GMT. US gold futures were up at $3,406.80.
In global markets, gold rebounded from early losses as weak US employment data prompted a shift in investor sentiment. Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, noted that the international gold price hit a low of $3,343 earlier in the day before recovering to a high of $3,384. It was last trading at around $3,373.
""Gold was declining since morning, but after the US market opened, weak employment data triggered a recovery. Prices briefly touched $3,384 before settling slightly lower,"" Agar explained.
He added that Friday's release of the US non-farm payroll dataa key monthly employment indicatorwill be critical in determining the future direction of gold prices. ""That data could be a major market mover,"" he said.
Additionally, rising geopolitical tensions, including renewed flare-ups in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and emerging concerns over global trade disputes, are contributing to volatility in the precious metals market.
""Investors are closely monitoring geopolitical developments and US economic indicators,"" Agar said. ""These factors are driving current movements and will continue to shape gold prices in the coming days.""
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee posted a slight decline against the US dollar on Wednesday, slipping by 0.04% in the inter-bank market.
By the end of the trading session, the rupee closed at 282.22 against the dollar, marking a depreciation of 10 paisas compared to Tuesday's closing rate of 282.11.
At the close of the trading session, the Pakistani rupee depreciated by 0.04% day-on-day (DoD) against the US dollar, settling at 282.22, according to Ismail Iqbal Securities. On a calendar year-to-date (CYTD) basis, the rupee has depreciated by 1.30%, while the fiscal year-to-date (FYTD) depreciation stands at 1.38%.
Globally, the US dollar weakened on Wednesday as investors awaited upcoming US employment figures for near-term market direction, while also monitoring progress in President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff discussions with major trade partners such as China.

Alarms over the 27th constitutional tweak,"TR
Legal fraternity divided over proposed tweak as it still debates 26th Amendment
While the federal government has yet to formally move ahead with the 27th Constitutional Amendment, murmurs of discontent and debate have already taken root within the legal fraternity as the Supreme Court resumes hearings on review petitions challenging the July 12 order in the reserved seats case.
Tensions escalated further when Islamabad High Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Gilani came out in support of the proposed amendment, hailing it as an opportunity for much-needed ""structural reforms"" in the superior judiciary.
However, the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) fired back, condemning Gilani's stance and warning that lawyers from Sindh would ""strongly resist, by any means necessary, any attempt to reintroduce martial law and impose this judicial one-unit scheme upon the federation of Pakistan"".
'Post-constitutional order'
Weighing in, former additional attorney general Tariq Mahmood Khokhar pointed out that the original draft of the 26th Amendment had already been significantly revised under duress.
""In the face of opposition, to the chagrin of the Established Order, many of its amendment clauses had to be dropped from the final draft. But they were not abandoned as a lost cause,"" Khokhar said.
He argued that the current political climate is ""propitious"" for reintroducing those previously omitted provisions through the 27th Amendment.
""Victory on the battlefield can be seductive. Opposition is almost invariably a daunting task in Pakistan. More so now than ever before. Even otherwise, controlled institutions, lacking public legitimacy, unrepresentative legislatures and executives, the mainstream media and the legal fraternity are vying for collaboration.""
Khokhar warned that these dormant clauses could now return with ease, asserting that the 26th Amendment had already propelled Pakistan into a ""post-constitutional order"".
""The proposed 27th Amendment will 'formally' replace the already diminished rule of law with rule by law (law as an instrument of control). Expect reintroduction of military courts, a federal constitutional court, revamped judicial commission, redefined provincial powers, diminished judiciary, curtailment of the fundamental rights, marginalisation of the constitutional institutions, an authoritarian presidential system and more,"" he said.
""The supreme tragic irony is that the intended victims are, with rare honourable exceptions, willing accomplices in and apologists for offences against the constitution and democracy,"" Khokhar warned.
Meanwhile, lawyers have begun to question why the committee of constitutional benches, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, has not yet fixed hearings on petitions against the 26th Constitutional Amendment, as it moves swiftly on the reserved seats case – a matter deemed crucial for enabling the ruling coalition to secure two-thirds majority in Parliament.
Observers note that the constitutional bench appears eager to wrap up the proceedings on the reserved seats case without delay. However, questions are being raised over whether such haste risks undermining judicial independence, a salient feature of the Constitution.
Moreover, the very formation of the constitutional bench is itself under scrutiny. A section of the legal community alleges that those who benefited from the 26th Amendment are hesitant to adjudicate its legal challenges.
In 2015, a majority of SC judges, in the landmark 21st Constitutional Amendment case, had held that the parliamentary form of government was a salient feature of the Constitution and could not be amended via constitutional amendment.
Justice (retd) Sheikh Azmat Saeed authored the judgment, which was endorsed by eight judges.
According to the verdict, the constitution contains a scheme that reflects its salient features.
""In an effort to discover such salient features, material outside the Constitution cannot be safely relied upon. The salient features are ascertainable from the Constitution including democracy, the parliamentary form of government and independence of the judiciary,"" the ruling read.
It further stated that Parliament's power to amend the Constitution was subject to implied limitations. As per Articles 238 and 239, Parliament may amend the Constitution, provided that the salient features are not repealed, abrogated, or substantively altered.
The judgment also affirmed that the apex court is vested with jurisdiction to interpret the Constitution and to determine whether any constitutional amendment violates its defining features.
While the majority judgment remains in force, legal circles maintain that there was still a pressing need for the top court to examine the validity of the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
They caution that further delay in adjudication could open the door for additional constitutional amendments, potentially threatening the Constitution's foundational principles.
Meanwhile, in its strongly worded statement, the Karachi Bar Association expressed dismay over IHCBA President Gilani's public endorsement of an amendment ""as yet unknown to the nation at large"".
""The lawyers and the people of Pakistan expect Bar Associations and Bar Councils to be independent voices. They must not act as proxies on behalf of the Government and be used to throw out feelers on the Government's behalf and declare support and rubber-stamp constitutional amendments that are yet to even see the light of day.""
The KBA argued that making such statements while the legal community continues to grapple with the consequences of the 26th Amendment, which has not only been rejected by the legal community at large but is also sub judice, was ""entirely unwarranted"".
""If indeed there is any such Amendment on the anvil and the Government has seen fit to secretly share its contents with the IHCBA President; he should share the same with his actual constituents – which is the legal community.""
""The news is also being spread that such Amendment will include a requirement of fresh oath for superior court judges. This is a transparent attempt to intimidate the few judges left who are yet to surrender their conscience at the feet of the government. It is identical to the PCO oaths invented by General Zia and General Musharraf for this very purpose and any civilian and legal/judicial collaborators in this martial-law exercise shall surely be remembered in the same terms as Sharifuddin Pirzada and Abdul Hameed Dogar,"" the statement further read.
""In any event, to the extent the learned IHCBA President has announced support for constitutional amendments that would allow High Court and Lower Court judges from Islamabad to be transferred and posted in the different provinces (with or without their consent); the Karachi Bar Association considers this not only an attack on judicial independence but an attack on federalism and the autonomy and independence of provincial judiciaries.""
""Let there be no doubt, the lawyers of Sindh strongly reject and shall resist, by any means necessary, any attempt to reintroduce martial-law and impose this judicial One-Unit scheme upon the Federation of Pakistan,"" the association warned.

"Woman, son found dead at home","US
The neighborhood took the two daughters into their protective custody and handed them over to their uncle.
Hysteric screams of fear and horror of two minor girls made the neighbours rush to the otherwise quaint house which was home to Faisal Saghiruddin, his wife Sana son Muhammad Ali and two little daughters.
Sana was lying in a pool of blood, her throat slit open with a sharp knife. Faisal was also lying unconscious nearby with deep cut in the neck and knife in his hand. Muhamamd Ali was also dead, but there was no visible mark of trauma.
The neighborhood took the two daughters into their protective custody and handed them over to their uncle.
The police seized a sharp-edged knife from the crime scene and sent the bodies of Sana and her son, Muhammad Ali, to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for post-mortem. The severely injured Faisal Saghiruddin was shifted from Abbasi Shaheed Hospital to Civil Hospital for treatment.
District West police chief SSP Tariq Elahi Mastoi said the investigation so far strongly suggests that the victim Sana's husband Faisal, who was also injured, allegedly killed his wife and son. Sana's two minor daughters, Aimal and Bareera, were present in the house and initially told the police that they went to sleep between 10pm and 2:30am and usually wake up between 10am and 11am, but today they slept until 4:30pm, raising suspicions that they might have been given sleeping pills.
However, the police are recording statements from the neighborhood and local residents. The exact reason for the double murder could not be determined immediately, but the police are further investigating.
Local residents said Faisal had a hardware store in the area and had rented a house about a year and a half ago. The neighbors gathered upon hearing the girls' screams and immediately informed the police. They mentioned that they had never heard any quarrels or disputes coming from the house.

Author Dr Nauman sues Shoaib Akhtar,"US
Rs1b legal notice sent to former pacer over derogatory remarks
Pakistan's eminent cricket author and a former director at country's cricket Board, Dr Nauman Niaz has sued former express fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar for one billion rupees on derogatory remarks on a television channel.
Niaz told Telecomasia he has sent a legal notice to Akhtar to publicly apologise on his remarks or face legal proceedings for damages of one billion Pakistan rupees (around 3.56 million dollars).
Nauman has a prominent career not only as a hepatologist with education form esteemed institutions of Australia and the UK but as a director of Sports at the state-owned Pakistan Television (PTV) brining in world's top players for various transmissions. He has also written 14 books on cricket, the prominent being a history of Pakistan cricket.
""Yeh Dr. Nauman huamaray bags utatha (Dr Nauman Niaz basically used to carry our luggage for us in the team),"" Shoaib said on a podcast which was widely projected at various social media platforms.
Both Akhtar and Dr Nauman have a history of clashes, the first being a spat on PTV transmission of the World Cup. As anchor of the show, Niaz had a verbal clash with Akhtar who was there as a guest. Niaz asked Akhtar to leave the show which he did. Later, after an intervention from a government official the two settled the issue.
It may be mentioned here that since the past two years, Dr Nauman has faced the wrath of government officials and has been on the sidelines in PTV. He is currently hosting a popular show ""Caught Behind"" with former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif on Youtube.
Akhtar, while reacting to the legal notice, said he has hired a leading lawyer to fight the case. ""I have received a legally defective, unfounded, ego satisfying and utterly frivolous defamation notice from Nauman Niaz.

Gary Stead to depart as New Zealand coach,"US
The coach enjoyed a prolific seven years in the role
New Zealand men's head coach Gary Stead is set to leave his role when his contract finishes at the end of June.
Stead, who had already departed as white-ball coach, was ruled out of a Test-only role after New Zealand Cricket's decision to employ one head coach across all three formats.
The coach enjoyed a prolific seven years in the role, with the team claiming an ICC World Test Championship victory in 2021, with the team topping the Test Rankings, and claiming a momentous 3-0 Test series sweep of India away from home last year.
The side also sat on top spot in the ODI rankings in his tenure, reaching the final of the Men's Champions Trophy 2025, Men's Cricket World Cup 2019 and the T20 World Cup 2021, among other semi-final appearances at global tournaments.
An emotional Stead reflected on his time with great fondness.
""There's been some amazing memories over the past seven years based around a group of fantastic and talented people who have gone out to give their best for their country, each other and for the fans,"" he said.
""Brendon McCullum and Mike Hesson had left the team with strong values and a style of play, and I've just tried to build and shape that further to grow our ability to be consistent in everything we do.
""It's been nice to be competitive across all three formats and I'd like to think that regardless of results, the opposition know the BLACKCAPS are a team that won't fold and will always show the grit and determination to compete.
""To work alongside some of New Zealand's best cricketers and have had a ringside seat to every training and match has been very special and an absolute honour.
""For a country with five million people and limited resources, we comparatively perform outstandingly well against the other powerhouses of the game.
""I'd like to wish the new coach well and the team every success in the future.""
As New Zealand look to his replacement, 53-year-old Stead has outlined his intention to carry on in his coaching career.
""I'll initially take some time to refresh and recharge, but I still have the coaching bug and will look to explore opportunities at home and abroad where I can look to share what I've learned from my 30 years of professional sport as a player and coach.""
Kane Williamson led the tributes for Stead's contribution to New Zealand cricket.
""Steady gave absolutely everything to the team,"" Williamson said.

PSX at new peak over budget hopes,"US
Index up 1,348 points as tax relief expectations, positive data boost interest
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-breaking run on Wednesday as the benchmark KSE-100 index closed at an all-time high at nearly 121,800 points.
Investor sentiment remained upbeat ahead of the federal budget, buoyed by expectations of fiscal relief measures and encouraging macroeconomic indicators.
The rally was supported by a 10% year-on-year increase in petroleum product sales for May, rising cement exports and the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) approval of a $800 million financing package. Broader market gains were also driven by speculation about tax rationalisation and power tariff adjustments.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti observed that stocks closed at a new all-time high in a pre-budget rally, led by across-the-board activity, as investors weighed tax relief, power tariff cuts and the prime minister's hint at progress in budget talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
""The record bullish close was driven by a 10% surge in petroleum sales for May, rising cement exports and the approval of ADB's $800 million financing that will be supportive for rupee stability,"" he added.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index advanced 1,347.99 points, or 1.12%, and settled at 121,798.87.
Topline Securities noted in its review that the bullish momentum from the previous session was carried forward, fuelled by robust buying from local institutions and corporates, as indicated by the National Clearing Company data.
The key drivers of the rally included heavyweight stocks such as National Bank, Bank AL Habib, Systems Limited, Lucky Cement and MCB Bank, which contributed 586 points to the index, it said.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented in its report that the KSE-100 extended gains after breaching the 120,000 mark, rising 1.7% week-on-week ahead of the final session before Eid holidays.
Some 61 shares rose while 37 fell with National Bank (+10%), Bank AL Habib (+3.42%) and Systems Limited (+3.38%) contributing the most to index gains. In contrast, Habib Metropolitan Bank (-2.48%), Pakistan Oilfields (-0.66%) and National Foods (-2.67%) were the biggest drags.
Among corporate news, Big Bird Foods (+3.45%) announced direct export access to Alibaba's global B2B platforms while Cherat Cement (+4.49%) expressed interest in acquiring Attock Cement (-0.03%).
AHL expects that the 120k level will be built as a support and the index may advance to 130k.
KTrade Securities wrote in its market wrap that the KSE-100 index marked another historic session, closing at a new all-time high, driven primarily by strong performances in mainboard stocks, particularly the banking sector.
The sectors showing notable strength included commercial banks, technology, oil and gas and cement. Investor sentiment still remains measured amid uncertainty ahead of the federal budget announcement, it said.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the KSE-100 surged at the commencement of trading and maintained a strong momentum, hitting a new intra-day high and settling at a record close at 121,799.
With this powerful breakout above previous highs, the index is poised for continued upward momentum, potentially attracting increased institutional flows, he said.
He asked investors to capitalise on intra-day dips and accumulate fundamentally strong stocks in fertiliser, cement and banking sectors to benefit from the current upward trend.
Overall trading volumes increased to 710.6 million shares compared with Tuesday's tally of 578.2 million. The value of shares traded was Rs35.2 billion.
Shares of 475 companies were traded. Of these, 264 stocks closed higher, 170 fell and 41 remained unchanged.
Sui Southern Gas Company was the volume leader with trading in 51.6 million shares, rising Rs2.11 to close at Rs38.42. It was followed by Fauji Foods with 51.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.56 to close at Rs16.75 and K-Electric with 41.4 million shares, rising Rs0.09 to close at Rs5.41. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs946 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

Sher Jang, resident of Kernal Sher Khan Kaly, filed an FIR at Pormoli police station, stating that he, along with his cousin Ahmed Ali (61) and Ahmed's son Kotar Ali, were cultivating maize in their fields located in Maliarano Kothey Arhat. During this time, the accused Shakil Bacha and his father Lal Bacha arrived on a motorcycle armed and began firing at them.
As a result, Ahmed Ali was killed on the spot, Sher Jang was seriously injured, while Kosar Ali narrowly escaped unharmed. The motive behind the attack has been attributed to a longstanding land dispute.
In a separate but related incident, Sher Ali of Maniri Payan filed an FIR at Sawabi police station regarding the murder of his 27-year-old son, Zain Muhammad. According to Sher Ali, Zain Muhammad left home last evening and later his nephew Abrar Muhammad informed him that Zain's body was found dumped at Pahar Gar Maniri Payan near Ground School No 1.
Upon investigation, it was revealed that Zain Muhammad was shot dead by Sartaj and his brother Sajjad, sons of Khanzada, residents of Largo Pul, using firearms. The conflict reportedly stemmed from Zain Muhammad's marriage to a woman from the Khanzada family about a year ago. The couple had separated three months ago when the wife returned to her parental home and filed for divorce, with a court hearing scheduled for June 11.

Pilgrims begin Hajj under blazing sun,"US
Pilgrims begin Hajj under blazing sun
More or less 1.6 million pilgrims from around the world, including 115,000 Pakistanis, on Wednesday converged on the vast tent city of Mina for the five-day communion with their Creator, Allah Almighty, invoking His divine mercy and seeking forgiveness for their sins.
The sprawling tent city of Mina, situated just outside Makkah, marks the first stop for pilgrims undertaking Hajj.
They will spend the night there before departing at dawn on Thursday for the plains of Arafat, where they will observe Waqoof-e-Arafat, the Rukn-e-Azm of Hajj, in deep prayer and reflection, seeking divine blessings.
Pilgrims will listen to the Hajj sermon in their tents, with translations available in 35 languages. They will perform Zohr and Asr prayers together and spend the entire day engaged in prayers and Talbia.
With temperatures expected to top 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), robed pilgrims slowly circled the holy Kaaba.
Authorities have ratcheted up heat protection measures such as extra shade to avoid a repeat of last year, when 1,301 people died as temperatures hit 51.8C (125.2F).
On Wednesday, pilgrims will perform the tawafwalking seven times around the holy Kaaba.
Shaded areas have been enlarged by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands of additional medics will be on standby and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, Hajj Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah told AFP last week.
Artificial intelligence technology will help process the deluge of data, including video from a new fleet of drones, to better manage the massive crowds.

105 escapees recaptured after Malir jailbreak; 111 at large,"PK
Prisoner returning voluntarily says wants to complete term, live peacefully
Investigations were ongoing on Wednesday into the mass escape of prisoners from Malir District Jail.
Over the past 24 hours, 27 more inmates have been re-arrested and returned to the jail, bringing the total number of recaptured prisoners to 105. However, 111 inmates remain at large.
Separate search operations are underway across various parts of the city. Meanwhile, some inmates are returning voluntarily. One such prisoner, Muhammad Asif-jailed in a theft case-was brought back by his maternal uncle on Wednesday morning. Asif told the media that the jail break occurred following strong earthquake tremors, which caused panic among inmates and damaged a section of the jail wall. With the barrack doors left open, prisoners were able to escape through the main gate.
Reportedly, profiles of all escaped inmates have been compiled, and raids are being conducted at their residences. Jail authorities have stated that inmates returning voluntarily will be treated leniently, while strict action will be taken against those who continue to evade arrest.
Normalcy has returned to Malir Jail, and visitation restrictions have been lifted.

Zardari chastises PPP over Sialkot loss,"GB
Issues directives to revamp PPP's performance in Punjab
President Asif Ali Zardari has expressed strong displeasure over the Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP) defeat in the PP-52 Sialkot (Sambrial) by-election, pulling up senior party officials for underwhelming performance.
Zardari aired his concerns during his recent political engagements at the Governor House in Lahore, where he also held meetings with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other key political figures.
During his interaction with PPP Punjab's leadership, President Zardari openly rapped party officials for their handling of the by-election campaign in PP-52, expressing concern over the party's continued weak footing in the province.
He issued fresh instructions to both central and provincial leadership aimed at rebuilding the party's strength across Punjab.
Meanwhile, PPP's Central Punjab Information Secretary Shahzad Saeed Cheema has clarified that there was no discussion regarding the PP-52 Sambrial by-election during President Asif Ali Zardari's recent meeting with party officials in Lahore.
He also dismissed reports of Zardari chastising party officials over the by-election defeat, claiming that the party secured more votes than in the previous polls.
During a meeting with the family of the late PPP Punjab president Sheikh Rafiq Ahmad, Zardari expressed regret over not appointing the late Sheikh Rafiq as president of Pakistan, saying that had the party made that choice instead of Farooq Leghari, the party might have been spared the crises it later endured, and no one would have dared to betray it from within.
Centre-Punjab cooperation
In a separate meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the two leaders discussed the growing Pakistan-India tensions and the broader political landscape of the country.
According to insiders, they reached an understanding to address the concerns of provinces and coalition partners in the upcoming 202526 federal budget.
Sources also revealed that PM Shehbaz commended Bilawal Bhutto Zardari for effectively articulating Pakistan's position on India at international forums, particularly in light of the ongoing regional strain.

Actor prefers taking breaks between projects
In a video circulating online, Sarah Khan opened up about what's next in store for her career. Sarah, who currently stars in Sher, admitted that she'd prefer taking a break for now. ""Once I have finished working on one project, I like to take a break so that I can appear on TV after a gap. So for now, I've been reading scripts and will return soon,"" she explained.
The Hum Tum actor also revealed that she has no plans of heading to the silver screen. ""As far as the big screen is concerned, I don't believe you'll see me up there anytime soon because I'm not all that interested in doing films,"" she said.
Before starring opposite Danish Taimoor in Sher, Sarah launched her clothing line Alyana, named after her daughter, in February. Her little girl has also been instrumental in spilling the beans on what lies ahead in the actor's future with her singer-husband Falak Shabir.
In a vlog uploaded by Falak in May, the father-daughter duo is seen enjoying some playful moments together when Falak casually asks Alyana, ""Where is the baby?"" Without skipping a beat, little Alyana gleefully points toward her mother, Sarah, and declares, ""In mummy's belly!"" The camera pans to Sarah, who can be seen smiling warmly throughout the exchange, adding even more weight to the speculation: baby number two is on the way!
While the couple didn't follow it up with an official statement, fans were convinced that the cat, or rather, the baby, is out of the bag, thanks to Alyana's sweet reveal. Alyana's innocent joy and excitement lit up the screen, with her repeating, ""Second baby is in mummy's belly.""
Many viewers melted at Alyana's adorableness, while others questioned whether such personal news should be shared via a child. One user wrote, ""Kids are always like this. Cute!"" while another commented, ""Privacy matters. This is not something to discuss with a toddler."" A few netizens also weighed in on boundaries and parenting, arguing that such moments should remain within the family.

Marsh returns to lead Australia against West Indies,"US
The Aussies will play five T20Is against West Indies
Cricket Australia (CA) on Wednesday announced a 16-member squad for the upcoming five-match T20I series against the West Indies, set to begin next month.
Uncapped players Mitchell Owen and Matt Kuhnemann have received their first international call-ups.
Notably, promising young batter Jake Fraser-McGurk has been left out of the squad. Despite featuring in seven of Australia's last eight T20Is, Fraser-McGurk has managed just one half-century and failed to cross 20 runs in each of his other six innings.
Xavier Bartlett and Marcus Stoinis have also been omitted.
Mitchell Owen earned his spot after a stellar Big Bash League (BBL) season, where he finished as the tournament's leading run-scorer with 452 runs in 11 matches at an average of 45.20 and a remarkable strike-rate of 203.6.
His explosive 108 off 42 balls in the final led the Hobart Hurricanes to the title and earned him the Player of the Match award.
Mitchell Marsh will captain the side following a prolific IPL season, where he amassed 627 runs in 13 innings for the Lucknow Super Giants, including his maiden century in the tournament.
Veteran all-rounder Glenn Maxwell, who recently retired from ODI cricket, retains his place in the T20 squad. Tim David also returns after missing the latter part of the IPL season with champions Royal Challengers Bangalore.
Cameron Green and Cooper Connolly make their comebacks following brief injury layoffs, while Josh Hazlewood is back after being rested for the recent T20I series against Pakistan.
Australia have opted to rest key players Pat Cummins, Travis Head, and Mitchell Starc for the T20Is, with the series beginning in Jamaica on July 19immediately after the conclusion of the three-match Test series.
Chair of Selectors George Bailey emphasised the importance of squad depth and experimentation ahead of the T20 World Cup.
""We have a busy T20 schedule coming up through this series, followed by three against South Africa and New Zealand and five matches against India at home as we continue to refine and build a squad we think will be the right fit for the World Cup on the subcontinent,"" Chair of Selectors George Bailey said.
""There are a number of players outside the squad who can still force their way into the mix for those upcoming Indian Series and through the Big Bash.
""The connection, role development and combinations we will have as options are growing nicely as we build towards the World Cup. It's an exciting time in our T20 space,"" he added.
Australia T20I squad: Mitchell Marsh (C), Sean Abbott, Cooper Connolly, Tim David, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie, Josh Hazlewood, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Matt Kuhnemann, Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Owen, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa.

He smashed a match-winning ton against Bangladesh in 3rd T20I
England and Pakistan players made gains in the latest ICC Men's Player Rankings after series whitewashes against West Indies and Bangladesh, respectively.

Fellow middle-order batter Hasan Nawaz also impressed, finishing second on the charts with 121 runs at a strike rate of 198.36. He surged 57 places to a career-best equal 45th in the batting charts.
Bangladesh's Tanzid Hasan (up 28 places to No.53) and Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha (up 42 spots to equal 75th) were the other notable movers among batters after the series.
In a high-scoring third T20I, Abbas Afridi returned with brilliant figures of 2/26, helping him jump 18 spots to a three-way-tied 19th spot in the ICC Men's T20I Bowlers Rankings with Anrich Nortje and Haris Rauf.
Meanwhile, Shadab Khan's all-round contributions – 55 runs in two innings and four wickets across the series – helped him climb 10 places to No.14 in the ICC Men's T20I All-rounder Rankings.
Pakistan teammates, ex-pros and coaches discuss the brilliance of Shadab Khan.
England shine in ODIs
Playing at home, England completed a 3-0 whitewash over West Indies to set the new Harry Brook era rolling.
In the new era, it was the seasoned Joe Root who led the charge, earning Player of the Series honours with 267 runs, including a century and a fifty, taking the former captain up 14 spots to equal 24th place in the ICC Men's ODI Batters Rankings.
The highlight was a career-best 166* off 139 balls in the second ODI, where Root rescued England from 133/5 in the 24th over while chasing 309, guiding them to a memorable win.
Ben Duckett continued his strong run in ODIs, backing up his Champions Trophy 2025 form with two more half-centuries against West Indies, as a result jumping up three spots to 17th in the latest rankings update.

Building on two centuries against Ireland earlier in the European tour, Carty struck his fourth ODI ton in the second match against England, further cementing his place in the side.
The 28-year-old Carty climbs four places to No.12 in the Batting Rankings with a rating of 659, just one behind fellow West Indian Shai Hope (660) and 17 off Afghanistan's Ibrahim Zadran (676), who sits in 10th.
In the ICC Men's ODI Bowling Rankings, Adil Rashid, the leading wicket-taker of the series with nine scalps, moves up four spots to No.19. Saqib Mahmood makes the biggest leap, surging 82 places to No.48 after finishing with eight wickets.
West Indies pace spearhead Alzarri Joseph picked up seven wickets in the series to climb nine spots to 18th in the ICC Men's ODI Bowling Rankings. His handy 41-run knock in the final ODI also lifted him six places to joint-21st in the All-rounders Rankings.

Khamenei dismisses US nuclear proposal,"US
Iran's supreme leader vows to keep enriching uranium
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning uranium enrichment was ""100 per cent"" against the country's interests, rejecting a central US demand in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman, which has mediated talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After five rounds of talks, several hard-to-bridge issues remain, including Iran's insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and Tehran's refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium — possible raw material for nuclear bombs.
Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state, said nothing about halting the talks, but said the US proposal ""contradicts our nation's belief in self-reliance and the principle of 'We Can'"".
""Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear programme and the enemies have focused on the enrichment,"" Khamenei said during a televised speech marking the anniversary of the death of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
""The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100pc against our interests —The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear programme. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?"" he added.
""Independence means not waiting for the green light from America and the likes of America.""
Khamenei said, ""If we have 100 nuclear power plants but don't have enrichment, they will be of no use to us,"" because ""nuclear power plants need fuel"" to operate. ""If we cannot produce this fuel domestically, we have to reach out to the United States, which may have dozens of conditions.""
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Pakistan organised a beach cleanup drive at Hawkesbay's Turtle Beach, where community children released newly hatched green turtle babies into the sea, marking the beginning of their life journey.
During the event, waste left by beachgoers - including plastic bags, juice boxes, thermocol plates, and discarded fishing nets buried in the sand - was collected and disposed of in shopping bags. The activity saw participation from children living in Hawksbay, Sands Pit, and nearby communities.
Dr Babar Hussain, Natural Resource Management Coordinator at IUCN Pakistan, told Express News that engaging local children was aimed at instilling awareness about marine life and environmental conservation. ""These children are the future stewards of our oceans,"" he said.
He added that marine pollution has significantly harmed aquatic life and natural habitats like mangroves. Referring to the 2003 Tasman Spirit oil spill, Dr Hussain noted that olive ridley turtles have vanished from Karachi's waters since then.

'Not entertainment but dangerous storytelling',"TR
Aymen Saleem slams over-the-top abusive plotlines
In an Instagram Story shared on Monday, actor and model Aymen Saleem questioned the excessive display of abuse in local dramas.
""Enough is enough. I'm deeply disturbed by the way a recent drama is portraying abuse — tying up a woman with ropes, showing it in a romantic or a bold light, and then normalising it as part of a love story. This isn't entertainment. It's dangerous storytelling,"" Aymen stated.
She added that such plotlines can have detrimental effects in a country that's plagued with women's issues, including patriarchy, emotional and physical abuse, and societal pressure. ""Media has the power to either reinforce or challenge these toxic norms. Dramas should offer relief, empowerment, and progress, not drag us back into justifying harm in the name of love,"" she said.
The Chupke Chupke actor believes that Pakistani television has made strides in depicting ""strong, self-aware female leads and breaking generational curses"", which is what prompted her to question, ""Why are we slipping back?""
Aymen's insights are relevant to an industry that produces stories that often stem from strong grounds of morality and depart with positive takeaways. That is why, she believes, such uncensored violence against women has a negative impact.
Adding a note to her showbiz peers, she said, ""To the writers, producers, channels, and especially the actors: you have influence. People look up to you. Please choose your scripts and stories responsibly. This is not just fiction. This shapes culture.""
When it comes to her presence on social media, Aymen isn't afraid to speak her mind, whether it is to defend herself or others. In February, she penned a long note unleashing her frustration at netizens taking offence over wedding photos shared by then-newlyweds Kubra Khan and Gohar Rasheed.
""The unnecessary moral policing that happens every time someone dares to live their life on their own terms is honestly exhausting,"" she said.
The Paristan actor became well-acquainted with judgemental comments and 'moral policing' after posting pictures of her maternity shoot last November - a decision that raised concerns amongst netizens about her desire to follow 'Western' culture. In this instance, however, Aymen's anger stemmed from a place of empathy as she segued into Kubra and Gohar's wedding celebrations.
""No one gets to question someone else's sincerity or faith based on how they choose to celebrate their joy,"" Aymen wrote. ""Faith is personal. Celebration is personal. If you can't find it in yourself to be happy for others, the least you can do is mind your own business.""

Top RDA officials summoned in massive scandal,"US
Sources suggest civic agency chief may be removed from post
The Punjab chief secretary has taken notice of the alleged major financial scandal amounting to Rs1.94 billion in the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) and summoned RDA Director General (DG) Kinza Murtaza to appear before a special inquiry committee in Lahore.
There are strong indications that she may be removed from her post and made an Officer on Special Duty (OSD).
Investigations into the scandal are already underway by both the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Anti-Corruption Establishment.
According to sources, between 2016 and 2017, payments totalling Rs1.94 billion were made to various companies and individuals from the RDA's account through Call Deposit Receipts (CDRs).
These bank transactions were never scrutinised by the then DGs or directors of admin and finance, who held signing authority during the period in question.
This complete lack of oversight paralysed the financial discipline and transparency mechanisms within the RDA, sources said.
The malpractice remained unchecked until the first week of May 2025, when newly appointed Director Admin and Finance, Qazi Sohaib, initiated a probe and uncovered the irregularities.
In a related development, former Deputy Director Finance Junaid Taj Bhattiwho was then serving as DG Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) in Sialkotdied under mysterious circumstances on May 13 in his Sialkot office.
Following the discovery, the RDA DG first wrote to the Punjab secretary for housing seeking permission to formally begin an internal inquiry. However, before receiving a response, she proceeded to send letters to the DG of Punjab Anti-Corruption Department and NAB chairman, and DG FIA, requesting their involvement in the investigation.
This move reportedly angered the relevant provincial secretary, who expressed strong displeasure in a video link meeting over the matter being forwarded to external agencies prematurely, sources said.
Meanwhile, NAB has acquired the relevant records and launched a formal investigation. On June 3, the Anti-Corruption Establishment's regional director in Rawalpindi summoned and recorded statements from 13 current and retired RDA officers and employees.
Sources indicate that the DG may be removed from her position and reassigned as OSD after her appearance before the committee.

Fishermen oppose 'national fisheries policy',"US
Say fisheries is provincial subject, only provinces can formulate policy
The fishermen community has strongly criticised and opposed the formation of fisheries policy at national level, stating that fisheries is clearly a provincial subject, therefore, only provinces can formulate any policy about fishing sector.
Talking to The Express Tribune, Chairperson of Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, Mustafa Mirani said that they have learnt through media that the authorities in the federal government are engaged in formulating a national level fisheries policy. He said that the fishermen community is main stakeholder of fisheries sector but they are not consulted before drafting this policy. ""We will not accept any policy that is made against our interests,"" he warned.
It is pertinent to mention that the federal government has circulated a draft of the 'National Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy 2025-35' with provincial governments including Sindh and Balochistan. Provincial Secretary for Fisheries and Livestock, Sindh, Kazim Hussain Jatoi confirmed this and informed The Express Tribune that the Sindh government was still preparing its feedback to the proposed policy.
According to the proposed policy the federal government shall establish an apex council namely 'Pakistan Fisheries and Aquaculture Council (PFAC)' comprising relevant stakeholders from the centre and the provinces. It will propose amendments to the fisheries policy and legislation to resolve issues in federal-provincial context of fisheries and aquaculture governance.
In this draft the Sindh and Balochistan governments are advised to register and regularise all the existing informal unauthorised private jetties and landing sites through specific law, rules and guidelines. ""Annual tax, rent and fee will be levied on all such jetties and landing sites for the structure erected inside sea (starting from high water mark),"" it stated.
According to the draft the Mercantile Marine Department shall register every vessel, except merchant and cargo ships, which intends to operate in country's waters. ""The governments of the coastal provinces of Sindh and Balochistan are advised to complement their efforts in establishing a country-level integrated and coherent 'Central Digital Register' for sea-going fishing vessels and harbour crafts by the MMD of the federal government which shall have devolved system arrangements for registration processing at provincial level,"" it stated.
According to the draft, the federal government, in consultation with provincial governments of Sindh and Balochistan, shall rationalise 'One-Licence System' along with 'Benefit Sharing Mechanism' for co-management of capture fisheries in all fishing zones in marine waters of Pakistan including certification for nakhuda and crew.
It has also been proposed in the draft that there will be three months ban on fishing, from June to August, instead of existing two months, at sea and in freshwater resources. According to the proposed policy, the federal and provincial governments shall develop and implement dedicated rules to reform or describe the role and governance mechanism regarding social organisational setups like fisheries cooperative societies.

US lawmakers urge deportation relief for Afghans,"DE
.
A group of 100 Democratic lawmakers is urging top Trump administration officials to restore deportation protections for thousands of Afghans in the US, warning they would be sent back to ""devastating humanitarian and economic conditions"" in Afghanistan.
In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the lawmakers called on the administration to restore access to the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme for Afghans.
They warned that women and children could face particular harm under the Taliban-led government in place since 2021. ""The grave conditions that forced Afghan nationals to flee and seek refuge in the US following the return of the Taliban to power remain,"" the lawmakers said.
""Because of this harsh reality, forcing Afghan nationals in the US to return to Afghanistan would be reckless and inhumane, and would threaten the safety and well-being of thousands of individuals and families, especially women and girls.""
The effort is being led by US Senator Chris Van Hollen, Representative Glenn Ivey and Senator Amy Klobuchar. TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the US if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event.
The Homeland Security Department announced to terminate TPS for Afghans in a May. It said that Noem had determined conditions in Afghanistan had improved enough to allow Afghans to return and that letting them stay in the US would be contrary to national interests.
The decision to end TPS — set to take effect July 14 – has sparked concern among Afghans depending on the status. DHS said in its termination notice that 11,700 Afghans were currently enrolled in TPS but that 3,600 had been approved for green cards as of April.

Storms expose rural homes' vulnerability,"US
At least 10 injured in roof, wall collapse incidents
At least 10 people were injured as severe thunderstorms caused structural collapses across Punjab on Tuesday.
According to Rescue 1122 officials, the provincial emergency service reported widespread damage to homes and boundary walls as high winds and heavy rains battered several areas.
In Chichawatni, two women were injured when the roof of their home in Gulstan Colony collapsed during the storm. The victims, identified as 70-year-old Kulsoom Bibi and 35-year-old Shakeela, were rushed to a nearby hospital. Nearby, two boys playing outside their home, 10-year-old Umar Farooq and 12-year-old Abu Sufyan, were injured when a mud wall gave way under the force of the wind.
The situation proved equally dangerous in Pakpattan district, where five members of a family were injured when their home's roof collapsed near Lakhnawali Bahmani Bridge. The victims included three children – Zain, aged three, Rehan, five, and Rizwan, seven -- along with 20-year-old Sadia and 70-year-old Sharifan. In a separate incident along the Nanakpur-Dipalpur road, 13-year-old Areeba was struck by debris from a neighbour's collapsing boundary wall.
Rescue 1122 teams transported the injured to medical facilities. ""Our emergency teams were deployed within minutes of receiving distress calls,"" said a spokesperson, Farooq Ahmed. ""All victims received immediate medical attention.""
The incidents sparked renewed concerns about housing safety standards in rural areas, particularly regarding old mud-brick structures vulnerable to extreme weather.
With more storms forecast for the coming days, the authorities urged residents to exercise caution around potentially unstable buildings and to report any emergency situation immediately through the Rescue 1122 helpline.
Meanwhile, Punjab Emergency Services Secretary Dr Rizwan Naseer directed all district emergency officers to ensure timely emergency ambulance, rescue and fire services to citizens across the province during the Eid holidays.

Climate change
Addressing a seminar organised at Punjab University of mark the World Environment Day, Punjab Parliamentary Secretary for Environmental Protection Kanwal Pervaiz said climate change had emerged as the greatest challenge of the 21st century, with Pakistan among the most severely affected countries.
She said human activity had been the primary driver of environmental degradation, noting that emissions from nearly 80 of vehicles are a major contributor to urban pollution. ""Lahore was once known as the city of gardens; sadly, it is now referred to as the city of pollution,"" she lamented.

PTC urges tax on cigarette paper,"RO
Company calls for stricter enforcement, tax adjustments to plug revenue losses as illicit market share hits 58%
The Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) has urged the government to impose an adjustable tax on cigarette paper in a bid to ensure full documentation of the cigarette industry and combat the rapidly growing illicit trade, which it says has now become the market leader.
At a pre-budget media briefing, PTC Director Asad Shah expressed serious concern over the rise in untaxed cigarettes, calling for uniform implementation of the track-and-trace tax stamp policy. Without uniform enforcement, he argued, the policy is ineffective.
Shah also proposed reducing the adjustable tax on cigarette filter material acetate tow from Rs44,000 per kilogram to Rs4,000 per kilogram to discourage smuggling. Authorities seized 450 metric tonnes of smuggled acetate tow this year alone, he added.
Shah also proposed that adjustable tax should be imposed on cigarette paper to ensure complete documentation.
He noted that illicit cigarettes now account for 58% of the total market, with Pakistan's annual cigare tte consumption estimated at 82 billion sticks. Shah claimed that the sector has the potential to generate Rs570 billion in tax revenue annually, but only Rs292 billion was collected in FY2023-24 and Rs223 billion so far in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.
""It is impossible to collect the remaining Rs50 billion in a single month,"" he said, pointing to widespread tax evasion and the alleged involvement of some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) pursuing specific agendas.
Shah recalled that 12 years ago, the government taxed 67 billion sticks annually. That number has now dropped to just 34 billion, despite consistent or growing demand. He criticised the 2023 tax policy, saying it led to the second decline in government revenue from the sector in a decade.
Despite holding only a 42% market share, the legal tobacco sector still contributes 98% of the revenue, Shah said. He urged authorities to enforce documentation requirements across the board, stressing that 18 billion sticks are being sold at or below Rs150 per packbelow the official minimum price of Rs162.25 — without any penalties for violators.
He pointed out that no one has ever been penalised for violating the minimum price law and instead recommended raising the minimum price per pack to counter the perception of cigarettes being cheap in Pakistan.
""No policy can succeed without non-discriminatory implementation,"" he said, adding that untaxed, locally manufactured cigarettes are still openly sold.

America protects Israel by killing democracy,"PL
Today Palestine could have been what Nike is; supported and adored by millions of Americans
I was once talking to an old Pakistani man who had been living in America since the 60s. We tend to believe that somehow we have more authentic knowledge of things than the older folks just because we have better sources of information at our disposal. However, I believe the opposite is true.
The people before us may not have been getting their information as quickly as we do, but they sure had a better understanding of things, especially politics. This old man was telling me about George Bush, the senior one.
He was saying that the main reason Bush had lost was because he got tough with Israel by trying to prevent it from building settlements inside the occupied territories.
The Israeli lobbies inside the United States got into action and punished him. I laughed off the old man's argument by saying that a foreign country and a mere lobby cannot be so powerful that they'd influence an American presidential election. Boy, was I naive?
I spent years after that watching every single American politician, not just the presidential candidates, never forgetting to express their support and love for the state of Israel. It is as if they are required to sing this anthem or else they'd be deemed traitors and be disqualified either from the office they are holding or from the race to win that office. Sure enough, the last sentence is not really untrue.
What startled me recently have been two facts about the power of Israeli lobbies inside America: the pressure on TikTok and a song Michael Jackson once wrote but never became public. TikTok is perhaps the only mainstream platform that allows for the broadcast of videos that clearly show the brutality that Israel unleashes against innocent Palestinian children.
Every other platform you have ever known suppresses any content that is even remotely critical of Israel or sympathetic toward Palestine. That's why it had to be pushed around.
Michael Jackson wrote a song in 1993 called 'Palestine, Don't Cry' in which he expressed support for the cause of Palestine, showed solidarity with the Palestinian people, and highlighted the miseries of the Palestinians at the hands of Israeli society.
From what I understand, Sony refused to publish the song, which was heavily pressured by the United States, which was heavily pressured by the Israel lobbies. Even George Bush had expressed his helplessness and sorrow at the extreme power AIPAC had inside America when he visited the presidential library at Texas A&M in 2005.
That song by the mega superstar of the day would have created a tremendous impact in support of Palestine because Jackson was loved and almost worshipped by many Americans at the time. A superstar of his height would have done the same for Palestine, which the other MJ (Michael Jordan) did for the shoe brand Nike, which was a small and about-to-die brand.
Today Palestine could have been what Nike is; supported and adored by millions of Americans. But the cunning Jewish society of Israel knew this and their even more cunning supporters in the form of lobbies in America understood the potential devastation in the form of blowing Israel's fake victimhood cover.
America was allowed to use rockstars and pop stars in politics such as having them endorse candidates and hold concerts to motivate people to come out to vote during elections. However, the same could not be allowed in support of Palestine because that would create an American citizenry, which would become informed about the truth that Israel was an illegal state established over the land of Palestine and that it kills its way through expanding and grabbing more and more land every single day.
A genuine democracy made up of informed citizenry would result in the death of Israel because Israel would no longer enjoy the unconditional support of the American might.
Things that could have happened. History that could have been redirected. And the present that could have been beautiful.

Govt moves to revive sick industries,"US
.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan on Wednesday chaired a meeting to review and discuss proposals for the rehabilitation of sick and struggling industrial units across the country.
During the meeting, the SAPM stressed that the revival of sick industrial units is a key component of the prime minister's economic vision. He identified high utility costs, elevated interest rates, and limited access to financing for small industrialists as the primary challenges hindering industrial recovery. The meeting was convened on the direction of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The committee recommended that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) issue new guidelines to commercial banks to extend financial assistance and support to these struggling units.
Additionally, the committee proposed tax incentives, comprehensive business revival strategies, and a borrower categorisation system to ensure targeted and effective support.
