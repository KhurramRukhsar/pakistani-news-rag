"Many ME flights remain suspended, PIA cancels flights",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324336-many-me-flights-remain-suspended-pia-cancels-flights,"DUBAI/LAHORE: Airlines on Monday were weighing how long to suspend Middle East flights as a conflict, which has already cut off major flight routes, entered a new phase, foreign media reported.
Cancellations in recent days to typically resilient aviation hubs such as Dubai, the world’s busiest international airport, and Qatar’s Doha by international carriers show how aviation industry concerns about the region have escalated. The usually busy airspace stretching from Iran and Iraq to the Mediterranean has been largely empty of commercial air traffic for 10 days since Israel began strikes on Iran on June 13, as airlines divert, cancel and delay flights through the region due to airspace closures and safety concerns.
Finnair and Singapore Airlines (SIAL.SI) moved to cancel flights to Dubai through to Tuesday.  Air France KLM (AIRF.PA), IAG-owned Iberia and British Airways (ICAG.L), and Kazakhstan’s Air Astana (AIRA.KZ), all cancelled flights to either Doha or Dubai both on Sunday and Monday. Air France also cancelled flights to Riyadh and said it would suspend flights to and from Beirut, Lebanon until Wednesday included.
Carriers are likely avoiding airports in UAE and Qatar and, to a lesser extent, Kuwait, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, due to concerns that Iran or its proxies will target drone or missile attacks on US military bases in these countries, aviation risk consultancy Osprey Flight Solutions
said.
With Russian and Ukrainian airspace also closed to most airlines due to years of war, the Middle East had become a more important route for flights between Europe and Asia. Australia-based Flight Centre Travel Group said it is getting a small number of customer requests to route journeys to Europe away from Middle Eastern hubs.
Israel is ramping up flights to help people return home as well as leave. A handful of so-called rescue flights landed in the country on Monday morning, with 24 in total scheduled for the day. Israeli airline El Al on Sunday said it had received applications to leave the country from about 25,000 people in about a day. Meanwhile, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has announced the suspension of its flight operations to several Gulf countries as a precautionary measure.
According to a PIA spokesperson, all flights from Pakistan to Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Dubai have been temporarily cancelled due to the emerging war-like situation in parts of the Gulf.

Govt okays import of 0.5m tonnes of sugar months after allowing exports,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324337-govt-okays-importof-0-5m-tonnes-of-sugar-months-after-allowing-exports,"ISLAMABAD: In a stunning reversal that has sparked fresh criticism of the government’s sugar policy, the Sugar Advisory Board — headed by Federal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain — on Monday approved the import of 500,000 tonnes of sugar, just months after allowing 750,000 tonnes in exports from June 2024 to January 2025.
The move comes amid soaring domestic prices and market instability — ironically fueled, in part, by the very export approvals granted earlier. Now, with sugar prices pinching consumers and triggering inflation across food products, the government is scrambling to stabilize the market with imports that critics say could have been avoided.
Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain said, “disruption in the supply chain and non-compliance by mill owners have created volatility and contributed to price hikes. The increased price of sugar is not only affecting households directly but is also impacting the cost of a wide range of food items across the board, placing an additional burden on ordinary citizens.”
However, the timing of the import approval has raised questions. Analysts and consumer advocates argue that the government’s short-sighted policy — first allowing exports despite looming supply constraints — has now forced it to reverse course at the cost of public funds and consumer trust.
The minister, however, said that to address the situation, the ministry has decided to implement strict
monitoring and enforcement mechanisms in coordination with provincial governments. “These efforts are aimed at ensuring transparency in sugar distribution, preventing hoarding, and curbing profiteering practices that harm consumer interests,” he maintained.
The minister announced that all formalities regarding the import would be completed within the next few days, after which the imported sugar would be available in the domestic market. But critics warn that repeated policy flip-flops have only encouraged speculative behavior in the sugar market. “This isn’t market management — it’s mismanagement,” they say.
When contacted, the spokesman for the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association said. “Ample stocks of sugar are available to meet the country’s demand till November 21, 2025, and there is no need to import sugar.” He added that if the government wanted, then the sugar industry would start the next crushing season 2025-26 from November 1, 2025.
As per the latest official data, the sugar average price was Rs180.9/kg at the week ending June 19, increasing by near Rs4 in a week. Last year in the same week, its price was Rs143/kg. In the open retail market, in some areas it is nearing Rs200/kg.

"Budget public-, industry-friendly: Aurangzeb",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324338-budget-public-industry-friendly-aurangzeb,"ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb Monday said the powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to arrest individuals had been strictly regulated under the prime minister’s special directives.
Winding up the budget debate in the National Assembly, Aurangzeb said in cases involving Rs50 million or more, the FBR will not arrest anyone without a court warrant, and only under specific conditions, including deliberate evasion after three notices, an attempt to abscond, or formal referral for prosecution.
Arrests must also be approved by a three-member FBR committee, and the accused must be presented before a special judge within 24 hours, ensuring protection against arbitrary detention and abuse of authority.
The minister said the Finance Bill had proposed restrictions on large asset purchases by undocumented individuals. However, following the PM’s direction, these restrictions would not apply to the residential houses up to Rs50 million, commercial plots or properties up to Rs100 million, and purchase of vehicles worth up to Rs7 million.
Moreover under the existing law, the capital gains tax will not apply to the property sold after six years of purchase, provided it had been acquired before July 1, 2024.
However, it would be subject to 4.5 to 6 percent withholding tax on purchase, which was generally returned on
filing returns. The property in personal use for 15 or more years would be exempt from the withholding tax, he said.
The finance minister said in view of the positive contribution of e-commerce to the economy, the government had rationalized the tax in order to help it flourish.
The minister said the Budget 2025–26 was a balanced plan focused on providing public relief, promoting industry, curbing government expenditures, enhancing revenues, and ensuring fair tax-enforcement.
“All these measures are aimed at fostering sustainable growth and driving an export-led economy,” he said. He pointed out the major relief announced for the salaried class.
The income tax rate for those earning up to Rs3.2 million was reduced, while the tax was cut from proposed 2.5 percent to 1 percent for those earning between Rs0.6 million and Rs1.2 million annually.
He clarified that no tax would be imposed on pension commutation or gratuity, adding that only individuals receiving pensions above Rs10 million will be taxed, while those over 75 years of age were fully exempt.
He also mentioned that the proposed 18 percent sales tax on imported solar panel components had been reduced to 10 percent and will apply only to 46 percent of imported items, hence there would only be a 4.6 percent increase in the price of imported solar panels.
He also condemned opportunistic hoarding and artificial price hikes by some market players ahead of the new tax’s enforcement, warning that a strict legal action will be taken in coordination with the provincial governments.
He said while export facilitation schemes in recent years allowed exporters to import raw materials without paying taxes and duties, the policy unintentionally distorted market prices of domestically produced cotton and yarn, adversely affecting the local farmers.
The government has proposed sales tax on the import of raw cotton and yarn, reduction in the price gap between imported and local products and support for the domestic agriculture sector.
The finance minister informed the House that the new tax measures had been carefully designed to avoid burdening the common man and the focus was on high-income segments and wealthier businesses.
He said under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s special directive, export-oriented industries had been largely exempted from new taxes to preserve their global competitiveness.
Regarding the income tax reforms, he proposed raising the tax rate on inter-corporate dividends derived from mutual funds and similar instruments from 25% to 29%, bringing it in line with other sources of income.
Meanwhile, returns on investment in government securities by the companies will now be taxed at 20%, up from the existing rates.
He said the government had proposed a tax of Rs10 per broiler chick, citing the poultry industry’s minimal tax contribution.
The minister warned that the ongoing Iran-Israel tensions might affect regional economic stability; however, he assured the House that the government was closely monitoring the developments.
“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had constituted a high-level committee on June 14 to assess the impact of this conflict on Pakistan’s economy,” Aurangzeb said.
He said the government was committed to steering the economy toward sustainable growth while protecting the vulnerable and documenting the untapped domestic market potential.
He termed documentation of economy the most important initiative of the budget, which would help reduce informality, enhance exports, and improve revenue streams.
The minister announced an initiative in collaboration with the British Asian Trust to help equip the youth with market-aligned skills for long-term employment.
On the agriculture sector, he said the government was launching a collateral-free loan programme, offering loans up to Rs1 million to the farmers owning up to 12.5 acre land to cover seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, and other essential inputs. Health and crop insurance facilities will also be provided under the scheme.
The government will also introduce an electronic warehouse receipt system, allowing the farmers to store crops securely and obtain better market prices, thereby contributing to the national food security.
He further highlighted the upcoming policy measures, including a new Industrial Policy, progress on the Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy, and comprehensive energy sector reforms aimed at achieving sustainable growth.
He also announced a 20-year loan scheme for low-income individuals to help them build or purchase houses. Under the Women Inclusive Finance Program, he said, loans worth approximately Rs14 billion had been provided to over 193,000 women. In the coming year, another Rs14 billion will be extended to women with support from the Asian Development Bank.

"NA witnesses physical showdown, exchange of harsh words",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324339-na-witnesses-physical-showdown-exchange-of-harsh-words,"ISLAMABAD: Tension ran high during proceedings of the National Assembly which witnessed physical showdown, exchange of harsh words between members from sides of benches, while the opposition members also scuffled with the security staff, who were ordered by the Chair to intervene.
All that happened during speech of the finance minister and the sergeant-at-arms had to be called, but that too did not work as the angary opposition members also shouted at the security staff as well.
Amid sloganeering from both sides, PTI MNA Iqbal Afridi and Federal Minister Hanif Abbasi were also briefly involved in physical brawl.  Nisar Jatt of the PTI and Agha Rafiullah of the PPP also scuffled with each other.
The sergeant-at-arms and deputy sergeant-at-arms attempted to separate the two members. But allegedly they were abused and pushed by some opposition members.
The members from both sides also started pushing each other in front of the speaker’s dias as Ayaz Sadiq called for peace in the House.
The ugly situation forced the NA speaker to suspend the proceedings for 15 minutes. Tension in the House started when opposition members continued to interrupt speech of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto over his remarks against jailed PTI founder Imran Khan.
Later, the PPP lawmakers also opposed speaker’s decision to give floor to leader of the opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub. Syed Rafiullah stood in front of speaker’s dias saying that he would not allow him to
speak.
Initially, the sources said the speaker, who later mediated between two sides, decided to act against four opposition lawmakers, but later the government and opposition members reached reconciliation in a two-hour-long meeting at the speaker’s chamber.
On returning to the House, Nisar Jatt of the PTI, while taking the floor, said he apologised for harsh remarks and any attitude on his behalf and from any member of his party. “I feel sanctity of the House was violated and what was witnessed should not have happened,” he said.
Syed Rafiullah of PPP thanked the PTI members for their remarks, saying that his party leadership had rendered sacrifices for the country and democracy. Iqbal Khan Afridi of the PTI also regretted his remarks and action saying that what happened in the House should have been avoided.
The NA speaker termed the government and opposition benches as two wheels of the parliament’s cart. He said that the security staff of the National Assembly and other officers of Assembly sitting in front of him were not staff of the speaker or the government. “They are staff of all the members whether they belong to the government or the opposition; therefore, it is your responsibility to protect them,” he said.
Ayaz Sadiq pointed out that he always instructed the security staff to intervene whenever there was chance of any physical brawl. “They cannot speak before any member and they are accountable to all. This is responsibility of all of you to protect them,” he added.
He said “the government and the opposition are two wheels of the National Assembly which is answerable to people of the country. It is right of everyone to protest but there should be respect for each other,” he added.
He thanked both sides for feeling sanctity of the House and reaching a reconciliation. “I hope that what happened today in the House will not be repeated again and all members will work for betterment of the Parliament,” he said.

"Iranian strikes Shehbaz calls Qatari, Saudi envoys, urges de-escalation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324340-iranian-strikes-shehbaz-calls-qatari-saudi-envoys-urges-de-escalation,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held late-night telephone conversations on Monday with the ambassadors of Qatar and Saudi Arabia to express Pakistan’s deep concern over reports of missile attacks on a US military base in Qatar, reportedly carried out by Iran.
In separate calls with Ali Mubarak Ali Essa Al-Khater, ambassador of the State of Qatar, and Nawaf bin Saeed Al Malkiy, ambassador of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the prime minister conveyed Pakistan’s solidarity with the governments and people of both nations amid rising regional tensions.
Speaking with the Qatari ambassador, Prime Minister Shehbaz expressed his deep concerns over the reported attack and expressed full support for Qatar in this challenging time. He emphasised the urgent need for de-escalation and stressed that all regional actors must work to restore peace and stability.
Ambassador Al-Khater thanked the prime minister for his swift outreach and expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s solidarity at this critical juncture.
In his call with the Saudi ambassador, Prime Minister Shehbaz again voiced grave concern over the reported missile strike and added that such developments
pose a serious threat to regional peace. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with Saudi Arabia to help defuse tensions and support diplomatic solutions.
Ambassador Al Malkiy welcomed the prime minister’s timely initiative and emphasised the importance of coordinated efforts between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to prevent further escalation in the Middle East. Both agreed on the need for close collaboration to promote peace in the region.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif ordered for transitioning all transactions between the public and private sectors to a cashless model, and formation of three specialised committees -- the Digital Payments Innovation and Adoption Committee, the Digital Public Infrastructure Committee and the Government Payments Committee -- to promote cashless economy across the country.
These special sub-committees will present recommendations to facilitate payments between citizens and businesses, raise awareness about digital systems, activate the Pakistan Digital Authority, formulate a national digital master plan, and streamline transactions between the government and the private sector.
The prime minister was chairing a high-level meeting focused on promoting a cashless economy in Pakistan. He emphasised the importance of making digital transactions more affordable and accessible for the public compared to cash, as a means to promote a cashless system.
He also instructed that the RAAST digital payment system be established at the federal as well as across all provinces levels. “Establishing a digital transaction system is crucial for bringing transparency to the economy,” he said, adding that cashless systems are being prioritised in developed and successful economies around the world, and modern technology must be used to implement a robust digital payments infrastructure.
The prime minister noted that funds circulating through the banking system can be used for investment in government development projects.
During the briefing, the prime minister was updated on progress made toward implementing a nationwide cashless system. It was shared that currently, over 40 million users are benefiting from the RAAST system, and various initiatives are underway to increase this number.
All financial transactions of the federal government are now conducted through the RAAST system, and steps are being taken to expand it to the provincial level. The briefing also highlighted that Fintech is a key component of this ecosystem.
The Pakistan Digital Authority has been established and is actively working to transition the national economy toward a cashless model. It was also informed in the meeting that the Digital Public Infrastructure Committee will function under the leadership of the IT Ministry, while the Cashless Pakistan Steering Committee has been established within the PM Secretariat.
As part of the Smart Islamabad Pilot Project, the IT Ministry is taking steps to make Islamabad Pakistan’s first cashless city. The meeting was attended by Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, Minister for IT Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Minister for Climate Change Musadik Malik, the State Bank of Pakistan governor, FBR chairman and senior officials from relevant institutions.
Meanwhile, the prime minister met with Minister for Climate Change Dr Musadik Malik at the PM House, where matters related to the government climate policies and recent diplomatic efforts were discussed.
In the meeting, Dr Musadik Malik briefed the prime minister about the engagements of the diplomatic delegation.
Shehbaz paid tribute to Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and other members of the delegation for successfully exposing India’s recent unprovoked military and water aggression before the world, and for their successful diplomatic tour of the United States and Europe.
During the meeting, the measures taken by the Ministry of Climate Change under the government’s initiatives to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change also came under discussion.

Pakistan extends airspace closure for all Indian aircraft to July 24,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324341-pakistan-extends-airspace-closure-for-all-indian-aircraft-to-july-24,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has extended its airspace ban for all Indian-registered and Indian-operated aircraft, including military planes, for another month, until 5:00am local time on July 24, the Pakistan Airports Authority said in a statement on Monday.
According to a new NOTAM (Notice to Airmen), the restriction bars Indian commercial airlines, India-registered aircraft, and  military flights from entering Pakistani airspace. Pakistan had first imposed the airspace ban on April 24 in response to India’s unilateral move a day earlier to close its airspace to Pakistani aircraft amid heightened bilateral tensions following the deadly Pahalgam attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).
The initial restriction was extended on May 23 for another month. The latest extension to bring the total duration of Pakistan’s airspace closure for Indian aircraft to 90 days. India closed its airspace to Pakistani flights on April 23, prompting a reciprocal ban from Islamabad the next day. India then took several other measures against Pakistan.
This is not the first time Pakistan has imposed such restrictions. Airspace closures were previously enacted during the 1999 Kargil conflict and the 2019 Pulwama crisis, both instances in which India faced greater aviation disruptions than Pakistan.
According to sources, Indian airlines have suffered losses exceeding Rs8 billion in April alone. These include Rs5 billion in additional fuel costs and Rs3 billion in expenses incurred
due to forced stopovers by long-haul flights, according to Reuters.
Sources note that Indian carriers operating Boeing 777 and Airbus A320 family aircraft have had to endure 2 to 4 hours of extra flying time per journey. With approximately 150 flights rerouted daily, fuel consumption has surged dramatically.
Experts estimate that a Boeing 777 consumes about 6,668 kilograms of fuel per hour, while an Airbus A319, A320, or A321 uses around 2,400 kilograms per hour. At the current average jet fuel price of $0.82 per kilogram, Indian airlines are spending nearly $557,625 daily on additional fuel alone. That amounts to over Rs5 billion in fuel-related losses in one month.
In addition, the extended travel times have triggered crew duty hour limitations, necessitating crew changes at transit airports. These stopovers also involve added costs for landing fees, refuelling, and airport services. Over the past 30 days, such stopover-related expenses have totalled between Rs2.5 and Rs3 billion. Air India is reportedly the worst-hit carrier and has requested financial support from the Indian government. Other airlines, including Akasa Air, SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Air India Express, have also faced operational disruptions.
Flights originating from Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, and Jaipur are now forced to traverse longer western routes over the Arabian Sea. These detours affect flights to destinations in North America, Europe, and the Middle East.
Sources have indicated that if the ban continues and the Indian government does not provide special assistance, Indian airlines may be forced to take extraordinary steps to sustain operations.

"Power purchase price set at Rs25.98 per unit for next fiscal, down 3.77%",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324342-power-purchase-price-set-at-rs25-98-unit-for-next-fiscal-down-3-77pc,"ISLAMABAD: In a significant move that could ease electricity pricing pressure, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has slashed the national average Power Purchase Price (PPP) to Rs25.98 per unit for the fiscal year 2025-26 — down 3.77 percent (or Rs1.02/unit) from the current Rs27/unit.
According to Nepra’s latest determination, the total national Power Purchase Price has been set at Rs3.342 trillion for FY26. For the ex-Wapda Distribution Companies (XWDiscos), the PPP stands at Rs3.066 trillion or Rs26.34 per unit. The calculation excludes K-Electric’s share. Nepra’s decision sets the stage for downstream tariff decisions at the consumer end in the coming months.
Of the total projected PPP for XWdiscos, Rs1.125 trillion is allocated to fuel and variable operation and management (O&M) costs, while a hefty Rs1.941 trillion — or 63 percent — is earmarked for capacity charges, including NTDC, Pak Matiari-Lahore Transmission Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (PMLTC) wheeling costs, and CPPA-G’s MoF. Capacity charges alone are estimated at Rs6.484/unit/month, based on an average monthly Maximum Demand Indicator (MDI) of 24,943 MW.
On a per unit basis, energy charges for XWdiscos are calculated at Rs9.67/unit, while capacity charges make up Rs16.67/unit, resulting in a total of Rs26.34/unit before transmission and distribution (T&D) losses.
The new PPP is
Rs1.02/unit less than the ongoing fiscal’s Rs27/unit average, when the total power purchase cost stood at Rs3.534 trillion.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G), in its petition to NEPRA, outlined seven PPP scenarios for FY26 based on varying assumptions of demand growth (3–5%), exchange rates (Rs280–300/USD), and hydrological flows. Proposed fuel charges range from Rs8.16/unit to Rs9.19/unit, while capacity payments under different scenarios are projected between Rs16.04/unit and Rs16.45/unit — continuing the trend where capacity charges dominate the power purchase cost.
By comparison, for FY24, capacity charges stood at Rs16.22/unit while energy charges were just Rs6.73/unit. The total PPP for 2023-24 was Rs22.95/unit, highlighting a continued upward trend in fixed power costs.

Pakistan seeking to get two loans of $3.3bn from Chinese banks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324343-pakistan-seeking-to-get-two-loans-of-3-3bn-from-chinese-banks,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is aiming to secure $3.3 billion in the form of two foreign loans — one a syndicated loan and the other a refinancing of commercial loans — from Chinese banks within the next few days.
It is expected that the foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will surpass the $14 billion mark if this deal materialises within the outgoing financial year, which ends on June 30.
“Yes, we are still working closely with the Chinese high-ups to finalize modalities of this expected deal. We are expecting the striking of two different foreign loans from Chinese banks till the end of June 2025. A syndicated financing of $2 billion will be made available to Pakistan by a consortium of Chinese banks for three years,” top officials of the government confirmed while talking to The News here on Monday.
The second loan of $1.3 billion will be a refinancing of a commercial loan from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), which was paid back by Islamabad a few months ago.
In rupee terms, the government will be able to generate approximately Rs 924 billion ($3.3 billion), so the maturity of the short-term domestic debt would be cleared till the deadline of the first ten days of July 2025.
Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) stood at $11.7 billion by June 13, 2025, and the expected injection of $3.3 billion would help the SBP to jack up the foreign reserves to touch $15 billion, mark. However, keeping in view outflow requirements, there are strong expectations that
the foreign reserves held by the SBP might be standing at over $14.5 billion by the end of June 2025.
This scribe contacted to Ministry of Finance Spokesman Qamar Abbasi, and inquired about the possibility of two commercial loans and whether it would be provided in Chinese currency RMB instead of US dollars. The official spokesman did not share any response till the filing of this story.
In another important but relevant development, when the Strait of Hormuz might witness a blockade owing to intensified war between Iran and Israel, the oil prices have started witnessing a surge in the international market, mainly because of the possible disruption in the route of 20 percent supply of oil through this sea route. The oil prices have already gone up to $75-76 per barrel, although they fell slightly on Monday. There is strong apprehension that if war persists and Iran manages to block the route, then the prices might further escalate in the days to come. If the oil prices crossed $85 to $90 per barrel, it will result in surfacing the current account into deficit after remaining surplus in the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25 ending on June 30, 2025.
“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has provided $100 million in May 2025 for the provision of oil facility,” the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) data shows, but it did not mention clearly whether this amount was used for oil or any other purpose.

Analysis: White House faces risk of economic fallout from Iran strike,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324344-white-house-faces-risk-of-economic-fallout-from-iran-strike,"President Trump on Monday began to confront the potential economic blowback from his military strikes on Iran, which threatened to send oil and gas prices soaring at a moment when U.S. consumers are already facing significant financial strains, according to The New York Times
The mere prospect of rising energy costs appeared to spook even Mr. Trump, who took to social media to push for more domestic drilling while demanding that companies “KEEP OIL PRICES DOWN.” Otherwise, the president said, they would be “PLAYING RIGHT INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.”
“I’M WATCHING!” he added.
By Monday afternoon, global oil markets appeared relatively unfazed by the rising tensions between the two nations, just days after Mr. Trump dispatched U.S. bombers on a mission to disable three Iranian nuclear sites. Prices rose over the weekend but fell on Monday after Tehran launched retaliatory missile strikes against American bases abroad.
But it remained unclear if Iran would continue to respond, or if its leaders might escalate the conflict, particularly by trying to block access to the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway that serves as the critical entrance point to the Persian Gulf. The world ships substantial amounts of oil and liquefied natural gas through the passage, so any interruption to commerce could cause energy prices to surge globally.
A spike in energy costs could prove especially difficult for American consumers and businesses
this summer, given that it could arrive at about the same time that Mr. Trump plans to revive his expansive, steep tariffs on nearly every U.S. trading partner. Many economists expect those levies to push up prices after years of high inflation.
In April, the president announced, then suspended, the sky-high duties, seeking to quell a global market meltdown over his disruptive and legally contested campaign to remake global trade. But Mr. Trump has not wavered in his plan to implement the tariffs again on July 9, and many economists expect companies — which pay the duties when they source foreign products — to pass the added costs down to their customers.
Taken together, said James Knightley, the chief international economist at ING, the uncertainties around geopolitics and trade threaten to “squeeze households’ spending power” in the coming months.
He said that there was already “quite a lot of anxiety” about tariffs, and that the concern now was that there “could be another wave of pain for the consumer in the form of higher energy prices.”
“That would be a big negative,” Mr. Knightley said.The White House did not respond to a request for comment.A spike in oil prices would only add to the mounting political headaches facing Mr. Trump, who has promised to salve stubbornly high inflation dating back to the coronavirus pandemic. The president has long viewed energy costs as a barometer for the effectiveness of his economic agenda, and he has crowed repeatedly about declining gas prices in recent weeks as a sign that his policies are working.
For the moment, prices across the economy have remained relatively stable, according to the latest reading from the Consumer Price Index. But economists widely believe that inflation could pick up as soon as this summer, particularly once the president’s tariffs take full effect.
The uncertainty prompted the Federal Reserve last week to leave interest rates unchanged for June, in a move that angered Mr. Trump, who lashed out at the central bank as he argued that inflation has eased and high borrowing costs are no longer necessary.
Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman, told reporters on Wednesday that the central bank was “watching like everybody else is” to see how the conflict with Iran might affect prices. But he also acknowledged that the U.S. government was less dependent on foreign oil than it was in past Middle East conflicts that had roiled global energy markets.
“What’s tended to happen is, when there’s turmoil in the Middle East, you may see a spike in energy prices, but tends to come down,” Mr. Powell said.
On Monday, analysts at Goldman Sachs said that a disruption to the oil supply could cause a small but notable contraction in global economic growth while increasing inflation, depending on the duration of the conflict and the extent to which Iran opts to interfere with the Strait of Hormuz.
The strait is particularly important to China, which imports a significant amount of oil through the passageway, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who urged Beijing over the weekend to take a stand against Iranian retaliation.
“It will have some impact on us,” he told CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “It will have a lot more impact on the rest of the world.”
Mr. Trump and his top aides later suggested that they were closely watching energy prices, and they appeared to signal that they could take executive action if necessary to keep them from rising.
“I can assure you, the administration is actively and closely monitoring the situation in the Strait of Hormuz, and the Iranian regime would be foolish to make that decision,” Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, told reporters.
On social media, Mr. Trump demanded that the Energy Department begin “NOW!!!” to increase domestic oil production. That prompted Energy Secretary Chris Wright to promise that the agency was “on it!”
Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, told CNBC earlier Monday that other oil-producing countries had significant reserves at their disposal, giving them “a lot of room to adjust” if Iran retaliated in a way that affected oil and gas, causing prices to surge.

Strait of Hormuz closure to put Pakistan in a tight spot,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324345-strait-of-hormuz-closure-to-put-pakistan-in-a-tight-spot,"ISLAMABAD: Energy import-led economies such as Pakistan could face serious trouble if Iran shuts down Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for US attack on its nuclear sites. The escalating Middle East tensions may result in a massive hike in fuel prices in Pakistan. Petrol may go up by Rs15 and diesel by Rs20 per litre from July 1, 2025 for the next fortnight. This trend is feared to continue in the fortnight to come. If Harmoz crisis starts, Pakistan will face a massive adverse impact.
Around 20 per cent of global oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz. Pakistan imports about 70-80 per cent of its crude oil, most of it from Gulf countries (e.g., Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait), all of which rely on the Strait for shipping. It would lead to increased cost of oil as rerouted or limited supply would cause overall inflation, raising prices of basic goods, transportation, and manufacturing inputs.
Pakistan would face tremendous pressure on the balance of payments as the country already has a weak current account. Higher oil prices would deepen trade deficit and put pressure on foreign exchange reserves.
The country may also experience currency depreciation as the increased import costs would weaken the Pakistani Rupee, further worsening inflation.
The top authorities in the Petroleum Division on Monday held a detailed meeting with heads of refineries and oil marketing companies (OMCs) and deliberated on various options to reduce the impact of the Middle East
situation and in case of the Strait of Hormuz closure, a senior official told The News.
“In the meeting, various scenarios have been discussed and some doable options are finalised which will be pitched today (Tuesday) in the high-level meeting that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif convened at 10 am. The meeting to be headed by the Premier would give a nod to the finalised strategy to keep the impact of the Middle East situation at the lower side.”
Pakistan under long-term agreements imports crude oil, finished POL products from ADNOC of Dubai and Aramco of Saudi Arabia and diesel from Kuwait and LNG from Qatar.
The transportation of fuel trade between the Middle East and Pakistan is carried through the Strait of Hormuz. In case the Hormuz crisis starts and it lasts for days, Pakistan will cope with the situation, but it would have no option but to increase the POL prices in the country because of the continued surge in prices of POL products in the international market.
“Dubai has two ports one is Ras Al Khaima and the second is Fujairah. Pakistan’s refineries import crude oil from Ras Al Khaima port which is linked with Strait of Hormuz. Dubai exports crude oil of three million barrels per day, but if it uses its Fujairah port, its export would reduce by 50 percent to 1.5 million BPD because the oil pipeline to Fujairah has less capacity to export the fuel. Under this scenario, Dubai will certainly cut the supply of crude oil and finished products to all fuel-importing countries which mainly include Pakistan, India, China, Japan and others.
India, China, Japan, BD and other developing countries are importing crude oil and finished products under long-term agreements. However, Dubai may refuse to provide oil to the clients that buy on requirement basis through spot purchasing.
Saudi Arabia has a pipeline in the red-sea also from where it can export fuel. Currently KSA exports crude and finished products of 7 million barrels per day and to avoid the waterway of Strait of Hormuz, it would have to export from the red-sea through its pipeline and in this case, exports of fuel from Saudi Arabia would reduce by 50 percent. So under this scenario, KSA would place the cut on fuel supplies to the countries which are purchasing under long term agreements.”
“This would create a shortage of fuel in all countries which are importing fuel from Middle East countries. Under this scenario, panic buying of POL products may trigger as people would start rationing the fuel and petrol pumps may also go for hoarding.”
If Iran disallows the ships’ transportation in its waters area in Hormuz, then the traffic congestion would escalate manifold in Oman waters area in Hormuz. Under this situation, transportation of goods and fuel would slow down manifold and ships would arrive very late, but fuel products and other goods would be available but at higher prices. If the Strait of Hormuz is closed down, the crude oil price will cross $100 per barrel and may reach up to $130 per barrel.
In case a crisis persists for some days, Pakistan can cope with the situation by running the refineries at optimum level and by asking OMCs not only to maintain their 20 days stocks, but also increase stocks to 40 days as the existing storages have a capacity to increase stock to 40 days.
OMCs can be asked to import the POL products at the maximum. Ogra says that there are enough stocks in the country to cater for 22 days of petrol and 32 days of diesel consumption. Further, the imports are also as per planning and are arriving regularly to cater for the sales. The daily consumption of petrol stands at around 24000 tons and 18000 tons of diesel.
But if the crisis lingers for weeks, then Pakistan will face serious trouble as the fuel shortage is to be evident which will increase inflation because of high fuel prices. The power tariff would also increase manifold because of costly imported fuel, including LNG.
The official said that in this scenario, Pakistan needs to import crude and finished products from Russia, the USA and Algeria but under this scenario, the transportation cost would also increase which will cause a hike in inflation.
However, the chances to close down the Strait of Hormuz are not high as China which is one of the closest friends of Iran. Of its total import, China gets 40-50 percent (4-5 million barrels per day) fuel from the Middle East through Strait of Hormuz. China imports 10 million oil barrels per day out of which 5 million it imports through Strait of Hormuz. China also gets fuel from Iran in abundance. China has invested billions of dollars in Iran also. Iran is currently in consultation with Russia on how to respond after the US attack on Iran’s nuclear sites. China will also give its input to Iran for formulating its response if Iran should attack on the US bases in the Gulf countries, close down the Strait of Hormuz or accelerate the attacks on Israel only and this strategy would also continue to put the USA, G7 countries at pain.

"No need for panic or rationing, says petroleum minister",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324346-no-need-for-panic-or-rationing-says-petroleum-minister,"ISLAMABAD: With the Strait of Hormuz becoming a flashpoint following the bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran by the United States, Pakistan is actively reviewing alternative routes for uninterrupted supply of petroleum products.
Located between Iran and Oman, the Strait of Hormuz remains the world’s most strategically important choke points and its closure or blockade could have serious implications for the global and US economy.  Speaking to the Geo TV on Monday, Federal Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had constituted a high-level committee led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to assess the country’s petroleum situation.
“I am part of the committee, which also includes the Ogra chairman, petroleum secretary, and other senior officials,” Malik said.
He confirmed that Pakistan currently had adequate stocks of petroleum products and there was “no need for panic or go for rationing”.
“Cargos have already been booked, and we’re reviewing daily stock updates to ensure uninterrupted supply,” he said.
In a meeting held earlier Monday at the Petroleum Division, the government examined alternative sourcing strategies in case of emergency.
“We assessed how supplies can be diverted from Oman or other routes bypassing the Strait of Hormuz if required,” Malik noted, emphasizing that all preventive measures were underway. “Ogra has ramped up its
monitoring of refinery and OMC stocks,” he added, noting the regulator had done considerable groundwork in stock surveillance.
Malik stressed that despite geopolitical uncertainty, “we are fully prepared to maintain an active supply chain of petroleum and crude products.” He further said the prime minister will personally review the contingency plans in the coming days.
“The aim is to ensure the availability of oil at all costs, even in worst-case scenarios,” Malik emphasized.  The minister concluded by expressing hope for regional de-escalation.  “We pray for peace and expect better sense to prevail — but we’re not leaving anything to chance.”

AGP flags Rs 836bn discrepancies in Sindh audit,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324347-agp-flags-rs-836bn-discrepancies-in-sindh-audit,"KARACHI: In a damning revelation, the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has uncovered massive financial irregularities worth over Rs836.43 billion across multiple departments of the Sindh Government.
The audit report for the financial year 2023–24, released as part of the 2024–25 audit cycle, points to systemic failures, rampant corruption, mismanagement, and widespread financial misappropriation in provincial institutions.
The AGP report cited severe lapses in financial controls, record-keeping, hiring practices, and procurement procedures, raising serious questions about the governance and fiscal responsibility of key Sindh government departments. It cited non production of record of Rs.97.865 billion, cases of frauds, embezzlement, misappropriation of funds amounting to Rs.1.088billion; irregularities in hiring of employees amounting to Rs.32.122 billion; procurement related irregularities of Rs.55.408bn; financial irregularity of Rs.42.101bn. in management of accounts with commercial banks; irregularities in the head of value for money and service delivery of Rs19.406 billion, operational inefficiency amounting to Rs.494.779 billion; internal control weakness leading to losses amounting to Rs.65.012billion; and irregularities in record keeping and data accuracy amounting to Rs.28.654 billion.
Despite audit-flagged recoveries worth Rs56.53 billion, actual verified recovery stood at a mere Rs785.795 million. The AGP report added that, on
current audit paras, the secretary finance and the secretary agriculture have directed to conduct 31 inquiries against the persons responsible for the irregularities and embezzlements. Besides the Public Accounts Committee, Sindh directed the Departmental Accounts Committees to conduct 22 inquiries on issues identified by it and verification of academic degrees of all employees of public sector universities.
Ironically, the Sindh Finance Department—responsible for managing the province’s finances—was found to have committed financial irregularities totaling Rs66.556 billion.  These included payments of pensions and General Provident (GP) funds to ineligible individuals, unjustified disbursements of honoraria, arrears, and retirement benefits, recruitment of underage and overage staff, expenditure without proper tenders, unauthorized distribution of pension-related work an other heads. Conclusively, the Sindh Finance Department failed to implement oversight or ensure accountability in its own operations. The Audit report further mentions that, the Sindh Board of Revenue (BoR) was flagged for underperforming on its revenue target by Rs55.187 billion and for inadequate collection of agricultural income tax.
The Sindh Energy Department failed to recover Rs27.867 billion from K-Electric, SEPCO, and HESCO. It also paid out Rs3.314 billion in subsidies to various private power companies without sufficient justification. Furthermore, Rs3.145 billion was paid to distribution companies for electricity beyond usage limits, and Rs2.65 billion was paid for “zero load” connections—raising suspicions of misappropriation.
The Sindh Solar Energy Project, a subsidiary of the Sindh Energy Department, despite a four-year spending of Rs5.294 billion and an extended timeline until July 2025, has yet to complete any of its four components, besides contracts worth Rs2.182 billion were awarded without physical inspections.
According to the report the Health, Education, Irrigation departments also wasted billions of rupees. The Health Department saw irregularities worth Rs62.5 billion—mainly due to suspicious medicine procurement, fake vouchers, and poor service delivery. The School Education Department misappropriated Rs49.2 billion through fraudulent hiring, fake teacher attendance, and construction of non-functional schools. The Irrigation Department was accused of Rs42.9 billion in irregular expenditures due to tender violations and duplicate payments.
The Works and Services Department misused Rs58.4 billion on substandard roads, bridges, and building projects—many of which remain incomplete. Audit authorities highlighted poor planning and flawed execution. The Agriculture Department was found to have embezzled Rs37.6 billion through irregular procurement of seeds, fertilizers, and machinery. The Livestock and Fisheries Department reported Rs28.3 billion in anomalies, particularly in fisheries development schemes. The Home Department had Rs33.1 billion in questionable expenditures, including dual salary disbursements, unauthorized vehicle use, and misuse of police resources.
According to the audit report, the Chief Minister’s Secretariat reportedly paid Rs100 million to the NGO ‘JDC Foundation’ during 2023–24 on directives from then-caretaker chief minister. Additionally, the College Education Department was flagged for an irregular Rs1.5 billion grant to cadet colleges and IBA community colleges without fulfilling required formalities.
The AGP has recommended strict disciplinary action against officials for non-production of records, investigations into embezzlements and misappropriations, strengthening internal audit systems, regular meetings of Departmental Accounts Committees, verification of academic credentials of university employees, strict adherence to Sindh Public Procurement Regulatory Authority rules
A spokesperson for the Sindh government clarified that the audit report comprises preliminary observations and reported irregularities, which are considered part of the standard audit process. “These audit points are routinely reviewed by the respective Departmental Accounts Committees (DACs) and subsequently addressed in the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in accordance with established procedures,” the official stated.
The spokesperson concluded that if any official is found guilty of wrongdoing, the PAC holds the authority to order the recovery of the misappropriated amount and initiate appropriate disciplinary or legal action.

EU seeks Gaza progress after Israel found in breach of cooperation deal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324348-eu-seeks-gaza-progress-after-israel-found-in-breach-of-cooperation-deal,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: The EU said Monday that Israel must improve the humanitarian situation in Gaza or else face possible consequences, after a review of a cooperation deal found it fell short of its human-rights obligations.
The European Union’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said the bloc hopes to use a review of the EU-Israel Association Agreement to pressure Israel to ease suffering in the Palestinian territory and allow more aid into the strip.
“We will contact Israel to present our findings and look at how we can improve the situation on the ground,” Kallas told a press conference after presenting the review’s findings at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.
“If the situation does not improve, then we can discuss further measures,” she said, adding this would happen in July.
The bloc last month launched an audit of the EU-Israel deal, which forms the basis for trade ties, under one of its articles calling for respect of human rights.It marked a milestone of sorts, given the EU has long struggled to have an impact on the Mideast conflict due to longstanding divisions between countries that back Israel and those seen as more pro-Palestinian.
The review found Israel’s conduct in Gaza ran afoul of its obligations.The text seen by AFP cited Israel’s blockade of humanitarian aid, the high number of civilian casualties, and the massive population displacements
among possible rights violations.
“Our main concern is humanitarian aid distribution,” Kallas told reporters. “We see the humanitarian aid behind the borders, but it doesn’t reach the people.”What action Brussels might take if things do not improve is not clear, as the war in Iran has moved the goalposts and pushed some nations to voice renewed support for Israel.
Some countries would like to suspend the EU-Israel accord outright but that would require unanimity among member states -- something diplomats have said is virtually impossible.
Halting diplomatic dialogue with Israel -- a measure already rejected last year -- also requires backing from all EU countries.Trade measures could instead be adopted with a qualified majority, and Kallas hinted the EU response could go in that direction.
Asked about a nine-country call for Brussels to come up with a plan to end trade with Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that are illegal under international law, she said that was “one of the measures that could be taken”.

Maryam inspects uplift projects in Lahore,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324349-maryam-inspects-uplift-projects-in-lahore,"LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz made a surprise visit to Lahore city early on Monday and reviewed progress on development projects.
She visited the overhead bridge being built on the Walton Road and inspected the newly-constructed Route 47.
The CBD Route 47 has been made functional for traffic. Route 47 is over four and a half kilometers long and comprises three lanes equipped with the latest infrastructure. This route, which links Kalma Chowk to Walton, has been attributed to the freedom struggle of 1947. Travelling from Gulberg to Walton via CBD Route 47 will be possible in a few minutes. There is also a lane allocated for cyclists stretching over about 2.5 kilometers. Walkways have also been allocated for pedestrians and cyclists on the Walton Railway Crossing Flyover. Solar panels (912 megawatts) on the Walton Railway Crossing Flyover will be able to generate one megawatt of electricity.
An artificial lake has been set up along the route to store five million gallons of rainwater, fountains, and aeration systems have also been installed for beautification purposes. Various monuments have been installed to highlight the identity of the Route 47 highway.
Speaking on the occasion, Maryam said: “Route 47 is another significant milestone towards attaining a bright andsustainable future of Punjab. It is not just a road, but it highlights a new chapter of
smart development in Punjab.”
Message: The chief minister, in her message on the International Widows Day, has said the religion of Islam has persuaded its followers to give due respect to widows. She highlighted: “Widows are a collective responsibility of a civilized society. Women who have become widows during wars in Kashmir, Gaza and Iran are a big question mark on the global conscience. The Punjab government is not only providing sympathy to widows but due care and support as well. Widows or single mothers are being given foremost priority in the Apni Chhat, Apna Ghar program. Children of widows are also being given priority while granting Honhaar scholarships. The Women Protection Authority and the Social Welfare Department are ensuring due care to widows across Punjab.”

"Life skills education in schools: SC summons federal, provincial secretaries",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324350-life-skills-education-in-schools-sc-summons-federal-provincial-secretaries,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday, while hearing a case concerning the introduction of life skills education in schools, summoned the federal and provincial secretaries of education for the next hearing.
During the hearing, Justice Mazhar stated that a joint action plan can only be formed when all education secretaries are present in court. The additional attorney general, however, informed the court that life skills education is already being taught to children in schools in Islamabad.
Petitioner’s counsel Salman Akram Raja informed the court that responses had been submitted by Punjab province and the federal government, but he had not yet received copies of those responses.
During the hearing, the court expressed displeasure over the absence of a legal representative from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Justice Musarrat Hilali remarked that the main issue lies in the KP, and yet there is no representation from the province.
The bench directed that copies of all provincial responses be provided to the petitioner’s lawyer and adjourned the hearing sine die (indefinitely).
Meanwhile, the bench issued a notice to the federal government and sought a response in a case filed against military officers becoming part of the civil service without taking the required examination for joining the central superior services (CSS).  A five-member Constitutional Bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice
Musarrat Hilali and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, heard the case.
During the hearing, the petitioner, Ali Azim Afridi, appeared in person and argued that civilian candidates are required to pass both a written exam and an interview for the CSS (Central Superior Services), whereas armed forces officers are inducted into the civil bureaucracy through just an interview, bypassing the CSS exam process.
Justice Najafi asked the petitioner which of his rights were being infringed upon by the induction of military officers into the civil service. The court then issued a notice to the federal government, directing it to submit a reply within three weeks, and adjourned the hearing. Likewise, the Constitutional Bench, while hearing the review petition filed against the decision regarding vice chancellor appointments, saw Justice Mazhar inquire whether appointments for rector and president of the Islamic University had been made.
Rehanuddin, counsel for the university, replied that a permanent rector had not yet been appointed and that only an acting charge was in place. Justice Rizvi asked whether this was the same rector who was brought to the Supreme Court in a wheelchair. The lawyer responded that while the president of the Islamic University had been appointed, he had not yet arrived in Pakistan from Saudi Arabia to assume charge. He further informed the court that following a Supreme Court ruling, the former rector was suspended and removed from office, partly due to personal remarks made by the court against him.
He informed the court that they now wished to withdraw the review petition. Justice Mazhar, however, said that if the university wanted to withdraw the review petition, a formal application must be filed. Later, the court granted time to file the new application and adjourned further proceedings indefinitely.

"AGP’s report on Rs1,000bn irregularities charge sheet against Maryam: PTI",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324314-agp-s-report-on-rs1-000bn-irregularities-charge-sheet-against-maryam-pti,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Punjab Monday strongly condemned the shocking revelations presented in the Auditor General of Pakistan’s audit report for the Fiscal Year 2024–25.
In a statement, the opposition party said the report stands as an irrefutable charge sheet against the Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and her illegitimate government.
According to the report, serious financial irregularities of over PKR1,000 billion have been uncovered in Punjab’s expenditure accounts. These include fraud, misuse of public funds, unauthorized payments, financial mismanagement, suspicious procurement practices, and illegal placement of consolidated funds in commercial banks.
“The so-called chief minister has continued the legacy of family corruption by setting new records of financial misconduct in an alarmingly short time. Public tax money, earned through hard work and sweat of the people, is being squandered ruthlessly on self-promotion, propaganda, and lavish indulgences, the scale of which is unprecedented in the province’s history.
“This artificial and unsustainable government is fully aware that the people have categorically rejected them and that they will not return to power. That is why they are plundering Punjab’s resources with impunity before their imminent departure. Those responsible for pushing the people into the abyss of inflation, unemployment, and poverty while
misusing public funds for personal luxury will be held accountable,” said the statement.

Pakistan collects $1.1bn from tobacco taxes as reforms slash cigarette production: WHO,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324315-pakistan-collects-1-1bn-from-tobacco-taxes-as-reforms-slash-cigarette-production-who,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan collected a record-breaking Rs 298 billion, around $1.1 billion, in tobacco taxes in 2024 following a series of bold fiscal reforms that also slashed cigarette production by over 28 per cent, signaling a rare but powerful success in the country’s fight against tobacco, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in its Global Tobacco Epidemic Report 2025.
However, despite this significant progress on taxation, the report warns that Pakistan still lags dangerously behind in implementing the full spectrum of tobacco control policies.
The WHO hailed the country’s recent tax hikes -- executed between 2022 and 2023 -- as a model of evidence-based policymaking. These reforms included tripling cigarette taxes, doubling the minimum price of cigarettes from PKR 63 to PKR 127, and increasing the share of tax in retail prices.
This resulted in a substantial decline in legal cigarette production and a marked increase in government revenue, driven in part by technical collaboration between the Federal Board of Revenue and WHO.
Yet, the report paints a more sobering picture of Pakistan’s overall tobacco control efforts. While over 6.1 billion people globally — more than 75 per cent of the world population — are now protected by at least one of WHO’s MPOWER measures at best-practice level, Pakistan remains among the 40 countries that have not implemented a single one at that level.
The MPOWER package includes six strategies: Monitoring tobacco use, Protecting people
from tobacco smoke, Offering help to quit, Warning about the dangers of tobacco, Enforcing advertising bans, and Raising taxes.
In Pakistan’s case, only the “Raise” component has seen effective implementation, thanks to a major policy turnaround that reversed years of fiscal missteps.
According to WHO, earlier tax reforms had failed to curb smoking or increase revenue. A 2017 move to introduce a third tax tier — effectively lowering taxes on cheaper cigarettes — backfired spectacularly, costing the government an estimated PKR 42.4 billion (US$ 353 million) in 2018 alone.
However, renewed political will and technical guidance helped Pakistan abandon this regressive policy. The Minister of Finance even credited WHO in his 2023 budget speech for supporting the government in resisting tobacco industry pressure.
Still, the country’s performance on other vital measures remains inadequate. While 110 countries — covering 62 per cent of the global population — now require graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging, Pakistan does not meet the minimum standards for size, placement, or imagery.
Likewise, anti-tobacco mass media campaigns — considered crucial in preventing youth uptake and supporting cessation — have not been implemented at best-practice level in Pakistan.
South Asian neighbours such as India, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka have outpaced Pakistan on these fronts. India, for instance, mandates graphic warnings covering 85 per cent of cigarette packs and has banned most tobacco advertising. Sri Lanka has introduced plain packaging laws, while Bangladesh has intensified enforcement and public education campaigns.
Emerging tobacco threats such as e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches also remain unregulated in Pakistan, despite WHO warnings about their aggressive marketing to youth.
Globally, 133 countries now regulate electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), with 42 imposing outright bans. Pakistan, by contrast, still lacks a clear legal framework.
Globally, only four countries — Brazil, Turkey, Mauritius, and the Netherlands — have fully implemented all five MPOWER strategies at best-practice levels. Since the package’s launch in 2007, an estimated 300 million fewer people are smoking today compared to projected trends.
Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, emphasised the importance of comprehensive action. “Raising tobacco taxes works — it saves lives and raises revenue. But countries must also act on all other fronts, from health warnings to smoke-free laws and education campaigns.”
The WHO’s 2025 report makes it clear that while Pakistan’s recent tax reforms offer a template for progress, the fight is far from over. Without strong legislation on packaging, advertising, public education, and cessation support, the country remains vulnerable to the tobacco industry’s evolving tactics — and so does the health of its people.

"At UNSC, Pakistan says unilateral military actions only deepen conflicts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324326-at-unsc-pakistan-says-unilateral-military-actions-only-deepen-conflicts,"NEW YORK: Amid ongoing tensions in the Middle East involving Iran and Israel, only to be exacerbated by US strikes on Tehran’s nuclear sites, Pakistan has told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) that history reflects that the use of force and unilateral military actions only deepen conflicts and entrench divisions.
“We must act now to prevent the situation from spiralling further out of control [....] Dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable path forward,” Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Asim Iftikhar told the UNSC huddle amid increasingly volatile situation in the region.
Speaking at the UNSC, Ambassador Iftikhar echoed the earlier statement issued by the Foreign Office condemning US bombings and backing Iran’s right of self-defence and lamented the attacks on the nuclear sites as “dangerous precedent and pose a grave threat to the safety and security of populations across the region and the world”.
Denouncing the attacks on IAEA-safeguarded facilities, the envoy said that Islamabad has joined China and Russia in circulating a draft resolution calling for an “immediate and unconditional ceasefire”.
The resolution also urges “all parties to refrain from further escalation; demands the urgent protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure; and supports a diplomatic path forward on the Iranian nuclear issue that is acceptable to all
parties”.
Reiterating Pakistan’s support for Iran, the UN representative underscored that the sharp rise in tensions and violence as a result of the Israeli aggression and unlawful actions was profoundly disturbing and “any further escalation risks catastrophic consequences for the region and beyond”.
Furthermore, the diplomat urged the UNSC to reaffirm its obligation to protect civilian lives and property on both sides. “All parties must adhere fully to international law, particularly international humanitarian law,” he said while stressing the UN body to “promote urgent recourse to dialogue and diplomacy, consistent with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter” and to find a peaceful and lasting resolution to the Iranian nuclear issue.

Iranian envoy calls for enhanced trade ties with Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324327-iranian-envoy-calls-for-enhanced-trade-ties-with-pakistan,"QUETTA: The Iranian Consul General in Quetta, Ali Reza Rajaei, has expressed confidence that the government and people of Pakistan firmly stand with Iran against Israeli aggression.
He emphasised that establishing rail-based bilateral trade routes is a pressing need of the time and proposed the formation of a Crisis Management Cell to handle emergencies effectively.
Speaking to the office bearers and members of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry on Monday, the Consul General stressed the importance of proactive coordination between key stakeholders.
He proposed that the Crisis Management Cell should include representatives from the Quetta Chamber, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Customs, the Iranian Consulate, and the Zahidan Chamber of Commerce to ensure seamless handling of urgent situations.
Earlier, upon his arrival at the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Consul General was warmly received by Chamber President Haji Muhammad Ayub Mariani and other officials.
During the meeting, the chamber’s leadership condemned Israeli aggression against Iran and expressed solidarity with the Iranian people, assuring them of
the unwavering support of Balochistan’s business community and the general public during these testing times.
The Chamber President pledged that the Quetta Chamber would fully cooperate with relevant government departments, including Customs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the FIA, to ensure the timely and uninterrupted supply of essential goods to Iran.
He also stressed that in times of conflict, while border security remains the responsibility of law enforcement agencies, every possible facilitation should be provided for the delivery of essential commodities.
Highlighting Clause 17 of the Iran-Pakistan Joint Border Trade Agreement (JBTC), the Chamber President urged that border gates remain open 24 hours to maintain the continuous flow of trade.
The Iranian Consul General, while discussing the ongoing regional conflict, emphasised the critical need to ensure timely and unhindered supplies from Pakistan to Iran, particularly noting instances where trucks carrying rice and meat have been unnecessarily delayed, causing significant problems. He expressed strong belief in Pakistan’s support for Iran in the face of Israeli aggression.
The Consul General also proposed developing rail-based trade routes and welcomed the Chamber President’s suggestion to initiate a daily train service from Zahidan to Taftan capable of transporting 20 to 25 containers per day.

Kohistan mega scandal Azam Swati fails to appear before NAB,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324328-kohistan-mega-scandalazam-swati-fails-to-appear-before-nab,"PESHAWAR: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Senator Azam Swati did not appear before the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday in connection with the Rs. 40 billion Kohistan mega corruption scandal. Instead, his lawyer represented him before the bureau.
NAB KP had summoned Azam Swati to appear on Monday, but his lawyer requested a one-week extension. However, NAB sources said the bureau refused to grant additional time and instructed that Azam Swati must appear in person as soon as possible. NAB will now issue a second notice for his appearance.
Swati has been accused of receiving Rs. 600 million in transactions during 2024 from suspects involved in the Kohistan scandal, allegedly deposited into his bank accounts.
According to sources, one of the companies allegedly involved in the scam is accused of siphoning off large sums, causing significant losses to the national exchequer. During 2024, the company allegedly transferred substantial amounts into Swati’s bank accounts.
Investigations revealed that a property, valued at Rs250 million, was sold for Rs600 million. Documents suggest the property was sold in 2024, but the ownership transfer was allegedly backdated to 2016. Furthermore, there is no record of any tax payments to the government regarding the transaction, indicating possible forgery.
According to sources close to Swati, he sold his property located in Habib Colony, Mansehra, and
received the payment for it. The transfer and sale documents are reportedly available. His associates claim he has no connection with the source of funds used by the buyer and reject the allegations as baseless. They allege that a false propaganda campaign is being run against him.

PPP slams PTI for disrupting Bilawal’s speech in NA,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324329-ppp-slams-pti-for-disrupting-bilawal-s-speech-in-na,"ISLAMABAD: Central spokesperson for the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Member of the National Assembly, Shazia Marri, strongly criticised Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for disrupting party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s address in Parliament, alleging that their discomfort stemmed from his bold stance on Indian aggression and his solidarity with Iran.
Speaking at a press conference outside Parliament House on Monday, flanked by PPP leaders Abdul Qadir Patel and Agha Rafiullah, Marri said, “The PTI looked visibly agitated during Bilawal’s speech. Was it his exposure of Modi’s propaganda or his call for solidarity with Iran that made them squirm?”
She said some in the opposition were clearly annoyed simply because Bilawal was forcefully raising Pakistan’s cause on global platforms.
Marri launched a scathing attack on Opposition Leader Omar Ayub, questioning his political integrity and past affiliations. “We all know how many parties he has switched. Today, he champions a party he once opposed — he lacks the stature to lead the opposition,” she stated.
Accusing the PTI of aligning with hostile narratives, she remarked, “PTI’s social media and Indian social media often sound like they are reading from the same script.”
Marri praised Bilawal’s speech as a “courageous and historic
articulation of Pakistan’s position on the world stage.” She said the PPP chairman had returned from global engagements with diplomatic victories, having held nearly 70 high-level meetings where he advocated for peace, Kashmir, and anti-terrorism efforts.
Highlighting the PPP’s ethos, she reiterated President Asif Ali Zardari’s commitment to political dialogue. “PPP stands for reconciliation, not confrontation. Our efforts are sincere and persistent,” she said.
In a sharp rebuke, Marri accused the PTI founder of being the “product of foreign funding” and claimed his children were raised in Zionist households. “He is the face of a foreign conspiracy,” she alleged.
Marri credited Bilawal’s diplomacy for refocusing the international spotlight on Kashmir and forcing India to soften its hardline stance. “From the UN to global media, Pakistan is being heard again because of Bilawal’s leadership. The world salutes his clarity and courage,” she declared.
The PPP leaders condemned the PTI’s “disgraceful” conduct in Parliament, accusing them of prioritising their imprisoned party chief over national issues. “They are silent on Kashmir, terrorism, and water security. All they care about is their leader’s release,” said Marri.
Abdul Qadir Patel expressed concern that the PTI’s behaviour may render PPP’s reconciliation efforts fruitless. “Criticism is part of democracy, but what we saw today crosses all bounds,” he remarked.
Marri reiterated Bilawal’s message that Pakistan seeks peace, not war, with India — a message echoed even by the US leadership. “Terrorists seek war; we do not. Peace builders deserve our full support,” she said, citing past international appreciation for Pakistan’s peace efforts.
Calling India’s unwillingness to engage a strategic failure, she urged the opposition to reflect on its role and support national interests at a time when Pakistan’s global narrative is gaining ground.

"Climate change to claim 15.6m lives by 2050, warn experts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324334-climate-change-to-claim-15-6m-lives-by-2050-warn-experts,"Islamabad: Up to 15.6 million people in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are projected to die between 2026 and 2050 due to climate-sensitive diseases, experts have warned in a groundbreaking international paper that explores the devastating intersection of climate change, rapid urbanization, and rural health inequalities.
Despite contributing minimally to global carbon emissions, rural populations in LMICs are bearing the brunt of this escalating crisis.
The study, published in the Journal of Surgical Specialties and Rural Practice, presents a comprehensive analysis of how extreme weather events, shifting disease patterns, and inadequate health infrastructure are amplifying health disparities across rural regions already weakened by poverty, weak governance, and decades of systemic neglect.
“Climate change is not just an environmental issue—it’s a public health emergency that is hitting the rural poor the hardest,” the paper warns, adding that climate-induced stress is driving food insecurity, mental health issues, and the spread of communicable diseases like malaria, dengue, and diarrhea in rural LMICs. One of the most alarming projections is the estimated annual toll of 250,000 additional climate-related deaths in LMICs, according to the World Health Organization. These deaths are attributed to shifting patterns of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and extreme weather, disproportionately
affecting women, children, and the elderly in rural areas.
Dr. Sankha Randenikumara, lead author from Sri Lanka, and co-authors from Pakistan, India, South Africa, Ukraine, and 10 other countries, argue that the ongoing migration of healthcare professionals from rural to urban areas is hollowing out already fragile rural health systems.
This migration is leading to dependence on traditional medicine and increasing health risks for rural communities, particularly where agriculture is the primary source of livelihood and is itself under siege from climate shocks. The study singles out rapid, unregulated urbanization as another compounding threat. It notes that rural-to-urban migration is creating overcrowded informal settlements in cities that lack clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. These urban slums, the authors say, are becoming breeding grounds for infectious diseases and social exclusion, placing further stress on both rural and urban health systems.
In a rare interdisciplinary call to action, the authors propose targeted policy reforms to integrate climate adaptation with health planning. These include strengthening climate-resilient health infrastructure, scaling up telemedicine and mobile health platforms, adopting climate-smart agricultural practices, and empowering community health workers. Notably, the study highlights Pakistan’s own success with mobile health platforms that provided maternal and child health services during the COVID-19 crisis. Similar models from India, Tanzania, and Australia are cited as evidence that community-based healthcare models—when properly resourced—can improve access and resilience in underserved rural areas.
Prof. Dr. Ejaz Ahmad Khan of the Health Services Academy, Islamabad, who co-authored the paper, emphasized the urgency of aligning health policies with climate resilience strategies. “We need to invest now in rural health systems before the gap becomes irreparable. Climate change is a multiplier of existing inequalities,” he said.
Importantly, the paper also highlights the unique role of family doctors, calling them “agents of change” who can engage with individuals, communities, and policymakers to address the climate-health crisis. From “greening” general practice clinics to delivering climate education during consultations, family physicians are urged to take a leading role in the response. The authors lament a serious gap in research on climate and health in rural settings. They recommend future studies on gendered health impacts, mental health effects of climate trauma, and the effectiveness of early warning systems tailored to rural environments. They also call for increased funding, legal protections, and integrated governance across sectors such as health, environment, agriculture, and urban planning.
With the clock ticking and vulnerable populations increasingly at risk, the report ends with a sobering reminder: unless bold, coordinated, and inclusive actions are taken immediately, climate change will deepen the fault lines of inequality, placing millions of lives in jeopardy.

SHC disposes of PA speaker’s plea for access to Governor House,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324285-shc-disposes-of-pa-speaker-s-plea-for-access-to-governor-house,"Sindh acting governor Awais Qadir Shah has been given full access to all rooms, offices and chambers of the Governor House except the residential portion to carry out his official business as the acting governor of the province, the principal secretary to the Governor House told the Sindh High Court on Monday.
The statement filed in compliance with a court order for the principal secretary to the Governor House to provide immediate access to the Sindh Assembly speaker, who is presently the acting governor, to all rooms and other chambers of the Governor House, except the residential portion, to carry out his official business as the acting governor of the province under the constitution.
Sindh Assembly Speaker Awais Qadir Shah had approached the high court against denial of his access to various rooms of the Governor House to perform his official duties as the acting governor.
A division bench, headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha , after taking the statement on record, disposed of Shah’s petition against denial of his access to various rooms of the Governor House to perform his official duties as the acting governor following a statement by the principal secretary that the order of the court had been complied with.
Shah’s counsel had submitted that Governor Tessori was presently outside the country and as such by virtue of Article 104 of the constitution, the speaker of the Sindh Assembly had to perform
the functions of the acting governor until the governor returned to Pakistan. He submitted that the petitioner was being denied access to the Governor House and its offices, which had hampered him from performing his official duties as the acting governor.

Police foil secret burial attempt after woman’s murder in Afghan Basti,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324288-police-foil-secret-burial-attempt-after-woman-s-murder-in-afghan-basti,"In a disturbing incident of domestic abuse, a 17-year-old, also the mother of a minor baby girl, was murdered in Karachi’s Afghan Basti allegedly by her own family members.
The incident took place near Afghan Chowk within the limits of the Gulshan-e-Maymar police station. Acting swiftly on a tip-off, police intervened just in time to stop a secret burial, arresting the girl’s father at the scene, while her husband and other suspects fled and are currently being sought.
The murdered woman was identified as 17-year-old Aram Bibi, wife of Muhammad Afghani. Police received a tip-off that the woman's husband, father Yaseen and other suspects had tortured and killed her and were attempting to bury her quietly to cover up the crime.
Acting swiftly, police arrived at the scene just before the burial could take place. A grave had already been prepared when the police team came. During the raid, police arrested the victim’s father while her husband and other suspects fled. A search operation is currently under way to apprehend the remaining culprits.
Police said signs of severe torture were found on the body that was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities. The initial investigations revealed that Aram Bibi had been married off at a young age and was the mother of a baby girl. Police believe the murder was the result of a domestic dispute. A post-mortem examination would be conducted to determine the exact cause of
death, after which a formal FIR would be registered.

Two most-wanted suspects linked to MQM-L held: Rangers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324289-two-most-wanted-suspects-linked-to-mqm-l-held-rangers,"Acting on intelligence-based information, the Sindh Rangers and police conducted a joint operation in Saudabad and near the Karachi airport, resulting in the arrest of “two most-wanted suspects”, Shehab Khan, alias Kara, and Mansoor Alam, alias Charkat, who are reportedly affiliated with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London (MQM-L).
According to the Rangers spokesperson, the arrested men had been involved in drug trafficking, robberies and multiple street crimes. The law enforcers allegedly recovered an auto-rickshaw, two mobile phones and cash from them.
Both suspects are “habitual offenders”, and have allegedly been arrested several times by police and the security forces. During the preliminary interrogation, Alam allegedly admitted to being involved in wall-chalking, putting up political banners, and collecting donations and Fitra for his party.
The spokesperson claimed that to avoid arrest during the Karachi operation, he began working as a rickshaw driver. The suspect allegedly revealed that he used his rickshaw to transport gutka, mawa and other narcotics across the city.
Khan allegedly admitted to working as a controller at a private factory while engaging in part-time street crimes. He also has a criminal history, and has served time in jail on multiple occasions, according to the spokesperson.
The two suspects allegedly admitted to committing numerous street crimes in Malir, Shah Faisal Colony, Landhi and Korangi, and also admitted to
being involved in armed robberies at three private dairy shops.
According to their alleged confession, they looted over Rs400,000 and 40 to 50 mobile phones during various street crime and robbery incidents. The suspects have been handed over to police for further legal proceedings, along with the recovered items.

"Lawyers slam US, Israeli military strikes against Iran as ‘illegal aggression and war crime’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324290-lawyers-slam-us-israeli-military-strikes-against-iran-as-illegal-aggression-and-war-crime,"The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) on Monday convened an emergency session of its general body to condemn unprovoked and unlawful military aggression by the United States and Israel targeting Iran's sovereign territory and strategic nuclear facilities at Natanz, Isfahan and Fordow.
The meeting was presided over by KBA President Amir Nawaz Warraich. In a resolution adopted in the meeting, the lawyers' body said: ""This coordinated act of aggression constitutes a direct violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and UN Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015), which obligates states to honour peaceful agreements and refrain from hostile actions against signatories of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Act (JCPOA).”
The resolution said that there were no credible claim of self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, as no armed attack was initiated by Iran, and thus the pretext of ""preemtive self-defence"" remains legally void, militarily disproportionate, and morally indefensible.
""This attack mirrors a familiar and dangerous pattern of US-led imperial militarism as seen in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and Syria which has brought decades of destruction, displacement, and instability, all based on lies, fabrication, or unverified intelligence,"" read the resolution.
""The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following this strike has issued threatening statements directed at Pakistan, irresponsibly dragging
Pakistan's name into a geopolitical crisis and attempting to provoke further regional chaos. This constitutes a reckless escalation and an insult to Pakistan's sovereignty.""
The moot said that the US had repeatedly weaponized its veto power in the UN Security Council to shield Israeli war crimes in Palestine, and continues to act with impunity, eroding the credibility of international law and enabling a cycle of unaccountable violence.
It expressed unwavering solidarity with the people of Iran and with all nations resisting imperialism, occupation, and the violation of their territorial integrity. The lawyers condemned the Israeli PM's statement about Pakistan, saying it was a deliberate provocation intended to destablize the wider Muslim world.
The meeting urged the government to issue a strong diplomatic protest against Israel, summon the US envoy for formal explanations, and raise matter at the OIC, UN General Assembly and international court of justice. Judicial work was suspended from 10:30am onward to express solidarity with Iran after the US strikes at Iran.

"Shia scholars, IGP agree on cooperation for Muharram security",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324292-shia-scholars-igp-agree-on-cooperation-for-muharram-security,"Sindh police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon on Monday held a meeting with Shia scholars at the Central Police Office to discuss security arrangements for Muharram. The meeting was also attended by Shia scholars and police officers from Larkana and Sukkur divisions through videoconferencing.
The meeting expressed their gratitude to the Pakistan Army for crushing Indian pride during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, and prayed for the survival and security of the country. The Shia scholars expressed their complete satisfaction with police security measures in different districts and divisions, and assured police and other law enforcement agencies (LEAs) of their full cooperation during all security arrangements, including those for Muharram.
They said volunteers would stand side by side with police during Muharram gatherings and processions, adding that constant contact with police at district level would also be ensured. IG Memon said there has always been exemplary cooperation between Shias and police during Muharram, and it would continue. “However, I request all of you not to fall prey to any mischief, and let the law do its job. We have defeated terrorism, and will continue to do so.”
He said the Sindh police, other LEAs and the security agencies are working day and night to strengthen law and order, and make it stable and integrated.
“However, we also need to be more cautious and alert in view of the global scenario.”
He asked immediately contacting police in case of any suspicious activity, and also keeping a close watch on those spreading division and sabotaging law and order. He said dignitaries belonging to all schools of thought, including scholars and Zakirs, should make Muharram peaceful and safe through their individual and collective roles.

SHC issues show-cause notice in Arif Alvi accounts freeze case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324293-shc-issues-show-cause-notice-in-arif-alvi-accounts-freeze-case,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday issued a show-cause notice to the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) for not complying with the court’s order in the case of the freezing of the bank accounts of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leader and former Pakistan president Dr Arif Alvi and his wife.
Dr Alvi and his wife Samina Alvi had petitioned the SHC that their bank accounts had been blocked by private banks on the directions of the NCCIA. An SHC division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha said the NCCIA’s investigating officer had been ordered to appear in court with the relevant case record, and the NCCIA director general was asked to ensure the IO’s appearance.
The bench said that neither the IO nor the DG appeared in court. The court issued a show-cause notice to the IO to explain the non-compliance. The SHC also repeated notices to the DG, saying that if the IO does not appear in the next hearing with an explanation, the DG must appear in court.
The bench also said the court would pass an appropriate order if both officers fail to comply  the SHC’s orders and do not appear in court on July 2. The petitioners’ counsel Ali Tahir said the NCCIA had initiated baseless inquiries against Dr Alvi under the Pakistan Penal Code’s
sections 298 and 298-A, which pertain to blasphemy-related allegations.
Tahir said the respondent agency’s officials had issued letters to the banks where his client and his family members have their accounts and had asked them to block them. He said the petitioner and his family members are unable to access personal and lawful funds due to the arbitrary and unlawful directives of the NCCIA issued to the private banks.
He also said that neither the Federal Investigation Agency Act nor the anti-money laundering act confers any authority on the NCCIA to unilaterally freeze or block the accounts of the petitioners without observing any due process of the law and legal procedure.
The counsel said that the private banks and the NCCIA had offered no opportunity of hearing to the petitioners with regard to justifying their action. He said the absence of procedural safeguards in such a serious matter is not only alarming but also underscores the respondent agency’s disregard for law and constitutional governance.
In the previous hearing, the SHC had, as an interim measure, allowed Dr Alvi to withdraw up to Rs1 million from his bank account in Islamabad for the purpose of his general living expenses until the next hearing.

The situation escalated when Adeel Mushtaq, an employee at the Gujranwala office, became a victim of alleged management negligence. According to staff reports, Adeel's health deteriorated and he was brought to Lahore for treatment. However, due to unpaid dues by PSQCA management, panel hospitals refused service, citing suspended agreements. Consequently, he was shifted to Jinnah Hospital, where he passed away. Employees revealed that the protests have been ongoing since before Eidul Azha. During a pre-Eid visit to the Lahore office, Director Shakil Arshad had promised resolution of all issues within a week after Eidul Azha but despite his assurance, no progress has been made. Workers also report receiving threats of severe consequences from the management for continuing their protest.
Employees Union Chairman M Tariq stated, ""Our homes are in darkness and instead of resolving issues, the management is pushing us towards further complications. The employees are united and determined to secure their rights."" He further appealed to Federal Minister Khalid Magsi to intervene immediately, stating that withholding bonuses and healthcare is blatant exploitation of the workforce.

Govt decision to revoke tax rebate for teachers condemned,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324200-govt-decision-to-revoke-tax-rebate-for-teachers-condemned,"LAHORE:Punjab University Academic Staff Association (PUASA) and the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA) Punjab Chapter held a joint press conference here on Monday to condemn the federal government’s decision to revoke the longstanding tax rebate for researchers and teachers.
PUASA President and former FAPUASA president Prof Dr Amjad Abbas Khan Magsi, FAPUASA Balochistan president Prof Dr Kaleem Ullah Bareach, FAPUASA Punjab president and PUASA secretary Dr M Islam, and others were also present.
Speaking at the press conference at PU New Campus, the FAPUASA and PUASA leaders demanded Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to increase budgetary allocations for the varsities of the province. They expressed serious concern over the meager funding and tax issues of the universities of Punjab province.
Dr Amjad Magsi said, “Despite being the largest province and more number of universities (51) in Punjab, only Rs18 billion have been fixed as recurring grant while Sindh province that has less (32) varsities than Punjab, more than double grant Rs42 billion has been allocated there. They demanded the Punjab Chief Minister for an immediate revision of allocation of recurring grants for the public sector universities in Punjab province.
This tax rebate was originally introduced by the Musharaf Government in 2006 at 75%, aimed at promoting research and academic retention. It was reduced to 40% by the PMLN government in 2013, and now the PMLN government is abolishing it
completely, a continuation of policies that show longstanding disregard for the academic community. The rebate was never a luxury; it was a lifeline for university faculty and researchers who routinely pay out of pocket for journal publication fees, chemicals, fieldwork, and academic travel. Its abolition will demoralise scholars, reduce research productivity, and accelerate brain drain, weakening Pakistan’s academic future. This assault comes amid a broader financial crisis in higher education. Despite the federal budget growing from Rs5.9 trillion in 2018 to Rs17.5 trillion in 2025, a 196% increase, the recurring grant for higher education has remained frozen at just Rs65 billion.
Meanwhile, the number of public sector universities has grown from 126 to 160, and operating costs, salaries, pensions, utilities, have skyrocketed. According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan, the country is spending only 0.8% of its GDP on education overall, and a mere 0.37% on higher education in the current fiscal year.
This is well below the UNESCO-recommended 4–6%, and far behind regional peers like India and Bangladesh. Shockingly, both PMLN and PPP had committed in their election manifestos to increase education spending to 4% of GDP, but have failed to honour those promises while in power. The PUASA and FAPUASA leadership warned of a country wide protest in case the government didn't honor their demands.

Promoting e-vehicles vital to drive sustainable transport future,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324219-promoting-e-vehicles-vital-to-drive-sustainable-transport-future,"Islamabad:The present government has stepped up policy-level efforts to promote electric vehicles in the country, as it offers a wide array of benefits across environmental, economic, public health and industrial development sectors.
This was stated by Muhammad Saleem Shaikh, media spokesperson for the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination on Sunday in context of the federal government’s New Electric Vehicle Policy (NEVP) launched that primarily aims to ensure a just and inclusive transition to cleaner mobility, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, stimulate local innovation and create new green jobs.
“The Government of Pakistan is stepping up efforts to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as a key part of the country’s clean energy and climate resilience agenda. With the transport sector being a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution, the shift towards EVs marks a significant move towards a sustainable, healthier, and economically viable future,” the senior climate change ministry official Muhammad Saleem remarked.
He said further that the Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Ministry has already reaffirmed its commitment at various forums to promoting electric vehicles (EVs) in the country as a strategic priority in the country’s transition toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient future for as a part of global efforts to cut heat-trapping and climate-altering vehicular carbon
emissions and achieve environmental and urban sustainability.
The senior Ministry official Muhammad Saleem Shaikh said, “Recognising the transport sector as among the key contributors to air pollution and climate change-causing greenhouse gas emissions, the Ministry would now actively support every possible efforts for implementation of the New Electric Vehicle Policy 2025–2030 to drive the country toward a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable mobility system.
Director General of the Ministry, Mohammad Asif Sahibzada pointed out that Ministry of Industries and Production, Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination (MoCC&EC), and other key industrial and non-industrial stakeholders are working in close collaboration to implement the New Electric Vehicle Policy 2025–2030.
He said further that the policy would go a long way in bring more and more e-vehicle on the country’s roads as it envisions 30 percent  of all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric — including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, buses, and cars.
“This transition is not only vital for addressing adverse impacts transport sector-related carbon emissions that contribute to climate change but also crucial for ensuring a clean, efficient and inclusive transport future for all Pakistanis,” Asif Sahibzada.
Talking about the environmental and public health benefits, the ministry’s director general Asif Sahibzada highlighted that EVs emit zero tailpipe pollutants, significantly reducing urban smog and climate-warming emissions. This shift supports the country’s commitments under the Paris Agreement and its national climate change targets, he added.
“Cleaner air means fewer respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. With fewer emissions on the road, citizens—especially children and the elderly—will benefit from improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs,” the ministry’s director general remarked.
He said further that electric vehicles undoubtedly offer long-term savings due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. They reduce Pakistan’s dependency on imported fossil fuels, helping stabilize the economy and protect against global energy price shocks.
The Ministry’s Director for Urban Affairs and Urban Air Pollution Experts, Muhammad Azeem Khoso said that cleaner air means fewer respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. With fewer emissions on the road, citizens, especially children and the elderly, will benefit from improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs, Khoso remarked.
The director urban affairs of the ministry suggested, “By integrating EVs with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, could one step further toward greater energy independence and a more resilient energy mix.”
He said further that local EV manufacturing, battery production and charging infrastructure development would open doors for innovation, entrepreneurship and green job creation across the green economy of the country.
""Electric vehicles are not just about cleaner transport; they are a cornerstone of our climate action strategy. Through this transition, we aim to protect public health, cut emissions, and create green jobs. The future of Pakistan’s mobility is electric, and we are fully committed to driving that change,"" director Urban Affairs Muhammad Azeem emphasised.

Partnerships between stakeholders imperative for better AI policy in Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324220-partnerships-between-stakeholders-imperative-for-better-ai-policy-in-pakistan,"Islamabad:Participants of a stakeholders' dialogue stressed that despite governments’ intention to develop policies for emerging technologies, there is still a long way to go for Pakistan to keep up with the rapidly evolving AI landscape. They expressed these views in a stakeholder dialogue organized on AI by the Institute for Research, Advocacy and Development (IRADA) with technical assistance of International Media Support (IMS).
The dialogue convened key stakeholders from Pakistan’s private tech sector, AI startups and legal community. Muhammad Aftab Alam, Executive Director of IRADA, said that, “the objective of this conversation is to address the opportunities and roadblocks in the country’s growing AI ecosystem. With over 200 AI-focused startups and a market estimated at $100 million, Pakistan’s private sector is actively innovating in AI-driven solutions across industries.” Salwa Rana, Program Manager of IRADA briefed about IRADA’s recent research which emphasized that Pakistan’s current legal and regulatory environment is ill-prepared for the complex implications of AI, such as issues around content ownership, liability, and data governance.
The dialogue, moderated by Moaz Bangu, drew comparisons with regional leaders like India and the UAE, whose AI regulatory frameworks offer valuable lessons for Pakistan. Using a structured five-step approach—Find the
Friction, Reframe the Challenge, Align Interests, Model the Fix, and Execute Next Moves—the dialogue surfaced practical solutions, including the need for regulatory sandboxes, model IP clauses, and data governance policies.
The participants of the dialogue highlighted critical challenges: outdated and missing legal frameworks, a lack of skilled professionals, inadequate infrastructure, and limited access to funding. Shahzar Ali from Enablify AI was of the view that data is the major obstacle developing indigenous AI models since most data is in an informal shape, largely stored in old-fashioned offline methods. The digitisation of this data requires time and resources, which contribute to Pakistan’s lack of growth in the area. Haroon Wajid, co-founder of Eynvision, also emphasised the importance of AI-oriented education in Pakistan and highlighted the need for revision of curriculum to include courses on emerging technologies. Manahil Kashif from Atom Camp said that such progress is possible if multiple stakeholders collaborate to promote training and capacity building on AI.
The session concluded with a shared commitment for increased engagement between civil society and tech industry and government on actionable policy recommendations for the government.

Higher seat of learning target of thieves,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324223-higher-seat-of-learning-target-of-thieves,"Islamabad:‘Knowledge is power.’ We being Urdu-medium students heard this dictum after 6th class. Then came to know that electricity is also a power. Rather it is Establishment of the scientific world.
And cables with 11KVA become higher source of power just like education, otherwise a forgotten, ignored and neglected field, becomes higher after entering boundaries of a university.
Quaid-i-Azam University is blamed to be No. 1 university of the country and is in the first 400 top university of the world. The condition of its classrooms, laboratories, libraries, hostels and faculty, however reflects something different. One must expect it in this Islamic Republic where education instead of Unesco-recommended 4 to 6 per cent of GDP, is doled out less than 1.5%. Even share of Zakat is 2.5%. Education is almost half of Zakat. That is why a former faculty of QAU, also an alumna, had asked the Vice-Chancellor Dr Niaz, rather all public-sector universities VCs or Rectors, to start collecting ‘Qurbani ki Khalain’ to meet their financial crises.
When Islamabadites were having a sigh of relief from scorching heat after some shower Friday morning, the Campus community was simmering due to power outage for six hours, a norm in the rural belt of ICT, University being part of it.
The reason this time, however, was different. The first rumour was that taking advantage of power breakdown, some thieves decamped with underground 11
KV high-tension cable. Later it transpired that the noble action was performed a week or so ago but Iesco ‘dasdi nai payee.’ The thieves removed the copper casing of the cable, obviously an expensive metal. Iesco just restored the connection by applying tapes and insulation material. The burglars must be qualified and equipped with technology to steal a live cable.
It is strange that the electricity supply vendor uses German silver in wires and copper in the outer casing. Wires are much efficient and good conductor of electricity.
The Friday rain water short-circuited it and the result was outage. Iesco is not that efficient to provide and replace cable swiftly and according to a QAU official, some ‘Jugarhs,’ in which this nation is well-versed, were applied to restore electric supply by noon. A permanent solution has yet to be found.
After cable theft, next step was to nab the culprits. CCTV cameras are an obvious ‘suhalat-kar’ in this exercise. It was discovered that many of the security cameras had been stolen in the meantime. ‘Lo kar lo gal’. Now university is encapsulating cameras with cages to prevent staling. Security cameras themselves need security.
Earlier some air conditioners were also stolen from the Campus buildings. Already, some teachers in their social media chats had suggested entrusting university security to monkeys roaming around so freely in its five housing colonies and departments while QAU is on holidays. Have a try VC-sahib!

FAPUASA rejects abolition of tax rebate under IMF pressure,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324227-fapuasa-rejects-abolition-of-tax-rebate-under-imf-pressure,"Islamabad:The Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) has strongly condemned the government's plan to abolish the longstanding tax rebate for university teachers and researchers in the upcoming budget.
Introduced in 2006 at a 75% rate and reduced to 40% by the PML-N government in 2013, this rebate was the only meaningful incentive for teachers and researchers to stay in academia and contribute to national development. Now, the same party seeks to end it altogether, dealing a serious blow to higher education and research in Pakistan.
The government’s excuse that the IMF has objected to the rebate, is both weak and misleading, it said. If the IMF has no objection to the FBR spending billions on luxury cars for officers, how can it justify denying a modest tax relief for educators and researchers? Even more outrageously, the same budget reportedly includes up to 600% salary increases for parliamentarians, highlighting the government’s misplaced priorities.
This selective austerity, according to FAPUASA, reflected a disturbing trend: rewarding bureaucracy and political elites while punishing educators. It is shameful that a sovereign country surrendered its policy space to external institutions to the point of micromanaging academic incentives.
Ending the rebate will accelerate brain-drain, demoralise scholars and further
weaken research output in Pakistan. FAPUASA will announce its response strategy in a press conference on Monday. It demanded immediate reversal of this anti-education decision. Teachers and researchers deserve respect, not cuts, it said.

Contract system for riverbank hunting spots opposed,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324231-contract-system-for-riverbank-hunting-spots-opposed,"CHARSADDA: An organisation working for the conservation and protection of bird species on Monday opposed the government’s decision to bring designated hunting points along the province’s rivers under a contractor system.
The organization also rejected the recent hike in the wildlife shooting license fee.Speaking at a press conference, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Nature and Wildlife Organization provincial president Musa Khan Safi and general secretary Rohullah Jan and other members said that the decision was tantamount to genocide of bird species if the contrcat system was implemented.
They said that all members of their organization were hunters, who hunt migratory birds as a hobby and renew their licenses annually through the Wildlife Department.Both said that under the new directive, the government has instructed the Wildlife Department to bring all designated riverbank hunting spots under a contractor system, which they consider a flawed decision.
The office-bearers said that their members hunt only during specific seasons and also release birds into the wild during breeding seasons to help maintain ecological balance. However, under the contractor system, the contractors would be motivated to hunt as many birds as possible, endangering bird populations.
They added that increasing license fees for hunters was an unfair move against the hunting community in the province. The hunters also said that the Wildlife Department had limited hunting to
only three days a week during the hunting season, which they believed was insufficient.

Ex-DG health’s pre-arrest bail extended,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324232-ex-dg-health-s-pre-arrest-bail-extended,"PESHAWAR: Special Anti-Corruption Judge Asif Rasheed on Monday extended the pre-arrest bail of former director general of Health Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Shaukat Ali, till June 30 and directed the Anti-Corruption Department to submit the complete case record.
During the hearing, Shaukat Ali was represented by Babar Khan Yousafzai.The counsel argued that despite multiple written requests, neither a copy of the first information report (FIR) had been provided to the petitioner nor were any relevant officials being produced in the court.
Yousafzai told the court that his client, a retired government officer, was accused of benefiting from dual employment of doctors allegedly working simultaneously at the DHO office and receiving double salaries.
However, he contended that all relevant employment records were available with the Anti-Corruption Department and there was no evidence that his client personally benefited from the matter.
He argued that Shaukat Ali had resisted attempts by certain groups to bypass merit in the procurement of medicines for government hospitals. “When my client refused to comply with irregularities, the medical supply mafia turned against him,” Yousafzai said, adding that an inquiry had already concluded that the supplier companies had failed to deliver the goods.
The counsel informed the court that his client had obtained a stay order from the Peshawar
High Court in a related matter, but the Anti-Corruption Department filed a fresh case to undermine the court’s directives.
Addressing allegations related to procurement for the Timergara Medical College, Yousafzai said there was no substance to the claims, as both records and physical inventory confirmed the legitimacy of purchases made during Shaukat Ali’s tenure.
“Even the deputy commissioner of Lower Dir has verified that nothing was done in violation of rules,” he added.Despite these facts, he said, his client was being subjected to political victimization. He said that a proper legal defense could not be mounted without access to the FIR or supporting documents. The senior prosecutor for the Anti-Corruption Department informed the court that the case record would be submitted at the next hearing.

PTI camp burning case: PPP leader terms FIR political victimisation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324236-pti-camp-burning-case-ppp-leader-terms-fir-political-victimisation,"PESHAWAR: A local court here on Monday extended the pre-arrest bail of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) General Secretary Humayun Khan and its provincial President Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha till July 12.
The two PPP leaders were accused of setting fire to a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protest camp on Khyber Road.The case was heard by Additional District and Sessions Judge Peshawar, Ismatullah Wazir.
During the proceedings, the petitioners were represented by Gohar Rehman Khattak, who argued that the first information report (FIR) was politically motivated and filed in retaliation for participating in a peaceful protest against the provincial government.
The counsel maintained that his clients were peaceful citizens and political activists exercising their constitutional right to protest. He told the court that instead of upholding this right, police responded to the protest with baton-charge and teargas shelling, and later registered criminal cases against the PPP leaders.
Speaking to the media after the hearing, Humayun Khan said that the PPP had successfully faced such cases in the past and would do so again. “The FIR was lodged against us for participating in the ‘Save the Province’ movement. This is nothing but political victimization,” he said.
He added that the PPP would continue to raise its voice against injustice and exploitative systems at every platform.Humayun Khan emphasized that the PPP would not back down
from its commitment to defending the rights of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“We will not be intimidated by false and baseless cases. We have never bowed before political revenge and we never will,” he stated. He praised the party workers for remaining peaceful during the protest despite what he described as the “brutal response” of the provincial government. “Whenever there is injustice, the workers of the PPP are the first to raise their voices,” he said.

Budget approval process: QWP says PTI fostering uncertainty in KP,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324242-budget-approval-process-qwp-says-pti-fostering-uncertainty-in-kp,"PESHAWAR: Qaumi Watan Party (QWP) provincial Chairman Sikandar Hayat Khan Sherpao on Monday accused the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government of fostering uncertainty through unconstitutional and irresponsible behaviour in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Speaking to various party delegations at the QWP Secretariat, Watan Kor, in Peshawar, Sikandar Sherpao said that public anxiety and confusion had intensified in the wake of the recent provincial budget approval process, which he alleged was manipulated through political blackmail by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
He termed the budget’s approval based on the endorsement of a single individual as “unconstitutional” and an “insult to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”According to him, the provincial government was using the budget as a political bargaining tool, putting the future of the province at stake.
Sikandar Sherpao noted that the government changed its stance and hastily indicated its intention to pass the budget once it realized its political maneuvering had failed and its grip on power was weakening.
He reiterated that the PTI’s priorities were not aligned with the needs or interests of the province, but rather focused on protests and pressure tactics to seek the release of their party founder.
The QWP leader criticized the PTI’s style of governance, stating it had caused “irreparable damage” to the
province and its people. “Due to PTI’s poor governance, the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are being deprived of their rights,” he said.
Sikandar Sherpao added that corruption, nepotism, and financial mismanagement had become rampant under the incumbent PTI government. “The province has turned into a hub of corruption, with new scandals surfacing almost daily which is a clear reflection of bad governance,” he added.

Govt urged to introduce uniform power tariff,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324244-govt-urged-to-introduce-uniform-power-tariff,"MANSEHRA: A Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) local office-bearer on Monday urged the federal government to introduce a uniform electricity tariff structure to ease the financial burden on both domestic and commercial consumers.
“A consumer who slightly exceeds 200 units ends up paying multiple times more in electricity bills, which is unjust. This system must be reformed to provide relief to people already struggling with financial hardship,” Salauddin Khan, told reporters here.
He said that PMLN President Nawaz Sharif had initiated major development projects in the past to combat poverty and steer the country toward prosperity.“The current electricity tariff, which increases sharply after consumption exceeds 200 units, should be brought in line with the lower slab rates to ensure fairness,” he added.
Salauddin said that the PMLN had promised to reduce high electricity tariffs during the 2024 general elections campaign to provide meaningful relief to the public.“We are optimistic that the government will deliver on this promise and revise the tariff structure,” he said.
The PMLN office-bearer asked the government to end prolonged and unscheduled loadshedding in the district in such a sizzling heat wave, as people, particularly children and the elderly ones, were suffering from different ailments.

Police break up protest by govt employees,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324245-police-break-up-protest-by-govt-employees,"PESHAWAR: Police used baton charge and fired tear gas shells on Monday to break up a large protest by government employees who had gathered near the KP Assembly building to demand better salaries and the resolution of other issues.

Rupee weakens as tensions loom in Middle East,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324145-rupee-weakens-as-tensions-loom-in-middle-east,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee declined on Monday as investors were worried about volatility in global oil prices and assessed its impacts on the country’s inflation and external account outlook amid rising tensions in the Middle East.
The rupee closed at 283.87 against the U.S. dollar in the interbank market, down 0.06% from the previous close of 283.70. In the open market, the rupee traded at 285.89 per dollar, compared with the previous close of 285.73.
Tensions escalated sharply in the Middle East following the US attack on Iran’s nuclear sites over the weekend. Investors were cautious, awaiting possible retaliation from Iran, which had threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz -- a vital maritime route through which over 20 per cent of the world’s oil supply flows.
According to a Reuters report, Brent crude futures rose by 16 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $77.17 a barrel on Monday. Meanwhile, US West Texas Intermediate crude increased by 14 cents, or 0.2 per cent, to $73.98 a barrel.
Saad Hanif, head of research at Ismail Iqbal Securities, said that the rupee is currently facing mild downside pressure, trading around Rs284/USD, primarily due to rising oil prices and concerns regarding the external account.
“However, strong remittance inflows, improving reserves, and IMF programme support are helping stabilise the currency. In the near term, a gradual depreciation towards Rs290-300 is
likely, but no sharp collapse is expected unless external shocks worsen significantly,” Hanif added.
For Pakistan, any sustained rise in oil prices poses significant macroeconomic risks. As a net importer of energy, higher oil prices can widen the current account deficit, exert pressure on the rupee and push inflation higher, said Chase Securities in a note.
“Given the sizable weight of fuel in the CPI basket, a 10 per cent increase in oil prices generally translates into a 0.4 per cent to 0.6 per cent rise in headline inflation. This may limit the central bank's room to pursue monetary easing in the near term,” it said.
Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $1.8 billion during the 11 months of the fiscal year ending in June, in contrast to a deficit of $1.6 billion in the same period last year.
The SBP forecasts the current account to remain in surplus for fiscal year 2025. Despite weak net financial inflows so far, the SBP anticipates that its foreign exchange reserves will increase to approximately $14 billion by the end of June 2025. It said the external outlook remains vulnerable to several risks, primarily arising from heightened geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in international oil prices, potential negative impacts of proposed budget measures and possible shortfalls in anticipated financial inflows.
Tresmark reported on Saturday that the increasing difficulty in accessing dollars created noticeable anxiety in the currency markets. On Friday, the interbank rate closed at 283.7, while importers were quoted between 284.25 and 284.5. Meanwhile, open market selling rates were around 285.7. Interestingly, banks were offering Rs1-2 higher rates for remittances, likely to boost their remittance numbers.

"Tankers U-turn, zig-zag, pause around Strait of Hormuz",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324146-tankers-u-turn-zig-zag-pause-around-strait-of-hormuz,"SINGAPORE: At least two supertankers made U-turns at the Strait of Hormuz following US military strikes on Iran, shiptracking data shows, as more than a week of violence in the region prompts vessels to speed, pause, or alter their journeys.
Washington’s decision to join Israel’s attacks on Iran has stoked fears that Iran could retaliate by closing the strait between Iran and Oman through which around 20 per cent of global oil and gas demand flows.
That has spurred forecasts of oil surging to $100 a barrel.Disruption is already evident, with tankers avoiding spending more time than needed in the strait, industry sources said.
Singapore-based Sentosa Shipbrokers said that over the past week, empty tankers entering the Gulf are down 32 per cent while loaded tanker departures are down 27 per cent from early May levels.
The Coswisdom Lake, a very large crude carrier (VLCC), reached the strait on Sunday before making a U-turn and heading south, Kpler and LSEG data showed. On Monday it turned back again, resuming its journey towards the port of Zirku in the United Arab Emirates.
The South Loyalty, also a VLCC, made a similar U-turn and remained outside the strait on Monday, LSEG data showed. It was scheduled to load crude from Iraq’s Basra terminal, according to Kpler data and two shipping sources.
The Coswisdom Lake was scheduled to load crude at Zirku for delivery to China. It was chartered by Unipec, a
trading arm of China’s state-run Sinopec, LSEG and Kpler data showed.Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Shipowners will try to minimise time that vessels spend inside the Strait of Hormuz due to the conflict, KY Lin, spokesperson at Taiwan’s Formosa Petrochemical Corp. “Vessels will only enter the region when it is nearer to their loading time,” he said on Monday.
Japanese shipping firms Nippon Yusen and Mitsui OSK Lines said on Monday they continue to transit the strait but have instructed their vessels to minimise time spent in the Gulf.
Several oil traders and analysts told Reuters that they had been warned to expect possible shipping delays as vessels wait for their turn outside the area.Iran’s parliament on Sunday approved a measure to close the strait, Iran’s Press TV reported, but any such move would require approval from the Supreme National Security Council.Iran has threatened to close the strait in the past but has never done so.

Oman moves to become first Gulf state to impose personal income tax,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324147-oman-moves-to-become-first-gulf-state-to-impose-personal-income-tax,"DUBAI: Oman issued a royal decree to become the first country in the Gulf to impose a personal income tax, its tax authority said on Sunday, as the small oil producer works to diversify its revenue stream.
Oman, among the smaller Gulf economies, launched a medium-term fiscal programme in 2020 to reduce public debt, diversify revenue sources and spur economic growth, which has improved public finances.
The sultanate, which still remains largely reliant on oil revenue, will impose a five per cent tax on taxable income for individuals earning over 42,000 Omani rials ($109,091) per year starting from 2028, according to the decree.
“The law also includes deductions and exemptions that take into account the social situation in the Sultanate of Oman, such as education, healthcare, inheritance, zakat, donations, primary housing,” the country’s tax authority said in a statement.
According to the state-run Oman News Agency (ONA), the plan also contributes to the objectives of Oman Vision 2040 by diversifying income sources and reducing reliance on oil revenues, with targets of 15pc of GDP by 2030 and 18pc by 2040.
The Gulf country added that the tax would apply to about 1pc of the population.The Omani tax authority stated that the implementation of the tax “follows an in-depth study assessing its economic and social impact, based on income data from various government entities”, according to ONA.
Meanwhile, observers said that the introduction of income tax signalled
economic maturity.“That the rate is competitive internationally will ensure that Oman remains a country of choice for international professionals,” said David Daly, a partner at Gulf Tax Accounting Group, speaking to Gulf publication The National.

Port Qasim cuts charges by 50% for exporters,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324148-port-qasim-cuts-charges-by-50pc-for-exporters,"KARACHI: The Port Qasim Authority (PQA) has announced a 50 per cent reduction in port charges for exporters, in line with the government’s reform agenda aimed at enhancing trade and driving economic growth.
The announcement was made during a strategic roadmap meeting of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, chaired by Federal Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Monday.Addressing the meeting, Chaudhry reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting local entrepreneurs and boosting domestic trade through the development of ports and fisheries.
He noted that the reform agenda in the maritime sector -- including the reduction of port charges at Port Qasim -- demonstrates the government’s resolve to facilitate business, promote trade, and foster economic progress in coastal regions.
The minister also announced plans to establish an aquaculture industrial zone to stimulate commercial activity in the marine and aquaculture sectors.In addition, Pakistan’s first-ever marine and aquaculture policy is expected to be introduced soon. The policy will offer a comprehensive framework for the sustainable development of marine resources and aquaculture.
The meeting also reported notable achievements by the marine fisheries department, which has met its annual export target of $410 million through fisheries and aquaculture exports. Meanwhile, the ship recycling industry has generated Rs6 billion in revenue.
Chaudhry stressed the importance of
aligning with global green shipping initiatives to minimise environmental impact and promote sustainable maritime practices.He further highlighted the government’s focus on modernising port infrastructure, streamlining customs processes and cultivating a business-friendly environment to improve the country’s competitiveness in global trade.The Ministry of Maritime Affairs, he added, is actively pursuing reforms to unlock the economic potential of the country’s extensive coastline and maritime resources.

"Levy on furnace oil likely to cut local demand, spur exports, say analysts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324149-levy-on-furnace-oil-likely-to-cut-local-demand-spur-exports-say-analysts,"KARACHI: The imposition of petroleum and carbon levies on furnace oil (FO) is expected to reduce domestic demand and increase exports in the upcoming fiscal year, according to analysts.
The government has proposed to introduce both a carbon levy (CL) and a petroleum levy (PL) on FO from July 1 in a bid to curb excessive fossil fuel use and raise additional funds for green energy initiatives.
This marks the first time a combined levy of Rs79.5 per litre will be imposed on FO -- comprising Rs77 per litre in PL and Rs2.5 per litre in CL.“Industry will continue using FO as an emergency fuel while gradually shifting towards renewable sources of power,” said Farhan Mahmood, an analyst at Sherman Securities. He said the impact on listed companies is likely to be limited, as many have already moved to coal and solar-based energy. The cement sector, which is highly energy-intensive, sees power costs make up around 15 per cent of production costs.
The levies are expected to raise the price of FO by around Rs85,000 per tonne (a 57 per cent increase), taking it to approximately Rs235,000 per tonne. This may dampen FO demand within the country. The government expects to collect Rs75 billion in revenue from the new charges.
FO consumption in FY25 is projected at around 0.9 million tonnes (950 million litres), down from 1.2 million tonnes in FY24. Over the past three years (FY23-FY25), Pakistan’s FO consumption has declined sharply -- by an average of 40 per cent per annum.
A decade
ago, Pakistan’s FO consumption stood at around 9.2 million tonnes, with the power sector being the primary consumer, as FO accounted for nearly 35 per cent of the electricity generation mix. Today, that share has dropped to just 1.5 per cent, with coal and LNG having replaced FO in the energy mix.
Local refineries currently produce about 2.5 million tonnes of FO annually, while exports total around 1.5 million tonnes. FO is largely a declining product, primarily used as bunker fuel in shipping, and global demand is limited.
The industrial and power sectors together account for 99 per cent of domestic FO consumption. In both cases, FO is used primarily as a backup fuel. Industries lacking grid connectivity or alternative energy sources rely heavily on FO, particularly during power outages.
At present, electricity generation using FO costs around Rs25 per kWh -- a figure expected to rise to Rs40-42 per kWh following the levies.Regarding the power sector, Mahmood said the levies would have minimal impact on grid electricity tariffs, since FO accounts for just 1.5 per cent of the power mix.
He added that a decline in FO sales is unlikely to affect oil marketing companies (OMCs), given FO’s minimal contribution to their revenue. However, the impact on refineries could be significant, as FO makes up around 24 per cent of their production mix.
In FY25, local refineries are expected to produce 2.5 million tonnes of FO, while domestic consumption is estimated at just 0.9 million tonnes.Mahmood said refineries may now prioritise exporting surplus FO as domestic demand continues to weaken. Otherwise, they may be forced to cut throughput or temporarily halt operations, adversely affecting earnings.“Even if surplus volumes are exported, gross refining margins (GRMs) could come under pressure, as FO typically sells at a discount in export markets,” he added.

PYMA calls for simpler textile duties,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324150-pyma-calls-for-simpler-textile-duties,"KARACHI: Chairperson of the Pakistan Yarn Merchants Association (PYMA) Muhammad Saqib Goodluck has raised concerns over the duty structure and policy ambiguities in the federal budget for the financial year 2025-26, warning that these measures are adversely affecting the textile sector, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
In a formal submission to the government and the anomaly committee, the PYMA chairperson called for the urgent redressal of key issues that, he said, undermine transparency, competitiveness and the long-term viability of the domestic textile industry.
He noted that the budget lacks clear policy differentiation between commercial and industrial imports. While industrial imports are subject to a 1.0 per cent income tax, commercial imports face a significantly higher rate of 3.5 per cent. Based on PYMA’s calculations, the overall duty differential between the two categories -- including sales tax value addition -- is around 5.5 per cent. Goodluck argued that this gap is not justified, particularly in light of the administrative burden and resulting market distortions. He added that earlier consultations had created a mutual understanding that both sectors would be treated equitably.
Goodluck also highlighted that draw textured yarn (DTY) of polyester (HS Code: 5402.3300) is already subject to an average anti-dumping duty of 13.84 per cent, imposed by the National Tariff Commission (NTC) on June 17, 2025.
Given this existing protection for the domestic industry, the PYMA considers any continuation or imposition of additional regulatory duties on DTY to be unjustified. The association has strongly recommended that the regulatory duty on DTY be reduced to zero.
On the issue of customs duties, the PYMA chairperson pointed to structural imbalances in the duty regime. Both raw materials such as polyester filament yarn (PFY) and grey fabrics are subject to a 10 per cent duty, while bleached or finished textile products attract a 15 per cent duty. This cascading duty structure, he argued, disproportionately affects core segments of the value chain -- such as knitting, weaving, twisting and finishing -- particularly hurting SMEs. The PYMA urged the government to rationalise duties across all fabric types (finished, semi-finished and grey), which currently bear a flat 15 per cent duty, in order to justify a fair polyester value chain structure.Goodluck emphasised that timely resolution of these issues is critical for ensuring a stable, transparent and globally competitive textile sector.

Climate resilience conference urges action in Sindh,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324151-climate-resilience-conference-urges-action-in-sindh,"KARACHI: A provincial conference on climate change and disaster resilience was held in Karachi on Monday, bringing together stakeholders from government departments, academia, civil society, media, UN agencies, and the development sector.
Organised under the ECHO-funded Building Institutional Capacity and Resilience Against Natural Disasters (BRAND) project, the event aimed to strengthen local climate resilience and disaster preparedness across Sindh, one of Pakistan’s most climate-vulnerable provinces.
Hosted by CESVI Pakistan in partnership with Welthungerhilfe (WHH), the Fast Rural Development Program (FRDP), and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Sindh, the conference provided a crucial platform to present findings, exchange best practices and chart forward-looking strategies to integrate climate-smart approaches in policy and practice.
A key highlight of the event was the official launch of a pioneering research study titled ‘Climate-Smart Agriculture as a Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy in Vulnerable Regions of Sindh, Pakistan: A Multi-District Comparative Analysis’. Developed by leading academic researchers headed by Dr Aziz Talpur, the study demonstrates how the adoption of climate-smart agricultural techniques can mitigate disaster risks, strengthen food security, and foster
sustainable rural development in hazard-prone districts of Sindh.
During the technical sessions, the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s Chief Meteorologist Ameer Hyder presented an in-depth climate projection for Sindh, outlining emerging challenges such as increasing temperatures, worsening water scarcity and erratic rainfall patterns. These stressors, participants noted, are likely to severely impact agriculture, livelihoods, and public health in the province.
Country Director of Welthungerhilfe Aisha Jamshed highlighted the strategic importance of the gathering. “This conference marks an important milestone in our collective journey to integrate climate resilience into disaster risk reduction frameworks. The evidence shared today reaffirms that investing in climate-smart agriculture is not only a sustainability imperative but also a practical solution to protect lives, livelihoods, and ecosystems in Sindh,” she said.
Echoing this sentiment, Shayan Shah, director of operations at PDMA Sindh, reaffirmed the provincial government’s commitment to implementing data-backed climate strategies. “Sindh is on the frontlines of climate change, and strengthening local resilience is critical. The partnership between government institutions, NGOs and academia demonstrates how data-driven, community-rooted strategies can shape long-term policy and planning for a safer, more climate-resilient province,” he said.
Sessions led by the Sindh Environment, Climate Change, and Coastal Development Department underscored the disproportionate impacts of climate change on agriculture-dependent and marginalised communities. A panel discussion titled ‘Innovating for Resilience: Climate-Smart Solutions and DRR in Agriculture and Food Systems’ explored innovations in water conservation, soil health, resilient crop development, and agri-tech applications. Speakers called for scaling up pilot initiatives and increasing investment in climate-smart technologies across at-risk districts.

Pakistan faces higher risks than neighbours amid Iran-Israel tensions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324152-pakistan-faces-higher-risks-than-neighbours-amid-iran-israel-tensions,"LAHORE: Pakistan faces graver and more complex risks from a potential Iran-Israel war than India or Bangladesh, owing to its geostrategic location, economic fragility, sectarian makeup and reliance on Gulf economies.
Unlike India and Bangladesh, Pakistan shares a 900-km border with Iran. Any escalation -- be it airstrikes, refugee inflows, smuggling, or acts of sabotage -- could directly impact border security in Balochistan and strain the country’s already stretched law enforcement agencies.
Pakistan’s significant Sunni and Shia populations further heighten its exposure. Any conflict involving Iran -- whether with Israel, the Gulf, or the US -- risks triggering sectarian violence, protests, or proxy activity on Pakistani soil. Iran-backed or inspired elements may become active, particularly in urban centres and Balochistan.
The country’s dependence on remittances, jobs and financial assistance from Gulf states such as the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Qatar adds another layer of vulnerability. A broader regional conflict could disrupt these inflows -- critical to Pakistan’s current account -- and threaten energy imports. While India and Bangladesh also rely on the Gulf, Pakistan’s historical, ideological and military linkages leave it more exposed to political or diplomatic fallout.
Compounding these risks is
Pakistan’s precarious economic position. The country is grappling with IMF-mandated reforms and resurgent inflation after a period of temporary stability. Fuel prices are rising, and food inflation is under acute pressure. A prolonged conflict that drives up global oil prices or disrupts trade routes would hit Pakistan harder than India’s more diversified economy or Bangladesh’s relatively stable currency and reserves.
Pakistan has also historically served as a theatre for proxy conflicts. Renewed hostilities in the region could once again see its territory exploited for intelligence and counterintelligence operations. In contrast, India and Bangladesh maintain tighter internal security control.
While all three countries would suffer economic spillovers, particularly through oil markets, Pakistan’s risks extend beyond the financial -- into internal unrest and cross-border volatility. Its exposure is therefore deeper and more multidimensional.
Managing such a complex risk landscape will be a formidable challenge. Pakistan must reinforce national security and strengthen border management -- particularly along the Iran-Pakistan frontier. Additional Frontier Corps and intelligence personnel should be deployed in Balochistan to deter proxy infiltration, smuggling, and arms or drug trafficking. Drone surveillance and fencing should be expanded where feasible.
The government must also prepare for economic shock absorption. Targeted subsidies or fuel hedging mechanisms should be considered to cushion global oil price shocks, especially in transport and agriculture. Policymakers should accelerate the shift towards compressed natural gas (CNG) and renewables to reduce reliance on imported fuel.
Strategic reserves of food and fuel should be built up in anticipation of supply disruptions. Pakistan should engage the IMF and friendly governments to negotiate contingency financial support, including a temporary relaxation of fiscal targets if inflation or import bills worsen.
Domestically, intelligence efforts must be ramped up to monitor sectarian outfits, foreign-funded networks, and sleeper cells. Diplomatic coordination with Iran and Gulf states is essential to counter cross-border threats.
The state must also enhance financial surveillance (including FATF compliance) to detect suspicious transfers and track seminaries or organisations receiving external funding from Iranian or Gulf-linked sources.
Pakistan must navigate the crisis with neutrality, cohesion and fiscal prudence. It cannot afford to be drawn into regional rivalries or ideological alliances. The goal should be to contain spillovers while quietly positioning itself as a stabilising actor in a turbulent region -- at a time when global powers increasingly seek mediators rather than military allies.

BISP proposes skills partnership with KCCI,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324153-bisp-proposes-skills-partnership-with-kcci,"KARACHI: Director General of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) Sindh Zulfiqar Ali Shaikh has proposed that the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) under the Benazir Hunarmand Programme.
The proposed agreement aims to facilitate collaboration on demand-driven skills training, endorsement of certified training institutions, and joint efforts to ensure the success of the initiative.
“We want to establish a robust mechanism in which the business community guides us on labour market requirements, enabling BISP beneficiaries to receive relevant training, gain employability and become self-reliant,” said Shaikh, speaking during a meeting at the KCCI on Monday.
The DG noted that while 10 million families across Pakistan -- including 2.7 million in Sindh -- benefit from BISP, reliance on cash stipends is not sustainable. “As poverty continues to rise, our approach must evolve. A partnership with the KCCI could be transformative by linking vulnerable households to economic opportunities,” he said. Such a collaboration, he added, would not only improve livelihoods but also help address skilled labour shortages in the industrial and manufacturing sectors.
Additional Secretary BISP Dr Tahir Noor noted that the government has allocated Rs720 billion to
the programme this year, with Rs13,500 in stipends being distributed to women in eligible households. However, with an estimated 45 per cent of the population now living below the poverty line, a shift in approach is critical.
Dr Noor emphasised the need for the KCCI’s support in identifying real-time labour market demand in Karachi, endorsing reputable training institutes, and helping integrate trained individuals into the workforce. “This isn’t just about reducing dependency on stipends -- it’s about creating productive citizens who contribute to the economy,” he remarked.
Earlier, KCCI President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani welcomed the BISP delegation and extended full support for the proposed collaboration. He called for strict oversight to ensure that BISP funds are utilised efficiently and reach only those most in need. Speaking on the Benazir Hunarmand Programme, he said: “We fully support this initiative because it aims to break the cycle of poverty. Providing skills instead of permanent aid is the right way forward.”

Amazon’s premium beauty push may be a buffer against Trump’s tariffs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324154-amazon-s-premium-beauty-push-may-be-a-buffer-against-trump-s-tariffs,"NEW YORK: Amazon’s defence against tariffs for its coming Prime Day? Luxury goods.US President Donald Trump’s tariffs have spurred some Amazon sellers who source products from China and other heavily tariffed countries to bow out of the company’s Prime Day, one of its biggest sales events of the year, to protect their margins.
Amazon Prime Day is now a four-day shopping event exclusively for Amazon Prime members, taking place this year from July 8 to July 11.The Seattle-based e-commerce company is hoping that recent sales growth in high-margin cosmetics in its Amazon Premium Beauty category will cushion the impact of tariffs on Prime Day sales revenue and consumer sentiment.
“Beauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers’ minds,” even in hard financial times, said Anna Mayo, vice president of NielsenIQ’s Beauty Vertical unit.
Amazon Premium Beauty was initially shunned by luxury cosmetic players who feared the platform would harm their image when it was launched in 2013. But those days are gone. Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including Estee Lauder’s Clinique, Olaplex and L’Oreal’s Urban Decay.
During last year’s Prime Day event, US shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11 per cent year-over-year, according to Adobe
Analytics. Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods.
This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have “milder” discounts of 10 per cent to 17 per cent, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14 per cent to 22 per cent off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights.
That, coupled with the ease of shipping small packages of most products, means that Amazon Premium Beauty merchandise has higher margins than other products sold on Prime Day.Amazon “doesn’t make a huge margin in most of the categories of stuff that it sells online,” said Renee Parker, co-founder of consultancy firm Invinci and a former Amazon executive. “They are making a lot of money on premium beauty products because ... (they’re) small and expensive, and you can ship a ton of them.” Vitamins and supplements are successful for similar reasons.
Amazon Premium Beauty sales gathered steam after the e-commerce giant began clamping down on counterfeits and top beauty companies needed new ways to reach customers, said Alfonso Emanuele de Leon, a beauty industry veteran and partner at FA Hong Kong Consultancy.
Amazon was previously viewed as a pariah by luxury beauty brands because of the cheap merchandise on the website, but is no longer perceived that way, said Emanuele de Leon.
‘HUGE ACCELERATION’
Sales at Amazon Premium Beauty rose by nearly 20 per cent to $15 billion between April 2024 and April 2025, outpacing the 14 per cent growth for beauty products outside the specialized e-commerce store, according to NielsenIQ. It also outpaced the year-over-year growth of 5.0 per cent for online store sales in the first quarter, NielsenIQ said.
L’Oreal Chief Executive Nicolas Hieronimus said during the company’s annual meeting in April that having products on Amazon led to a “huge acceleration” in expanding its US market share. Estee Lauder has launched 11 brands on Amazon’s US site since March 2024. More than 75 per cent of Estee’s finished goods sold in the US originate from the US or Canada and are therefore protected by existing trade agreements, Roberto Canevari, Estee Lauder’s global supply chain executive vice president, said at a conference in June.
Lauren Gordon, vice president of Amazon at Estee Lauder, said that Prime Day and Amazon’s other “high-traffic shopping moments” give the company a chance to “attract both new and existing customers”.
Melis del Rey, general manager for health and beauty for Amazon US stores, said her team has been “very proactive” in working with premium brands to determine tariff impacts. “At a high level, most of the premium brands’ sourcing strategies are local, and therefore, the (tariff) impact is less imminent,” del Rey said.
Amazon Premium Beauty is an invite-only programme for brands shipped and sold by Amazon and third-party sellers. The department has grown to more than 10,000 products, and brands' eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis. Brands like Dyson and Estee Lauder’s Aveda pay an extra 15 per cent commission to Amazon for every website sale, and the third-party seller approach allows major brands to control pricing and inventory.
Adding prestige brands including Unilever’s Dermalogica has helped the company compete with beauty retailers Ulta Beauty and Sephora, which is owned by LVMH, and also attract older, higher-income shoppers at a time when TikTok Shop is scooping up younger customers.

"Pakistan, China sign deal to recognise engineering qualifications",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324156-pakistan-china-sign-deal-to-recognise-engineering-qualifications,"KARACHI: Pakistan and China have signed a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) that will allow reciprocal recognition of professional engineering qualifications, a step expected to boost workforce mobility, service exports and bilateral cooperation in high-tech sectors.
The agreement, finalised between the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) and the Chinese Society of Engineers (CSE), enables engineers from both countries to obtain provisional licensure without additional examinations, provided they hold accredited four-year degrees and are registered with their respective national bodies.
PEC Chairperson Engr Waseem Nazir described the deal as a “vote of confidence in Pakistan’s engineers”, adding that it would open global doors for young professionals, strengthen foreign exchange earnings through services exports and enhance Pakistan’s soft power, particularly within Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) member countries. The agreement was signed by PEC Secretary Dr Nasir Mahmood Khan and CSE Deputy Secretary-General Zhang Bin, with senior representation from both sides including CSE President Wan Gang and former president of World Federation of Engineering Organisations Gong Ke.
Under the agreement, Pakistani engineers will be able to participate in infrastructure, energy, ICT and smart-city projects in China, while adhering to local
regulations, ethical codes, and professional standards. A joint PEC-CSE working group will oversee credential verification, continuous professional development programmes, and engineer exchange opportunities, with an annual review mechanism to ensure compliance.
The deal is expected to benefit thousands of Pakistani engineers by enabling them to pursue licensure and project roles in China and other Belt and Road partner countries. Officials also foresee a positive impact on foreign remittances, as qualified engineers working abroad contribute to Pakistan’s external accounts. Beyond economic gains, officials say the agreement enhances the global visibility of Pakistani engineering talent and affirms the country’s ability to meet international standards.

Ten-man Real Madrid show class in Pachuca win,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324175-ten-man-real-madrid-show-class-in-pachuca-win,"CHARLOTTE: Real Madrid shrugged off an early red card to defeat Mexico’s Pachuca 3-1 and take a big step towards the knockout stage of the Club World Cup on Sunday.
The result leaves Madrid, under new head coach Xabi Alonso, on top of Group H with four points while Pachuca are eliminated after two defeats. Saudi club Al Hilal, who held Real in their opener, face second-placed Salzburg later on Sunday.
The Spanish giants were in trouble after just seven minutes when Raul Asencio was shown a straight red card after he pulled down Salomon Rondon with the Venezuelan clear on goal. That left the Liga MX team sensing the chance for an upset in front of 70,248 fans at the home of the NFL’s Carolina Panthers.
Pachuca quickly went close when Brazilian Kenedy saw a shot parried out by Thibaut Courtois and the Belgian keeper did brilliantly to deny Alan Bautista’s follow up shot. But Real were able to get a grip on the game in midfield and slow the pace down, limiting opportunities for Pachuca. It was a superbly worked team goal that provided the breakthrough for Madrid in the 35th minute.
Gonzalo Garcia’s clever flick released Fran Garcia down the left and he looked inside to Jude Bellingham who took the ball in his stride and then buried a left-foot shot into the corner. Two minutes before the break Real doubled their advantage
when Trent Alexander-Arnold drilled a low cross in from the right and Arda Guler collected Gonzalo’s deft lay-off and fired home.
Pachuca created a pile of chances after the break, peppering Courtois’s goal, but the Belgian was up to the task denying Brazilian substitute John Kennedy and efforts from Rondon and Bryan Gonzalez.
Javier Eduardo Lopez missed the best opportunity for the Mexican side, firing wide after some sloppy defending from Madrid. The outcome was put beyond doubt in the 70th minute when Federico Valverde slid the ball home after a smart exchange with Brahim Diaz.
Pachuca finally got some reward for their determined effort when Elias Montiel’s shot on the turn was deflected off Aurelien Tchouameni and flew past the wrongfooted Courtois. Alonso, who tasted victory for the first time as Real coach, praised the way his team handled the early setback.
“We had to be defensively, for almost all the game with one player less and it became really intense for us, but we defended with a lot of sacrifice and solidarity which is what it takes,” he said.
“We waited for our chances, so I was really pleased with the performance with a player less,” he added. The Real coach said he was pleased to see his team’s ability to change plan during a game. “We want to have the culture that we understand situations, the structure, the context and we understand what it takes in each moment, with strong principles.
“I think that game intelligence gives you another edge and today I am pleased how they understood the quick change in the cooling break that we had,” he added. Pachuca coach Jaime Lozano said his team had failed to make the most of the extra man.
“We had a great start, (but) we did not make the most of our advantage. They have the strongest players in the world and their players were amazing. Their strongest feature is that they don’t need to play at their best to win any match, they were amazing,” he said.

IHC dismisses petition challenging PTF elections,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324176-ihc-dismisses-petition-challenging-ptf-elections,"KARACHI: The Islamabad High Court has dismissed the writ petition of M Asif Dar against Pakistan Tennis Federation’s elections, stating that the petitioner has no locus standi and PTF does not fall within the definition of a person or authority subject to writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution.
This was stated by Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, the judge, in his order. However, he stated, that “any person aggrieved by the election process may approach the Pakistan Sports Board in accordance with its Constitution for appropriate relief”.
According to details, former Secretary PTF Asif Dar filed a writ petition (No. 1105-2024) with the IHC and challenged the results of the elections of the federation held on February 2, 2024, contending that same were conducted without lawful authority and are of no legal effect.
He also prayed for the fresh elections of the PTF after notification of the relevant regulations, in accordance with the earlier order of this court passed in writ petition (No. 2524/2022).
It is worth adding here that the same court while hearing the writ petition (No.2524/2022) directed on July 18, 2022 that no election of any National Sports Federation shall take place until the Election Commission is notified under the Pakistan Sports Board Constitution, 2022.
However, contrary to the direction of this court and the advice of the PSB the PTF issued a schedule and conducted elections on February 10, 2024, which have been challenged through
the instant petition.
Meanwhile, Assistant Attorney General, along with officials from the PTF and the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, submitted that the elections were conducted in accordance with applicable rules and the results were duly notified.
They further argued that the petitioner lacked locus standi (the right or capacity to bring an action or to appear in a court) to challenge the said elections, as he had failed to demonstrate any prejudice to his justiciable legal rights.
It was submitted that the petitioner did not fall within the category of an “aggrieved person” under Article 199 of the Constitution and was in fact litigating on behalf of a losing candidate, who was not even a party to the proceedings.
Interestingly, this aspect was confronted to the petitioner during hearing, where he candidly admitted that he was not a candidate in the previous elections and that no personal legal right of the petitioner had been affected.
Thus, the court order mentioned that “it is a settled principle that under Article 199 of the Constitution, this Court may only issue directions to persons or institutions performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province, or a local authority.
“The Pakistan Tennis Federation, however, is not a statutory body; it has not been established by or under any statute. It is a private, nonprofit organization registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, and functions autonomously under its own Constitution.
“The PTF is not substantially funded or controlled by the Government of Pakistan; rather, bulk of its functions is independently carried out and is privately funded. Therefore, the PTF does not qualify as a body amenable to judicial review under Article 199 of the Constitution”.

Minjee Lee wins Women’s PGA Championship for third major title,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324177-minjee-lee-wins-women-s-pga-championship-for-third-major-title,"LOS ANGELES: Australian Minjee Lee fired a gritty two-over-par 74 to win the Women’s PGA Championship on Sunday, capturing her third major title by three strokes on another demanding day in Frisco, Texas.
The 29-year-old from Perth added the title to her 2021 Evian Championship and the US Women’s Open title she won in 2022, finishing with a four-under-par total of 284. American Auston Kim and Thailand’s Chanettee Wannasaen tied for second on on one-under 287. “A lot of patience out there today,” said Lee, who started the day with a four-shot lead after a brilliant, bogey-free round on Saturday but had three bogeys in her first six holes.
“I just felt like some shots were going my way and some shots weren’t,” Lee said. “I just said stick to my game plan. It was a battle against myself pretty much, especially with how tough the conditions were this whole week -- not just today, just amplified today because it’s a major Sunday.”

USA scrape past Haiti in Gold Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324178-usa-scrape-past-haiti-in-gold-cup,"LOS ANGELES: The United States wrapped up their CONCACAF Gold Cup group phase campaign with a nervy 2-1 victory over minnows Haiti in Texas on Sunday.
Mauricio Pochettino’s side had already made sure of their place in the quarter-finals after opening Group D with wins over Trinidad and Tobago, and Saudi Arabia. However the Gold Cup hosts were fortunate to preserve their 100 percent start to the tournament with a lacklustre performance at the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.
PSV Eindhoven midfielder Malik Tillman fired the USA into the lead in the 10th minute, cleverly steering a header from Brenden Aaronson’s cross back across goal past Haiti goalkeeper Johny Placide.
But Haiti stunned the hosts with an opportunistic equaliser in the 19th minute after a blunder by USA goalkeeper Matthew Freese. There appeared to be little danger when defender Tim Ream covered a speculative ball forward and calmly rolled a pass to Freese on the edge of his six-yard box.

"Thunder beat Pacers in game seven, cap stunning season with NBA crown",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324179-thunder-beat-pacers-in-game-seven-cap-stunning-season-with-nba-crown,"Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma City Thunder crowned a dazzling season with an NBA title on Sunday, pulling away relentlessly in the second half to beat the Indiana Pacers 103-91 in game seven of the NBA Finals.
Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 29 points and handed out a career playoff high 12 assists and the Thunder’s swarming defense finally proved to much for a Pacers team that lost talisman Tyrese Haliburton to a leg injury just seven minutes into the contest.
The underdog Pacers hung tough and held a 48-47 lead at halftime, but the Thunder out-scored them 34-20 in the third quarter and pushed the lead to as many as 22 points in the fourth.
“It doesn’t feel real, so many hours, so many moments, so many emotions, so many nights of disbelief,” Gilgeous-Alexander said, his voice breaking “It’s crazy to know that we’re all here. “But this group worked for it, this group put in the hours and we deserved this.”
Gilgeous-Alexander put himself among some of the game’s greats as he earned Finals Most Valuable Player honors to go with his regular-season MVP and scoring title along with his first championship.
The 26-year-old Canadian star becomes the first player since LeBron James in 2012-2013 to win both the NBA regular season MVP and Finals MVP in the same campaign. Jalen Williams
scored 15 of his 20 points in the second half and Chet Holmgren added 18 points, eight rebounds, a steal and five of the Thunder’s eight blocked shots.
A crowd of 18,203 at Paycom Center were given some tense moments as the Pacers chipped away at the deficit late, but 23 Indiana turnovers leading to 32 Thunder points were ultimately too much for the Pacers to overcome.
The Thunder, who led the league with 68 regular-season wins, captured their first title since the club’s controversial move to Oklahoma City in 2008, the franchise having won it all in 1979 as the Seattle SuperSonics.
After the Thunder failed in their first chance to close out the series in game six, Gilgeous-Alexander there was a measure of relief along with the jubilation. “Feels amazing,” he said. “So much weight off my shoulders, so much stress relieved.
“Wouldn’t want to do it with any other group in the world,” he added. “Feels so good to be a champion.” The Pacers, three-time American Basketball Association champions in the 1970s -- remain in search of a first title since joining the NBA in the NBA-ABA merger.
Haliburton, already nursing a right calf strain when the Pacers won game six to force the first Finals game seven since 2016, had scored nine points -- all on three-pointers -- when he went down as he tried to drive past Gilgeous-Alexander.
Haliburton’s right leg gave out and he sprawled forward, slapping the court in pain and disappointment. Teammates gathered around him before he was helped off the court and to the locker room, supported and hopping on one leg with a towel over his head.
“What happened with Tyrese, all of our hearts dropped,” Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said, adding that Haliburton was in the locker room at halftime “and he was very much a part of a group that believed that they could do this.”
In his absence, the Pacers dug in. Down by three after the first quarter, they grabbed a 48-47 lead on Andrew Nembhard’s step-back three-pointer with 4.3 seconds left before halftime. In a first half that featured 10 lead changes, the three-point shot was an early difference-maker for the Pacers, who connected on eight of 16 from beyond the arc in the first half, but had just three after the break.
The Thunder struggled early from long range, but Gilgeous-Alexander made his first three-pointer of the night with 8:16 left in the third, Holmgren followed with a trey and Jalen Williams added another -- the quick 9-0 run giving Oklahoma City a 65-56 lead that set the stage for the rest of the game.
“We had 24 minutes to go get it -- we had 24 minutes to finish our season,” Gilgeous-Alexander said of the Thunder’s mindset coming out for the third. Carlisle said the Pacers just weren’t good enough in the third quarter. “That quarter was the killer,” he said, but he praised his team’s effort in the fourth. “There was no surrender,” Carlisle said. “It was all defiant fight until the end.” Bennedict Mathurin led the Pacers with 24 points off the bench. Pascal Siakam and T.J. McConnell added 16 points apiece and Nembhard scored 15.

Pakistan shock Qatar to storm into Nations Cup final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324180-pakistan-shock-qatar-to-storm-into-nations-cup-final,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday marched into the final of the AVC Nations Cup Volleyball with a stunning straight set win over highly-ranked Qatar in the semi-finals in Manama (Bahrain) Monday.

With this victory, Pakistan has not only qualified for the AVC Nations Cup final but also reaffirmed its status as one of the rising powers in Asian volleyball.

Pant piles on agony for England with record-breaking century,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324181-pant-piles-on-agony-for-england-with-record-breaking-century,"LEEDS: Rishabh Pant became the first India batsman to score hundreds in both innings of a Test against England as the tourists strengthened their grip on the series opener at Headingley on Monday.
The swashbuckling wicketkeeper, who made 134 in the first innings, completed a 130-ball century, including 13 fours and two sixes on the fourth afternoon. He was out for 118, caught by Zak Crawley off the bowling of Shoaib Bashir.
Pant’s dismissal ended a stand of 195 with KL Rahul that started with the match in the balance when India were 92-3 in their second innings. India, however, were 298-4 at tea -- a lead of 304 runs -- with opener Rahul 120 not out.
Pant is just the second wicketkeeper in Test history to score hundreds in both innings of the same match following Andy Flower’s scores of 142 and 199 not out for Zimbabwe against South Africa in 2001.
After a morning session in which India captain Shubman Gill was the only batsman dismissed, Rahul and Pant upped the tempo in their contrasting styles. Right-hander Rahul hit off-spinner Bashir for a textbook cover-drive four, while left-hander Pant nicked Josh Tongue through the vacant second slip position before thrashing him through the covers.
Pant completed an 83-ball fifty before driving Bashir for two soaring sixes in three balls. He had made 75 when he hammered a Bashir delivery to short cover where diving England captain Ben Stokes did well to get a hand to the ball as he tried to complete what would have been a sensational catch.
An England
attack missing express quicks Mark Wood and Jofra Archer was largely powerless to stop the run spree as Rahul and Pant took advantage of the old ball on a good batting pitch. Rahul completed a 202-ball century featuring 13 fours with a trademark cover-drive -- his ninth century in 59 Tests.
Pant, severely injured in a life-threatening car crash in December 2022, was stuck in the 90s before a quick single took him to a 130-ball century featuring 13 fours and two sixes. India great Sunil Gavaskar, watching from the stands, encouraged Pant to mark this century with the familiar somersault with which he had marked his first-innings hundred, but this time Pant celebrated in more conventional style.
India are strongly placed in the game, with the outstanding Jasprit Bumrah, the world’s top-ranked Test bowler, leading their attack. But England chased down 378 -- their record successful chase -- against a Bumrah-led India attack at Edgbaston three years ago.
And the tourists will now want to avoid a repeat of what happened in their first innings at Headingley. Hundreds from Gill, Pant and Yashasvi Jaiswal put them on course for a total well in excess of 500, but they were dismissed for 471 after losing their last seven wickets for just 41 runs. England mustered 465 in reply, with Ollie Pope making 106 and Harry Brook scoring 99.

"‘New-look Australia can cope without Smith, Labuschagne’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324182-new-look-australia-can-cope-without-smith-labuschagne,"SYDNEY: Travis Head said Monday Australia were experienced enough to cope as they prepare for their first Test without Steve Smith or Marnus Labuschagne since 2018. An out-of-form Labuschagne has been dropped for the opening Test against the West Indies in Barbados this week, while fellow batting stalwart Smith is nursing an injured finger.
Sam Konstas and Josh Inglis, who have only played two Tests each, compared to the combined 175 of Smith and Labuschagne, replace them. But Head said he was not concerned. “They (Smith and Labuschagne) are still around the squad, so it still feels similar at the moment in the build-up,” he told reporters in the West Indies.
“Getting into the game will be a little bit of a new look, but it’s guys who have already played, guys with experience already in a short amount of Test match cricket.” Not since the Boxing Day Test against India in 2018 -- when Smith was serving a year-long ban for ball-tampering -- have Australia fielded a Test team without either him or Labuschagne.
Labuschagne has played 53 consecutive Tests, according to Cricket Australia, while Smith’s streak stood at 51. Konstas is expected to open at Kensington Oval with Usman Khawaja -- a role Labuschagne filled in the recent World Test Championship final -- with Inglis coming in anywhere from three to six.
Head, who usually bats at number five, said the team were prepared for any scenario. “As a batter, you’re planning for anything at the moment and then once we get
a look at the lay of the land, we’ll come up with a plan,” he said.

Pakistan trio make it to Asian Snooker pre-quarterfinals,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324183-pakistan-trio-make-it-to-asian-snooker-pre-quarterfinals,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s cueists continued their fine form at the Asian 6-Red Snooker Championship 2025 in Colombo, with all three players — Awais Ullah Munir, Muhammad Asif, and Muhammad Sajjad — securing spots in the pre-quarterfinal stage.
Defending champion Awais Ullah Munir maintained a perfect record, winning all three group matches. His latest triumph came against India’s Pushpender Singh in a tightly contested 4–2 battle, highlighted by breaks of 66, 35, and 31.

Muhammad Sajjad has also won both of his matches, including a commanding 4–0 victory over Sri Lanka’s Badurdeen Mohamed Musarra, which featured a fluent 58 break. His final league match was scheduled for the late evening against Malaysia’s Lim Kok Leong.
The group phase, featuring 32 players from 13 nations, will determine the top two players from each group who advance to the knockout rounds.

Ray of hope for Pakistan to get into Pro League,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324184-ray-of-hope-for-pakistan-to-get-into-pro-league,"ISLAMABAD: A glimmer of hope has emerged for Pakistan’s return to elite-level hockey, as the prospects of featuring in the upcoming season of the prestigious FIH Pro League remain alive, despite the heartbreak of losing the Nations Cup final to New Zealand.
In a dramatic turn of events, reports from New Zealand suggested that the Blacksticks’ participation in the Pro League was hanging by a thread due to a severe financial crunch. The New Zealand Hockey Federation is reportedly struggling to arrange sufficient funding to support the men’s team full-year campaign in the Pro League. With hockey still considered an amateur sport in the country, the financial burden on players and federation alike appears unsustainable.
“A crucial meeting between New Zealand hockey officials and government representatives is scheduled for next month, which is expected to decide the fate of the Blacksticks’ participation in the 2025-26 Pro League,” a well-placed source told The News.
“Initial feedback from sports authorities in New Zealand indicates a reluctance to commit funds for the team’s full-season travel and participation. A final verdict is expected within the next 20 days.”
If New Zealand officially withdraws and notifies the FIH of their inability to compete, the vacant slot is likely to be offered to Pakistan -- runner-up in the Nations Cup. According to FIH policy, the next-in-line team earns the right to fill any
vacated position in the league. This could pave the way for Pakistan’s surprise re-entry into one of the world’s most competitive international hockey tournaments.
While the possibility of participating in the Pro League has sparked fresh optimism, uncertainty continues to cloud Pakistan’s next confirmed international assignment -- the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in India in August-September this year.
Given the strained political climate, it appears unlikely that the Pakistan government would allow the national team to travel across the border. However, Indian hockey authorities are said to be exploring the option of shifting the event to a neutral venue, acknowledging Pakistan’s presence as vital for the tournament’s credibility and competitiveness. No official decision has been announced as yet.
Looking ahead, Pakistan are also set to take part in the crucial World Cup qualifying round in February 2026. The International Hockey Federation (FIH) is expected to confirm the venue in the upcoming months.

Shaheen leads Lahore Qalandars’ UK trophy tour ahead of trials,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324185-shaheen-leads-lahore-qalandars-uk-trophy-tour-ahead-of-trials,"LAHORE: Lahore Qalandars have announced plans to hold overseas trials in the United Kingdom (UK) and collaborate with English county clubs through exchange programmes, aimed at nurturing young Pakistani talent and expanding franchise visibility beyond borders.
“This initiative will help young players gain international exposure and open doors not only to the Qalandars but potentially to other franchises as well,” said COO Sameen Rana at a special trophy celebration held at the Pakistan High Commission in London. “It’s time to broaden our horizons and integrate with overseas cricketing systems for the long-term benefit of Pakistan cricket.”
The announcement came during a historic UK trophy tour by the reigning Pakistan Super League (PSL) champions and led by captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, who brought their silverware across continents to include overseas players and diaspora fans in their celebrations. Hosted by Pakistan High Commissioner Dr Mohammad Faisal, the event honored England-based Qalandars stars Sam Billings and Tom Curran, who missed the PSL 10 final due to travel restrictions.
The event also served to strengthen ties with the Pakistani diaspora in the UK. “We wanted to include our passionate UK fanbase and thank the community for their continued support,” said Atif Rana. “This isn’t just about celebrating a win, it’s about building bridges through cricket.”
Shaheen Afridi, who led Lahore Qalandars to their
third PSL title in four years, highlighted the franchise’s core values. “What sets Qalandars apart is our player development program and our deep bond with every team member,” he said. “Sam and Tom couldn’t be in Lahore for the final, so we brought the celebration to them.”
Billings and Curran, visibly touched by the gesture, praised the inclusive spirit of the team. “Sameen and Shaheen create a very special environment, it’s rare to find such care and chemistry,” said Billings. Curran added, “From the very start, it felt like home.”

Under the umbrella of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA), the event was hosted by the Islamabad Olympic Association (IOA).

"IOC is in ‘best of hands’, says Bach as he hands over to Coventry",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324187-ioc-is-in-best-of-hands-says-bach-as-he-hands-over-to-coventry,"LAUSANNE: Kirsty Coventry became the president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the most powerful person in sport, on Monday in a handover ceremony with her predecessor Thomas Bach.
The Zimbabwean is the first woman and African to head the body and at 41 the youngest since Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who is credited with founding the modern-day Olympics.
Coventry accepted the Olympic key from Bach, who like her is an Olympic champion -- he won a team fencing gold in 1976 and she earned two swimming golds in 2004 and 2008.
Stepping down after a turbulent 12-year tenure, Bach expressed his confidence that the Olympic movement was “in the best of hands” and Coventry would bring “conviction, integrity and a dynamic perspective” to the role.
Coventry, who swept to a crushing first-round victory in the election in Greece in March, leans heavily on her family.  Aside from her parents, who were present at the ceremony in Lausanne, there is her husband Tyrone Seward, who was effectively her campaign manager, and two daughters, six-year-old Ella, who Bach addresses as “princess”, and Lily, just seven months old.
“Ella saw this spider web in the garden and I pointed out how it is made, and how strong and resilient it is to bad weather and little
critters,” said Coventry, who takes over officially at midnight Swiss time Monday (2200 GMT).
“But if one little bit breaks it becomes weaker. That spider web is our movement, it is complex, beautiful and strong but it only works if we remain together and united.”  Coventry said she could not believe how her life had evolved since she first dreamt of Olympic glory in 1992.
“How lucky are we creating a platform for generations to come to reach their dreams,” she said to a packed audience in a marquee in the Olympic House garden, which comprised IOC members, including those she defeated, and dignitaries.
“It is amazing and incredible, indeed I cannot believe that from my dream in 1992 of going to an Olympic Games and winning a medal I would be standing here with you to make dreams for more young children round the world.”
Coventry, who served in the Zimbabwean government as sports and arts Minister from 2019 to this year, said the Olympic movement was much more than a “multi-sport event platform.”
“We (IOC members) are guardians of this movement, which is also about inspiring and changing lives and bringing hope,” she said. “These things are not to be taken lightly and I will be working with each and every one of you to continue to change lives and be a beacon of hope in a divided world.
“I am really honoured to walk this journey with you.” Bach, who during his tenure had to grapple with Russian doping and their invasions of the Crimea and Ukraine as well as the Covid pandemic, said he was standing down filled with “gratitude, joy and confidence” in his successor.
“With her election it sends out a powerful message, that the IOC continues to evolve,” said the 71-year-old German, who was named honorary lifetime president in Greece in March. “It has its first female and African to hold this position, and the youngest president since Pierre de Coubertin. She represents the truly global and youthful spirit of our community.”
Bach, who choked back tears at one point during his valedictory speech, was praised to the rafters by Coventry, who was widely seen as his preferred candidate of the seven vying for his post.
After a warm embrace she credited him with teaching her to “listen to people and to respect them,” and praised him for leading the movement with “pure passion and purpose.” “You have kept us united through the most turbulent times. “You left us with many legacies and hope, thank you from the bottom of my heart for leading us with passion and never wavering from our values.”

UK moves to ban protest group Palestine Action,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324261-uk-moves-to-ban-protest-group-palestine-action,"LONDON: The UK government announced on Monday it would ban campaign group Palestine Action under anti-terror laws following a “disgraceful attack” on Britain´s largest air force base last week.
The group denounced the proposed ban, announced by interior minister Yvette Cooper, as an “unhinged reaction” and its supporters scuffled with police in central London as they protested the move.
On Friday, Palestine Action activists broke into the RAF Brize Norton base in southern England, raising questions about security at the site and embarrassing Prime Minister Keir Starmer´s Labour government.
A video posted by the group showed two activists spraying a plane with red paint while roaming the base on scooters. Counter-terror police are investigating the incident. Cooper said the vandalism at the base was “the latest in a long history of unacceptable criminal damage” committed by the group since it formed in 2020.
“In several attacks, Palestine Action has committed acts of serious damage to property with the aim of progressing its political cause and influencing the government,” Cooper said in a statement. She announced she would lay a draft order before parliament next Monday that would ban the group under Britain´s Terrorism Act of 2000. Labour holds a massive majority in parliament, meaning the proposal
should pass easily.

Beijing issues weather warning for hottest days of year,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324262-beijing-issues-weather-warning-for-hottest-days-of-year,"BEIJING: Beijing residents sought shade and cooled off in canals on Monday as authorities issued the second-highest heat warning for the Chinese capital on one of its hottest days of the year so far.
China has endured a string of extreme summers in recent years, with heatwaves baking northern regions even as parts of the south have seen catastrophic rain and flooding. Authorities in the city of 22 million people urged the public to take precautions, with temperatures expected to peak at around 38 degrees Celsius (100 degrees Fahrenheit) on Monday.
“It´s been really hot lately, especially in the past few days,” intern Li Weijun told AFP on Monday afternoon. The 22-year-old said he had stopped wearing formal clothes to work and delayed his daily exercise until after 10:00 pm to stay safe.
“I think it´s related to climate change, and maybe also to the damage done to nature,” he said. An orange heat warning -- the second-highest in a three-tier system -- was issued on Monday as officials encouraged people to limit outdoor activity and drink more fluids to avoid heatstroke.
Construction workers should “shorten the amount of time consecutively spent at labour”, while elderly, sick or weakened individuals ought to “avoid excessive exertion”, according to the guidelines. Zhang Chen, 28, said she carried an umbrella outdoors to prevent sunburn.

Serbia’s president announces halt to ammunition exports,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324263-serbia-s-president-announces-halt-to-ammunition-exports,"BELGRADE: Serbia on Monday announced a halt in all exports of ammunition, after renewed Russian criticism of sales and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.
President Aleksandar Vucic said the exports, which were reportedly worth over $1.6 billion in 2023, had been redirected to the national military stockpile. “We have now stopped literally everything and are sending it to our army,” he told reporters.
“We´re not exporting anything. Everything is stopped. Everything is stopped, and from now on, there must be special decisions for anything to go forward,” he added. The defence ministry later confirmed the stoppage of “weapons and military equipment produced in Serbia” and that all exports will need authorisation from the ministries and National Security Council.
Israel and Iran are both allies of Belgrade, as is Russia, and the suspension is a sign of an increasingly difficult balancing act for Vucic. Russia´s foreign intelligence service restated criticism that Serbian ammunition exports had ended up aiding Ukraine.
It first claimed in May that hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Serbian ammunition has indirectly reached Kyiv via contracts with third countries. Vucic told journalists the suspensions would hit employment in Serbia but added: “Where should we export? I cannot to Asia, cannot to Africa, I cannot to Europe, I cannot to America.

UN worried about Afghans leaving Iran to return home,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324264-un-worried-about-afghans-leaving-iran-to-return-home,"UNITED NATIONS, United States: Thousands of Afghans are leaving Iran because of the war with Israel and heading home, even as their own country grapples with a humanitarian crisis, the United Nations said Monday.
Because of new immigration policies in Iran regarding Afghans, more than 600,000 Afghans have returned home so far this year, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, told the UN Security Council.
“Given the concerning developments in the region, the UN agencies are preparing for potential cross-border movement from Iran. Returns from Iran alone in the past few days have been over 10,000 per day,” she said.

"Germany against suspending EU deal with Israel, says official",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324266-germany-against-suspending-eu-deal-with-israel-says-official,"BERLIN: Germany does not support calls to suspend a pact governing Israel’s relations with the European Union, a government official said on Monday, highlighting divisions within the bloc.
There has been deepening concern in European capitals in recent months about Israel’s military operations in Gaza and the humanitarian situation in the enclave.
Spain’s foreign minister said earlier on Monday he would ask the EU council to approve an immediate suspension of the EU-Israel Association agreement in protest over what he called human rights violations in Gaza.
The bloc’s diplomatic service also said on Friday that Israel may have breached its human rights obligations in Gaza and the West Bank under the deal. Israel rejected that report as a “moral and methodological failure”.
“Our position is very clear - we do not support either a suspension or a partial suspension,” the official said at a German government briefing. As such an upcoming EU summit will involve intense discussions about Iran and Israel but is unlikely to result in any decisions, the official said.
Germany has long followed a policy of special responsibility for Israel, known as the Staatsraeson, due to the legacy of the Nazi Holocaust, and been much slower during the current conflict to criticize Israel for its conduct than other EU states.

Greece declares emergency on Chios over wildfires,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324267-greece-declares-emergency-on-chios-over-wildfires,"ATHENS: Greece put the Mediterranean island of Chios under a state of emergency on Monday because of major fires that have raged since the weekend.
Civil Protection Minister Ioannis Kefalogiannis said the decision was made so the authorities could “immediately take the necessary measures”. Government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis called on island residents to exercise “the greatest caution” and follow official instructions.
Chios, in the northern Aegean Sea, is Greece´s fifth-largest island and is currently facing five separate fire outbreaks. Some 190 firefighters, 38 vehicles, 12 helicopters and four water-bombers have been deployed, the fire service said. Kefalogiannis, who travelled to the island, said strong winds, estimated at force six on the Beaufort Scale were making the situation “very difficult”.
Reinforcements were being deployed, he told Greek news site iEidiseis. “If the wind dies down a bit we might be able to get this fire under control,” he said.
“But the wind really hasn´t dropped.” On Sunday, hundreds of asylum seekers were forced to move from a reception centre while seven villages were evacuated on Monday.
Island authorities feared the fire was dangerously close to fields of valuable mastic trees, whose aromatic sap is used in making chewing gum, alcoholic
drinks and pharmaceuticals.

"EU, Canada sign defence and security deal in rearm push",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324268-eu-canada-sign-defence-and-security-deal-in-rearm-push,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: Canada and the European Union on Monday signed a defence and security pact as the transatlantic partners seek to better confront Russia, with worries over US reliability under President Donald Trump.
The deal was announced after a summit in Brussels between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and EU chiefs Ursula von der Leyen and Antonio Costa.
“While Nato remains the cornerstone of our collective defence, this partnership will allow us to strengthen our preparedness... to invest more and to invest smarter,” Costa, who heads the European Council representing EU member states, told a press conference. “It opens new opportunities for companies on both sides of the Atlantic.”
The pact seeks to bring Canada´s defence industry more closely into European efforts to revamp the domestic industrial base.
It opens the door for Ottawa to join common procurements under a recently approved 150-billion-euro ($174-billion) loan programme backed by the EU´s central budget to boost rearmament.
It also paves the way for Canadian defence firms to tap into the scheme, although that requires the signing of a separate deal. The EU said the pact would deepen cooperation in areas including crisis management, defence industry collaboration, hybrid threats and military mobility.
Britain signed a similar defence partnership in May, and Australia and the EU announced they had started negotiating another one last week.
The signing comes on the eve of a Nato summit where allies,
which include Canada and 23 of the EU´s 27 nations, are due to sign off on a ramped-up defence spending target of five percent of GDP.
The pledge is seen as key both to satisfying Trump -- who has threatened not to protect allies spending too little -- and helping Nato build up the forces it needs to deter Russia.
Carney said the deal with the EU will help Canada “deliver on our new requirements for capabilities more rapidly and more effectively”. At a time of international instability, Canada was looking to diversify and strengthen its international partnerships, he added.
“We turn first and foremost to our most reliable allies, those who share our values of democracy, freedom and sovereignty,” he said. Ottawa, which is yet to meet the current 2 percent Nato target having spent 1.4 percent of GDP on defence in 2024, buys much of its military equipment from the United States.
But relations have soured under Trump, who has repeatedly called for Canada to become the 51st US state and announced tariffs on its exports. The EU is Canada´s second-biggest commercial partner. Bilateral trade in goods was worth 75.6 billion euros in 2024, up 64 percent since 2017, when a free-trade agreement provisionally entered into force.

Indian activists seek to save child brides,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324269-indian-activists-seek-to-save-child-brides,"BEED, India: When wedding season comes in India, the phone of child rights activist Tatwashil Kamble never stops ringing with appeals to stop girls from being married off due to poverty.
Kamble said he has helped stop thousands of illegal marriages in India, where nuptials before the age of 18 are banned. “The elders of the village think: ´How dare we come to stop a marriage in their village!´” said Kamble, who has been campaigning for more than a decade in western Maharashtra state.
Many families are motivated by poverty to marry off their daughters, so that the girls can start earning their own living. When activists have sought to stop marriages, “it has led to physical altercations”, according to Kamble.
Sometimes they are able to stop the nuptials from taking place, or, if they arrive too late, then the bride is taken to a shelter and supported in deciding on her own future. India accounts for one in three of the world´s child brides, according to the UN children´s agency, with at least 1.5 million girls getting married each year.
Kamble said he is driven by the bitter memory of seeing a teenager die of blood loss during labour. “That´s when I thought: so many young girls are getting married and, even after their death, it´s not being called child marriage. They are saying ´the mother has died´” without acknowledging she was a girl.
Kamble works in the Beed district of Maharashtra, an area
dominated by sprawling sugarcane fields hit hard by years of drought. Workers said they have little choice but to marry their daughters off young -- arguing they do it to protect the girl, not harm her.
“It is not like we don´t like the idea of education,” said Manisha Barde, a sugarcane cutter who was a child bride herself. “We want her to become a doctor.” Barde, however, arranged for her teenage daughter to be married only to be stopped by authorities.
She did so because they were poor and, if they had “better jobs, we wouldn´t have thought of her marriage”. Farm labourers said that when their children are little, relatives look after them or they come to the fields.
But when the girls become teenagers, their parents begin to worry -- either that they could start a relationship before marriage, or be subjected to sexual violence.
“There are very few girls who stay unmarried until 18,” said Ashok Tangde, district chief of the child welfare committee. “I have seen girls who have never seen a school,” he said.
Families worry for “the girl´s safety”, Tangde said, and even those opposed to child marriage can end up organising a wedding. Tangde said his team received 321 calls from across the district about child marriages that were taking place, or about to happen, in the first five months of this year.

Greenpeace joins protests against gala Bezos wedding in Venice,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324270-greenpeace-joins-protests-against-gala-bezos-wedding-in-venice,"VENICE: Global environmental lobby Greenpeace added its voice on Monday to protests against this week’s celebrity wedding in Venice between American tech billionaire Jeff Bezos and journalist Laura Sanchez.
The event, expected to attract some 200 guests including US President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as scores of stars from film, fashion and business, has been dubbed “the wedding of the century”.
But some locals see the celebration as the latest sign of the brash commodification of a beautiful but fragile city that has long been overrun with tourism while steadily depopulating. Activists from Greenpeace Italy and UK group “Everyone hates Elon” (Musk) unfolded a giant banner in central St Mark’s Square with a picture of Bezos laughing and a sign reading: “If you can rent Venice for your wedding you can pay more tax.”
Local police arrived to talk to activists and check their identification documents, before they rolled up their banner. “The problem is not the wedding, the problem is the system. We think that one big billionaire
can’t rent a city for his pleasure,” Simona Abbate, one of the protesters, told Reuters.
Mayor Luigi Brugnaro and regional governor Luca Zaia have defended the wedding, arguing that it will bring an economic windfall to local businesses, including the motor boats and gondolas that operate its myriad canals. Zaia said the celebrations were expected to cost 20-30 million euros ($23-$34 million).

Embattled Thai PM reshuffles cabinet as crisis rages,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324271-embattled-thai-pm-reshuffles-cabinet-as-crisis-rages,"BANGKOK: Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra began a cabinet reshuffle on Monday as a political and judicial crisis sparked by a leaked phone call threatens to sink her government.
The 38-year-old daughter of controversial former premier Thaksin Shinawatra began handing out ministerial posts vacated when her main coalition partner quit last week -- a move that nearly took her government down.
Paetongtarn, in office for less than a year, is hanging on by a thread, and on top of the party horse-trading she now faces a Constitutional Court case that could see her barred from office.
She faced calls to quit or call an election last week as critics accused her of undermining the country and insulting the army during the leaked call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen, which focused on a festering border dispute. The conservative Bhumjaithai party quit the governing coalition led by Paetongtarn´s Pheu Thai party over the call, leaving it with a wafer-thin majority.
But the crisis stabilised as other coalition partners said they would stay, and Pheu Thai secretary general Sorawong Thienthong told AFP on Monday that all 10 remaining parties were sticking with the government.
“None of the other parties are pulling out -- the remaining parties are staying united with the government,” Sorawong said. “The prime minister has discussed the reshuffle with other political leaders.”

Earth’s satellites at risk if asteroid smashes into Moon: study,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324272-earth-s-satellites-at-risk-if-asteroid-smashes-into-moon-study,"PARIS: If a huge asteroid smashes into the Moon in 2032, the gigantic explosion would send debris streaming towards Earth that would threaten satellites and create a spectacular meteor shower, according to researchers.
Earlier this year there were briefly fears that the 60-metre-wide asteroid called 2024 YR4, which is big enough to level a city, would strike Earth on December 22, 2032.
It was given the highest chance -- 3.1 percent -- of hitting our home planet that scientists have ever measured for such a giant space rock.
Subsequent observations from telescopes definitively ruled out a direct hit on Earth. However, the odds that it will crash into the Moon have risen to 4.3 percent, according to data from the James Webb space telescope in May.
A new preprint study, which has not been peer-reviewed, is the first to estimate how such a collision could affect Earth.
It would be the largest asteroid to hit the Moon in around 5,000 years, lead study author Paul Wiegert of Canada´s University of Western Ontario told AFP. The impact would be “comparable to a large nuclear explosion in terms of the amount of energy released”, he added.

Syria announces arrests over Damascus church attack,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324273-syria-announces-arrests-over-damascus-church-attack,"DAMASCUS: Syrian authorities on Monday announced arrests over a suicide blast targeting a church blamed on the Islamic State group, as President Ahmed al-Sharaa vowed those involved in the “heinous” attack would face justice.
The shooting and suicide bombing on Sunday at the Saint Elias church in the working-class Dwelaa district of the Syrian capital killed 25 people and wounded 63, the health ministry said.
The Islamist authorities who took power after ousting longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December said the attacker was affiliated with the Islamic State group, which has not yet claimed the attack.
The interior ministry reported the arrest of “a number of criminals involved in the attack” and the seizure of explosive devices and a booby-trapped motorcycle during a security operation near Damascus “against cells affiliated with the Daesh (IS) terrorist group”.
The announcement came hours after Sharaa vowed authorities would “work night and day, mobilising all our specialised security agencies, to capture all those who participated in and planned this heinous crime and bring them to justice”.
The attack follows incidents of sectarian violence in recent months, with security one of the greatest challenges
for the new authorities. The attack “reminds us of the importance of solidarity, and unity of the government and the people in facing all that threatens our nation´s security and stability”, Sharaa said. The attack was the first suicide bombing in a church in Syria since the country´s civil war erupted in 2011, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor.

"E.coli can turn plastic into painkillers, chemists discover",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324274-e-coli-can-turn-plastic-into-painkillers-chemists-discover,"PARIS: Scientists have found a way to use the bacteria E.Coli to convert plastic waste into a popular painkiller, a study said on Monday, though outside experts doubted the technique would make a dent in the fight against plastic pollution.
Paracetamol, which is one of the most commonly used drugs worldwide, is made from the derivatives of fossil fuels, often by Asia-based subcontractors using cheap, polluting methods that contribute to climate change.
The world is also facing an escalating crisis of plastic pollution, with countries set for another bruising round of negotiations in August in the hope of sealing an international treaty to reduce plastic waste.
The British team of researchers behind the new study sought to find a solution to the two problems by roping in a third -- E.coli, which is normally known for making people sick when they eat contaminated food.
First the chemists used a molecule derived from PET plastic, which is used in bottles and many other plastic products the world over, to spark a chemical reaction in a strain of E.coli. By genetically modifying the bacteria, the chemists were able to transform their molecule into acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol.

"Greece to deploy frigates off Libya to curb increased migrant flows, PM says",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1324275-greece-to-deploy-frigates-off-libya-to-curb-increased-migrant-flows-pm-says,"ATHENS: Greece will deploy two frigates and one more vessel off Libya’s territorial waters to deter migrants from arriving at its southern islands of Crete and Gavdos, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Monday.
Mitsotakis did not elaborate on the role of the vessels or explain what they would do, but said the move would be in coordination with Libyan authorities and the rest of the European forces operating in the area.
Sea arrivals from northeastern Libya of migrants trying to cross to Europe mainly from the Middle East and North Africa, including war-torn Sudan, have surged in recent months. More than 800 migrants have tried to reach Greece’s southern islands since Thursday.
Mitsotakis told Greek President Constantine Tassoulas that the issue was discussed during a national security and defence council on Sunday and that the situation was alarming.
“I have asked the defence minister... to ensure that Greek Navy vessels are deployed off Libya’s territorial waters to pre-emptively ... send a message that traffickers will not command who enters our country,” he said.
The three ships, including a support vessel would leave Greece in next coming days,
two government officials with knowledge of the issue told Reuters.
Greece has been a favoured gateway to the European Union for migrants and refugees from the Middle East, Africa and Asia since 2015 when nearly 1 million people landed on its islands, causing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Since then migrant flows from Turkey have dropped significantly.
