Police break up Nigeria protest after deadly attack,"US
.
Nigerian police fired tear gas to disperse protesters in the central city of Makurdi on Sunday as anger mounted over the killing of at least 45 people by gunmen in a nearby town.
Gunmen attacked the village of Yelewata on Friday night in a region that has seen a surge in violence.
Police fired tear gas to break up a protest by thousands of people, witnesses said, as demonstrators called on Benue state's governor to act swiftly to halt the cycle of violence.
""The protesters were given specific time by the security to make their peaceful protest and disperse,"" Tersoo Kula, the governor's spokesperson, told AFP.
John Shiaondo, a local journalist, said he was covering the ""peaceful protest"" when the police moved in and started firing tear gas.
""Many people ran away for fear of injuries, and I also left the scene for my safety,"" he told AFP.
Joseph Hir, who took part in the protest, said people were protesting the continued killings in Benue when the police intervened.
""We are not abusing any one, we are also not tampering with anybody's property, we are discharging our rights to peacefully protest the unabated killings of our people, and now the police are shooting tear gas at us,"" he told AFP.
Kula confirmed 45 deaths in Friday's attack, though residents said the toll could exceed 100.
Amnesty International also put the death toll at more than 100.
The rights group called the attack ""horrifying"", saying it ""shows the security measures (the) government claims to be implementing in the state are not working"".
Pope Leo XIV also condemned the killings during his Sunday prayer in Rome, calling it a ""terrible massacre"" in which mostly displaced civilians were murdered with ""extreme cruelty"".
Nigeria's federal government has yet to issue a statement on the attack.

Afghan imports temporarily exempt from certificate,"US
Special exemption granted for specific goods including cotton, beans, coal, and soapstone
Negotiations between customs authorities and traders have proved successful, resulting in a temporary exemption for the Certificate of Origin requirement on Afghan imports until June 30.
According to Customs Collector Azood Mehdi, productive discussions were held with a delegation representing traders regarding the mandatory Certificate of Origin for goods imported from Afghanistan.
The Collector clarified that under Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) regulations, the certificate is a legal requirement for all Afghan imports.
However, a special exemption has been granted for specific goods, including cotton, beans, coal, and soapstone.
A total of 667 cargo vehicles carrying these items had been halted at the Torkham border due to the absence of the required documentation.
These consignments will now be allowed clearance upon submission of a written affidavit, in lieu of the certificate, valid until June 30.
After the deadline, all Afghan imports must be accompanied by the Certificate of Origin without exception.
Traders have welcomed the temporary relief and expressed their gratitude to the customs authorities for the flexibility and cooperation.

Shortage of water – myth or reality,"RO
Dearth of water for industry can prove to be biggest growth choke-point
Shortage of water is now posing an existential threat to Pakistan in multiple dimensions. The widespread protests we observed in Sindh a few weeks back regarding six canals are just one example. The more serious dimension of the issue can be observed by Pakistan's unequivocal declaration that India's implementation of its recent absolutely illegal intimation of putting the Indus Waters treaty in abeyance would be considered as an act of war.
Both the above reactions make complete sense, when we realise that per capita freshwater availability in Pakistan has declined from 5,260 cubic metres in 1951 to around 900 cubic metres and is projected to decrease to 560 cubic metres by 2050.
What further accentuates its significance is the fact that, while the global average for the annual utilisation of freshwater is 70% for agriculture, though for Europe it is only 40%, in Pakistan it is 93%. The disproportionate consumption reflects nothing else except wastage. Also, its alarmingly diminishing availability for the industry can prove to be the biggest choke-point for industrial growth.
Agricultural use
While rising ambient has increased water evaporation and transpiration, our cropping strategy has proven to be a more potent culprit. Sugarcane and cotton alone account for at least one-third of the aggregate consumption by the agricultural sector. What adds to the injury is that Pakistan's crop water productivity for sugarcane is around 53.5% lower than the global average. For rice, with one-third of the global average, it is even worse.
Irrigated agriculture, which is generally considered to be a luxury vis-a-vis rain-fed farming, provides 90% of Pakistan's food, while the global average is 40%. Despite the operational convenience it provides, we have failed to utilise it effectively so far. Irrigation system in Pakistan, rather, is a major source of wastage. Some 25% of water is lost till the farm gate, followed by the loss of 30% of the remaining water till its application at the crop root.
The ingress of poor farming practices is so pervasive that it has left no aspect unaffected. For instance, almost half of upper Sindh's irrigated land is now affected with water logging and salinity. While the increase in ambient is aggravating the issue of salinity, seepage from unlined watercourses and cultivation through water inundation keep on making more land hostage to water-logging.
In my view, the current system of billing the water use in agriculture, called Abiana system, majorly contributes to the above rampant utter extravagance of water. Instead of per unit usage, it is based on the area being cultivated, thus providing least incentive for the user to save it. Also, the state succeeds in recovering only a fraction of what is billed. Thus, what is ultimately collected barely covers 10% of the maintenance costs for water channels.
The ""water use efficiency"", ie, the value created in USD/cubic metres of water used, is the most common yardstick for assessing a country's performance regarding its water economy. As per the UN records, for Pakistan, China, Israel and India, its overall value, respectively, stands at 1.84, 31.21, 128.94 and 3.13, while for agriculture for the same countries in the same order, it stands at 0.40, 2.51, 2.06 and 0.49. For Switzerland, the overall value is 432 and for agriculture it is 5.95.
The numbers say everything about the steep uphill journey required to be traversed by us. No wonder that our foreign exchange spending on food-related imports has already grown by around five times during the past 20 years.
Industrial use
Rapid urbanisation is increasing the per capita demand for freshwater while increasing urban waste continues to pollute it. As a result, the size of the global water and wastewater treatment market is expected to reach twice of its current size of $350 billion by 2034; a reflection of the growth of circular economies.
In Pakistan, we have so far not observed any such signs. This is despite the fact that out of the total industrial consumption, 49% goes to the textile sector and only few textile manufacturers treat their effluent before dumping it. In Faisalabad, the textile hub of the country, around 3.6 million cubic metres of effluent water is disposed of without treatment into Chenab and Ravi.
In the above backdrop, for purchasing textiles, the EU and the US regulations are more and more focusing on mechanisms for establishing products' traceability. This includes a regime of Digital Product Passport vide which providing detailed data on the sustainability of each product is essential. Most of these regulatory filters would be fully effective by 2030 and their non-compliance can prove cataclysmic for our economy – when 60% of our textile exports are made to the US and Europe.
What is to be done
From the above observations and analysis, we can observe similar disregard for the real economic value of this natural resource, as we adopted for decades towards natural gas till we had frittered away most of its proven reserves.
The crisis of water is definitely more fundamental. In view of the same, the following steps seem essential: 1) Uninterrupted flow of water, in line with the Indus Waters Treaty, from India to Pakistan can only be ensured through effective diplomacy. This would, however, remain unsustainable, if not complemented with bilateral trade and economic relations with India and other critical countries capable of leveraging their influence in Pakistan's favour when required. The same, in turn, requires industrial development for generating value-added products for exports. 2) Kabul River contributes tangibly to the economy of K-P. Thus, to ensure a sustained and judicious use of its water, a treaty with Afghanistan needs to be initiated. 3) The present unit cost of $0.08/cubic metres of water for the textile sector is the lowest in the region; thereby, generating an attitude of indifference towards its wastage. This requires necessary price adjustment and stringent regulatory measures for wastewater treatment and water conservation including a system of penalties and rewards around the principle of circular economy. Similarly, for agriculture, volume-based water metering needs to be introduced with Abiana indexed to the same as well as the farm size and corresponding income. The current petty recovery of Abiana is a shame vis-a-vis the palatial palaces in which our feudals (owners of at least 65% of the agricultural land) live. 4) Integrated economics of water guzzling crops like cotton, sugarcane and rice versus their replacement with less water-intensive crops need to be reviewed. 5) Replacement of current practice of crop inundation with drip-feeding is imperative. 6) Investment in the wastewater treatment industry needs to be encouraged.
It goes without saying that like many other sectors, we have burnt all the margins in this respect as well; hence, delay in the implementation of the above measures is not an option.

Heatwave halts trading activities,"US
All tourist spots, parks also give deserted look throughout the day
Amid the scorching sun and intense heatwaves, an oppressive stillness gripped wholesale markets, trading centres, grain markets, and commercial bazaars across the city on Sunday. All tourist spots and parks remained deserted throughout the day due to the unbearable heat, severely affecting the businesses of stallholders.
From 10am to sunset, commercial activity in markets drastically declined. Shopkeepers were seen wiping sweat off their faces while sitting under fans blowing hot air, waiting in vain for customers.
The extreme heat also forced birds to seek refuge in flocks under thick tree canopies. With temperatures soaring between 45°C to 47°C, the skies appeared empty as even birds avoid flying.
The Citizen Action Council has appealed to residents to place water and grains in shaded areas of their balconies and rooftops to help birds survive the heat — a charitable act considered a form of ongoing charity (sadaqah jariyah) for households.
Meanwhile, the relentless heatwave, combined with scarce rainfall, has led to a drop in the underground water table, and many delicate bird species have been found dead.
The intensity of the sun has also impacted loading and unloading activities, badly affecting the working class and daily-wage labourers.
After Eidul Azha, people's purchasing power has significantly declined, and due to the heat, most avoid visiting markets during the daytime. Some citizens only venture out after sunset, but even then, business activity has plummeted. Instead of buying bulk items from wholesale markets, many now prefer purchasing small quantities from neighbourhood shops.
Meanwhile, in homes, streets, mosques, imambargahs, and churches, people have started praying fervently for rain to break the intense heat.

TikTok murder highlights Pak's unease with women online,"US
Short video app is popular, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels
Since seeing thousands of comments justifying the recent murder of a teenage TikTok star in Pakistan, Sunaina Bukhari is considering abandoning her 88,000 followers.
""In my family, it wasn't an accepted profession at all, but I'd managed to convince them, and even ended up setting up my own business,"" she said.
Then last week, Sana Yousaf was shot dead outside her house in the capital Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.
News of the murder led to an outpouring of comments under her final post — her 17th birthday celebration where she blew out the candles on a cake.
In between condolence messages, some blamed her for her own death: ""You reap what you sow"" or ""it's deserved, she was tarnishing Islam"".
Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media, where she shared her favourite cafes, skincare products and traditional shalwar kameez outfits.
TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy. But as TikTok's views have surged, so have efforts to police the platform.
Pakistani telecommunications authorities have repeatedly blocked or threatened to block the app over what it calls ""immoral behaviour"", amid backlash against LGBTQ and sexual content.
TikTok has pledged to better moderate content and blocked millions of videos that do not meet its community guidelines as well as at the request of Pakistan authorities.
After Yousaf's murder, Bukhari, 28, said her family no longer backs her involvement in the industry.
""I'm the first influencer in my family, and maybe the last,"" she told AFP.
Only 30 percent of women in Pakistan own a smartphone compared to twice as many men (58 percent), the largest gap in the world, according to the Mobile Gender Gap Report of 2025.
""Friends and family often discourage them from using social media for fear of being judged,"" said a statement from the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF).
In southwestern Balochistan, a man confessed to orchestrating the murder of his 14-year-old daughter earlier this year over TikTok videos that he said compromised her honour. In October, police in Karachi, in the south, announced the arrest of a man who had killed four women relatives over ""indecent"" TikTok videos.
These murders each revive memories of Qandeel Baloch, one of the country's first breakout social media stars whose videos shot her to fame. After years in the spotlight, she was suffocated by her brother.
Violence against women is pervasive in Pakistan, according to the country's Human Rights Commission, and cases of women being attacked after rejecting men are not uncommon.
""This isn't one crazy man, this is a culture,"" said Kanwal Ahmed, who leads a closed Facebook group of 300,000 women to share advice. ""Every woman in Pakistan knows this fear. Whether she's on TikTok or has a private Instagram with 50 followers, men show up. In her DMs. In her comments. On her street,"" she wrote in a post.
In the fifth-most-populous country in the world, where 60 percent of the population is under the age of 30, the director of digital rights organisation Bolo Bhi, Usama Khilji, says ""many women don't post their profile picture, but a flower, an object, very rarely their face"".
""The misogyny and the patriarchy that is prevalent in this society is reflected on the online spaces,"" he added. A 22-year-old man was arrested over Yousaf's murder and is due to appear in court next week.

From Imperial China to global stage,"US
Taiwan's Palace Museum charts new century
Taiwan's National Palace Museum, home to one of the world's biggest collections of imperial Chinese treasures, must expand its horizons internationally to let the ""world see Taiwan"", President Lai Ching-te said on Friday as it marked its centenary.
The museum was re-established in Taiwan in 1965 after the Republic of China government lost a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists and fled to the island in 1949, taking with them thousands of cases of antiques once owned by China's emperors, saving them from destruction during and after the revolution.
While it is a top tourist attraction, the presence of so many Chinese artefacts has over the years caused discomfort to those Taiwanese who champion the island's separate and distinct identity from China.
Speaking to inaugurate an exhibit of French impressionist and early modernist paintings from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lai said the National Palace Museum was a ""state asset"".
""The National Palace Museum not only needs to deepen its roots locally, it also needs to deepen them internationally. We need to go into the world, to let the world see Taiwan, but also to bring the world to Taiwan,"" he said at the museum, located in Taipei's foothills.
""The National Palace Museum is not only the National Palace Museum of Taiwan, but also the National Palace Museum of the world, and I believe these values should be strongly supported by the international community.""
A competing institution remains in Beijing, the similarly named Palace Museum, though the National Palace Museum is not planning any joint anniversary events with China.
Quincy Houghton, the Met's Deputy Director for Exhibitions and International Initiatives, speaking at the event with Lai, praised the close relations between the museums, including in 1996 when the National Palace Museum sent some of its collection to the Met.
""We are honoured to collaborate with the National Palace Museum on its very special centennial year,"" she said.
Works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne are on show at the National Palace Museum until mid-October. Reuters

Messi denied late winner in Club World Cup,"PL
Inter Miami were held 0-0 by Egypt's Al Ahly in the opening match of the tournament
Lionel Messi and Inter Miami were held to a 0-0 draw by Egyptian side Al Ahly on Saturday as FIFA's new 32-team tournament got off to a smooth start in front of 60,927 fans in Florida.
Messi was denied a storybook stoppage-time winner when he saw his curling shot from 20 yards out tipped on to the bar by Mohamed El Shenawy as Miami piled on the pressure in the final minutes of the game.
Al Ahly, who were cheered on by over 10,000 of their supporters, were left to rue a first-half penalty from Egypt international Trezeguet which was saved by Miami's Argentine keeper Oscar Ustari.
But the Egyptians also had El Shenawy to thank for another fine save in the dying seconds to keep out a header from Maxi Falcon as Miami pushed for three points in the Group A clash.
For organisers FIFA, who have faced heavy skepticism over the necessity for the tournament, the absence of a goal was the only disappointment on a night that delivered everything else that their president Gianni Infantino had hoped for from the opening night.
Fears of a low crowd for the opener eased as the seats in the 64,000 venue began to fill up with the stadium almost full at kick-off time.
Thousands of fans of Al Ahly, record 12 times African Champions League winner and 45-time league champions of Egypt, arrived at Hard Rock Stadium well ahead of kick-off and made their presence felt with singing and chanting.
The stadium, home to the NFL's Miami Dolphins, witnessed chaotic scenes last year at the final of the Copa America between Argentina and Colombia where fans broke into the ground after long delays to enter.
But there was an efficient filter system set up for ticket and security checks well away from the stadium perimeter and there were no signs of any problems.
Nor was there any indication of the controversial crackdown on illegal immigrants from US President Donald Trump's administration having any impact on the game in the heavily Hispanic South Florida community.
While there were no goals to celebrate, the game was far from boring with Al Ahly enjoying the better of the first half before Miami improved significantly after the break.
Al Ahly opened up Miami's defence with ease in the opening minutes of the game and Emam Ashour was denied by Ustari after being put through by Trezeguet.
Palestine international striker Wessam Abou Ali had an effort ruled out for offside in the 31st minute and then the Denmark-born forward had a fierce strike tipped over by Ustari.
The penalty came when Telasco Segovia bundled over Zizo but Trezeguet's spot kick was weak and parried out with the former Aston Villa forward unable to react fast enough to the rebound.
Miami were stronger after the break with Messi going close in the 64th minute with a free-kick which grazed the post before hitting the side-netting, tricking part of the crowd into thinking he had scored.
He nearly did in stoppage time, after a well-worked short-corner but the outstretched finger tip of El Shenawy was to deny him.
Miami face Porto in Atlanta on Thursday before returning home to face Brazil's Palmeiras on Monday and while those should be tougher tests, their Argentina coach Javier Mascherano was upbeat.
""The truth is we leave with the feeling that we could have won it in the second half. Going forward we have to do what we did in the second half, not have any fear, shed whatever baggage we had because when we play like that, we can play even with any team,"" he said.
Al Ahly's Spanish coach Jose Riveiro, who only took charge of the team for this tournament, said his team should have finished the game off in the first half.
""It's a game of mistakes. We had a decent amount of chances in the first half to put the game in a different space,"" he said before praising the team's fans.

Laughter is strictly prohibited?,"US
.
The first synonymous idea of school that comes to mind is a place of strict discipline. All the moral policing at the early stages of the growth of a child is expected to be done within the school premises. Hence, came the term 'schooling' in public discourse, meaning discipline, reproof or reprimand.
The success of educators and students is gauged by the pindrop silence in the classroom. Mentally engaged students, no doubt, show that the class is busy in the learning process. But absence of comic relief can turn teaching and learning into something insipid, boring and uninspiring.
In the mad pursuit of lesson plans, deadlines, exams, attendance and discipline, the first casualty is the loss of smiles within the school perimeter. We must not forget that the distinguished feature of Mr Chipping's teaching in James Hilton's novella, Goodbye, Mr Chips, is his humour. Students at the Brookfield School waited anxiously for Mr Chips' latest joke that would become talk of the town at the school. The students never thought of missing his class.
The educationists with a formalist approach towards education speculate that to make students laugh blurs the boundary of proprieties between an educator and his learners. Laughter encourages frankness which sooner or later ends in cheekiness among students. However, to laugh at students and with students are two diametrically opposed approaches and often the difference between the two is obliterated to mask the educators' lack of proficiency in their subjects and failure in bonding with their students.
Research has shown that students learn much more in the pleasant classroom milieu than in that where sternness prevails. Care must be taken that laughter should not be at the expense of a student's self-respect. What is learnt in untargeted humour gets etched on memory. Students don't have to memorise and revise to regurgitate in the exams.
Humour is needed to transform bland traditional decantation of knowledge into experiential learning which our education system is severely lacking in. Run-of-the-mill pedagogy promotes absenteeism among students and widens the communication gap between an educator and his students, whereas according to Victor Borge, ""Laughter is the shortest distance between two people.""
Teachers are required to act as the dispensers of information. Have we ever asked ourselves, ""Did I laugh today? Were there smiles on my students' faces? Or were there just smirks all around?"" Charlie Chaplin says, ""A day without laughter is a day wasted.""
Children are known to laugh like there is no tomorrow, but now the taunt of ""act mature"" has shrunk childhood and caused the earlier onset of adulthood anxieties. The grind of the school routine, the taxing burden of coaching centres and truckloads of homework have left students with little space for moments of reflexive delight and mirth.
The robotic routine has pushed children towards binge watching reels and shorts. It has mutated laughter from being a group enjoyment to a personal engagement, justified with the need for privacy. The universal human language of laughter, consisting of words with short vowel-like syllables ""ha-ha"", ""ho-ho"" or ""hee-hee"", is on the verge of extinction in this age of production hysteria.
Biologically speaking, a laugh makes the brain release endorphins, the body's natural pain relievers and mood boosters, which make the human mind more receptive to and retentive of learning. Laughs and smiles don't weaken the authority of teachers; rather they build trust and enhance approachability – the prerequisites for a milieu enabling students to speak their hearts out and ask questions which if remain unanswered muddle the mind. Comic relief saves students from burnouts, too.
Bereft of all zinger, quip and riposte to parry cheeky questions, the self-deprecating touché and mea culpa, however, demystify authority and burst the angelic halo of teachers, humanising their role and presence in the classroom.
Students can forget formulae, equations or grammar rules, but what they can't is the teacher who made them smile and the moments wherein they laughed away the stress of the school grind. It is said that ""a day you didn't laugh is a day you didn't live.""

Meat market gets a facelift,"US
Wahab minces no words in criticising Centre for lack of funding
It seems that the Centre has beef with Karachi, for literally chopping its development funds on the block. Mayor Murtaza Wahab, addressing the inaugural of the renovated meat market at the city's iconic Empress Market, minced no words in criticizing the rulers in the federal capital lack of funding for the economic hub of the country considered a cash cow by all.
""The meat market has been provided a clean and hygienic environment,"" Wahab announced, standing before rows of freshly refurbished stalls now gleaming under new lighting. On the occasion, Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad, Municipal Commissioner Syed Afzal Zaidi, Deputy Parliamentary Leader in the City Council Dil Muhammad, and other notable figures were also present.
The mayor noted that the market, once dead meat in terms of infrastructure, now boasts 29 modern stalls, promising improved livelihoods for those in the meat and potatoes of daily commerce. A new parking facility catering to 400 cars and 150 motorcycles, he said, would finally carve out space in the historically congested area.
The mayor stated that after renovating the vacant part of Empress Market, the remaining section will also be restored and beautified, including the iconic clock, which will be fixed.
Further, Wahab stated that when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) took control of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) two years ago, it decided not to complain about lack of authority and used whatever resources it had for the city's improvement, and to resolve the citizens' problems. He noted that Frere Hall, Khaliq Dina Hall, and Denso Hall have been restored and reopened to the public, and that six more KMC markets will be renovated this year.
Meanwhile, Wahab stated that Rs40 billion had been requested from the federal government for the K-IV water supply project. However, he asserted that only Rs3.5 billion have been allocated in the budget for it. Further, the mayor said that Rs100 billion had been demanded from the federal government for Karachi, but not a single rupee has been given to KMC, although the city contributes significantly to the country's revenue.

Kirsten talks about quitting Pak job,"US
He revealed that he was excluded from the team selection process
Former South Africa cricketer and renowned coach Gary Kirsten has opened up about the reasons behind his premature departure as Pakistan's white-ball coach, citing a lack of authority and internal power struggles within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Speaking on the Wisden Cricket Patreon Podcast, Kirsten detailed how his role was undermined by being excluded from the team selection process, which ultimately made it difficult for him to make a meaningful impact.
""It was a tumultuous few months. I realised quite quickly I wasn't going to have much of an influence. Once I was taken off selection and asked to take a team and not be able to shape the team, it became very difficult as a coach then to have any sort of positive influence on the group,"" Kirsten said.
Kirsten took over as Pakistan's white-ball coach in April 2024, alongside Jason Gillespie, who was appointed the Test coach.
However, both saw their tenures cut short. Kirsten stepped down six months into the role, shortly after the PCB announced squads for the ODI and T20I tours of Australia and Zimbabwewithout involving him or Gillespie in the selection process.
Gillespie, too, resigned ahead of the South Africa Test series in December, reportedly disillusioned after the board parted ways with high-performance coach Tim Nielsen. He later admitted the experience left a ""sour taste"" in his coaching career.
Despite the frustrating experience, Kirsten hasn't ruled out returning to coach Pakistan in the futureunder the right conditions.
He also hinted that external interference and a lack of cricketing autonomy were at the heart of the issues.
""If I got invited back to Pakistan tomorrow, I would go, but I would want to go for the players, and I would want to go under the right circumstances,"" he said.
""Cricket teams need to be run by cricket people. When that's not happening and when there's a lot of noise from the outside that's very influential noise, it's very difficult for leaders within the team to walk a journey that you feel like you need to walk in order to take this team to where it needs to go.
""If I were invited back tomorrow, I would gobut only for the players and under the right circumstances,"" he said. ""I'm too old now to be dealing with other agendas.
I just want to coach a cricket team and work with the players. I love the Pakistan players — they're great guys. In my short time with them, I could feel the immense pressure they carry. When they lose, it's hectic for them, and they really feel that.""
Following Kirsten's resignation, former pacer Aaqib Javed served as the interim head coach. He has now been replaced by New Zealand's Mike Hesson, who has taken charge of Pakistan's white-ball teams. As of now, the red-ball coaching position remains vacant.
Kirsten concluded by emphasising that success with any talented group depends on minimal interference.
""I'm too old now to be dealing with other agendas, I just want to coach a cricket team, work with the players  — I love the Pakistan players, they're great guys. I had a very short period of time with them and I feel for them. More than any other team in the world, they feel the pressure of performance massively, when they lose it's hectic for them and they feel that.
""But they're professional cricketers and I'm a professional cricket coach. When we get into that environment, there are generally certain things you do to help a team be the best that they can be, and when there's no interference, you go down the road, and if it's a talented group of guys, you're generally going to have success.""

Essential items' prices soar after federal budget,"US
Survey shows food prices are likely to increase by 25% to 30% from July 1
Owing to heavy taxation in the federal budget for FY26, there has been a sharp rise in the prices of essential items in the open market, including milk, sugar, ghee, cooking oil, tea, toothpaste, pulses, flour, refined flour, gram flour, and soap. Their supply has also started to dwindle.
According to a wholesale market survey, the prices of all essential food and household items are expected to increase by 25% to 30% from July 1. There is also a warning that the prices of spices may surge by 35% to 40%.
However, due to the blessings of Eidul Azha, chicken prices have dropped significantly, yet customer turnout remains low. Butchers' shops selling mutton and beef remain closed during Eid and are expected to stay shut for another week.
In the open market, sugar has reached Rs190 per kg. According to Saleem Parvez Butt, the President of the Kiryana Merchants Association, it may hit Rs200 per kg in the first week of July.

Govt's food price struggle goes on,"US
Announcement of official rates of chicken meat reintroduced
The Punjab government has reverted to its previous mechanism of setting prices for live chicken as well as meat following the failure of an alternative system aimed at stabilising poultry prices.
However, as in the past, enforcement remains weak, and the official price lists continue to be widely ignored in markets across the province.
Milk vendors have also raised prices unilaterally, with the rates increasing by Rs20 per litre and curd prices rising by Rs20 to Rs30 per kilogramme in recent days.
This week, the official rate for live chicken was set between Rs249 and Rs263 per kg, but many sellers refused to comply. Chicken meat was officially priced at Rs381, yet it was commonly sold for between Rs480 and Rs530 per kg, with boneless chicken reaching as high as Rs1,000.
Vegetables also saw significant price disparities. A-grade soft-skin potatoes, officially priced at Rs55 to Rs60, were sold at Rs120 to Rs140 per kg. B and C-grade varieties were priced at Rs35 to Rs50, yet mixed-grade potatoes sold for up to Rs100 per kg. Sugar-free potatoes had similarly wide gaps between official and market prices.
A-grade onions were officially priced at Rs35 to Rs40, but sold for up to Rs80. B-grade onions were listed at Rs27 to Rs30 and C-grade at Rs22 to Rs25, yet mixed varieties fetched Rs50 to Rs60.
Tomatoes also saw price hikes, with A-grade fixed at Rs35 to Rs40 but selling for up to Rs100 per kg. Garlic and ginger prices exceeded official rates dramatically, with local garlic priced at Rs176 to Rs185 but selling for Rs250 to Rs300, and Chinese garlic fixed at Rs248 but retailing for Rs400.
Thai ginger, fixed at Rs525 to Rs550, was sold at Rs650 to Rs700 per kg.
Other vegetables such as brinjal, bitter gourd, spinach, zucchini, and lemon also showed large gaps between official and actual market rates.
Fruits also saw excessive pricing. Apple varieties, officially listed between Rs270 and Rs430 per kg, sold for up to Rs800. Banana prices were also inflated; A-grade, officially Rs180 to Rs200 per dozen, reached Rs350 per dozen.
Dates remained officially priced at Rs430 to Rs460 but were sold for Rs900 to Rs2,000. Papaya, fixed at Rs352 to Rs370, reached Rs400, while melons, watermelons, and cantaloupes all sold well above their fixed rates.
Summer fruits like peaches, phalsa, apricots, mangoes, cherries, and plums also showed significant discrepancies. Peaches, fixed between Rs160 and Rs250, were sold at up to Rs350, while phalsa rose from Rs300 to Rs400. Apricots, officially priced at Rs230 to Rs240, went up to Rs450 per kg.
Mangoes saw retail prices of up to Rs400 per kg despite a fixed range of Rs230 to Rs270.
Meanwhile, Punjab Price Control and Commodities Management Secretary Dr Ehsan Bhutta announced that Sahulat bazaars would be established in every Tehsil across the province from next year.
He said during a visit to a newly shifted fruits and vegetable market in Sheikhupura that essential commodities would be available at cheap rates with good quality throughout the year.
He said 13 new markets would be opened by August by the Sahulat Bazaar Authority.
The development came as the issue of shifting of the fruit and vegetable markets from Sheikhupura city areas to the newly notified location was resolved and all shops shifted.
The first auction was held and the service would continue every day in the new market. The market and municipal committees have deployed their staff to address issues faced by vendors. Police have also been deployed for security.
The secretary checked all shops, auction of different fruits and vegetables. He directed the staff to provide drinking water, security and lighting for facilitating the traders.

"Ukraine receives another 1,200 bodies from Russia","US
.
Ukraine on Sunday said it had received another transfer of 1,200 bodies from Russia as part of an exchange agreement struck in Istanbul talks earlier this month.
""Another 1,200 bodies which the Russian side claims belong to Ukrainian citizens, including military personnel, were returned to Ukraine,"" Kyiv's headquarters for the treatment of prisoners of war wrote on social media.
""In total, 4,812 bodies have been returned this week,"" Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said on Facebook.
""I am grateful to everyone involved in this humanitarian mission,"" he said. Ukraine has not said whether it has transferred any bodies to the Russian side.
The two sides agreed a large-scale exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed soldiers during their latest round of direct talks in Istanbul on June 2.
Both Russia and Ukraine typically do not disclose their military losses.
In a rare public estimate, President Volodymyr Zelensky told US news outlet NBC earlier this year that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and some 380,000 wounded.
Russia has not announced its military deaths since September 2022, when it said fewer than 6,000 soldiers had been killed -- a figure believed to be vastly lower than reality.
Several independent investigations using open sources, such as the publication of death announcements by local officials and family members, have reported massive death tolls for Moscow's army.
The Russian website Mediazona and the BBC's Russian service said they had identified the names of some 111,000 killed Russian soldiers. AFP

Man City want winning feeling at Club WC,"US
The defending champions spent $135 million ahead of the tournament
Bolstered by a £100 million ($135 million) spending spree ahead of the Club World Cup, Manchester City are determined to erase the memory of a disappointing season by returning to winning ways in the United States.
For the first time in eight years, City ended the domestic campaign without a major trophy as Pep Guardiola's men surrendered the Premier League crown to Liverpool after an unprecedented four consecutive titles.
A Champions League exit before the last 16 for the first time since 2012/13 and a shock FA Cup final defeat against Crystal Palace compounded a miserable season for a club that has grown used to success since an Abu Dhabi-backed takeover 17 years ago.
At one time the month-long expanded Club World Cup, sandwiched between two gruelling seasons, was the last thing Guardiola or his players appeared to want.
Ballon d'Or winner Rodri hinted back in September that a players' strike was ""close"" over fixture congestion.
Defender Manuel Akanji more recently said the City squad was ""not exactly overjoyed"" at playing in the tournament given the limited rest time.
However, City are keen to turn the page from last season and begin afresh with major changes in the squad and coaching staff.
Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli were all signed last week to beat the deadline to feature in the Club World Cup from the start.
City also spent more than £172 million in January on Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Nico Gonzalez.
Adding Claudio Echeverri, who arrived in Manchester in January at the end of a loan spell at River Plate, nine of Guardiola's 27-man squad for the tournament have been at City for less than six months.
Former City captain Kyle Walker and club record signing Jack Grealish have been left out of the travelling party in a changing of the guard.
Meanwhile, Guardiola has also made radical changes to his staff with Pep Lijnders, Jurgen Klopp's former assistant at Liverpool, and ex-City defender Kolo Toure joining the backroom team and three other coaches departing.
""This is a very, very serious competition,"" said Guardiola. ""In the summer, the whole world will be watching this.
""A big number of the top teams in the world will be competing in this tournament and I can assure you, we're going to give it our best shot. We're going there to win it.""
City begin the tournament as third favourites in the British bookmakers odds behind newly-crowned European champions Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid.
They should ease through a group containing Morocco's Wydad Casablanca, Al Ain of Abu Dhabi and Italian giants Juventus.
Yet there is an air of mystery around what to expect from City given the fresh faces and their inconsistency over the last season.
After a miserable mid-winter run of one win in 13 games in all competitions, Guardiola's side recovered to an extent as they finished third in the Premier League.
The additions of Reijnders and Cherki add some much-needed verve to an ageing midfield and compensate for the departure of Kevin De Bruyne to Napoli.
Ait-Nouri's arrival ends a long spell without a natural left-back and will add an extra attacking dimension down that side.
Most crucially of all, though, Rodri is back from the cruciate knee ligament injury that decimated his and City's season.
When the Spanish midfielder went down against Arsenal in late September, City were still undefeated and top of the Premier League.
His importance as the key cog in Guardiola's machine was brutally exposed in the months that followed.

Biogas blaze exposes Karachi's waste crisis,"US
Dumping of untreated sewage into sea must be stopped, and alternate ways of its anaerobic recycling be explored
As many as 417 million gallons per day (mgd) of domestic effluent and 80mgd of untreated industrial wastewater are being dumped into the sea and coastal areas of Karachi due to a lack of comprehensive collection and treatment facilities for domestic sewage and industrial wastewater. The entire sewage, after going through different drainage channels including the Lyari and Malir rivers, ultimately goes into the sea. The information to this effect was provided by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) to the Sindh High Court (SHC) on Wednesday.
This has resulted in polluting the marine environment and posing a threat to marine life. The more dangerous threat of the accumulation of sewage and decomposable solid waste into the marine environment is the decomposition of such organic waste and the production of biogas underneath the silt and sand.
Recent news has alarmed us that some gas has erupted from beneath the silt and sands of Korangi Creek and has taken fire. This mysterious situation of fire eruption all along the Korangi Creek has created doubts among the coastal residents as well as concerned government agencies that some geological deposit of gas exists underneath the silt and sand of the beaches at Korangi. It is informed that this deposit is shallow and not too deep. Thus, it must not be a geological deposit but decomposition of sewage and organic waste into biogas under anaerobic conditions at shallow surface beneath the Korangi Creek sands.
As per the news, the fire at Korangi Creek continues to rage as authorities have temporarily halted firefighting efforts due to extreme heat, fire brigade officials said on Saturday. The officials said that the blaze had erupted during a 1,200-foot-deep excavation in the wee hours of Saturday. Laboratory reports of water samples from the Korangi Creek gas leak have confirmed the presence of underground hydrocarbons (gas) and continuous gas leakage from underground faults or fractures. Chemical results indicate that the gas leak is not the result of biological activity near the surface but may be from thermogenic gas reservoirs located deep below.
According to the preliminary chemical analysis report, the water contains unusually high levels of benzene, toluene, and tetrachloroethane, while o-xylene was also found in concentrations above normal levels. Despite the visible fire and bubbling water in Karachi's Korangi Creek, the hydrocarbon content in the water samples was found to be below the specified limits. However, the presence of benzene, toluene, and xylene suggests that the contamination likely stems from petroleum hydrocarbons or natural gas condensate. The lab report also found thermogenic signatures, indicating that the methane gas is not the result of biological activity in upper rock layers but a combination of aromatic hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents, strongly suggesting the presence of deep thermogenic gas. This gas reaching the surface is believed to have caused the fire.
According to the notice, the initial technical assessments, along with independent views from industry experts, suggest that the gas may be biogenic methane, a gas typically formed from the decomposition of organic matter. The company clarified that this discovery is not part of any known natural gas reserves in the region. TPL Properties also noted that, given the nature of the area, it is likely that the gas pocket will naturally dissipate over time, especially if it is left to burn. The company further stated that the test is part of an extensive study conducted with the cooperation of renowned national and international consulting firms.
Biogas is a mixture of various gases that is synthesised as a result of decomposition of organic matter, animal dung, biomass, and other biodegradable material. Its chemical composition is methane (CH₄, 50-70%), carbon dioxide (CO₂, 25-50%), other gases: nitrogen (N₂, less than 5%), hydrogen (H₂, less than 1%), and oxygen (O₂), traces of hydrogen sulfide (H₂S, less than 3%), water vapor (H₂O, less than 10%), and ammonia (NH₃, less than 1%). Methane is inflammable and is purified from biogas into 100% methane that is used as a source of energy and power. The natural gas deposits in Pakistan hidden deep in the earth and discovered by geologists as a source of energy are in fact synthesised in much the same manner as biogas is produced from decomposition of decomposable organic material. It is buried deep in rock and soil crevices, caves and pores. However, biogas is produced on the surface using the same techniques and purified to 100% methane.
The gases emitting from the Korangi Creek and catching fire are nothing but decomposition and other organic solid waste that gets decomposed into biogas stored underneath the sand and silt layers. As sand and silt are porous, the biogas finds space in their layers and is stored. Most of the biogas may also escape into the atmosphere without catching fire, but when a bulk quantity of biogas escapes and ignites, we see the fire disaster continue for days and weeks at Korangi Creek. It is advisable that biogas and bio-methane experts analyse the situation at Korangi Creek and come up with recommendations to manage it. The dumping of untreated sewage into the sea must immediately be stopped, and alternate ways of its anaerobic recycling shall be made to produce biogas as a source of energy and power, along with decomposed manure as a bi-product. We can also earn carbon credits from such a huge source of biogas production through anaerobic decomposition, which is eligible under global carbon credit systems.

A raise too far,"US
.
At a time when the majority of Pakistanis are tightening their belts in the face of relentless inflation and shrinking incomes, news of the astronomical hike in salaries and allowances for top government officeholders has rightly provoked public outrage. That the monthly remuneration of the National Assembly Speaker and Senate Chairman has jumped from Rs205,000 to a staggering Rs1.3 million — with total benefits exceeding Rs2 million — is not just tone-deaf but also a betrayal of public trust.
What makes this even more egregious is the timing. Only weeks ago, the federal budget offered a paltry 7% increase to government employees, many of whom already struggle to make ends meet. Meanwhile, there has been no meaningful movement on increasing the minimum wage, which remains grossly insufficient to support a family in today's economic climate.
Adding insult to injury is the fact that this is not the first instance of unjustified self-enrichment. Members of the National Assembly and superior judiciary have already benefitted from earlier hikes, further fuelling the perception that the public office increasingly serves the personal interests of the elite. It is perhaps in recognition of this backlash that a key federal minister has now hinted at reviewing, or even withdrawing, the salary increase.
But this backpedaling, while welcome, raises an uncomfortable question: how was such an insensitive proposal approved in the first place? Where is the accountability within the system that allows such decisions to pass through unnoticed — until the public reacts?
The government must do more than merely reverse this raise. It must restore credibility by committing to a transparent and needs-based salary structure for all public servants. Any increases must be benchmarked against national economic indicators and the financial hardships faced by the average citizen.

"Teachers decry budget, demand upgrades","US
Teachers have called these omissions unfair and disheartening
The primary school teachers of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa have expressed deep disappointment and frustration over the provincial government's failure to include their long-standing demand for up-gradation in the recent budget and for not aligning salary increases with those implemented at the federal level. Teachers have called these omissions unfair and disheartening.
According to Provincial President of the All Primary Teachers Association (APTA), Azizullah Khan, despite the preparation of legislation for the regularization of 15,000 teachers, the government has remained silent on the matter, with no progress being made. He added that in the merged tribal districts, education has become nominal, and no serious steps are being taken to address the issues faced by teachers there, creating a sense of severe anxiety among them.
Speaking about disparities in allowances, Khan criticized the K-P government for granting only a 15 per cent disparity reduction allowance based on basic pay scale salary, compared to the federal government's 30 per cent allowance based on current basic salaries. ""It is unfortunate that two sets of laws now exist within one country. If we don't resort to protest in these circumstances, what other option do we have? he asked.

'Dept. Q' delivers grime and grit,"US
Netflix's crime thriller is a perfect blend of blood, banter, and brains
Amongst the rarest breed in television is the happy detective with a sunny disposition and good manners. Which is why those who prefer the much more commonplace rude, surly specimens (think Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock or Idris Elba's Luther) will be pleased to learn that Netflix's Dept. Q. does not bother with rare detective breeds. Instead, it shoves before us some top tier scowling and filter-free bouts of rage in the form of lone wolf Carl Morck, exquisitely brought to life by Matthew Goode and his haunted, beautiful face.
A shooting gone awry, dodgy lawyers, PTSD, therapy sessions conducted with supreme reluctance, and a loose cannon policeman hurled in the midst of it all is, in a nutshell, what Dept. Q offers the thriller junkie – and in a world infested with mediocre thrillers populated by characters as interesting as pencil sharpenings, here is a show that delivers its promise.
Goode's good looks will be familiar to romcom addicts from 20 years ago (Chasing Liberty) and anyone who adores a devious villain (The Crown, Ordeal By Innocence). In Dept. Q, however, Goode has to work to earn our sympathies as he treads the fine line between a brainy hero and a man who lets the razor-sharp barbs gush from his lips with the force of the Amazon river during the rainy season. You do not need to be a great detective or have an overactive imagination to work out whether or not he succeeds.
Pray, tell us more
Set in a perpetually overcast Edinburgh but based on Danish crime noir novel The Keeper of Lost Causes (the first book in a series of ten) by Jussi Adler-Olsen, Carl's tale of woe does not so much swan dive into action as it does freefall before hitting the ground running. We are plunged into Carl's bleak angst-ridden universe as he and his partner stroll into a crime scene, with some very unexpected results. Carl's mental health spirals out of control, manifesting in a sullen demeanour and a penchant for shouting. Thisis bad news for anyone who has to engage with him in conversation, be it his unfortunate colleagues, his therapist, or his long-suffering boss, mainly because (like all TV detectives with a healthy ego) Carl is convinced that they are all far, far stupider than he is.
Tempted though she is, Carl's boss, Moira (Kate Dickie), is unable to fire him. Therefore, adopting an unspoken 'out of sight, out of mind' philosophy, Moira does the next best thing: she banishes Carl to 'Department Q', the office's urinal-filled basement, which appears to be illuminated (if that is not too strong a description) by a single 20-watt bulb from the 1980s. In these uninspiring new surroundings, Moira also dumps upon Carl an unwanted IT man called Akram (Alexej Manvelov).
At a later date, Moira is startled to learn that Akram spends very little time doing IT-related work as initially advertised and deals with uncooperative witnesses by throwing them down the stairs or bruising their windpipes, depending on what the occasion calls for. Akram's other identifying mark is that he is a Muslim who has fled Syria. We are made acutely aware of his faith because he declines Morck's offer of alcohol and prays in the office on a prayer mat, albeit not in a way any Muslim has ever prayed in their lives, presumably because the research department behind Dept. Q did not ask the right questions when fleshing out the script.
However, in the grander scheme of things, we must overlook these niggling details, as Akram's piety is not the focal point of this story. To seal the trio, Carl also unwittingly inherits Rose, a fresh-faced rookie aching to do something more interesting than filing paperwork. Having thus sent away her Department Q team down to the basement, Moira bequeaths them all an alarmingly large pile of unsolved cold cases that had, up until now, been festering away in an office cabinet somewhere. It is, of course, one of these cases that Carl and co pick up to work through for the duration of the show's nine episodes. Can Carl and his team overcome their fearless leader's grumpiness and come together as a cohesive whole?
A second strand
Carl's is not the only sordid tale we are introduced to. Minutes into Dept. Q's opening, we encounter stern-faced prosecutor Merritt Lingard (Chloe Pirrie) who, sadly, is not having the greatest luck in court when we witness her in action. Merritt's troubles are not limited to the courtroom; she also has someone sending her threatening voice messages and stalking her.
And because bad luck comes in threes, Meritt's life is consumed by worrying about her beloved disabled brother. Mentally, she has no spoons left to spare, but because she sports a severe, unflattering haircut, we are far less disposed to be sympathetic to her plight than we are to the rude Carl's gaunt handsome face. That, unfortunately, is how shallowness works. Goode's bearded Carl gets a pass, and Pirrie's monstrous fringe (although nowhere near as horrific as the one sported by Violett Beane's Imogene Scott in Death and Other Details) pits us against her.
But not for long – a welcome relief for those viewers plunging into an awkward moment of self-reflection as they ponder over how they could possibly be shallow enough to be manipulated by a bad hair day. As with any thriller that follows the rules, Carl's and Merrit's stories become irrevocably intertwined in a roller coaster ride, culminating in a conclusion that brings a welcome release after escalating tension. If there are moments of mortifying cheesiness throwing a spanner in the works, the interspersed moments of raw horror chisel it all away. Bullets meet flesh, rocks go flying, faces get kicked. Carl's sullen demeanour is definitely earned.
When gore meets good
Those moments of gore, however, are just that: moments. With an underlying thread of black humour stitching everything together, Dept. Q ensures that you will miss very little if you watch with your hands over your eyes during the more blood-heavy moments. The one redeeming factor of all this violence is that it is all accompanied by a llinguistically intoxicating lilting Scottish accent. (Conversely, if the more rural Scottishness sails over your head, be grateful that we live in the age of subtitles.)
Are there unanswered questions left hanging as the credits roll by on the final episode? Yes. Is Goode good looking enough that shallow viewers can forgive this travesty? Also yes.

Call for desilting to prevent monsoon losses,"US
Authorities urged to prioritise drainage maintenance, infrastructure improvements
As Pakistan braces for a 13% increase in rainfall during the 2025 monsoon season, environmental experts have warned that inadequate drainage infrastructure could exacerbate flood risks and economic losses.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasts the monsoon to commence around June 23 and continue until September, with potential flash floods and urban inundations, particularly in regions like Koh-e-Suleman, Sindh, AJK, KPK, Punjab, and Islamabad.
Experts emphasise that without proactive drainage maintenancesuch as clearing debris and removing blockagesthe country faces significant economic repercussions.
Monsoon-induced flooding has historically inflicted severe economic damage across South Asia. For instance, the 2020 floods in the region caused an estimated $105 billion in damages, with Pakistan alone accounting for $1.5b of that total. Similarly, in 2024, Nepal experienced floods resulting in over Rs17b in losses, primarily affecting agriculture and infrastructure.
These recurring disasters underscore the urgent need for improved drainage systems to mitigate economic losses and enhance resilience against future floods.
In Islamabad, sectors such as G-10, F-10, I-10, and I-9 face chronic drainage issues. Drains are often clogged with solid waste, including plastic bags, bottles, food waste, and construction debris.
During the monsoon, these drains become further obstructed with soil, sand, and shrubs, significantly reducing their capacity and causing water to overflow into residential areas. Residents have repeatedly urged authorities to clean and maintain these drains to prevent property damage.
Environmental experts highlight that the worsening flood situation is not solely due to increased rainfall but also due to climate change, neglected infrastructure, and insufficient public awareness about the consequences of dumping waste into drainage channels.
Informal settlements, particularly in sectors like G-6, F-6, G-7, F-7, and G-8, are often situated along drain canals. These areas are at high risk of floodwater intrusion, which can cause significant damage to infrastructure.
Experts recommend issuing timely warnings to these communities to take necessary precautions. Experts note that sediment accumulation in drains reduces their width and capacity. For example, a drain that was once 100 feet wide may now be only 50 feet wide due to sediment buildup.
This narrowing increases the risk of overflow and flooding, as the same volume of water is forced through a much narrower channel. Low-cost houses, especially those with basements or illegal connections to drains, are particularly vulnerable to floodwater intrusion.
Experts urge authorities to prioritise drainage maintenance and infrastructure improvements ahead of the monsoon season. Proactive measures, such as regular cleaning of drains and raising public awareness about the importance of proper waste disposal, are essential to mitigate flood risks and economic losses.
Environmentalist Muhammad Aslam urged authorities to take immediate action in informal settlements, particularly in sectors G-6, F-6, G-7, F-7, and G-8, where many homes are built along drainage canals.
""These areas are highly vulnerable to flooding, and residents should be issued timely warnings to take precautions,"" he said. Aslam also highlighted that sediment accumulation is drastically reducing drain capacities.
""A drain that was once 100 feet wide is now about 50 feet due to unchecked buildup,"" he explained. He warned that low-cost houses, especially those with basements or illegal drain connections, are at serious risk.

Driver burned alive in oil tanker blaze,"IT
Rescue 1122 teams from Rawalpindi arrived at the scene and successfully extinguished the flames
The driver was burned to death, while the helper sustained injuries after an oil tanker plunged into a ravine and caught fire near the Kaak bridge on Sunday, witnesses and rescuers said.
The incident took place in the jurisdiction of Humak Police Station. Rescue 1122 fire tenders managed to control the blaze.
According to authorities, the oil tanker was passing through the loop at the Kaak Pul when it suddenly malfunctioned and veered off the road, falling into a deep ditch. Upon impact, the tanker caught fire, and thick smoke was visible from a distance.
The driver, identified as Amjad, tried to save himself by jumping out but got trapped inside the tanker and was burned to death. His helper, Hasnain Raza, managed to jump out and survive with injuries.
Humak SHO Muhammad Imran said that the accident appeared to have been caused by a broken tie rod, but the exact cause would be confirmed after a detailed investigation.
A video of the incident, which went viral on social media, captured an eyewitness saying he was sitting by the roadside when he heard a loud explosion, likely caused by a tire burst. He then saw the tanker wobbling before it fell into the ravine and caught fire.
Rescue 1122 teams from Rawalpindi arrived at the scene and successfully extinguished the flames, but the tanker was completely destroyed in the blaze.
In a separate incident, a truck and a car collided near Messa Kaswal on GT Road in Gujar Khan, injuring four people.
The injured were identified as 28-year-old Ehsaan, 30-year-old Shehbaz Asghar, 25-year-old Asad Asghar, and 16-year-old Kashif. Rescue 1122 provided the victims with first aid and later shifted them to a hospital.

Budget: will it power tech economy or stall its promise?,"US
Country needs overhaul of licensing systems, clear cloud procurement framework and enforceable data protection
The federal budget for FY 2025-26 arrives at a critical juncture. As Pakistan grapples with economic fragility, youth unemployment and declining investor confidence, the technology sector still offers one of the few credible paths towards sustainable growth. But even this promise risks fading, choked by a familiar cycle of lofty declarations with little follow-through.
For years, slogans like Digital Pakistan, IT exports and Startup Pakistan have echoed across stages and press conferences. Yet these remain ceremonial, rarely backed by budgetary or institutional commitment. The FY26 budget, like many before it, acknowledges the sector but stops short of empowering it.
References to digitisation and startups are there but feel like afterthoughts. There is no substantial allocation to expand fibre broadband or improve rural connectivity. These are foundational requirements for any meaningful digital economy. The Universal Service Fund remains underpowered. Key areas such as artificial intelligence, cloud computing and cybersecurity are barely acknowledged. These are not futuristic ambitions. They are current global imperatives.
The neglect of public cloud infrastructure is particularly telling. Around the world, governments are investing in sovereign cloud to ensure data control, cybersecurity and efficient citizen services. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to rely on outdated hosting and procurement models while spending heavily on foreign software licences. We have not created the policy or regulatory environment that would attract global players like Microsoft, Oracle or Amazon to establish localised cloud zones in the country.
This is not just about reducing costs. Localising global cloud infrastructure means protecting national data, supporting critical fintech and public services, improving cybersecurity and restoring investor confidence. Countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and even Kuwait have been able to achieve this successfully. Pakistan, despite its population and potential, has not. The reason is not capability. It is the lack of political will and policy coherence.
To move forward, fiscal incentives are not enough. We need a complete overhaul of our licensing systems, a clear cloud procurement framework and enforceable data protection policies that support international standards and welcome strategic investment.
Our underperforming technology exports are another missed opportunity. Despite talent and diaspora strength, Pakistan's IT and IT-enabled services exports remain flat at around $3 billion. Delegations continue to travel to international expos labeled as promotion, yet few convert into meaningful outcomes. We lack market intelligence, follow-up mechanisms and synergy with embassies or trade bodies.
The country must shift from exhibition-based engagement to targeted market expansion. That means using data to identify high demand regions, strengthening diaspora commercial diplomacy and aligning visa, trade and marketing policies accordingly. Forex Retention Cards and a robust Digital Export Facilitation Portal can reduce friction and support growth.
Startups in Pakistan also remain underserved. Early stage capital is scarce. Regulatory inconsistency deters innovation. Public innovation agencies like Ignite are underfunded. Gender inclusive policy support is largely symbolic. And there is minimal room for experimentation in areas like fintech, healthtech, agritech or education technology.
Pakistan needs a government-backed Tech Growth Fund, tax holidays for early stage startups and regulatory sandboxes that allow innovation to mature. Grants for women-led ventures are not just desirable, they are essential if we want to build an inclusive technology economy.
All of this is complicated by a harsh and fragmented tax regime. Advance income taxes, overlapping provincial levies and ambiguous procedures punish digital businesses. Freelancers and software exporters struggle with remitting earnings. The FY26 budget has ignored these fundamental friction points.
It is time to reinstate long-term tax exemptions for digital exporters, introduce zero rating for in-house developed software and unify digital taxation through a single window. Otherwise, we risk driving our best talent out of the country while chasing token foreign exchange.
Behind these gaps is a more systemic failure. There is no central authority responsible for driving digital transformation across government. Ministries and agencies continue to operate in silos, leading to duplicated projects, inconsistent platforms and wasted resources. The establishment of a Central Digital Governance Authority is not a luxury. It is a national need. This body must have legal authority and cross-institutional mandate to drive implementation, track performance and ensure accountability across public sector initiatives.
Another missed opportunity is talent development. The budget refers to skills but offers no strategy to future proof the workforce. What we need is not more unstructured training but a national education model aligned with global demand. Leading tech nations invest in talent as their core asset. Pakistan has the youth but not the planning.
A National Digital Skills Fund must be created in partnership with global tech providers such as Microsoft, Cisco and AWS. The school curriculum must be upgraded to embed STEM skills and computational thinking. Skilling must be scalable, industry driven and outcome based. We cannot outsource this to non-profits and hope to compete globally.
In the end, the FY26 budget appears more focused on fiscal optics than digital transformation. It may satisfy IMF checklists but it does little to address the urgency of economic reinvention. Other nations are building cloud parks, launching national AI strategies and attracting tech investment at scale. We are still debating whether digital transformation is viable. It is not just viable. It is vital.
Pakistan's technology economy can be the engine that drives us out of crisis. But engines need fuel, direction and commitment. That means infrastructure. That means policy. That means institutional leadership. We must move from ceremonial launches to systemic reform, from scattered events to connected ecosystems and from policy talk to measurable performance.
The world will not wait for us to catch up. Neither will our young people. The time to act was yesterday. The time to recover it is today.

PM hails overseas Pakistanis' contribution,"US
.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has offered ""heartfelt tribute"" to overseas Pakistani, the remittances sent by whom reflect an enduring bond with their homeland — a bond of trust, commitment, and generational responsibility.
In a statement issued at the International Day of Family Remittances, he said the government continues to work tirelessly to attract foreign direct investment and expand export base to ensure long-term economic stability.
In this journey, he said, remittances have played a crucial role, significantly strengthening our foreign exchange reserves. According to the PM, remittances from overseas Pakistanis have always been a cornerstone of our national economy.
""With over 9 million Pakistanis living abroad, mainly in the Gulf, Europe, North America, and elsewhere.
""Our diaspora remains deeply connected to their roots. Their financial contributions are not only an expression of love and responsibility towards their families, but also a powerful pillar supporting Pakistan's economic resilience,"" he added.
He noted that in the current fiscal year, overseas compatriots remitted a record $34.9 billion, marking a 28.8% increase compared to the previous year. In May 2025 alone, the country received $3.7 billion in remittances, reflecting a 13.7% increase over May of the previous year.
""These historic figures are a testament not only to the hard work and loyalty of our diaspora but also to their growing confidence in the government's economic policies.""
He said this trust reinforces the government's resolve to redouble efforts for the revival and growth of our economy. ""Let us renew our collective pledge to work hand in hand with our diaspora, development partners, and all stakeholders to overcome our economic challenges and usher in a new era of investment, prosperity, and national progress,"" he said.

Delayed drain cleaning ups flood risk,"US
As KMC awaits funds, experts warn large parts of the city could be inundated if unclogging operations are not launched
With the Pakistan Meteorological Department forecasting above-normal rainfall in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, the city remains ill-prepared for the monsoon season as storm water drains remain uncleaned due to the delayed release of funds by the Sindh government.
Sources have revealed to The Express Tribune that despite repeated warnings and past experiences of urban flooding, the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has not received the required funds for comprehensive cleaning of the city's drainage network comprising of 586 storm drains, including 41 major ones under its jurisdiction.
Experts have warned that the delay has already undermined the effectiveness of any upcoming cleaning efforts, as drains cannot be thoroughly cleared in a limited timeframe. ""The monsoon season is just around the corner. If cleaning doesn't begin now, large paths of Karachi could be submerged,"" said an official close to the matter.
Deputy Director of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Anjum Nazir Saigham, confirmed that Karachi and interior Sindh were likely to receive 20 to 30 per cent more rainfall than average this season. ""We have already issued alerts to all concerned agencies about the high risk of urban flooding in Karachi and flash flooding in parts of interior Sindh,"" said Saigham.
Historical data reinforces these warnings. In July 2022 alone, the Mauripur observatory recorded 584mm of rain, with a total of 757mm for the monsoon season. A single-day record of 230mm was set on August 27, 2020; the day that brought the port city to a standstill.
KMC's Senior Director of Municipal Services, Abdul Hannan, confirmed that a funding request had been sent to the Sindh government, though he declined to specify the amount. According to a senior municipal officer, KMC has sought Rs650 million for the current season, in line with requests made in previous years, which ranged from Rs600 to Rs800 million. ""Unfortunately, the provincial government has never released the full amount. Typically, Rs400 to Rs450 million are provided, and that too when the rains are already upon us,"" said the official.
It is worth mentioning that although partial cleaning under KMC's annual maintenance contract began in May, full-scale work will only commence once funds are released and new contracts awarded. A KMC report identified 19 key locations where rainwater accumulates several feet deep every monsoon season. These include I.I. Chundrigar Road, Shahrah-e-Faisal (Nursery, Jinnah Bridge, FTC Flyover), Civic Centre, NIPA Chowrangi, Rashid Minhas Road, and parts of Gulistan-e-Johar and Liaquatabad.
Other historically flood-prone areas include Nagan Chowrangi, Banaras, KDA Chowrangi, Safoora Goth, Surjani, Thado Dam, and Palm Village Malir. In addition, The Express Tribune has received reports of at least 30 other vulnerable neighbourhoods including Jehangir East & West, Martin Quarters, Korangi Industrial Area, Qayyumabad, Noorani Mohalla (New Karachi), Liaquatabad No. 4 and 10, Water Pump, and Cheel Chowk in Lyari, which face a high risk of flooding if preventive measures are not taken immediately.
Urban planner Dr Syed Nawaz Al-Huda called for systemic reforms beyond emergency cleaning. ""The tradition of dumping garbage into drains must end. The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board should ensure daily waste collection and removal to landfill sites. Separating sewer lines from storm water drains could save the government millions of rupees by preventing future crises. Storm water should drain from city roads within 30 minutes - which is the global standard. In Karachi, however, due to poor planning, water takes three to four hours to drain out,"" highlighted Dr Al-Huda.

Plastic wasteland,"US
.
Pakistan's plastic problem has crossed a critical threshold — one that threatens both environmental integrity and public health. With nearly two million tonnes of plastic waste generated annually, and a staggering 86% of it mismanaged, the country is teetering on the edge of an environmental crisis of its own making. According to WWF-Pakistan, over 1.7 million tonnes of this waste ends up in landfills, open dumps, waterways, and, increasingly, in the very food systems meant to nourish human life.
This unchecked surge in plastic pollution places Pakistan among the top 10 plastic-polluting nations globally — a dubious distinction that reflects not just a waste management failure but a broader policy and behavioural crisis. The proliferation of single-use plastics is emblematic of a culture addicted to convenience, yet blind to consequence. These items, designed for moments of use, linger in ecosystems for centuries, leaching toxins into our soil and water.
Pakistan is also among the worst in South Asia when it comes to plastic mismanagement, placing tremendous strain on already overburdened urban waste systems. The long-term consequences of such exposure are still unfolding, but the immediate need for action is undeniable. It is imperative for federal and provincial governments to move beyond token bans on plastic bags and adopt an integrated national plastic action plan. This must include strict regulation of SUPs, investment in recycling infrastructure, incentivising alternatives and public education campaigns to change consumption patterns. At the same time, the private sector must take responsibility for the lifecycle of its products.
Plastic waste is a direct symptom of systemic neglect and a threat to our collective future. Without coordinated and sustained action, Pakistan risks suffocating under the weight of its own waste.

Families hold funerals for Air India crash victims,"US
.
Mourners covered white coffins with flowers in India on Sunday as funerals were held for some of at least 279 killed in one of the world's worst plane crashes in decades.
Health officials have begun handing over the first passenger bodies identified through DNA testing, delivering them to grieving relatives in the western city of Ahmedabad, but the wait went on for most families.
""They said it would take 48 hours. But it's been four days and we haven't received any response,"" said Rinal Christian, 23, whose elder brother was a passenger.
There was just one survivor out of 242 passengers and crew on board the Air India jet when it crashed Thursday into a residential area of Ahmedabad, killing at least 38 people on the ground.
""My brother was the sole breadwinner of the family,"" Christian told AFP. ""So what happens next?""
At a crematorium in the city, around 20 to 30 mourners chanted prayers in a funeral ceremony for Megha Mehta, a passenger who had been working in London.
As of Sunday evening 47 crash victims have been identified, according to Rajnish Patel, a doctor at Ahmedabad's civil hospital.
""This is a meticulous and slow process, so it has to be done meticulously only,"" Patel said Saturday.
One victim's relative who did not want to be named told AFP they had been instructed not to open the coffin when they receive it.
Witnesses reported seeing badly burnt bodies and scattered remains.
Workers went on clearing debris from the site on Sunday, while police inspected the area.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner erupted into a fireball when it went down moments after takeoff, smashing into buildings used by medical staff.
The majority of those injured on the ground have been discharged, Patel said, with one or two remaining in critical care.
Indian authorities are yet to detail the cause of the disaster and have ordered inspections of Air India's Dreamliners.
Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu said Saturday he hoped decoding the recovered black box, or flight data recorder, would ""give an in-depth insight"" into what went wrong.
Imtiyaz Ali, who was still waiting for a DNA match to find his brother, said the airline should have supported families faster.
""I'm disappointed in them. It is their duty,"" said Ali, who was contacted by the airline on Saturday.
""Next step is to find out the reason for this accident. We need to know,"" he told AFP. Just one person miraculously escaped the wreckage, British citizen Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, whose brother was also on the flight.
Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian on board the flight, as well as 12 crew members.
Among the passengers was a father of two young girls, Arjun Patoliya, who had travelled to India to scatter his wife's ashes following her death weeks earlier.
""I really hope that those girls will be looked after by all of us,"" said Anjana Patel, the mayor of London's Harrow borough where some of the victims lived.
""We don't have any words to describe how the families and friends must be feeling,"" she added.
While communities were in mourning, one woman recounted how she survived only by arriving late at the airport.
""The airline staff had already closed the check-in,"" said 28-year-old Bhoomi Chauhan.
""At that moment, I kept thinking that if only we had left a little earlier, we wouldn't have missed our flight,"" she told the Press Trust of India news agency.

Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) has decided to discontinue the collection of electricity bill payments through Pakistan Post from July 1st.
In a letter sent to Pakistan Post Headquarters, the company stated that the move aims to digitise the manual collection system and prevent losses in cash collections. Pakistan Post sources expressed surprise at this abrupt unilateral decision, while confirming that post offices continue to provide services for electricity, gas, telephone, and WASA bill collections despite facing significant financial losses.
They said that its continuation is for public convenience and to maintain the national institution's dignity. Public trust in post offices, especially in rural areas, is evident from statistics showing that during the last fiscal year, over 42.8 million electricity company bills were collected at post offices, including 10 million bills for IESCO. Similar figures are emerging for the current fiscal year as well.
It has been learned that while IESCO and all other electricity companies and utility providers already have alternative proposed facilities available, the majority of the public still relies on Pakistan Post.

Fuel prices jacked up,"PK
Petrol price jumps by Rs4.80, HSD by Rs7.95 per litre
The federal government on Sunday raised the fuel prices for the next fortnight.
According to a notification issued by the Finance Division, petrol has been increased by Rs4.80 per litre and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs7.95 per litre. The hike follows recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) and other relevant ministries.
With the increase, petrol now costs Rs258.43 per litre, up from Rs253.63, while HSD is priced at Rs262.59 per litre, rising from Rs254.64.
The new rates came into effect at midnight on June 16.
The government cited fluctuations in international oil markets and the rupee's exchange rate as key reasons for the adjustment, in line with Pakistan's fortnightly fuel price review mechanism.
Additionally, the government is focusing more on collecting petroleum levy in order to redirect it to subsidize electricity prices.
The government has already decided to increase petroleum levy rate up to Rs90 per litre on the sale of oil products.

The apps are rapidly spreading through social media, offering the a false hope of ""easy money from home"". But behind the colourful graphics and catchy slogans lies a financial and mental danger.
These apps promote various games. At first glance, they seem like simple fun. But as soon as the users sign up, they are welcomed with free bonuses, sometimes Rs500 or more just to play.
In the beginning, they win small amounts. Encouraged by early success, many users start putting in their own money, hoping to earn even more. That's when the real loss begins, said information technology experts.
""I thought I could earn some side income by playing a game online. But within two weeks, I had lost Rs15,000,"" shared a college student on the condition of anonymity.

Chahan Dam contracts' issue remains unresolved,"IT
Court suspends cancellation of contracts of Lots two and three to Turkish company
The controversy over awarding Lot Two and Lot Three contracts from Chahan Dam to Rawalpindi under the Dream Project could not be resolved.
Project Director Hamza Salik was removed from his post and additional Secretary Finance Omar Javed was appointed as the new Project Director. The cancellation of the contract for the supply of 12 million gallons of additional water per day upon completion of the Lot Two and Lot Three contract at a cost of Rs20.4 billion funded by the Asian Development Bank was suspended by the High Court.
The court also issued instructions to resolve the matter within two weeks. Rawalpindi will be able to get 17 million gallons of additional water per day upon completion of the project from Lot One to Lot Four.
The contract for Lot One of the projects was awarded to China Construction Third Engineering at a cost of Rs6.36 billion, while the contract for Lot Four was awarded to MS Metracon BDL and Turkish company Five H Insat at a cost of Rs7.19 billion. Work on both contracts is ongoing. With the completion of these projects, Rawalpindi will get 5 million gallons of additional water per day from Khanpur Dam and Rawal Dam.
In addition, the joint venture company of the project had objected to the award of the contract for Lot Two and Lot Three to Turkish company Five H Insat at a cost of Rs20.40 billion. The project director had cancelled the contract on the recommendation of the Steering Committee for Dream Project after the fact-finding of the Chief Minister Inspection Team on the objection of the joint venture company of the project.
When the company challenged the decision in the Rawalpindi bench of the Lahore High Court, Justice Jawad Hassan suspended the decision of the project director and WASA MD and directed them to resolve the matter by mutual agreement with the Turkish company within two weeks.
However, after the meeting of the steering committee of the Dream Project, the project director of the Dream Project, Hamza Salik, was removed from his post and Additional Secretary Finance Omar Javed has been appointed as the new project director of the Dream Project.
Now, in the light of the court's decision, the steering committee of the Dream Project will decide to award the contracts of Lot two and Lot three. If the matter of awarding the contracts of Lot two and Lot three drags on, the completion of the loan-funded project of the Asian Development Bank may be delayed.

Radiocontrast film shortage stalls diagnosis at govt hospitals,"GB
Low-income patients lacking access to smartphones are expected to take photos of their radiological reports
In Punjab's government hospitals, there are significant challenges in accessing essential imaging services such as X-ray, ultrasound, MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), and CT (Computed Tomography) scan, despite official claims of free medicines and treatment facilities.
Although government hospitals claim to provide immediate access to X-ray, ultrasound, MRI, and CT scan services in emergency situations, routine patients, on the other hand, often face long waiting times due to overcrowding. This is in spite of the fact that each quarter, the government disburses billions of rupees to hospitals in Lahore, including the Mayo, General, Services, Jinnah, and Guru Nanak Dev hospitals, to support medical facilities.
Abdul Rehman, a resident of Lahore, shared his experience at the Services Hospital, where his brother was taken after an accident. After receiving medical attention in the emergency department, his family encountered a troubling situation when they sought a CT scan and X-ray.
""When I brought my brother to the radiology department, the technician told me that I should take a picture of the reports with my mobile phone since films were not available. I am a poor man, and I do not own a smartphone with a good-quality camera. Eventually I had to sought help from someone else to capture the images, which were then shown to the doctor. Similarly, the X-ray image was simply printed on plain paper,"" said Rehman.
According to the Health Department, government hospitals across Punjab are grappling with severe financial challenges. Although the Punjab government recently released additional funds worth Rs2 billion to support hospital operations, the issues plaguing the healthcare system persist. In recent years, the government has upgraded hospital infrastructure, renovated buildings, and increased annual budgets however, the rapidly growing population has led to a surge in the influx of patients, placing immense pressure on public healthcare facilities.
Public health expert, Dr Muhammad Ajmal, highlighted the fact the increasing population in the country necessitated the construction of more hospitals. ""Currently, the situation has become such that X-ray, MRI and CT scan films are not available, due to which patients have to take photos on their phones. Doctors check reports on their phones, and this practice is becoming a part of their routine. At present, resources are scarce, but doctors are doing their job within these resources. More hospitals should be built and the number of radiological machines should also be increased,"" said Dr Ajmal.
At the same time, it is also worth emphasizing that private-sector healthcare has become increasingly unaffordable for many citizens. Over the past three years, the prices of medical supplies have skyrocketed, but the budget allocation for government hospitals has not kept pace. Despite government funding, the gap remains unfilled. Similarly, the prices of imported X-ray, MRI, and CT scan films have increased significantly due to the rise in the dollar's value, much like the raw materials for medicines. Although medicines are being provided, shortages are still observed.
Sources have reported that the budget allocations for government hospitals are determined based on the number of beds each facility has. For instance, the Mayo Hospital, which has 2,484 beds, receives an annual allocation of Rs3.3 million per bed. However, other hospitals in Lahore reportedly receive a higher per-bed allocation.
The correspondent tried contacting the Provincial Health Minister Salman Rafiq however, the official was unable to comment on the matter.

Lawyers booked for viral traffic row,"US
Legal fraternity protests registration of case, demands quick withdrawal
Cantt police have registered a case against some lawyers for hurling threats at traffic policemen, making a video of the clash over impounding a motorcycle and making it viral on social media. The case was registered under the PECA Act and other offences.
The Rawalpindi legal fraternity protested the registration of a case and demanded its quick withdrawal.
Inspector Wajid of the City Traffic Police complained that he was on duty with his team when a video was circulated on Facebook by Advocate Chaudhry Rizwan Elahi.
The incident took place on Saturday on Haider Road, where a motorcyclist was stopped for not wearing a helmet and for the absence of a front number plate. The rider, identified as Malik Tajammul, was issued a challan (ticket), and his motorcycle was impounded due to a lack of documents.
The motorcyclist introduced himself as a lawyer and called around 15 fellow lawyers to the scene, who allegedly hurled serious threats. Other policemen present helped defuse the situation. However, Advocate Rizwan Elahi later posted the video on his Facebook account, allegedly to defame the police.
The complaint states that the video was intentionally made viral to incite public sentiment and malign the image and dignity of the police department.
It further alleges that threats were issued to uniformed officers and official work was obstructedacts considered criminal.
The police confirmed that a case has been registered and investigations are underway.
On the other hand, the lawyers strongly condemned the registration of a case, calling it fabricated. In a statement issued by Asad Mehmood Malik, the Secretary of the Rawalpindi Bar Association, the Association expressed strong condemnation of the City Traffic Police's ""illegal, unconstitutional, and inappropriate behaviour"" towards their esteemed member and former Joint Secretary, Advocate Malik Tajammul Awan.
Despite the matter being resolved at the scene, the Bar Association strongly protested the ""baseless and unlawful FIR"" lodged against Advocates Elahi and Awan, demanding its immediate withdrawal.
The Rawalpindi District Bar declared full solidarity with its members, asserting that the dignity and honour of the legal fraternity would never be compromised. If the case is not withdrawn within 24 hours, the Bar will announce its next course of strict action.

"Gaza death toll crosses 55,000","US
Health ministry says 16 dead in latest Israeli strikes
Gaza's civil defence agency said 16 people were killed in Israeli military operations in the Palestinian territory on Sunday, most of them while waiting for aid.
Besides, the health ministry in Hamas-run Gaza said Israel's offensive has left at least 55,207 people dead, majority of them civilians.
The first responders agency's teams transported the bodies of 16 people killed by Israeli fire in various part of the Palestinian territory, spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP.
At least three people were killed and many injured when Israeli forces ""targeted a gathering of hundreds of citizens near the aid distribution point"" in central Gaza Sunday morning, Bassal said.
In the coastal territory's north, Bassal said civil defence teams transported seven people killed on their way to get aid distributed from trucks in the area northwest of Gaza City.
In south Gaza, two people were killed and 50 were injured ""when (Israeli) forces opened fire on citizens near an aid distribution point,"" Bassal said.
Contacted by AFP, the army said it was ""not aware of gunshots near Netzarim or Rafah"", and that it was looking into the events in northern Gaza.
Israeli restrictions on media in Gaza and the difficulties of access on the ground mean AFP is unable to independently verify the casualty tolls provided by the civil defence agency.
Dozens of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach GHF distribution points since the US- and Israel-backed organisation began operating in late May, according to the civil defence agency.

New police station set up for airport area,"US
.
Following the inclusion of areas surrounding the New Islamabad International Airport within the administrative boundaries of the Rawalpindi district, a new Airport Police Station has been established, and a Station House Officer (SHO) has been appointed.
A temporary building for the police station has been rented on the Motorway Link Road. However, a permanent structure will later be constructed after acquiring land on or near Airport Road.
When the New Islamabad International Airport became operational, its terminal building, runway, and funnel area spanned three different jurisdictions: the Attock district, the Rawalpindi district, and parts of the Islamabad Capital Territory. Legally, only the New Airport Police Station in Attock had jurisdiction over the airport area.
However, in view of security concerns and the need for unified jurisdiction, the government reassigned full administrative control of the airport and its surrounding areas to the Rawalpindi district last year. Consequently, it was decided to establish a new Airport Police Station specifically for the airport and adjacent areas.
It has been learned that the new police station has been formed by dividing the jurisdiction of Naseerabad Police Station, particularly areas that were previously under its Hameedan police post.

Solidarity Camp supports Global March to Gaza,"US
Organized jointly by Palestine Foundation Pakistan, camp aims to express support for international land convoy to Gaza
A solidarity camp was held at the Karachi Press Club in support of the Global March to Gaza, drawing participation from political and religious leaders, civil society members, human rights activists, and students.
Organized jointly by the Palestine Foundation Pakistan, Federal Urdu University, and think tank KAP, the camp aimed to express support for the international land convoy to Gaza.
The convoy, which began in Algeria and reached Egypt after crossing several countries, has been blocked at the Rafah crossing by Egyptian authorities, who reportedly used force against the peace activists.
Speakers at the camp harshly criticized the Egyptian government for obstructing humanitarian aid and holding up the Gaza convoy, and held the United States complicit in the blockade.
They also condemned Israel's recent attacks on Iran, terming them acts of state terrorism.
Participants accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza by blocking food and aid while bombing civilians, and condemned the international community and Muslim leaders for their silence and inaction.
The speakers demanded an immediate severance of diplomatic ties with Israel by Muslim states and called on Pakistan's government to take a firmer stance in support of both Palestine and Iran.

BCCI announces schedule for New Zealand tour,"US
Cricket returns to Vadodara after 15 years
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has announced the schedule and venues for New Zealand's white-ball tour of India, set to take place in January 2026.
The tour will feature three ODIs followed by five T20Is, marking the first bilateral series between the two sides since India's win over New Zealand in the Champions Trophy final earlier this year.
Vadodara will mark its return to the men's international cricketing map after more than 15 years, with the city set to host the opening ODI on January 11 at the newly built Kotambi Stadium.
The venue previously hosted three Women's ODIs between India and West Indies in December 2024 and six matches during the 2025 Women's Premier League (WPL).
Interestingly, New Zealand also featured in Vadodara's last men's international match - an ODI at Reliance Stadium in December 2010.
In that game, current India head coach Gautam Gambhir was named Player of the Match for his century, while Virat Kohli, who has since retired from T20Is and Tests but continues to play ODIs, scored an unbeaten 63.
Following the series opener in Vadodara, the teams will remain in Gujarat for the second ODI in Rajkot on January 14, before the series concludes with the third ODI in Indore on January 18.
The tour will then transition to the T20I leg, starting with matches in Nagpur (January 21) and Raipur (January 23).
The final leg of the tour will take place in eastern and southern India, with Guwahati (January 25), Visakhapatnam (January 28), and Thiruvananthapuram (January 31) hosting the third, fourth and fifth T20Is respectively.
These five T20Is are likely to be India's final preparation before they begin their campaign at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026, which they are co-hosting with Sri Lanka.
The Men in Blue will enter the tournament as defending champions, having won the 2024 edition in the West Indies and the USA.
New Zealand, on the other hand, are scheduled to play a three-match T20I series against Afghanistan immediately after their India tour concludes.

Steve Smith provides injury update,"US
He dislocated finger during the World Test Championship final
Australia batter Steve Smith has broken his silence following the finger injury he sustained during the ICC World Test Championship Final against South Africa at Lord's.
The veteran cricketer offered insights into his recovery timeline and prospects for a return to international action.
Smith was taken to the hospital on day three of Australia's five-wicket loss to South Africa after suffering a compound dislocation of his right little finger while fielding in the slip cordon.
The 36-year-old sustained the injury attempting to catch South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, who was on just two at the time.
Fortunately for Smith, the injury did not require surgery.
""I will be in a splint for eight weeks now and I may be able to play with it in a couple of weeks,"" Smith revealed after Australia's five-wicket loss to the Proteas at Lord's.
""It will depend on my functionality and what I am able to do, so it was probably the best result I could have hoped for.""
Despite the dropped catch, Bavuma went on to score 66 and anchor a crucial match-winning partnership with Aiden Markram.
Smith explained the circumstances of the incident, noting the challenges posed by the Lord's pitch.
""I was standing pretty close with the helmet on and as we saw throughout the game a lot of nicks went short of first and second slip,"" Smith said.
""The plan was to stand pretty close and I lost sight of it with the angle that Mitchell Starc was bowling and it kind of went inside Bavuma's hip and I didn't quite see it until really late and it kind of dipped on me a little bit late too as well.
""It was tricky, it didn't go in my hand very well and fortunately there is no break there and it just split the skin and dislocated it which made me feel pretty ill at that stage.""
The former captain's latest setback adds to a series of dramatic moments he has experienced at Lord's, including the infamous bouncer from Jofra Archer during the 2019 Ashes.
""I have a love/hate relationship with this place now,"" Smith stated.
""I have had some good memories here and some not so good ones as well.
""Getting hit in the head by Jofra (Archer) in 2019 and now having my digit knocked off out here yesterday as well.
""But it's a wonderful place to play cricket and I have enjoyed it here and it was a real good game of cricket again.""
Australia's medical staff will continue to monitor Smith's recovery, with hopes he could still feature in the upcoming three-Test series against the West Indies in the Caribbean.

Same old dreams,"US
.
I've learned not to trust people. Diplomats, men with shining armors, ministers of the sovereign and those on their chrome horses, as soon as you see either, run away. If you see them all together, your mother's curse continues to haunt you. Should've been a better son/daughter.
As Ronald Reagan put it ""The most terrifying words in the English Language are: I am from the Government and I am here to help.""
You want to know who really rules over you? Try and see those who you cannot criticise. Those who can't stand criticism are probably the ones who run the game and call the shots. But now you know who runs the party. The ruler who throws the party and declares himself to be the DJ too.
Speaking about the DJ, the government has recently directed all guest houses to have their guests registered mandatorily on what they call the 'Hotel Eye Software'. This software registers details of visitors. Such as name, date of birth and other personal credentials. It is said that this measure aims at curbing terrorism and illegal activities. By keeping an eye out on the identity of visitors, the government can now, maybe, anticipate who will engage in not so favourable activities.
Here comes unsolicited advice from a man who doesn't know any better. Perpetrators do not stay at guesthouses or hotels. They have safe houses which tend to be off the radar.
That was my one cent. The second cent is, we need Parliament Eye Software too. Where we as citizens keep an eye out on who is attending parliamentary sessions and see who is indulging in illegal activities. I reckon we're all prudent enough to fathom where most illegal activities happen. Yes, you guessed it right! The good old wax museum.
While we're at it, let's also have a Court House Eye Software. After all, the citizens pay taxes, right? They have all the right to know who enters and exits court houses too. Imagine the scope of this 'eye software' and places we can deploy it in.
Now that my views have been laid down and that too quite eloquently, let me clarify my position. The government shouldn't expect to crack down on terrorist activities by surveilling who sleeps where. At most, you'll end up cracking down on bad marriages. Your own house isn't in order (ask the Sunni Ittehad Council, they'll have something to say), why ruin someone else's?
In other news, Zahir Jaffer is being sent to the gallows. I don't know when though. Maybe he'll spend the rest of his life on death row. But, despite such overwhelming evidence, it took more than 4 years for him to be sentenced. Need I say more?
Unpopular opinion but I still think someone needs to get information out of Zahir Jaffer as to why he did what he did. There is no better way of learning homicidal behaviour than to speak with and study the perpetrator. Some MRIs, some CT scans and who knows, we might be able to build a blueprint of intervention programmes moving forward.
There is wisdom with psychopaths and we need to extract that wisdom to ensure we protect our communities and our people in the future. Zahir Jaffer wasn't the first and he is most definitely not the last and for us to learn from our mistakes, we need to treat this man as a subject of a study. Nothing will justify what he did but we might learn about the workings of an Islamabadi psychopath's brain. Islamabadi just makes it sound more pretentious.
What on God green's earth has gone wrong with the justice system in Islamabad? Judicial officers cannot seem to come to one page regarding how to run the system. The other day the paper said some judicial officer conceded to rifts within the system. What about the people who want justice and are not concerned with rifts?
Fun fact, 172,000 people (skilled labour) have already left the country since January 2025.

"Plates, pastels, and palette of blue","GB
Private Picasso ceramics go to auction in Geneva
Emblematic motifs from Picasso's artistic universe — pigeons, fish, a goat, a bull, and a bird adorn the colourful plates and dishes.
""It's a truly exceptional collection. The plates and dishes we have here are real Picasso works,"" Bernard Piguet, director of the Piguet auction house in Geneva, told AFP. ""These unique pieces belonged to Picasso's estate, and in the early 1980s, his heirs gave them to one of their friends,"" he said.
The close friend, a French art lover whose name has not been revealed, kept them until his death. His heirs have decided to put the ceramics up for sale.
Made between 1947 and 1963 in the Madoura workshop in Vallauris on the southeast French coast, the ceramic artworks are being exhibited to the general public for the first time ahead of Thursday's auction.
'Reasonable' prices
The seven pieces are being sold in separate lots.
Two large platters decorated with pigeons are both expected to fetch between 30,000 and 50,000 Swiss francs ($37,000-$61,500).
A third plate depicting three blue, pink, and brick-coloured fish on a white background, resembling a child's drawing, is estimated at 20,000 to 30,000 francs.
A thin brick, titled Head of a Bearded Man, and painted with ceramic pastels in yellow, white, garnet, brown, blue orange and green, has the same estimate.
Glazed on a painted background in shades of grey, brown, and black, a terracotta plate depicting a goat's head bears the prestigious stamp ""Original Picasso print"" on the back. It is valued at 20,000-30,000 francs.
The two others feature a bull on a hexagonal terracotta tile (15,000-20,000 francs), and a stylised bird on a plate painted in black and white (15,000-25,000 francs).
""It's a lot,"" Piguet said of the price. ""But don't forget that these are works of art in their own right and unique pieces"" without replicas. ""If you step back from Picasso's work and his drawings, which are becoming practically unaffordable today, you have here original works by Picasso that command a reasonable estimate.""
New outlet
Picasso was one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. The prolific Spanish painter died in 1973, aged 91.
He created thousands of plates, platters, vases, pitchers, and other earthenware utensils in the Madoura ceramics studio, run by the pottery couple Georges and Suzanne Ramie.
After World War II, ""Picasso was already an internationally-renowned artist,"" said Adeline Bisch Balerna, head of paintings and sculptures at Piguet. ""He had already opened up a huge number of avenues for all artists; the great, well-known works had been created, and he was seeking new means of expression for his art.""
Picasso would visit the Madoura studio, meet Georges Ranie, and be ""captivated by all the possibilities offered"" by this new artistic outlet, she explained.
Piguet is also auctioning two Picasso works ""never before seen on the art market"", from the same family friend's collection: Serenade (1919), an Indian ink and watercolour painting estimated at 20,000-30,000 francs, and the pencil drawing Famille balzacienne (1962), valued at 80,000-120,000 francs.
Unseen Klein
Meanwhile the contemporary art in Thursday's sale includes one of French artist Yves Klein's first blue monochromes, in what is its first appearance on the art market, according to Piguet auction house.
From 1959, Monochrome bleu sans titre (IKB 328), estimated at 100,000-150,000 francs, is painted in International Klein Blue, the deep blue hue developed by the artist himself.
""In daylight, it really has this luminous blue, this completely fascinating Klein blue. And when you put it indoors, you see it as a dark blue, almost midnight blue,"" said Bernard Piguet.
Klein died in 1962 aged 34, following a series of heart attacks.
The work comes from the collection of the Swiss artist couple Muriel and Gerald Minkoff, who liked to exchange their works with their contemporaries. It was discovered by their successors in their Geneva apartment, according to Piguet.

FBR may detain 'tax evaders' sans warrants,"US
Business community says 'unconstitutional' move to promote 'abuse of power'
The business community condemned the federal government's decision to allow the Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) to arrest traders and industrialists on suspicion of tax evasion.
Office bearers of the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Trade and Small Industry (HCSTSI), in their reaction to the federal and provincial budgets, categorically rejected the insertion of Section 37AA into the Sales Tax Act, on Sunday.
They contended that the powers authorised to the FBR are unconstitutional and undemocratic besides being inimical to trade and industry. HCSTSI President, Muhammad Saleem Memon stated ""granting FBR officers the power to arrest any trader without a warrant and to detain them for up to 14 days is a gross abuse of authority and a clear violation of human and economic rights."" The chamber demanded the government withdraw from this decision, warning that if the authorities remained stubborn, the business community would resort to nationwide protests.
With regard to the much delayed Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway project, the chamber complained that a paltry sum of Rs15 billion was earmarked for FY 2025-26, for a project requiring around Rs400 billion. Memon argued ""at this pace the project may take a decade or more to complete."" The business community viewed the allocation as a reflection of the centre's disregard for vital road projects, which would benefit hundreds of millions of people travelling within Sindh, and towards Punjab.

Residents capture two robbers,"US
Foil robbery attempt, thrash suspects before handover to police
Two suspected robbers attempting a late-night heist at a mobile phone shop at the Bhaiwala Stop in the 202RB area in Millat Town were caught and tortured by local residents before being handed over to the police.
The suspects entered the shop with the intention of robbery and tried to hold the shopkeeper hostage. However, citizens outside the premises noticed suspicious activity and raised alarm. The noise drew a crowd of locals who surrounded and overpowered the robbers, subjecting them to a violent beating.
Despite being informed, the Millat Town police allegedly arrived late at the scene. In the meantime, the Dolphin Force reached the location and rescued the alleged robbers from the mob, ensuring their safe transfer to the police station.
Police officials confirmed that an investigation and interrogation of the arrested robbers was under way.
A few days earlier, robbers had targeted another mobile phone shop and two pharmacies in the same area, raising concerns about increasing street crimes.
Meanwhile, the women police arrested two men for allegedly harassing a woman and threatening her after she refused to befriend them.
According to officials, Women Police Station SHO Madiha Irshad received a complaint from a citizen that his daughter was being pressured by Ammar and Tariq to befriend them. Upon her refusal, the suspects allegedly threatened her.
The SHO and her team conducted a raid and apprehended both the suspects who were shifted to the police lock-up for further legal proceedings. Commenting on the case, Faisalabad CPO Sahibzada Bilal Umar said the protection of women and children's rights remained the top priority of the police.
Inmates released
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Iqbal Harl and Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate Sheikh Abdul Razzaq paid an inspection visit to the central jail, where they ordered the release of 10 inmates involved in minor offences on personal surety bonds.
Jail Superintendent Sajid Baig and other officials gave the judges a detailed tour of the prison hospital, kitchen, barracks and cells. The visiting judges expressed satisfaction over the arrangements made by the jail administration.

PTI stares down mounting pressure,"US
As May 9 verdicts roll in, PTI caught between legal blows, isolation and internal disorientation
As anti-terrorism courts begin to hand down verdicts in the May 9 riot cases, the political stakes for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and its founding chairman, Imran Khan, are not only intensifying but also entering a new phase of vulnerability.
The reported conviction of a sitting PTI Member of the National Assembly, among others, marks more than just a legal precedent as it signals the beginning of a mounting pressure campaign on the party, just as it readies itself for yet another attempt to reclaim the streets.
But before PTI can reignite its street power, it must first grapple with three compounding challenges: tightening legal nooses, growing internal disarray exacerbated by Imran Khan's incarceration and isolation, and a widening gulf between the party and the powerful quarters.
Taken together, these dynamics have left the party politically disoriented, legally cornered and strategically adrift.
The May 9 violence, sparked by the arrest of PTI's newly-designated patron-in-chief in a corruption case, unleashed unrest across the country, including unprecedented attacks on military installations.
The state's response was swift and sweeping, with a crackdown leading to the arrest of dozens of leaders and supporters, many now facing anti-terrorism charges.
As convictions begin to roll in, political analysts believe the cost of staging fresh agitation is growing by the day.
Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, president of the Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (PILDAT), sees this as a pivotal moment.
""The government and the establishment have emerged stronger and more confident, especially after the recent [Pak-India] four-day war,"" he said, adding ""the support for agitation against government & establishment by PTI and its allies has also suffered further setback"".
Commenting on the convictions' aftermath, the PILDAT chief noted that there was a greater likelihood for harsher punishment for 9 May accused persons, adding, ""This judgment is indicative of the future trend of tougher actions"".
Mehboob felt that the vacuum at the top was another factor compounding the legal challenges for both Khan and the party.
Regarding the question of whether PTI's call for protest would gain traction, especially after the patron-in-chief first called for talks with the establishment and then announced a protest movement from jail, Mehboob felt that Imran Khan suffers from a lack of clarity in communication because he is unable to communicate directly from behind bars.
He noted that the visitors narrate Khan's point of view with a slant reflecting their personal views, which are often contradictory.
""Apparently, there is no clear and well-considered policy which the party has decided to follow,"" he said while listing down the reasons for constantly getting confused signals from PTI.
Mehboob said it shows a confused state of mind, which is quite natural in a situation where ""the supreme leader is behind the bar and isolated; and the rest of the party officials lack the trust and authority to take a decision as Khan can embarrass and snub them any time"".
Meanwhile, PTI's relationship with powerful stakeholders has hit a new low.
One example of it was witnessed when the party was excluded from a high-level field marshal's dinner to celebrate victory in the recent war, which the experts believe was a symbolic but telling snub.
The only invitation extended to PTI was sent to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur. Still, he skipped the event to attend a party meeting discussing Khan's release - an act that was seen by some as defiance, but by others as a missed opportunity.
""PTI should decide to either act as a ""revolutionary"" party by opting for the path of street agitation (which, in my opinion, may be a suicidal path) or act as a responsible political party which rules a province and may rule the country again,"" Mehboob said.
He said that PTI should not miss its official duties as a large political party and as the government of the province, and participate in all such state ceremonies and meetings as the dinner hosted by the field marshal. ""Trying to ride in two boats may land the party in mud,"" he concluded.
While sharing his views on the challenges being faced by PTI, Professor Tahir Naeem Malik of NUML University said that the verdict in the May 9 cases made it absolutely clear that the state was not going to go easy on PTI.
""The May 9 verdicts are not just legal judgments,"" the professor noted, ""they're part of a broader message that the state intends to draw a hard line.""
Commenting on Khan's desire to hold direct talks with the establishment, which was swiftly followed by his announcement to begin a new protest movement, Professor Malik said that it was a result of a lack of coordination among the party leadership, as they do not get frequent opportunities to devise political strategies amid changing circumstances.
""The top leadership is in jail and unable to take stock of the rapidly changing situation while those outside can't make decisions on their own,"" Professor Malik said, ""this has created confusion whether to negotiate or resist; hence, facing paralysis.""
Nonetheless, Malik said that the support from voters is still there for PTI, but it seems the party's ability to turn that into action has reduced, adding that slogans alone won't be enough without proper coordination and a clear plan.
On rifts, he said, with some form of reconciliation or reset, it's hard to see how PTI regains political space through traditional channels.

No ECP appointments sans PM-Opp consultation: NA,"US
CEC, ECP members' selection to follow full constitutional process, says NA speaker
The National Assembly Secretariat on Sunday clarified that the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and two members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was being carried out in full compliance with constitutional requirements and parliamentary procedures.
In response to recent media reports, the secretariat confirmed that National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has formally responded to a letter from Opposition Leader Omar Ayub regarding the appointments.

Realism and shifting tides of international relations,"IN
.
In the ever-evolving arena of international politics, the concept of permanent alliances or perpetual hostilities often proves to be a myth. As Lord Palmerston had put it long ago, ""We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual enemies. Our interests are eternal and perpetual, and those interests it is our duty to follow.""
This preposition remains central to realist thought in foreign policy, where national interest overrides ideological consistency or historical ties. Recent geopolitical developments — from the US President Donald Trump's unconventional diplomacy to shifting alliances in South Asia -— demonstrate these powerful illustrations of this timeless truth.
Trump recently visited the Middle East and had diplomatic engagements amid scenes of pomp and show. He had interactions with Saudi Arabia - which is poles apart from the US from an ideological perspective. One espouses democratic values and the other Sharia law with a dynastic rule. However, overridding considerations of lucrative arms deals and mutual economic benefits set all those ideals to naught. Trump even declared Saudi Arabia as a model for a reimagined Middle East, emphasising the promise of economic prosperity over instability in a region reeling from multiple wars.
Similarly, Trump's brief chat with President Ahmed al-Sharaa of Syria, though on the sidelines of his diplomatic initiatives, was widely speculated and analysed. He also announced easing sanctions on Syria to give the country ""a chance at peace"".
Trump's remarks and subsequent actions, however melodramatic in presentation, reflect the primacy of interest over principle. In the complex chessboard of international relations, strategic considerations often overshadow moral judgments.
Perhaps one of the most glaring examples of realist foreign policy was observed during the US-Taliban talks culminating in the 2020 Doha Agreement between the two.
After nearly two decades of warfare that claimed thousands of lives and cost billions of dollars, the US opted to negotiate directly with its once-archenemy. The very group that had been the target of a massive military campaign post-9/11 was now being recognised as a legitimate stakeholder in Afghanistan's future.
This position from combat to the negotiating table, sidelining Ashraf Ghani and finally abandoning his government, was not a reflection of ideological transformation but rather a calculated move to pull out the US troops from a protracted and unwinnable conflict. It was a textbook case of interest-based diplomacy.
This trend is not unique to the United States. China's recent diplomatic initiatives further portray the realist approach. The trilateral meeting of the foreign ministers of China, Pakistan and Afghanistan in Beijing marked a strategic reevaluation in the region. Expressing unanimity of views, the three states agreed to shore up diplomatic and economic engagement, assuring a cooperative stance on counterterrorism.
From a Chinese perspective this move would further enhance security along its western borders, ensuring the success of the Belt and Road Initiative, and countering the influence of rival powers in a geopolitically sensitive area.
Pakistan's participation in this meeting also reflects a realist recalibration. Once a frontline ally in the US-led War on Terror, Pakistan is increasingly leaning towards regional partnerships that align more closely with its evolving strategic and economic interests. The re-engagement with Afghanistan, under Taliban leadership no less, is a nod to regional stability over ideological divergence. It's a pragmatic choice aimed at containing security threats and fostering economic integration.
The meeting has also provided a fair chance to the de facto rulers of Afghanistan to gain legitimacy and economic lifelines. By engaging with regional powers like China and Pakistan, the Taliban seek to break out of international isolation and gain access to trade routes, infrastructure investments and diplomatic recognition. Once again, national interest overrides historical enmities or ideological moorings.
All those aforementioned events, underscore the relevance and utility of realism in international politics. Realism postulates that the international system is anarchic and that states primarily follow the law of self-preservation and prosperity. In such a system, moral principles, while not entirely absent, are often subordinated to strategic calculations. Ideological allies may quickly turn into enemies and former foes may transform into partners as dictated by the circumstances.
Critics of realism often decry its perceived cynicism and lack of moral compass. However, proponents argue that it is a sober and necessary lens through which to view global affairs. Idealism may inspire, but it is realism that governs the actions of states when stakes are high and options are limited.
Moreover, the real-world consequences of deviating from realism can be severe. History is replete with examples where ideological rigidity led to strategic blunders — from the Vietnam War to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Conversely, moments of pragmatic diplomacy — such as Nixon's visit to China or the Iran nuclear deal — have often yielded more sustainable outcomes.

KBA denounces parallel body by PBF,"US
We will take legal action, says secretary Zahid Malik
The Secretary of the Karachi Basketball Association (KBA) Zahid Malik has strongly condemned the Pakistan Basketball Federation (PBF) for forming a parallel and unauthorized association in Karachi, calling it a failed attempt to disrupt and damage the sport of basketball in the city.
In a statement issued on Sunday, Malik asserted that ""there is only one legally recognized basketball association in Karachi, with Advocate Ghulam Abbas Jamal Chaudhry, Director of Air Sial, serving as its President."" He challenged the legitimacy of the newly claimed 16 clubs, stating, ""If it can be proven that these 16 clubs exist as claimed in the disputed elections, I will bid farewell to basketball altogether.""
He further criticized the structure of the parallel body, highlighting the absence of female representation and the allotment of three positions to a single individual. Malik announced plans to file a petition in the High Court next week to clarify the KBA's legal standing and to expose the truth.
Expressing empathy for Ahmed Ali Rajput and Asghar Baloch, who attended the meeting allegedly under pressure, Malik said, ""We know the circumstances under which they were compelled to attend."" He has called for an urgent meeting of the KBA on Wednesday, June 18, at 8:00pm to discuss the matter further and initiate legal proceedings.
Meanwhile, the Annual KBA Summer Basketball Coaching Camp has commenced at the International Abdul Nasir Basketball Court in Aram Bagh. The camp is open to girls, boys, and senior players.

Sarkozy stripped of France's top honour,"US
.
Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been stripped of his Legion of Honour -- the country's highest distinction -- following a conviction for graft, according to a decree published Sunday.
The right-winger has been beset by legal problems since he was defeated in the 2012 presidential election after serving one five-year term.
Sarkozy, 70, had been wearing an electronic ankle tag until last month after France's highest appeals court upheld his conviction last December of trying to illegally secure favours from a judge.
According to the code of the Legion of Honour, France's top state award, any person definitively sentenced to a term in prison equal to or greater than one year is excluded from the order.
But French President Emmanuel Macron had argued against such a move in April, saying that scandal-plagued Sarkozy had been elected and it was ""very important that former presidents are respected"".
Despite his legal problems, Sarkozy remains an influential figure on the right and is known to regularly socialise with the president.
Sarkozy becomes the second former head of state to be stripped of the award after Nazi collaborator Philippe Petain, who was convicted in August 1945 for high treason and conspiring with the enemy.
Others to have been stripped of the honour include former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, drug cheat cyclist Lance Armstrong and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein whose conduct with women sparked the #MeToo movement against sexual violence.
Sarkozy is using his last remaining legal avenue, an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights, to defend himself against the conviction.
Sarkozy's lawyer Patrice Spinosi said the former president had ""taken note"" of the decision to strip him of the Legion of Honour, but stressed that the petition lodged with the ECHR was ""still pending"".
Any ECHR ruling against France would ""imply reviewing the criminal conviction against (Sarkozy) as well as his exclusion from the order of the Legion of Honour"", Spinosi said.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot stressed that the ""case has not been completely closed"" in view of the appeal at European level.
Government spokeswoman Sophie Primas added that comparisons between Sarkozy and Petain were ""shameful"".
Sarkozy is currently on trial in a separate case on charges of accepting illegal campaign financing in an alleged pact with late Libyan dictator Moamer Kadhafi.
The court is to issue a verdict in September with prosecutors asking for a seven-year prison term for Sarkozy, who denies the charges.
The Grand Chancellor of the Legion of Honour, General Francois Lecointre, has stressed the importance of disciplinary measures to uphold the order's integrity.
Lecointre told reporters in March that ""the honour of the order depends on the fact that those decorated can also be sanctioned.""

"Robbers loot medical store, grocery shops","IE
After fleeing the medical store, the same suspects targeted a nearby grocery shop.
A series of armed robberies have shaken the residents of Dhoke Banaras in the jurisdiction of Race Course Police Station. Two armed robbers carried out back-to-back heists, targeting a medical store and three grocery shops in Milt Colony, making off with cash and valuables.
CCTV footage of two of the incidents has surfaced, revealing masked robbers entering the medical store. In the footage, one can see the store owner holding his young son, believed to be around three to four years old, as the robbers enter.
One of the armed men is seen heading directly to the counter and taking cash from the register, while the other stands guard with a pistol in hand, showing no regard for the presence of the child. The robbers also frisked the store owner, taking any cash found in his pockets.
After fleeing the medical store, the same suspects targeted a nearby grocery shop. CCTV footage from the second location also shows the same individuals looting the store and fleeing the scene.
The robbers did not stop therethey looted two more nearby grocery shops before disappearing. Police arrived at the scene after being informed and collected evidence. However, the suspects remain at large, and no leads have been found so far.

'JUI-F's stance on establishment no secret',"US
Fazl urges powers that be to 'stay within their constitutional limits'
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has said his party's stance on the establishment's alleged role in politics is no secret and that it has always demanded that the powers that be keep themselves limited to the constitutional role.
""We have rejected the establishment's role in manipulating elections. We have always opposed the establishment's interference in politics, and this is our political stance and a political party does not abandon its stance,"" Fazl said on Sunday while addressing a rally in Hyderabad.
He said the establishment may be a power, but it is a subordinate one.
""If in Pakistan the right to rule belongs to the people, then the decisions of the people cannot be altered. Whoever tries to change the people's decisions is the greatest criminal against Pakistan, and it is this crime that we are fighting against.""
He said when India committed aggression against Pakistan last month, it was the JUI-F that urged the nation to stand united against India.
""We suspended our differences because it was a matter of the nation's survival and defence and we fulfilled our duty to defend the homeland.
""We encouraged our army and if our army achieved success in that war, that is exactly what we desirethat you demonstrate excellence in defence, not in politics.""
He said if the armed forces play their role in defence then they will honour them like a crown upon our heads. ""But if you try to forcibly sit on our heads, we will not tolerate it.""
He said God bestowed honour upon Pakistan and upon our defence leadership and that they should be thankful to God for this, and should not turn towards pride or arrogance.
He said today Israel is not only a cancer in the Arab world but also in the entire Islamic world.
""The dagger that British imperialism stabbed into the Arabs' back in the form of Israel still bleeds. But, God willing, Israel will be forced to swallow its own blood and will never gain dominance over the Islamic world,"" he added.

All-women breast radiation bay construction starts,"PK
Segregated facility at JPMC will serve up to 250 patients daily from Feb 2026
The Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), in a major step towards enhancing cancer care for women in Pakistan, has started the construction of the state-of-the-art ""Bilquis Abdul Sattar Edhi Breast Radiation Bay"", a facility aimed at providing international standard radiation therapy exclusively for female breast cancer patients, operated entirely by an all-women medical staff.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, JPMC Executive Director, Professor Shahid Rasool, revealed that the facility is aimed at addressing both the medical and emotional needs of women suffering with breast cancer. The new radiation bay is expected to cater to 200 to 250 patients, daily, upon completion.
The facility is to be equipped with two cutting-edge Helix Tomotherapy machines, which are capable of automatically adjusting during minor patient movements, ensuring precision by targeting only cancer-affected cells. This feature is especially critical during the hour-long radiation sessions when patients may inadvertently move. The new facility will use some of the most advanced global technology in cancer treatment
Professor Rasool highlighted that traditional radiation therapy, particularly for left-side breast cancer, poses risks to the heart. The new machines will employ Deep Inspiration Breath Hold (DIBH) technology, allowing radiation to be delivered while the patient holds a deep breath, increasing the distance between the heart and breast tissue, thereby reducing cardiac risk.
Notably, the entire facility staff will be women, providing emotional and psychological comfort to patients who often undergo not only physical pain, but also intense mental stress and feelings of shame and inferiority due to the nature of their illness. ""Hearing the word 'cancer' is devastating enough,"" Rasool noted, ""but for many women, the treatment process brings feelings of vulnerability and embarrassment. Having female staff can offer some much-needed dignity and support.""
The facility is expected to be operational by January-February 2026.

The rise of Islamic extremism across the world,"PK
.
Islamic extremists and their organisations have now turned their attention towards the parts of Africa where there are large Muslim populations but weak governments. The Islamists are now working through a new set of organisations. Asia is no longer their focus. After several years spent building its strength, Jamaat Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) is now the strongest military force in West Africa and among the most powerful in the world. It has overtaken al-Qaeda.
The JNIM was founded in Mali in 2017 as an umbrella organisation assembling four extremist groups. It is headed by Iyad Ag Gali and Ahmad Koufa, leaders of the 2012 uprising that came to be known as the ""Arab Spring"". Their organisation took over much of Mali's north. JNIM is ""creating a state that stretches like a belt from western Mali all the way to the borderlands of Benin. It is substantial — even exponential expansion,"" said Heni Nsaibia, senior analyst for the Armed Conflict Location & Event or Data or ACLED, a non-profit research organisation that keeps of track of the militant organisations.
Ag Gali belongs to the mostly Muslim Tuareg which has fought for decades to establish an independent Muslim state in northern Mali. Koufa is a Fulani preacher based in northern Mali. The differences between the two men have caused considerable uncertainty about the way Mali is likely to evolve.
According to ACLED, in most African countries the security situation has deteriorated. In 2024, Burkina Faso ranked as the nation most affected by terrorist violence for a second straight year, and Niger saw the largest increase in terrorism-related deaths in the world. Increasingly, experts see JNIM's informant and supply chains stretching into stable nations such as Ghana, Senegal and Guinea.
Several people who spoke to the journalists who were gathering material for an analysis for The Washington Post recounted how gun-toting JNIM members burst into mosques in Burkina Faso in recent years, announcing that strict Islamic laws would be implemented, schools would be closed and state institutions would be targeted. Violating the rules would carry a heavy price, probably public execution.
According to ACLED, nearly 6,000 civilians have been killed, mostly for not following the rules being imposed by JNIM. There are real-time contacts between the Islamic groups operating in various parts of the world. The JNIM programme echoes the one being followed by the Taliban regime in Afghanistan.
Somalia, a highly disturbed county in the horn of Africa, has also suffered because of the changing global approach by the United States under the leadership of President Donald Trump. Because of the pullout of America from the area, al-Shabab, one of the affiliates of al-Qaeda, has taken control of important towns from Somali forces since the beginning of 2025.
The new administration in Washington does not believe that this group poses a direct threat to the US forces. But according to Matt Bryden, founder of Sahan, a Nairobi-based think-tank, the gaining strength of al-Shabab ""would have far-reaching implications for US policy in Africa and much of the Middle East"".
The sudden breakup of the Soviet Socialist Republics, the USSR, in 1991, was the result of the defeat of its troops to save from collapse the Communist regime Moscow had installed in Kabul. Moscow was defeated be seven Islamic groups that called themselves the mujahideen who were able to march from the Pak-Afghan border to Kabul.
They did this with the help of the security services of Pakistan. Mikhail Gorbachev signed the Geneva agreement, with Pakistan included as one of the signatories, which assured a peaceful exit of the Soviet troops in 1989. The countries along the periphery of the collapsed Soviet Union gained independence. Among those that became independent states were the Muslim states of Central Asia.
There were attempts by some elements in these countries to bring Islam into the pattern of governance. These developments were analysed by Barnett R Rubin, noted American authority on the Middle East, who has studied the threat of radical Islam to stability in the Middle East and Central Asia. In a presentation organised by the Asia Society's Asian Social Issues, he focused on local developments in the republics of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan and how they might affect the spread of radical Islam in the area.
According to Rubin, the JNIM leadership is watching the developments in Syria. Corrine Dufka, another Middle East watcher, based in Washington, believes there is a model for mainstreaming the trajectory of Islamic movements. Some of JNIM senior leaders are looking at Ahmed al-Sharra — Syrian leader who has recast himself as a moderate after once being closely associated with al-Qaeda. He was embraced by the Americans when, during the recent visit to the Middle East, President Trump found him to be an attractive person to lead Syria.
The way the United States left Afghanistan after having been present in that country for 20 years has followed the same approach in West Africa and the Middle East. According to the Defense Department in Washington, there are now fewer than 200 United States troops in the area — down from 1,400 as recently as 2023. ""JNIM is now ascendant, but would likely collapse into many parts,"" one former senior official said to me in a conversation, aware that I was writing on the development of Islamic radicalism around the world. ""In a region where we used to monitor and influence developments, we no longer have the tools that follow those policies.""
According to the official I spoke to, ""we are concerned about President Hassan Sheikh Mohammad's prioritization of internal politics and leaving the ground to al-Shabab, the most lethal associate of the once-powerful Al-Qaeda which has pushed the government forces out of several towns in the country's west.""
Somalia's fractious government which operates from Mogadishu, the country's capital, was propped up by the United States aided by an extensive African Union peace-keeping operation. The AU also had the help of the United States, receiving both training and equipment from Washington.
With the Americans no longer closely involved, there is opportunity to act on the part of other regional powers. The obvious candidates are Iran, Turkey and possibly Pakistan. If Pakistan were to be involved, it would do so with the backing of China. This is a subject on which I will write later.

Sinner to bounce back from FO defeat,"US
The world number one will begin his campaign in Halle Open on Monday
World number one Jannik Sinner wants to use the Halle Open as a chance to bounce back from sleepless nights after his agonising loss to rival Carlos Alcaraz in the French Open final this month.
In a thrilling showdown, Sinner took the first two sets and had three match points in the fourth set, but Spaniard Alcaraz persevered to grind out a 4-6 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6(10-2) win in five hours and 29 minutes - the longest final at Roland Garros.
Asked if he had thought about the championship points he failed to convert, Sinner told reporters on Saturday: ""Often. It happens. I don't know how it will look in the future.
""I think that it is not the most important thing, but I nevertheless try to forget the negative things and see what I can do here"" in Halle. ""I think that for me to play another tournament is positive, because every match is a new beginning, and I must be mentally ready to give my all on the court. Therefore, it is great I can be here in Halle. Yes, I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better.""
The 23-year-old Italian is the reigning champion at Halle and will seek to defend his crown at the tournament, which starts on Monday, as he gears up for Wimbledon, which will be held from June 30 to July 13 at the All England Lawn Tennis Club.
""The first practice session was OK. I hadn't played since Paris, so my general feelings on the court were not so perfect,"" Sinner said. ""I think a good grass-court player can move well.
The ball can bounce a bit funny because of the grass, and you have to serve intelligently.
""But in general, it is a surface on which I took a step forward last year and we will see how it goes this year.""
Fritz lifts Stuttgart title as Zverev's grass-court wait goes on
Taylor Fritz claimed his first title of the year with a 6-3 7-6(0) win over top seed Alexander Zverev in the Stuttgart Open final on Sunday, extending his winning streak against the German to five matches.
Fritz, who knocked out Zverev in the fourth round of Wimbledon last year, won the opening set 6-3 in 30 minutes without facing a break point.
The American second seed broke for a 5-3 lead after Zverev double-faulted twice and missed a volley at the net.
The second set stayed on serve, with Zverev saving the only break point at 5-5 before Fritz pulled away in a one-sided tiebreak to seal victory.
It was Fritz's ninth career title, fourth on grass, and improved his head-to-head record against Zverev to 8-5. The 28-year-old Zverev is yet to win a title on grass, a surface he has long struggled on.
The three-times Grand Slam finalist has never progressed beyond the fourth round at Wimbledon. World number seven Fritz, 27, is set to rise to fourth in the rankings ahead of Wimbledon, which runs from June 30 to July 13.

Iran border crossings in Balochistan sealed,"RO
Citizens advised to stay vigilant as tensions rise
In response to growing security concerns linked to escalating regional tensions, the Balochistan government has officially closed all border crossings with Iran in Gwadar and Panjgur districts, suspending both pedestrian and fuel transport until further notice.
The development comes as Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar confirmed that 450 Pakistani pilgrims were evacuated from Iran earlier today, with more to follow from the neighbouring country as well as from Iraq.
According to official updates issued today by various deputy commissioners across the province, these measures are being taken as a precaution to safeguard public safety amid uncertainty stemming from the deteriorating situation in neighbouring Iran.
A statement from the office of the Gwadar Deputy Commissioner confirmed the closure of the Gabd-Kalato 250 border corridor. ""Following provincial directives, the Gabd-Kalato crossing has been sealed indefinitely. Citizens are urged to stay informed and contact local authorities for guidance,"" the statement said.
Similarly, the Panjgur district administration announced the suspension of all movement across the Iranian border routes, including the complete ban on fuel transportation. Officials cited the potential for instability in Iran and the wider region as the primary motivation behind the move.
""The decision aims to prevent any unforeseen incidents due to international tensions,"" said the Panjgur DC, emphasising that the public's cooperation is vital during this period. The statement called on residents to avoid unnecessary travel and remain vigilant.
These restrictions come as residents in Balochistan already face fuel shortages and increasing concerns over regional security, especially in light of recent geopolitical developments involving Iran.
Meanwhile, in a post on X this afternoon, Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar stated that the government was taking all necessary steps to ensure the safety and welfare of Pakistani nationals.
On Friday, Israel launched an air offensive targeting Iran, striking nuclear facilities and killing several commanders and scientists.
The assault was described as an attempt to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon, an allegation Iran has repeatedly denied, insisting its uranium enrichment programme is solely for civilian use.

Smuggling of innocence,"US
.
In a disturbing reminder of the dark underbelly of organised crime in Pakistan, the Federal Investigation Agency recently apprehended five suspects — including two female doctors — who allegedly attempted to smuggle a nine-month-old infant from Karachi to Mozambique. This case is an indictment of a deeply entrenched smuggling mafia that thrives on exploiting the most vulnerable in our society.
Child smuggling in Pakistan is not a new phenomenon, but its rise in frequency and boldness should ring alarm bells in every government corridor. Infants and children are trafficked not just for illegal adoptions but also for forced labour, organ trade and even more sinister purposes. The fact that this attempted smuggling involved a foreign destination highlights the transnational nature of this criminal network.
For years, Pakistan has lacked an effective national mechanism to combat child trafficking. Coordination between hospitals, NADRA, immigration authorities and law enforcement remains patchy at best. Investigations often stop at the lowest rung of the ladder, while those who orchestrate and profit from these crimes operate untouched.
This must change. The FIA must be empowered not only to arrest, but to dismantle. That means going beyond the immediate suspects — tracking money trails and identifying complicit officials along with exposing the networks behind such trafficking rings. The involvement of doctors in this case must serve as a wake-up call for regulatory bodies to audit and monitor professionals more rigorously. Moreover, there is a dire need for stronger laws and tighter implementation of child protection protocols.
Our children are not commodities. If we fail to act with urgency and resolve, we risk letting an entire generation fall into the hands of those who view them only as profit.

PPP women wing leader among 3 slain,"PK
Police launch investigation, forensic teams comb evidence, CCTV footage
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Women Wing's central leader Samrah Batool was gunned down in a triple murder in Mandi Town.
District Police Officer (DPO) Shehzad Rafiq Awan said the triple murder took place in the Mandi Town area near Mill Gate.
Samrah Batool was reportedly living independently at the time of the attack.
Two men were also killed in the incident, including a man named Irfan Bhatti. The third victim has yet to be officially identified.
Initial investigations suggest the killings were the result of a targeted assault, but the exact motives remain unknown.
Forensic and crime scene investigation teams reached the spot, while CCTV footage from nearby shops is being collected to piece together the sequence of events.
Samrah Batool's son, Yasir Abbas and her cousin Zain told police that Irfan Bhatti had come to visit Batool at her residence. They left the house briefly to withdraw cash from a nearby outlet.
When they returned, they found the lifeless bodies of Samrah Batool and the two men.
Based on CCTV evidence and preliminary forensic analysis, police believe a man identified as Sanaullah first opened fire on Samrah Batool and Irfan Bhatti before turning the weapon on himself in what appears to be a double murder-suicide.
Forensic experts noted a gunshot wound to the right side of Sanaullah's head, with burn marks around the wound consistent with a self-inflicted shot at close range.
The three bodies were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital for post-mortem examination. Legal proceedings have been initiated and police say they are pursuing all possible angles to ascertain the facts.
Bhakkar DPO said that the culprits, if any remain at large, will be apprehended within 24 hours and brought to justice.
In a separate incident in the Jhok Lal Shah area of Panjgiran, a man stabbed and killed his elder brother over a minor verbal dispute.
Police said the suspect, the younger brother, used a knife to fatally wound Naeer Abbas during a heated argument. Locals described the victim as a harmless individual who fell prey to a moment of domestic rage.
The accused fled the scene, and efforts to arrest him are ongoing.
Another act of violence occurred in Jhok Mitho Shah Notak, where a dispute between friends during the opening ceremony of a local shop turned deadly. According to eyewitnesses, the argument began over the distribution of rice.
Tempers flared, and one of the individuals pulled out a weapon and fatally shot his friend in front of the gathering. Police have cordoned off the area and launched a manhunt for the suspect.
A fatality occurred in Kotla Jam, where a young man lost his life in an apparent accident. The victim, who was bathing in a tubewell, sustained a critical head injury and drowned.
Authorities suspect the injury caused unconsciousness, leading to the accidental death.
Political activists said Samrah Batool was a prominent figure in the district's political landscape.
Bhakkar District Police Officer Shehzad Rafiq Awan, while speaking to The Express Tribune, emphasised that a full-scale investigation is under way and that all relevant agencies, including forensic teams, are actively working on the cases.

36 more countries likely to face US travel ban,"US
.
US President Donald Trump's administration is considering significantly expanding its travel ban by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.
Earlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against ""foreign terrorists"" and other national security threats.
The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from US universities and deport others.
In an internal diplomatic cable signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.
""The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days,"" the cable sent out over the weekend said. The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.
Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said.
Some countries were overstaying the US visas their citizens were being granted. Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or antisemitic and anti-American activity.
The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed. The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote D'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal and others.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has confirmed that 450 Pakistani pilgrims have been successfully evacuated from Iran, stating that the government was taking all necessary measures to ensure the safety of Pakistani nationals in the region.
In a statement released on X on Sunday, Dar said the evacuation of 450 Pakistani pilgrims from Iran was completed on Saturday.
He added that arrangements are also being made for the safe evacuation of the first batch of 154 Pakistani students stranded in Iran.
The foreign minister further stated that efforts are underway to evacuate and ensure the safe accommodation of Pakistanis stranded in Iraq.
""Our embassy in Iraq is in contact with Pakistani Zaireen who are stranded due to the closure of airspace. Measures are underway to ensure their safe stay in Iraq and possible evacuation,"" said Dar. A 24-hour Crisis Management Unit (CMU) is active at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist Pakistani nationals.
The CMU can be reached at +92 51-9207887 or via email at cmu1@mofa.gov.pk. ""Our embassies in the region are closely coordinating all necessary efforts to support Pakistani nationals and Zaireen,"" he added.
In the early hours of Friday, Israel launched an attack on Iran, targeting the country's nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories, and military personnel.
The assault marked the beginning of what Israel described as a prolonged military engagement, carried out under the pretext of preventing Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.
Seventy-eight people, including six nuclear scientists and senior generals of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), were killed in the attack.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency identified the scientists as Abdulhamid Minouchehr, Ahmadreza Zolfaghari, Seyyed Amirhossein Faqhi, Motablizadeh, Mohammad Mehdi Tehranchi and Fereydoun Abbasi.
Iranian ballistic missile attacks killed three people and injured at least 91 across central Israel, in response to Israeli airstrikes targeting key nuclear and military sites inside Iran.
In the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, nine buildings were destroyed and hundreds of apartments were damaged, Haaretz reported. Approximately 400 residents were evacuated from the Greater Tel Aviv area due to structural damage.
Visuals showed widespread devastation, including vehicles set ablaze and residential blocks flattened.

A crippling water crisis has gripped Abbottabad city and the suburban village of Bagh, depriving thousands of residents of clean drinking water for over 10 days. What began as a shortage has now escalated into a full-blown humanitarian emergency.
With taps running dry, life has become unbearable for residents. Women and children walk for miles daily, carrying heavy containers on their heads to fetch water from distant springs and makeshift streams. Clashes have erupted over scarce water supplies, raising fears of a breakdown in public order.
Despite repeated complaints lodged with the newly elected MPA and MNA, and official reports submitted to the Public Health Department, authorities have yet to take meaningful action. Local representatives remain silent, offering no assurance to those suffering.

Taha G gets real about reset and resilience,"US
Singer hints at healing and making his comeback
Anyone who has dedicated 2025 to having a mental reset will find a kindred spirit in singer Taha G, who earlier this week took to Instagram to do some soul searching as he penned raw reflections on resilience and growth in the face of adversity.
""Half the year is already gone damn, bumpier than I thought it would be,"" confessed the High On You singer. Laying his own vulnerabilities bare for his followers to mull over, he continued, ""From being broke to questioning if I'm even good enough as an artist, to feeling completely lost and broken mentally, I've gone through more phases than I can count.""
Taha's post comes amid the backdrop of a difficult year, with the musician having been forced to cancel a concert in Karachi in May due to ""unforeseen logistical issues"", for which he had profusely apologised to his followers on Instagram at the time.
The artist reminded his followers that when it comes to social media, what you see online rarely depicts reality. ""Truth is, what you see on here isn't always the full picture,"" he added. ""Behind the posts are real struggles, real doubts and real pain.""
However, much like a phoenix is reborn from the ashes, Taha's overall message was one of hope, despite the struggles he has had to overcome in the wake of recent setbacks.
""I'm still here,"" he reminded his followers. Reinforcing his commitment to his career, the singer noted, ""The second half of this year is personal and I [have got to] lock in. I'm choosing to shift my mentality, rebuild my confidence and focus on my comeback. I assure you it's coming, because I can change my life and this G will.""
Rounding off on a positive note with a glass-half-full attitude, Taha ended his post with a high-five emoji as he concluded, ""Time for growth, healing and rising again.""

44 houseboats restored at last floating village,"US
.
Pakistan's last surviving houseboat village on Manchar Lake, near Sehwan in Sindh, has been significantly restored in a landmark cultural preservation project.
A total of 44 traditional houseboats, known as Galiyo, and the smaller fishing boats known as Hurro have been carefully restored as part of a 20-month initiative led by two academics from NED University's Department of Architecture and Planning.
Currently, around 370 members of the Mohanna community — descendants of two brothersreside on these traditional Galiyos.
Funded by the UK Government's Cultural Protection Fund and implemented in partnership with the British Council, the project has also gifted two newly built Galiyo houseboats — Sohni and Laal — to the Mohanna community.
Named after characters from Sindhi folklore, these houseboats will support the launch of ""Manchar Lake Mohannas Tours"", a community-led tourism initiative featuring birdwatching, cultural games, local cuisine, heritage experiences and other community endeavors.
Historically a few decades ago, hundreds of houseboats floated along the Indus River from southern Punjab to interior Sindh. Today, only a few dozen remain primarily due to pollution, environmental changes, and the devastating impact of the Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD).
The RBOD was designed to carry saline, toxic, and wastewater, mostly from irrigation drainage, from the right bank of the Indus River safely into the Arabian Sea.

Post-Hajj flights continue amid tensions,"IT
Pakistan airspace becomes key route amid global traffic disruptions
The Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony confirmed on Sunday that the post-Hajj flight operation was continuing successfully despite global air traffic disruptions.
Ministry Spokesperson Muhammad Umar Butt said as of Saturday, a total of 11,418 Pakistani pilgrims had returned home from Saudi Arabia, while 4,995 more pilgrims were expected to arrive via 20 flights scheduled to land across five major cities on Sunday.
""Today, six flights each will land in Islamabad and Lahore, four in Karachi, three in Multan, and one in Quetta,"" the spokesperson stated. The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) will operate eight of these flights; Saudi Airlines, five; AirBlue, four; AirSial, two; and Serene Air one.
""Despite the international challenges in air traffic, the return operation is proceeding efficiently,"" he noted, urging the pilgrims to maintain discipline to ensure a smooth repatriation process. Pilgrims were also advised to strictly adhere to the instructions.
Pak airspace becomes key route
Several foreign airlines have started using Pakistan's airspace for various international destinations as airspace closures continued in the Middle East region because of the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, data shows.
Major carriers, including Emirates, are now flying over northern Pakistan on routes to North America, Egypt, and other destinations. Their flight paths pass through western Pakistan, then proceed over Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan, and Turkey before heading west.
The airspaces of Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Israel remained closed. The major airlines affected by the regional tension include El Al, Emirates, Lufthansa, Air India, Aeroflot, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, subsidiary AJet, Aegean Airlines, Wizz Air Abu Dhabi, and flydubai.
These carriers have suspended flights to and from Israel, Iran, Iraq, and Jordan or rerouted flights over safer airspace such as Central Asia or Saudi Arabia. Iraq's closure affects one of the busiest air corridors between Europe and the Gulf.
The airspace of Israel and Iran remained closed on Sunday. Jordan – which geographically lies between the two warring countries – reopened its airspace after a temporary closure. Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports have reported delays and cancellations linked to these restrictions.
Israel's Ben Gurion Airport, its main international terminal, remained shut with all flights suspended until further notice, according to the Israel Airports Authority. Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation confirmed its airspace closure would remain in effect until Sunday evening. With input from agencies

As America reeled from its latest spasm of political violence, lawmakers called for a return to civility in political discourse that has been overheated and angry for years.
Authorities searched for a man identified as Vance Boelter, 57, who also allegedly shot and wounded another lawmaker and his wife early Saturday in the northern state bordering Canada.
Officials said Boelter impersonated a police officer as he came to the homes of these couples near Minneapolis and shot them, and that officers found a manifesto and a list of other lawmakers and potential targets in his car.

LHC voids DC rate hike for Kottha Kalan,"US
Petitioner argues DC is authorised to hike rates by a maximum of 10% annually
Justice Rasal Hassan Syed of the Rawalpindi Bench of the Lahore High Court (LHC) has declared null and void the decision by the District Collector (Deputy Commissioner) of Rawalpindi to drastically increase the official DC (Deputy Commissioner) property valuation rates for the historic British-era neighbourhoods of Kottha Kalan I and Kottha Kalan II, effective from July 1, 2024.
In his verdict, Justice Syed ordered the DC to give a proper hearing to senior bar member Advocate Asif Chaudhry, the petitioner, and to reassess the DC rate for the said area on merit within one month. The petitioner has also been directed to appear before the DC and present his arguments.
Advocate Asif Chaudhry contended in court that Kottha Kalan I and II fall within the municipal limits of Rawalpindi. Until June 30, 2024, the official DC rate for residential properties in Mouza Kottha Kalan ranged from Rs225,000 to Rs372,000. However, this rate was arbitrarily increased by 300% to Rs2,067,000 for residential properties, and Rs4,286,300 for commercial propertiesreportedly the highest rate across all Mouzas in Rawalpindi.
The petitioner argued that, according to regulations, the District Collector is authorised to increase property rates by a maximum of 10% annually at the start of each new fiscal year. However, for the first time in Rawalpindi's history, the rate was hiked by an unjustified 300%, leading to a complete halt in property transactions — both domestic and commercial — in the affected areas.
Advocate Chaudhry requested the court to annul the excessive increase and direct the District Collector to revise the rate within legal limits, not exceeding 10%. The court upheld this stance, revoked the existing order of the District Collector, and instructed that a fresh, merit-based decision be made within one month in accordance with the rules.
The court also directed the petitioner to formally appear before the District Collector to present his constitutional and legal arguments.
As the new fiscal year beginning July 1, 2025, approaches, the District Collector is also tasked with determining the official property valuation rates for the 2025-2026 financial year.

'The Simpsons' has no time for toxic politics,"IT
'The Simpsons' creator on laughs beyond the US ballot
Like many American families struggling for unity in the polarised United States, The Simpsons have decided to avoid political jokes, the creator of the series Matt Groening told AFP.
Despite the potential for storylines and humour, Groening ruled out venturing into America's toxic politics for laughs.
""We don't do political humour because political humour is very limited. It dates very quickly,"" he said during an interview at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in the French Alps.
A Simpsons season takes at least six to nine months to produce, raising the risk of gags turning stale, Groening explained.
The show – broadcast on US network Fox TV and on Disney Plus, which now owns the series – has sometimes appeared to predict real events, such as Donald Trump's election, which was first referenced in an episode in 2000.
It has also featured parodies in the past of a host of politicians from Bill Clinton to Barack Obama, George W Bush and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
""We just have to stay true to our characters, their spirit and their relationships. And when they face the sadness of the world, people feel briefly connected to them,"" writer-producer Matt Selman told AFP.
Despite Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie remaining frozen in time since their debut in 1989, the writers have ensured the story lines move with the times.
A recent episode parodied artificial intelligence when a chatbot was asked to write the finale.
""In the plot of that episode, AI was given the job of writing the perfect finale. And of course, it just regurgitated and spat out all the other finales from all the other shows in very unoriginal and silly ways that, of course, would be terrible,"" said Selman.
""It was our attempt to push back at AI, push back at ever ending the show.""
The natural environment remains a rich source of inspiration, including in The Simpsons Movie in 2007, which featured a disaster caused by Homer that leads to Springfield being sealed under a giant dome.
""The environment's not going to get cleaned up anytime soon,"" Groening added.
The Simpsons Movie grossed $536.4 million worldwide, but the creators ruled out making a sequel - for the moment.
""We are still recovering from the first movie,"" joked Groening. ""And the sad truth is we don't have enough time to do both the show and the movie unless we decide we want to work really, really hard.""
The Simpsons has been translated into 26 languages and broadcast in around 100 countries.
The 800th episode is set to air in early 2026.

PPP workers announce hunger strike,"US
Express outrage at select workers meeting with party leadership in President House
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) organisations have announced a hunger strike camp outside the Presidency, Governor House and Benazir Bhutto's martyrdom site to protest against allowing friends, business partners, relatives and domestic staff of workers to meet President Asif Zardari at the Presidency.
PPP organisations have also announced a major protest demonstration at the Benazir Bhutto's martyrdom site. The decision was taken by PPP workers, Peoples Students Federation, Peoples Labour Bureau, Peoples Trader Cell and PPP Women's wing leaders and workers in a meeting held at a local hotel in Committee Chowk Rawalpindi under the chairmanship of former provincial candidate and central leader Banaras Chaudhry.
Tauqeer Abbasi, Iqbal Khattak, Tariq Waheed Butt, assembly candidate Adeel Malik, Tahir Ikram Chaudhry, District Information Secretary Muhammad Shahid, Women Wing leader Gulnaz Badshah, Councillor Rabia and Shazia Batool were also present at the meeting. While addressing the gathering, he said that instead of the workers who made sacrifices, former MD Baitul Mal Aamir Paracha took his business partners, friends, acquaintances, employees and a few workers t Eid Milan Party at the President's residence.
The dedicated workers were not even informed about the event. They accused the ""selfie mafia"" of causing irreparable damage to Rawalpindi PPP group. They stated that while workers go to jail and make sacrifices, when the opportunity arose to meet the leadership, Aamir Paracha took his friends and associates to the event. They claimed that they have been making sacrifices for the party for the last 30 to 50 years.
They demanded that President Asif Zardari, Chairman Bilawal Bhutto, and Asifa Bhutto hold open courts for workers in Islamabad two to three times a week and listen to their grievances directly. They alleged that certain elements with access to the leadership provide them with misleading reports.

Trump eyes Iran-Israel peace via Putin,"IT
Cites Pak-India ceasefire as proof of his peacemaking prowess
Despite evidence of escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, US President Donald Trump expressed optimism on Sunday that peace would come soon to Middle East, citing his track record as a dealmaker during the Pakistan-India conflict last month.
In a social media post, Trump said there were many unspecified meetings about the issue happening and encouraged the two countries to make a deal. And in an interview with ABC News, he cited the possibility that Russia president Vladimir Putin could help.
Trump acknowledged the possibility of US involvement in the Iran-Israel crisis and emphasised his track as a peacemaker as proof of his diplomatic prowess. However, the US president echoed his frustration that he was not given the due appreciation for his efforts.
Pakistan and India engaged in a four-day conflict from May 7 to 10, started by India's missile strikes against mosques and other civilian targets in six Pakistani cities. Pakistan responded with downing six and Indian jets on May 7 and hitting 26 military targets in the morning of May 10.
Later on that day, it was the US president who broke the news in a social media post that both Pakistan and India had agreed to a ceasefire because of his intense diplomatic efforts. His announcement later drew flak in India, which denied the US influence in its truce decision.
""I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that's OK, the PEOPLE understand,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, echoing his frustration over what he sees as underappreciated achievements. ""MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!"" he said, referring to his efforts for de-escalation between Iran and Israel.
""Iran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal,"" Trump wrote. ""We will have PEACE, soon, between Israel and Iran! Many calls and meetings now taking place,"" he added, without offering any details about the meetings or evidence of progress toward peace.
Trump, meanwhile, told ABC News that Iran wanted to make a deal and indicated something like the Israel strikes would accelerate that. ""Something like this had to happen because I think even from both sides. They want to talk, and they will be talking,"" Trump said.
Conflict between Iran and Israel over the former's nuclear programme escalated on Friday when Israeli unleashed missile and air strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities and top military leadership. Tehran said that top three general and several nuclear scientists were killed in that attack.
Iran replied with launching barrages of missiles along with swarms of drones, hitting several targets inside Israel. On the third day of these exchanges, the world capitals were abuzz with hectic diplomatic activities to calm down the two sides.
However, so far, Iran and Israel were showing no sign of taking a step back. Iran also denied a claim from President Nikos Christodoulides of Cyprus that Tehran has asked Cyprus to convey ""some messages"" to Israel. Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that no message had been sent to Israel via a third party.
While on a visit to Greenland, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed the hope for a return to calm ""in the coming hours"". His statement came as German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said Germany, France and Britain were ready to hold immediate talks with Iran over its nuclear programme.
Simultaneously, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer urged ""diplomacy and dialogue"" in his talk with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on the ""grave situation"" in the Iran-Israel conflict, according to a Downing Street statement.
Also Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Trump held telephonic conversation on the Iran-Israel conflict. His call came as the Group of Seven leaders gather in the Canadian Rockies for their annual summit meeting, where the issue was likely to figure prominently.
The United States has engaged in talks with Iran about its nuclear programme and Trump has told reporters previously that the talks were going well. But another round of discussions scheduled for Sunday in Oman was cancelled after the Israeli and Iranian strikes.
Trump said he and Putin discussed the Middle East situation on Saturday in a call that focused more on that conflict than the war in Ukraine. ""He is ready. We had a long talk about it,"" he said about Putin serving as a mediator. ""This is something I believe is going to get resolved.""

How playing Elizabeth Bennet changed Keira,"IT
Actor thought she was terrible before 'P&P' role
As Pride & Prejudice marks its 20th anniversary this year, Keira Knightley is revisiting the film that she says redefined how she was viewed in Hollywood. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, the British actor opened up about her career trajectory before and after the 2005 Jane Austen adaptation, which earned her an Academy Award nomination at just 20 years old.
Knightley, who had already achieved global recognition for her roles in Pirates of the Caribbean and Bend It Like Beckham, said she felt dismissed by critics early in her career despite commercial success.
""Pirates of the Caribbean had already come out, but I think in the public consciousness, I was seen as a terrible actress,"" Knightley admitted. ""But I had this phenomenally big success with Pirates. And I think Pride & Prejudice was the first one that was a phenomenally big success, but was also critically acclaimed.""
Knightley said the response to Pride & Prejudice stood in stark contrast to the reception of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, which was released around the same time. ""I got the worst reviews ever for that, and then also being nominated for an Oscar at the same time — it was, in my 21-year-old head, quite confusing.""
Reflecting on her earlier breakout role in Bend It Like Beckham, which was released when she was just 17, Knightley revealed that the reviews she remembers most were the negative ones. ""All those voices of self-doubt are so loud when you are in your teens or 20s,"" she said. ""But in an adult brain that's got a lot of experience, you can kind of go, 'You know what? It's okay. Today may not be my day, but tomorrow it might be better.'""
The actor has previously described 2005 as a year of extremes. Speaking to The Times, she called it a ""making and breaking"" moment in her career. ""They were the most successful films I'll ever be a part of and they were the reason that I was taken down publicly,"" she said. ""So they're a very confused place in my head.""
Knightley's candid reflections arrive as Pride & Prejudice enjoys renewed attention two decades on, with fans and critics alike continuing to celebrate its portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet - a role that, for Knightley, was as redemptive as it was career-defining.

"Digitalisation: avenues, hurdles","PK
Will digital currency, laws to discourage cash deals bridge informal economy gap?
The global financial landscape is undergoing a profound transformation with the advent of digital currencies, mobile banking, and fintech innovations. These advancements are reshaping economies by promoting financial inclusion, enhancing transparency, and reducing reliance on cash-based transactions. In Pakistan, a country with a significant cash-based economy, the push toward digitalisation of currency and financial inclusion is gaining momentum. The government and financial regulators, led by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), have introduced policies and regulations to encourage digital payments and discourage cash transactions. These efforts aim to modernise the economy, combat the informal sector, and integrate millions of unbanked individuals into the formal financial system.
However, the transition to a digital economy is not without challenges, including infrastructural limitations, regulatory complexities, and socio-economic barriers. This article explores the digitalisation of currency in Pakistan, its role in promoting financial inclusion, the laws and regulations designed to reduce cash usage, and the advantages and disadvantages of this shift.
Financial inclusion, a key objective of digitalisation, aims to provide affordable and accessible financial services to underserved and unbanked populations. According to the World Bank, 1.4 billion people globally remain unbanked, with Pakistan accounting for a significant portion mainly due to illiteracy, no access to banks or the inability of Pakistan Post to offer banking services like Singapore Post, hence Pakistan has a large informal economy, especially in rural areas. Digital financial services, such as mobile banking and digital wallets, have proven effective in bridging this gap by enabling low-cost transactions, savings, and credit access without the need for physical bank branches.
In Pakistan, the digitalisation of currency aligns with the government's vision of a ""Digital Pakistan,"" launched in 2019, which seeks to leverage technology to enhance economic growth and governance. The SBP's National Payment Systems Strategy (NPSS), introduced in 2019, and subsequent regulations have laid the groundwork for a cash-light economy. However, the transition requires balancing innovation with regulation, addressing infrastructural challenges, and ensuring equitable access for all citizens.
Pakistan's economy is heavily cash-dependent, with cash transactions accounting for an estimated 80-90% of all payments, particularly in rural areas and the informal sector. According to the SBP, the informal economy constitutes approximately 30-40% of GDP, driven by cash-based businesses, unreported income, and limited banking penetration. Only 26% of Pakistan's adult population had access to formal financial services in 2021, per the World Bank's Global Findex Database, leaving millions reliant on cash for daily transactions.
This reliance on cash poses several challenges. Transactions are difficult to track, enabling tax evasion and the growth of the black economy. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) estimates that Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio, at around 10%, is among the lowest in the region, partly due to unreported cash-based activities.
Cash facilitates illicit transactions, including money laundering, terrorist financing, and corruption, undermining economic stability and security.
Handling physical cash incurs significant costs for printing, transportation, and security. For businesses and individuals, cash transactions are time-consuming and prone to theft or loss.
The lack of access to banking services excludes millions from savings, credit, and insurance, perpetuating poverty and inequality, particularly among women, rural residents, and low-income groups.
The digitalisation of currency offers a pathway to address these issues by promoting transparency, reducing costs, and integrating the unbanked into the formal economy.
The Pakistani government and the SBP have introduced a range of policies and regulations to encourage digital payments and reduce cash usage. These measures are part of a broader strategy to modernize the financial system, enhance tax compliance, and promote financial inclusion. Key initiatives include: StBP's National Payment Systems Strategy (NPSS), launched in 2019, aims to create a robust, interoperable, and inclusive digital payment ecosystem.
Key components
Raast instant payment system: Introduced in 2021, Raast is Pakistan's first instant digital payment platform, enabling real-time, low-cost transactions across banks and digital wallets. Raast supports person-to-person (P2P), person-to-business (P2B), and government-to-person (G2P) payments, reducing reliance on cash for small transactions. By 2024, Raast had processed over 200 million transactions, with a focus on financial inclusion for rural and underserved populations.
Electronic money institutions (EMIs): The SBP's EMI Regulations (2019) allow non-bank entities, such as fintech companies, to offer digital payment services, including mobile apps and e-wallets. Licensed EMIs like JazzCash and Easypaisa have expanded digital financial services to millions, particularly in rural areas. Interoperability and open banking: The NPSS mandates interoperability among banks, fintechs, and payment service providers, ensuring seamless digital transactions. The SBP's Open Banking Framework encourages data sharing to foster innovation and competition.
Taxation and cash transaction limits
To discourage cash usage and enhance tax compliance, the FBR has introduced measures to limit cash transactions and incentivize digital payments:
Section 21(l) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001: This provision disallows tax deductions for business expenses exceeding PKR 250,000 if paid in cash, encouraging businesses to use banking channels.
Withholding tax on cash withdrawals: Under Section 231A, a 0.6% withholding tax is imposed on cash withdrawals exceeding Rs50,000 per day from bank accounts, incentivising digital transactions to avoid additional taxation.
Point of Sale (POS) integration: The FBR's POS Integration Rules (2021) require large retailers (Tier-1) to install POS machines linked to the FBR's system for real-time transaction reporting. Non-compliance results in penalties, pushing businesses toward digital payments.
Tax incentives for digital transactions: The FBR offers reduced tax rates for merchants accepting digital payments, encouraging the adoption of card and mobile-based transactions.
The digitalisation of currency in Pakistan, supported by initiatives like Raast, EMI regulations, and tax policies, holds immense potential to transform the economy. By promoting financial inclusion, enhancing transparency, and reducing the costs of cash handling, digital payments can drive economic growth and integrate millions into the formal financial system. However, challenges such as the digital divide, low financial literacy, and cybersecurity risks must be addressed to ensure an equitable transition.
Pakistan's laws and regulations to discourage cash transactions, including POS integration, cash withdrawal taxes, and AML/CFT measures, are steps in the right direction. Yet, their success depends on robust implementation, public awareness, and infrastructural improvements. By learning from global models like India's UPI and investing in inclusive policies, Pakistan can build a digital economy that benefits all citizens, from urban elites to rural farmers.
As the country moves toward a cash-light future, it must balance innovation with regulation, ensuring that the benefits of digitalisationfinancial inclusion, transparency, and efficiencyare accessible to all. The journey is complex, but with strategic reforms and collective effort, Pakistan can harness the power of digital currency to create a more inclusive and prosperous economy.

"CM, governor offices overspent budget","US
Expenses during current fiscal year exceeded allocation by Rs950 million
The expenses of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's two top constitutional offices — the Chief Minister's Secretariat and the Governor's House — have soared dramatically during the outgoing fiscal year, with both institutions overspending by hundreds of millions of rupees.
According to official budget documents, the Chief Minister's Secretariat exceeded its allocated budget by Rs858.5 million during the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25. The initially allocated amount of Rs805 million swelled to actual spending of Rs1.663 billion. For the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26, Rs1.419 billion has been earmarked for the Secretariat.
A significant portion of this spending went to staff salaries and allowances, with Rs448.5 million initially allocated but Rs504.6 million ultimately spent. In the next fiscal year, Rs537.5 million has been allocated for this head.
Spending on gifts and entertainment also raised eyebrows. While Rs35 million was originally set aside, actual expenditures reached Rs110 million — more than three times the allocation. For FY 2025-26, Rs38.5 million has been sanctioned.
For ""Secret Services,"" Rs50 million had been budgeted, but actual spending hit Rs200 million mark. The new allocation for this category is Rs100 million. Similarly, fuel allowances exceeded the budgeted Rs35 million, with Rs60 million spent; Rs38.5 million is proposed for next year.
On the other Governor's House also overspent its original allocation. Against a budget of Rs507.6 million for fiscal year 2024-25, actual spending rose to Rs606.7 million — an excess of Rs99.1 million. For the upcoming fiscal year, Rs591.6 million has been earmarked.
Utility bills for the Governor's House had an allocation of Rs41.3 million, but only Rs800,000 was spent. However, Rs45.4 million is proposed for fiscal year 2025-26. Travel allowances were budgeted at Rs16.2 million but reached Rs20.7 million; the new budget proposes Rs17.8 million.
General expenses also saw an overrun, with Rs97.8 million budgeted and Rs109 million spent. For the coming year, Rs107.6 million has been allocated. Secret service expenses in this category doubled from the allocated Rs10 million to Rs20 million, with Rs11 million proposed for fiscal year 2025-26.
Entertainment and gifts at the Governor's House cost Rs20.1 million, surpassing the allocated Rs16.1 million. The proposed allocation for next year is Rs17.7 million.
These figures have sparked concern among fiscal observers, who argue that such extravagant public spending, especially on discretionary items like gifts and entertainment, warrants closer scrutiny amidst the province's ongoing financial challenges.

"Iran, Israel trade long-range missile strikes","US
Iran's barrage reaches Israel's coastline; Israeli strikes target Tehran, Mashhad; Rising death toll on both sides
Israel's military said on Sunday night several sites were hit by the latest Iranian missile barrage, with firefighters reporting a residential building struck on the country's Mediterranean coast, as Iranian military said they launched a new wave of ballistic missiles at Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Ashkelon.
Earlier, Israel unleashed a punishing barrage of strikes across Iran, hitting targets from the west to Tehran and as far east as Mashhad, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to make Iran pay a ""heavy price"" for killing its civilians.
With no let-up in sight, Iran said it would begin opening mosques, metro stations and schools to serve as makeshift bomb shelters for civilians, as Israel kept up its withering blows. The Iranian military said its ""mission will continue"" as long as necessary.
After decades of enmity and a prolonged shadow war fought through proxies and covert operations, the latest conflict marked the first time the arch-enemies have traded fire with such intensity, triggering fears of a lengthy conflict that could engulf the entire Middle East.
As Israel targeted sites across Iran on Sunday, Iran responded with barrages of missiles, with residents told to seek shelter as booms were heard over occupied Jerusalem and other cities, and aerial defence systems reportedly activated in Tehran.
Residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the hostilities broke out three days ago. ""Iran will pay a very heavy price for the premeditated murder of civilians, women and children,"" Netanyahu said during a visit to a missile strike site in the coastal city of Bat Yam.
The remarks came hours after Iranian missile fire targeting Israel killed at least 10 people overnight, according to authorities, pushing the death toll up to 13 since Iran began its retaliatory strikes on Friday, with 380 reported injured.
Iranian state television, meanwhile, reported at least five people killed on Sunday by an Israeli strike that hit a residential building in downtown Tehran. Local media put the death toll at 128 in Israeli attacks on Friday and Saturday, including women and children, with 900 more injured.
On Sunday, Israel's military said its air force hit Mashhad airport in Iran's far-east, making it the longest-range strike of the conflict, with the target ""approximately 2,300 kilometres from Israel"". A heavy cloud of smoke hung above Tehran after Israeli aircraft struck two fuel depots.
The Iranian media also reported an Israeli strike on the police headquarters in Tehran. Late in the night Iran's deputy foreign minister said Israel hit one of the foreign ministry's buildings, injuring several employees. The Israeli military said its air force had hit ""more than 80"" targets in the capital overnight.
Long lines snaked around gas stations as most businesses remained closed, while the head of Tehran's traffic police told the IRNA news agency that ""heavy traffic was reported at the capital's exit points"". Some residents, however, were determined to stay put.
Israeli police said six people were killed and at least 180 injured at the site of an overnight missile strike in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv on Israel's Mediterranean coast. In northern Israel, rescuers and medics said a strike late on Saturday destroyed a three-storey building in the town of Tamra, killing four women.
Early Sunday, a series of blasts rattled Tehran. Israel said its forces had struck the defence ministry headquarters in Tehran, where Iranian news agency Tasnim reported damage. The Israeli military also said it had struck the secretive Organization of Defensive Innovation and Research (SPND).
Iranian media later said that police had arrested two suspects over alleged links to Israel's Mossad spy agency. Israel, in turn, said it had taken two individuals into custody over alleged links to Iranian intelligence.
On Sunday, the Israeli military warned Iranians to evacuate areas near weapons facilities nationwide. In response, Iran's military warned people in Israel to leave the Israeli-occupied territories, while they could as punitive Iranian strikes would be targeting the entire Israeli-held territories.
""Warnings for you in the coming days: Leave the occupied territories, because, certainly, they won't be inhabitable in the future!"" Colonel Reza Sayyad, spokesperson for the Iranian armed forces, said, shortly after a new wave of Iranian strikes began against Israel.
The military announced that it launched a new wave of ballistic missile strikes at Israel as part of its retaliatory operation dubbed True Promise 3. The missile barrage was launched shortly after the Israeli regime struck locations in Tehran on the third day of its aggression against the country, it added.
There had been widespread fear that the conflict might spill over to the other countries in the region. Iran's top diplomat, Abbas Araqchi said his country did not want its conflict with Israel to expand to neighbouring countries unless the situation was forced.
""Dragging the conflict to the Persian Gulf is a strategic mistake, and its [Israel's] aim is to drag the war beyond Iranian territory,"" he said. The foreign minister accused Israel of seeking to sabotage the ongoing Iran-US nuclear talks.
Netanyahu suggested in an interview to Fox News that Israel had killed Iran's intelligence chief Mohammad Kazemi, saying it had recently ""got the chief intelligence officer and his deputy in Tehran"" as its jets carried out raids over the capital.
In Washington, meanwhile, a senior US official told AFP US President Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. ""We found out that the Israelis had plans to hit Iran's supreme leader. President Trump was against it and we told the Israelis not to.""

Labubu shines as Pop Mart opens jewellery store,"US
Ugly-cute mascot becomes wearable luxury
""Blind box"" toymaker Pop Mart, which has seen frenzied sales worldwide for products related to its ugly-cute Labubu character, opened its first jewellery store in Shanghai on Friday.
The jewellery concept store, called Popop, sells accessories adorned with Pop Mart's top-selling characters, including Labubu, Molly and Skullpanda.
While Chinese consumption remains subdued in the face of a prolonged property downturn and sluggish economy, Pop Mart's affordable and adorable toys have remained in high demand both at home and abroad, driving its share price up more than 200 per cent so far this year.
Investor Zhang Ming, 34, who owns Pop Mart stocks worth 100 million yuan ($13.92 million), flew from his base in the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing for the opening to check out the new store type and decide whether to increase his shareholding in the company.
""I believe that the pricing and target audience for this brand are particularly well-suited, and I am confident that Pop Mart could potentially become China's version of Disney,"" Zhang said, predicting that the company's market cap could double from its current $45.65 billion valuation.
Along with some Disney characters and others related to anime, comics and popular video games, Pop Mart's characters are seen as fulfilling what has been called ""emotional consumption"", which sees young consumers spend on affordable luxuries that bring joy into their lives.
Fang Ke, 35, who has a birthday coming up this month decided to treat herself to a 699 yuan Labubu bracelet at the opening.
""I've loved Pop Mart for a long time; it's good-looking, brightly coloured, and also has a visual impact,"" she said. ""My daughter likes it too.""
At Popop, prices start at around 350 yuan for charms or a simple silver ring, and go as high as 2699 yuan for necklaces adorned with metallic models of the characters. Most pieces are priced at under 1,000 yuan.
At a traditional Pop Mart store, the ""blind box"" toys that the chain is best known for generally sell for 69 yuan and up, but consumers have shown a willingness to shell out much more for limited editions.
Earlier this week, a Beijing auction house sold a human-sized Labubu figure for 1.08 million yuan, setting a new record and marking the toy's switch from craze to collectible.

From mining real gold to digital gold,"US
In the absence of rules, crypto mining may cost more than it offers
In March 2022, Pakistan made headlines when Mark Bristow signed a landmark agreement to launch the country's largest-ever copper and gold mining projecta symbol of traditional resource extraction. Three years later, in March 2025, a new frontier emerged with the formation of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), aiming to mine a different kind of gold: digital. From proposals to use idle electricity for crypto mining to controversial links allegedly aimed at attracting US President Donald Trump's attention, Pakistan's crypto ambitions have taken on a complex and politically charged tone.
Currently, cryptocurrencies are banned in Pakistan, as confirmed by officials from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Ministry of Finance during a recent National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance meeting. The SBP, in multiple statements, has reiterated that trading, holding, or promoting cryptocurrencies violates domestic law. Citing concerns over capital flight, money laundering, and terrorist financing, the SBP has warned financial institutions against engaging in crypto-related activities.
In early 2025, the finance ministry echoed these concerns, calling crypto ventures ""misaligned with national economic goals."" This has created internal contradictions, as other government bodies appear to be exploring crypto integration through unofficial channels. Until there is regulatory claritypreferably through legislation or a policy frameworkPakistan remains a high-risk jurisdiction for any legitimate crypto activity.
The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) emerged in early 2025 as a private initiative with lofty ambitions. Branded as an innovation-driven entity, the PCC has signed non-binding agreements with international partners to promote blockchain use in Pakistan. However, many of these agreements and the entities involved have been criticised in both mainstream and social media for lacking transparency.
A major event triggering scrutiny was the visit of Binance founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) to Pakistan. Convicted in the US in November 2023 for violating anti-money laundering laws, CZ's company also paid a record $4.3 billion penalty. His visit, reportedly facilitated by PCC intermediaries, was viewed by analysts as tone-deaf and damaging to Pakistan's international image.
Adding a geopolitical dimension is PCC's recent Letter of Intent with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a US-based crypto company in which the Trump family reportedly holds a 60% stake. The agreement proposes collaboration on blockchain, stablecoin, and decentralised finance projects in Pakistan.
Critics argue that the move is less about technology and more about political manoeuvringan effort to curry favour with Donald Trump. The involvement of Steve Witkoff, a Trump ally now serving as a US special envoy, has further fuelled speculation of backdoor diplomacy disguised as financial innovation. Pakistan has over 10,000 MW of excess power generation capacity due to over-commitment in generation contracts and under-utilised industrial demand. But this surplus comes at a steep cost. Electricity remains expensive10 to 15 cents per kWh for industrial usersmaking it non-viable for crypto mining, which thrives on rates below 5 cents per kWh in places like Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and Ethiopia.
While crypto mining could monetise some of this idle capacity, alternative uses offer better long-term value. Industrial and Special Economic Zones (SEZs) can justify higher tariffs through job creation and exports. Green hydrogen targets premium markets, while data centres and IT parks generate high income per energy unit. Cold storage facilities for agriculture are crucial for exports and reducing food waste. EV infrastructure can help lower fuel imports while promoting sustainability.
If the government is considering subsidised energy for crypto mining to attract global miners, then why not do the same for these sectors? These alternatives maximise economic utility by pairing energy use with employment, export potential, and long-term gains. In contrast, crypto is volatile and speculative, potentially locking Pakistan into low-return ventures while sidelining more transformative opportunities.
Amid rising interest in cryptocurrency, Pakistan's consideration of Bitcoin as a strategic reserve is fraught with significant risk. While countries like El Salvador have recently profited from such investments, Pakistan's volatile economy, regulatory vacuum, and legal bans make this approach dangerous. The IMF has already raised concerns over subsidised power tariffs. Meanwhile, any move to build Bitcoin reservesespecially from confiscated assetscould provoke renewed scrutiny from the FATF, jeopardising Pakistan's progress in exiting the grey list.
With limited reserves and a fragile economy, adopting crypto as a reserve asset may seem reckless. Instead, Pakistan must focus on financial stability and regulatory clarity, rather than speculative digital ventures.
Ultimately, the question isn't whether Pakistan can enter the crypto economy, but whether it shouldand to what extent. In the absence of clear regulation, public consensus, and a sound economic rationale, the pursuit of crypto mining may cost more than it offers. As the world moves toward regulated, sustainable digital finance, Pakistan must decide whether chasing crypto-mining under uncertain pretences is worth the price of strategic credibility.

Owners warned as hotel registration deadline passes,"IT
Restriction also covers bookings through online apps
Hotel and guesthouse owners across Punjab have been issued a final warning to register their businesses as Sunday was the last day for mandatory registration on the 'Hotel Eye' software system.
The Punjab Home Department had launched the online portal to register all hotels, guesthouses and residential service providers, setting June 15 as the deadline for compliance.
According to a home department spokesman, hotel and guesthouse owners who have not yet registered must immediately complete their registration on the porta.
""Action will be taken against hotels and guesthouses that fail to register under the Punjab Information of Temporary Residence Act 2015,"" the spokesman warned.
The initiative extends to accommodations booked through international online booking applications, which must also be registered on the system. ""Registration has been made mandatory for bookings made through online booking applications operating worldwide,"" the spokesman explained.
The decision was made to prevent terrorism, crimes and illegal activities, according to the department. ""Individuals from abroad and within the country stay in Punjab's hotels and guesthouses,"" the spokesman noted.
Under the new system, data of all individuals staying in hotels and private guesthouses across the province must be entered into the Hotel Eye software.
Private guesthouse owners will provide guest information through their login credentials.
""Digital verification of domestic and foreign residents will assist in crime elimination,"" the spokesman added.
The department emphasised that the comprehensive registration system is crucial for maintaining security and monitoring temporary residents across Punjab.
Hotel and guesthouse owners who have not completed their registration were urged to immediately register to avoid legal action under the provincial law.

K-P's debt surges over Rs43b in one year,"IT
Despite the rising debt, the provincial government has repaid Rs30.70 billion in loans during the ongoing fiscal year
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's total debt burden has increased by Rs43.59 billion over the past year, official data reveals. At the beginning of the current fiscal year, the province's total debt stood at Rs679.54 billion. However, by July 1, 2025, it is projected to rise to Rs723.13 billion.
As of July 1, 2024, the province had no domestic debt, and it remains free from internal borrowing to this day. The entire debt consists of external loans. At the start of the current fiscal year, the external debt was Rs679.54 billion, which is now expected to reach Rs723.13 billion by the beginning of the next fiscal year.
Despite the rising debt, the provincial government has repaid Rs30.70 billion in loans during the ongoing fiscal year. Originally, the government had planned to repay Rs67 billion — Rs40 billion in principal and Rs27 billion in interest. However, revised estimates indicate that only Rs55 billion was paid, comprising Rs35 billion in principal and Rs20 billion in interest.
For the upcoming fiscal year, the government has planned debt repayments totaling Rs65 billion — Rs40 billion in principal and Rs25 billion in interest.
The largest portion of the province's debt is owed to the Asian Development Bank (ADB), totaling Rs323.63 billion, followed by Rs307 billion owed to the International Development Association (IDA). The remaining debt is owed to other international financial institutions.
It may be recalled that in 2021, the province's debt stood at Rs295.96 billion. It rose to Rs359.33 billion in 2022, jumped to Rs530.72 billion in 2023, and has now reached Rs723.13 billion — a more than doubling of the debt burden in just four years.

G7 leaders hope to avoid Trump clash,"US
Heads of elite club meet in Canada
Group of Seven leaders gather in the Canadian Rockies starting on Sunday amid growing splits with the United States over foreign policy and trade, with host Canada striving to avoid clashes with President Donald Trump.
While Prime Minister Mark Carney says his priorities are strengthening peace and security, building critical mineral supply chains and creating jobs, issues such as US tariffs and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine are expected to feature heavily.
The summit is taking place in the mountain resort of Kananaskis, some 90 km (56 miles) west of Calgary.
The last time Canada played host, in 2018, Trump left the summit before denouncing then Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as ""very dishonest and weak"" and instructing the US delegation to withdraw its approval of the final communique.
""This will be a successful meeting if Donald Trump doesn't have an eruption that disrupts the entire gathering. Anything above and beyond that is gravy,"" said University of Ottawa international affairs professor Roland Paris, who was foreign policy adviser to Trudeau.
Trump has often mused about annexing Canada and arrives at a time when Carney is threatening reprisals if Washington does not lift tariffs on steel and aluminum.
""The best-case scenario ... is that there's no real blow-ups coming out of the back end,"" said Josh Lipsky, the chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council think tank and a former White House and State Department official.
Diplomats said Canada has ditched the idea of a traditional comprehensive joint communique and would issue chair summaries instead, in hopes of containing a disaster and maintaining engagement with the US.
A senior Canadian official told reporters Ottawa wanted to focus on actions the seven members - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States – could take together.
Canadian Senator Peter Boehm, a veteran former diplomat who acted as Trudeau's personal representative to the 2018 summit, said he had been told the summit would last longer than usual to give time for bilateral meetings with the US president.
Expected guests for parts of the Sunday to Tuesday event include leaders from Ukraine, Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil, who all have reasons to want to talk to Trump. Reuters
