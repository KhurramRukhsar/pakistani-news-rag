F-35 destroyed: Iran becomes second country to down stealth fighter,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321435-f-35-destroyed-iran-becomes-second-country-to-down-stealth-fighter,"TEHRAN: Iran has claimed to have downed two F-35I Adir, the customised Israeli fifth-generation stealth aircraft that were involved in precision strikes against Iranian military and nuclear installations on June 13. If true, this would be the second time that a US-origin stealth aircraft has been downed in combat.
Initial reports about the Israeli strikes under Operation ‘Rising Lion’ noted that the F-35 stealth fighters flew almost 2,000 kilometers. The IAF’s F-35I Adir, a modified variant of the formidable Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II aircraft, was hailed as the hero of the audacious Israeli operation. EurAsian Times earlier highlighted the cutting-edge capabilities of the F-35IA Adir, such as advanced avionics and integrated electronic warfare systems of the aircraft that enabled it to penetrate a sophisticated air defense network.
While the scale of damage caused to Israel overnight is still emerging, Iran has also claimed to have downed two F-35 fighters. Iran’s state-run Press TV was quick to note: “Iran has earned the distinction of being the first country in the world to successfully shoot down fifth-generation fighter jets by targeting two stealth F-35 fighters belonging to the Zionist regime.” The IDF categorically denied the claims. “Fake Iranian media,” said Col. Avichay Adraee, the IDF’s Arabic-language spokesman. However, if confirmed, this would be the first time an F-35 would have been downed anywhere in the world.
It is pertinent to note that despite the cutting-edge capabilities, the F-35I Adir (like any other F-35 variant) is not invincible. For instance, during the US bombing operation against the Houthis undertaken earlier this year, a Houthi missile almost struck an American F-35 Lightning II aircraft, forcing the pilot to take evasive action.
No aircraft in the world is completely invisible to advanced radars, and the US got the taste of this when it lost its first-ever stealth aircraft in combat. The vulnerability of the first-ever operational American stealth aircraft, the F-117 Nighthawk, was displayed in 1999 against Yugoslavia’s President Slobodan Milosevic’s ruthless ethnic cleansing effort against the Kosovar Albanian population.
On the fateful day of March 27, 1999, the pilot spotted two bright dots ascending rapidly from the clouds below. These were radar-guided missiles that were fired at three-and-a-half times the speed of sound from an S-125M Neva surface-to-air missile system. Despite the evasive maneuvers, F-117 “Something Wicked” was damaged by one of the Neva missiles that exploded very close to it. The plane went into a dive as it lost control and sped toward the ground. Lt. Col. Zelko ejected safely and was rescued by a US Air Force combat search-and-rescue team.

"Muslim world must unite or face individual targeting, warns Asif",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321436-muslim-world-must-unite-or-face-individual-targeting-warns-asif,"ISLAMABAD: Strong expressions of support for Iran in response to Israel’s aggression echoed across both the government and opposition benches in the National Assembly on Saturday, as lawmakers took up the budget debate amidst rising regional tensions.
As the Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif assured that Pakistan would continue to stand with Iran while extending every support to brotherly Islamic country, ex-Speaker and PTI parliamentarian Asad Qaiser noted that Iranian forces have the right for self-defence against Israel’s attack.
Khawaja Muhammad Asif called on the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to hold an emergency meeting to develop a joint strategy in response to Israel’s aggression. Condemning its military aggression against Iran, Asif declared Israel a serious threat to regional and global peace. The minister said Iran is not just a neighbour but a brotherly country with deep-rooted ties with Pakistan. He warned that if the Muslim world does not act together, every country will eventually become a target. “The way Israel has targeted Yemen, Iran, and Palestine shows a larger plan. Strong leadership is needed now,” he said. Khawaja Asif said Pakistan stands firmly with Iran and will continue to support it on international fora, he said.
Asad Qaiser, while addressing the budget session, stated that Israel’s attack and the subsequent retaliatory action by Iran in defence of its sovereignty must be viewed with moral clarity. He said that Pakistan stands in full solidarity with Iranian brothers and announced strong support. “It is our moral obligation to stand by Iran at this critical time,” he said. He further said that Israel has committed worst atrocities against Palestinians, sparing neither children, women, elderly, nor hospitals and schools. He demanded that the Government of Pakistan immediately launch diplomatic efforts to convene an emergency session of OIC.
Meanwhile, the defence minister recalled that India used Israeli drones while launching unprovocative attack on Pakistan last month. He said “India’s false pride has been shattered, and their leadership is now embarrassed at home.” He highlighted the armed forces defended the nation bravely. He also praised Pakistan’s youth, especially cyber experts, who shut down lights in Indian stadiums, disrupted IPL matches, and even shut down their water supply from dams. Their skills surprised the world, he said.
Turning to the economy, Khawaja Asif said Pakistan suffers huge losses due to tax evasion, especially in tobacco, real estate, steel and tyres. “We lose around Rs300 billion annually in tobacco taxes alone,” he said. Asif demanded accountability and urged the finance ministry and FBR to brief parliament on the people behind large-scale tax evasion. Khawaja Asif praised Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and credited him for bringing back international trust in Pakistan’s economy. He admitted that the public may still be feeling economic pressure but said positive changes are happening. “The business community is showing more confidence, and the stock market recently hit a historic 125,000-point high,” he said.
Discussing alleged financial injustices towards Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Asad Qaisar said that after the FATA merger, the province’s NFC Award share should have increased to 19pc, but there was no substantial progress. On the electricity crisis, he said the people were tormented during Eid, especially in Swabi, where electricity was available for only two hours.
PTI’s parliamentary leader Zartaj Gul agitated the absence of federal ministers and government members from the House. She said the incumbent government with only 13 genuine seats in the National Assembly, presented its second federal budget.
PPP parliamentarian Syed Naveed Qamar said that the federal budget is a policy document but it will be mocked if there are differences in prime minister’s statement and numbers of the budget proposals. He highlighted that there was no allocation in the budget for agriculture.
The opposition leader, Omar Ayub Khan, while taking the floor briefly, said the government would have to change budgetary figures in view of the increase in the price of crude oil after Israel’s attack on Iran. “The budgetary figures have become meaningless after the recent developments in the region and Pakistan currency is most likely to depreciate,” he said.

"In a first, FBR seizes Benami property",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321437-in-a-first-fbr-seizes-benami-property,"ISLAMABAD: The FBR’s Commissionerate of Anti-Benami Initiative (ABI), Islamabad, has confiscated its first-ever immovable properties, Plot No 168-A (Corner), area 816 sq yards and Plot No 174-A (Corner), area 991 sq yards, Block H, Pakistan Employees Cooperative Housing Eociety (PECHS) under Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act, 2017.
According to FBR’s announcement made here on Saturday, these plots have been officially transferred to the Federal Government of Pakistan, with all rights and titles now vest in the federal government. The investigation commenced following a complaint indicating potential benami ownership of the aforesaid properties.
Upon inquiry, it was revealed that the individual listed as the owner was not registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and disclaimed any knowledge of these properties. The Benamidar has stated that her Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) has been misused for registration of these plots.
Subsequent to a thorough investigation, a reference was filed before the Benami Adjudicating Authority Bench-I Islamabad, and the case was decided in favour of the Benami Zone-I, Islamabad. Moreover, the Adjudicating Authority has also issued confiscation order of these properties.
Following the completion of all legal procedures, the properties were confiscated with the assistance of local law enforcement agencies.
This action aligns with the government’s intensified efforts against benami assets, which gained momentum in July 2019 with the establishment of three Ani-Benami Zones across the country.
These zones, operating under the supervision of a Directorate General ABI, have filed over 187 references involving various categories of assets, including shares, bank accounts, vehicles, land and buildings. The ABI Zone-I, Islamabad, has been actively involved in identifying and investigating benami properties in the KP, Civil Division of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Capital Territory. The successful confiscation of these plots mark a significant step in the government’s ongoing campaign to eliminate benami transactions, non-documentation of economy, detect/catch the ill-gotten and untaxed money, curb white collar crimes and generate resources for the state.

Pakistan wants to resolve issues with India through talks: Bilawal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321438-pakistan-wants-to-resolve-issues-with-india-through-talks-bilawal,"BRUSSELS: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, head of Pakistan’s parliamentary delegation on a visit to Europe, has said Pakistan has been cooperating fully with the international community against terrorism since 2001.
“If India feels terrorism is its biggest challenge, it should sit down with Pakistan and try to resolve this issue,” Bilawal said while addressing a press conference at the European Press Club along with a delegation from Pakistan.
Bilawal Bhutto said it was thought bilateral talks would start after the ceasefire, but this expectation was not fulfilled. The Kashmiri nation has become the biggest and the first victim of accusation of terrorism levelled by India, he told the media.
Bilawal said Pakistan wants peace, and for this, Islamabad is ready to talk to Delhi by all means. But India, he said, is not ready for this.
“Instead of resolving the previous issues, India has started a new water dispute. It now wants to use water as a weapon. Stopping water for 240 million people would be considered an act of war, and we will not allow it”, Bilawal vowed.
He said Pakistan understands Europe’s desire for free trade with India. If India engages in war with its neighbours repeatedly, which can turn into a nuclear war due to any miscalculation, then what the future of the investment made in India will be, he asked.
He gave the example of recent dispute with India in which India used a nuclear-capable BrahMos missile. In such a situation, the other side would barely have a few minutes to think whether this missile is empty or carrying a bomb, he remarked.
In response to a question, Bilawal said India says Kashmir is its internal matter. “But despite its efforts, the Kashmir issue has been internationalised. US President is talking about resolving this issue, and we welcome it”, he said.
Pakistan, he said, wants to resolve every issue with India through dialogue. “We are giving this message to everyone to play their role for peace in our region”, he added.
During the press conference, he was asked by Jang and Geo, “When India does not accept any mediation and wants to resolve every issue unilaterally by force, do you think the Kashmir issue can be resolved in this situation?” In response, Bilawal said that for the world it may be a different kind of issue, but for the new generation of India, Pakistan and the subcontinent, this is the biggest challenge that later we will not be able to resolve it.
Bilawal said that according to experts, Pakistan is among top 10 countries suffering due to environmental problems and water scarcity. After the South Pole, the highest rate of natural ice melting and biggest threat is in the Himalayas, he said.
“If India tries to do everything unilaterally, it cannot deal with environmental problems alone. It cannot stop the water of an entire population,” Bilawal emphasized. For this, India will have to speak sooner or later, he said.
In response to the same question, Pakistan’s Environment Minister Musadik Malik said India is creating a new problem for the nations living in the lower reaches of the rivers. “Now this (Indus Water Treaty) is not just a problem of India or Pakistan. India is trying to formulate a new law or principle that those who live in the lower reaches of the rivers have no right to get water”, he noted. The minister said India is forgetting that not only Pakistan is in the last part of the water flow, it itself is also in the lower reaches of water coming from some other country. Under this principle, what will happen to Africa, Latin America and European countries themselves, he asked.
He said India has internationalised this issue on its own. “Now this issue is not only between India and Pakistan,” he added. For this, all the nations in the lower parts of the rivers will have to stand up and raise their voices, he urged.
He clarified there are very few agreements between countries regarding water in the world, but the IWT exists in the form of a regular treaty between Pakistan and India.

PTI blames rulers for power sector crisis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321441-pti-blames-rulers-for-power-sector-crisis,"ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has lashed out at the government for its ‘short-sighted, flawed and misguided policies’ that have severely damaged multiple sectors, especially the power sector.
PTI leaders, during a news conference on Saturday, claimed that the government’s short-sighted policies resulted in electricity becoming both inaccessible and unaffordable for the people of Pakistan.
Leader of the Opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, flanked by Opposition Leader in Senate Syed Shibli Faraz, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram and PTI senior leader Taimur Jhagra, highlighted the ‘glaring flaws’ in the budget.
Omar criticised the current regime’s handling of the power sector and broader fiscal policies and said the PTI government had laid the foundation for a strong and competitive power sector. Unfortunately, all those projects have been scrapped by this government. “During our tenure, electricity was available at much lower prices, but today, the prices have skyrocketed beyond the reach of the common man,” he said.
He highlighted the deteriorating electricity infrastructure, saying: “Even Islamabad, served by the Iesco, faces frequent power cuts. The power lines and feeders across the country are outdated and insufficient to meet the rising demand.” He pointed out that while the electricity demand grew, the number of feeders in many areas remained alarmingly low. On the regional situation, he noted: “Iran continues to be a major oil hub, exporting oil to Japan, Europe and other countries. However, the ongoing war in the region threatens to push oil prices even higher, which will exacerbate our economic challenges.” He rejected the budget and charged that the government was unable to digest affordable electricity usage and insisted that the common man should not pay for the expensive electricity. He claimed that the power projects started in 2018 initially valued at Rs450 billion have now ballooned to over Rs2,000 billion due to poor governance and flawed policies. He criticized the frequent adjustments to the Fuel Price Adjustment (FPA) in electricity bills, saying: “Every three months, the government changes FPA rates, and it is the common people who bear the brunt of these decisions.”
Shibli said the ongoing regional war would inevitably drive petrol prices even higher, worsening the economic strain on ordinary Pakistanis.  Waqas said PTI experts have transparently presented the budget to the public, highlighting the glaring gap between electricity demand and supply. The current state of electricity in Pakistan, especially in rural areas, is deeply unsatisfactory, as regions like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan are enduring 12 to 18 hours of loadshedding daily, with Sindh facing a similar crisis. Even Punjab is not spared. He said that while privatizing entities like Fesco might be considered, it was equally crucial for other organizations such as Iesco and Lesco to actively contribute to improving the power sector.
“Beyond the power crisis, serious human rights concerns are unfolding. Prisoners in the Kot Lakhpat military trial are facing the worst kind of political retribution, as they are deprived of basic rights, especially under the harsh heat, and are being denied the right to appeal,” he lamented. He charged that the PTI leadership was facing obstructions for meeting the party founder Imran Khan. “We urge all stakeholders to come together and discuss the budget constructively. Let us not widen divisions to the point where bridging them becomes impossible. Pakistan’s future depends on unity and accountability,” he added.
Taimur Jhagra said the government’s plan to privatize only Lesco, Fesco and Iesco won’t benefit the entire country. “Millions in ex-Fata have been completely denied electricity. Who will be held accountable in this regard?” he asked and said the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa budget was now presented, and the common man would witness the difference. Electricity costs have soared since the previous government, with Punjab facing over 12 hours of loadshedding. At 46 °C in KP, people suffer prolonged outages while the basic rights are denied and agriculture and industry are suffering. Bangladesh has now outpaced Pakistan in the power sector.

Govt expects to get Rs20bn from 18% GST on imported solar panels,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321442-govt-expects-to-get-rs20bn-from-18pc-gst-on-imported-solar-panels,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s government is banking on increased solar equipment imports to rake in Rs20 billion in tax revenue in FY2025-26, following the imposition of a standard 18 percent General Sales Tax (GST) on imported solar panels and photovoltaic cells, official documents revealed.
The projected tax take implies the government expects solar imports to over Rs110 billion next fiscal year — despite industry concerns that the new levy may slow momentum in the country’s solar adoption drive.
Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Langrial told a parliamentary panel that locally assembled solar panels were already subject to the same tax, while imported panels had been tax-free, creating a disadvantage for local manufacturers. He said the new tax on imports would help create a level playing field for the domestic industry.
The move comes as Pakistan’s net-metered solar capacity has more than tripled in less than two years, rising from 1.3 gigawatts in FY2023 to 4.9GW by March 2025, according to Islamabad-based energy think tank Renewables First.
This explosive growth has been largely fueled by households and businesses seeking relief from chronic power outages and soaring grid electricity tariffs.
While the government sees the GST as a revenue-generating tool amid fiscal tightening, industry players warn it could deter new investments in solar infrastructure, particularly for small-scale consumers. Still, policymakers argue that the demand for solar power — now seen as a hedge against energy inflation — remains strong enough to sustain high import volumes despite higher costs. The move also aligns with Pakistan’s broader fiscal goals under IMF-guided reforms, which push for expanded tax bases and reduced subsidies across energy sectors.

India fails to ‘push Pakistan back’ onto FATF grey list,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321443-india-fails-to-push-pakistan-back-onto-fatf-grey-list,"ISLAMABAD: India suffered a diplomatic setback in its bid to have Pakistan re-listed on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list amid “strong opposition from member states”, sources said on Saturday.
Diplomatic sources told Geo News that the Indian delegation made a “concerted push” to place Pakistan back on the grey list, citing concerns related to financial regulations and counter-terror financing.
However, China took a firm stance in Pakistan’s favour, advocating for continued relief and acknowledging the country’s progress on FATF requirements. Turkiye and Japan also extended their full support to Pakistan, further undermining India’s effort.
In October 2022, the FATF — a global money laundering and terrorism financing watchdog — removed Pakistan from a list of countries under “increased monitoring”, also known as the “grey list”

Does Iran possess nukes?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321444-does-iran-possess-nukes,"ISLAMABAD: Is there a nuclear weapon in Iran? Does Iran’s lack of nuclear weapons pose an existential danger to the regime’s continued existence?
The ‘so called’ goal of Israel’s recent strike on Iran was to prevent the nation from developing a nuclear weapon. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, stated that the military action was taken to prevent the nation from developing a nuclear weapon.
Additionally -- just hours prior to Israel’s attack -- the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) determined that Iran was not adhering to its nonproliferation commitments.
In view of experts, one of Iran’s options in the wake of the strikes could be to continue developing nuclear weapons that Israel sees as an “existential threat”.
“For many Iranian leaders, an Iran without a nuclear weapon (or the potential to have one) is an existential threat to the survival of the regime itself,” said Kenneth Pollack, Vice-President for policy at the Middle East Institute in Washington.
“Israel has opened a Pandora’s box: the worst Iranian response might also be the most likely, a decision to withdraw from its arms control commitments and build nuclear weapons in earnest,” Kenneth Pollack’s analysis reflected.
Moreover, a recent IAEA report found that Iran enriched uranium up to 60 percent, which is a short technical step away from weapons-grade levels (which is often considered by the IAEA to be 90 percent uranium).
The agency said it couldn’t verify the country’s total uranium supply since 2021 but estimates it would be around 9,247 kg as of May 17, 2025. The amount of enriched uranium to 60 percent is 408.6 kg, the report continued. According to an article in The Washington Post, Iran has enough fissile material that -- if further enriched -- would be sufficient for several nuclear weapons.
“Iran now has a supply of highly enriched uranium that could be converted into weapons grade fuel for at least three bombs in a time frame ranging from a few days to a few weeks”, stated the article.
The latest Congressional Research Service (CRS) report on Iran’s nuclear Weapon Production states that numerous IAEA reports claim Iran has been producing batches of enriched uranium containing up to 2 percent u-235, up to 5 percent u-235, up to 20 percent u-235, and up to 60 percent u-235, respectively. It is pertinent to mention here that the Joint Comprehensive Plan Of Action (JCPOA) mandates restrictions on Iran’s declared enrichment capacity and required that Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile must not exceed 300 kilograms of UF6 containing 3.67 percent u-235 “or the equivalent in other chemical forms”.
The aforementioned JCPOA restrictions constrained Iran’s nuclear programme so that Tehran, using its declared enrichment facilities, would, for at least 10 years, have needed a minimum of one year to produce enough weapons-grade HEU for one nuclear weapon. The agreement does not explicitly mandate such a timeline. However, six years after the Trump administration’s controversial decision to withdraw from the pact, the restraints have fallen away, one by one, leaving Iran closer to nuclear weapons capability than at any time in the country’s history. In March 2023, Mark Milley -- US Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff -- testified that Iran would need “several months to produce an actual nuclear weapon”. The question which arises now is what effect will Israel attack leave on Iran in terms of producing nuclear warheads? This might be a billion-dollar question for many today.

Gandapur threatens armed march on Islamabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321445-gandapur-threatens-armed-march-on-islamabad,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has once again issued a stark warning of an armed march towards Islamabad, vowing that any attack on PTI supporters would be met with force.
Addressing a rally held in Mathra area on the outskirts of Peshawar on Saturday, Gandapur warned, “If a bullet is fired at us, we will respond with bullets and not just fire back but strike with full force.”
The event was organised to demand the release of PTI’s founder currently in custody.
A large number of PTI workers attended the event. The gathering was delayed, with no key figure present at the scheduled start time. Meanwhile, traffic on the Warsak Road was severely disrupted due to the event.
As Gandapur arrived at the venue, fireworks were set off and slogans in support of the party’s detained leader echoed through the rally ground. Despite widespread power outages in surrounding areas, the rally venue had uninterrupted electricity throughout the event.
In his address, Gandapur urged PTI supporters across KP to stay prepared, reiterating his call for resistance. “If they shoot at us, they will have to face bullets in return,” he said, further intensifying the party’s confrontational rhetoric. “We won’t just shoot back, we will hit back hard.”
Other PTI leaders also spoke at the rally, repeating their demand for the release of their party’s founder and warning of escalating protests if their demands were not met.
The chief minister’s remarks have sparked fresh concerns about rising political tensions and the possibility of violent clashes in the federal capital.
Gandapur declared a hardline stance against future crackdowns and called on party workers to mobilise on June 22.
Speaking to a charged crowd, the chief minister condemned Israel’s recent attack on Iran, calling it an act of aggression. “We strongly denounce Israel’s attack on Iran,” he said, expressing solidarity with the Iranian people.
The chief minister warned that the PTI was no longer committed to passive resistance, saying, “We are no longer peaceful. If you hit us with batons, we will strike back. If you fire bullets, we will respond in kind.”
Reaffirming loyalty to the party’s founding leader, Gandapur said, “Whenever the founder of PTI gives a call, the people of KP are always on the front line.”
He vowed that party workers would defend themselves against any violent crackdown. “We will go armed. If bullets are fired at us, we will return fire,” he declared.
Gandapur also announced a nationwide mobilisation plan, urging PTI supporters to come out in their respective tehsils on June 22. “On the 22nd of this month, everyone must take to the streets in their tehsil,” he said.

Map controversy flares as IDF post draws Indian ire,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321446-map-controversy-flares-as-idf-post-draws-indian-ire,"KARACHI: As airstrikes between Iran and Israel continued on Friday, a diplomatic controversy unfolded online when the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) shared a map illustrating the range of Iranian missiles, drawing sharp criticism from Indian social media users over territorial misrepresentations. According to a report by BBC Urdu, a large number of Indian users took to X (formerly Twitter) to express outrage at the IDF	s post, claiming it inaccurately depicted India	s borders. The map in question appeared to show Jammu and Kashmir as part of Pakistan, India	s northeastern states as part of Nepal, and Ladakh as Chinese territory.
The post, intended to highlight Iran	s missile capabilities and the regional countries potentially within range  including Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, Saudi Arabia and Ukraine  was titled: 	Iran is a global threat. Israel is not its final target  this is just the beginning. We had no choice but to act.
The backlash prompted the IDF to issue multiple clarifications and at least six public apologies. 	This post contains a regional image. The map failed to accurately reflect borders. We apologize for the offense caused by this image,	 read one of the responses.
Despite these apologies, many Indian users continue to demand that the IDF delete the post  a step it has yet to take. While the Indian government has not officially commented on the issue, right-wing accounts and individual users used the incident to reinforce India	s diplomatic neutrality. One account remarked, 	Now you understand why India always remains neutral. In diplomacy, you have no permanent friends. On Saturday, India	s The Hindu newspaper reported that 	In response to the controversy, Israeli Ambassador to India Reuven Azar on X described the map as  bad unintended	 infographics. He said he had already asked to get the map removed/fixed	.
This is not the first time Israel has faced criticism in India over cartographic errors. In October 2024, the Israeli government removed a map from its official website after it was accused of depicting Jammu and Kashmir as part of Pakistan. At the time, the Israeli embassy in India acknowledged the mistake and attributed it to a website editor	s oversight.
Meanwhile, India has also distanced itself from a strongly worded statement issued by the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that condemned Israel	s military strikes on Iran as violations of international law and the UN Charter.
The SCO statement denounced the Israeli attacks in unequivocal terms: 	Such aggressive actions against civilian targets, including energy and transport infrastructure, which have resulted in civilian casualties, are a gross violation of international law and the United Nations Charter	. The statement described the strikes as a breach of Iran	s sovereignty and a threat to both regional and global security. Iran is a full member of the 10-nation SCO.
Although the SCO release did not mention any dissenting voices, India issued its own clarification, stating it had not taken part in drafting or deliberating on the statement. 	India did not participate in the discussions on the above-mentioned SCO statement	, said the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, adding that its position had been communicated to other member states.
India reiterated its call for restraint and dialogue. 	We urge that channels of diplomacy be utilised to work towards de-escalation, and it is essential that the international community undertake efforts in that direction	, the statement read.
So far, New Delhi has limited itself to expressing 	deep concern	 over the growing hostilities. Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, in a call with his Iranian counterpart on Friday, conveyed what India described as the global community	s concern, and urged both sides to avoid further escalation and return to diplomatic engagement.
India	s muted stance stands in contrast to more forceful condemnations from other Asian nations. Just a day earlier at the UN General Assembly, India had also abstained from voting on a resolution calling for a ceasefire in Gaza.

"LHCBA, LBA file review petitions in military court’s case verdict",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321429-lhcba-lba-file-review-petitions-in-military-court-s-case-verdict,"ISLAMABAD: The Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and Lahore Bar Association (LBA) have requested the Supreme Court (SC) to set aside its judgment recently delivered, allowing trails of May 9 suspects in the military courts after restoring the clauses of Army Act 1952 which were declared earlier by the apex court ultra vires the Constitution and of no legal effect.
Both the associations filed a review petition in the apex court under Article 188 of the Constitution through its counsel Ajmal Ghaffar Toor with the prayer to allow the instant review petitions and set aside the impugned judgment announced on May 7, 2025, allowing the trial of civilians in military courts after restoring clauses of Pakistan Army Act 1952. They further prayed to the apex court to uphold the earlier decision passed in identical petitions on October 23, 2023, declaring trial of civilians in military courts as unconstitutional. A seven-member constitutional bench of the apex court headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan on May 7, 2025 announced reserved judgment on the Intra Court Appeals (ICAs) of federal government, Ministry of Defence against the apex court judgment that had declared trail of civilians in the military courts as unconstitutional. The Shuhuda Foundation Balochistan as well as government of Punjab and Balochistan had also filed intra Court Appeals against the apex court judgment. Other members of the bench included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Musarrat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan. The court by majority 5-2 allowed the Intra Court Appeals and set aside the impugned judgment, dated 23.10.2023, rendered by the learned bench of the apex court. “For reasons to be recorded later, subject to augmentation and explication in detail, the aforesaid ICA(s) are allowed by majority of 5 (comprising J Aminud Din Khan, J Muhammad Ali Mazhar, J Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J Musarrat Hilali, and J Shahid Bilal Hassan)”, Justice Aminuddin Khan had announced a short order in the court.
Similarly, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan had dismissed the aforesaid Intra Court Appeals, holding that the convictions and sentences awarded to civilians by the courts martial for the occurrence of 9th May, 2023, are declared to be without jurisdiction, hence, the same are set aside. Justice Mandokhail and Justice Afghan held that the accused under custody shall be treated as under-trial prisoners and their cases stand transferred to the courts concerned of competent jurisdiction for trial. The court had restored the sub clauses (i) & (ii) of Clause (d) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 and subsection (4) of Section 59 of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 that were earlier declared by the apex court judgment in 2023 ultra vires the Constitution and of no legal effect. In its review petitions, both the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) and Lahore Bar Association (LBA) have contended that they are aggrieved by the order dated 07.05.2025 (impugned order) passed by this Hon’ble Court in ICA No. 5/2023 in CP No. 24/2023, by a majority of 5:2 whereby the judgment dated 23.10.2023 passed in Constitution Petition No.24 of 2023 and connected petitions were set aside and as a consequence thereof S.2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) and S.59(4) of the Pakistan Army Act, 1952 (PAA) were restored (vide paragraph 2(i) of the impugned order).

Murad opens Shahrah-e-Bhutto from Shah Faisal to Quaidabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321384-murad-opens-shahrah-e-bhutto-from-shah-faisal-to-quaidabad,"Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday inaugurated the second phase of the first complete segment of the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Expressway (Shahrah-e-Bhutto), describing it as a significant gift from the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government to the people of Karachi.
He said the project would improve transportation, boost economic growth, and enhance industrial connectivity.
The chief minister, accompanied by provincial ministers Sharjeel Inam Memon and Nasir Hussain Shah, and Senator Waqar Mehdi, drove along the newly opened section, paid the toll tax, and reviewed the project’s progress.
The 38.66-kilometre expressway features six lanes and a design speed of 100km/h. It connects DHA and Korangi with the M-9 Motorway near Kathore and includes six interchanges and 12 toll plazas. Currently, 80 per cent of the project has been completed.
The inauguration ceremony saw a large turnout of PPP supporters and members of the public, who raised slogans in support of the late ZA Bhutto and the chief minister. Shah reiterated that the expressway, being Sindh’s largest public-private partnership (PPP) initiative, is a transformative project for Karachi.
He directed officials to ensure the swift completion of the remaining section from Quaidabad to Kathore. The expressway originates 200 metres before the Jam Sadiq Interchange, and efforts are underway to improve connectivity from Korangi and DHA by constructing either a permanent interchange or a roundabout at the Korangi Causeway.
Highlighting the importance of infrastructure for progress, Shah said the government is focused on ensuring faster and safer urban-industrial linkages. While acknowledging delays due to utility shifting and local issues, he vowed that the remaining work would be completed by December 2025.
This inauguration follows the opening of the first phase — from Shah Faisal to Quaidabad — by PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on January 11, 2025. The government now plans to prioritise further upgrades to Karachi’s transport system, including the expansion of BRT lines and the introduction of electric buses. Shah added that the final segment up to Kathore will be inaugurated by Bilawal in December 2025. “I will seek an appointment with Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari after the anniversary of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s martyrdom,” he said.
Looking ahead, Shah revealed that a new link road from the port to Qayyumabad is being planned, with strong support from Karachi’s business community. “Some people have started acknowledging our efforts,” he said. “To those who still raise questions, I say: the people of Sindh are fully aware.”
In his address, Shah launched a strong critique of the federal government, accusing it of treating Sindh like a colony. “They dissolved the Public Works Department (PWD), which used to manage provincial development projects,” he said.
He alleged that while other provinces were granted projects and budgets, Sindh was ignored. “They now want to run Sindh’s affairs from Islamabad via a new company. I’ve made it clear; this will not be allowed.”
Shah warned that if all development projects are not devolved to the Sindh government, the PPP would oppose the federal budget in parliament. “You cannot run Sindh like a colony,” he said, suggesting that this centralised approach was being influenced by land mafias. “It seems this move is driven by land grabbers and the so-called ‘China-cutting mafia’.”
He urged the federal government to stop the “stepmotherly treatment” of Sindh. “If you continue this attitude, we know how to demand our rights,” he warned.
Addressing rumours about the expressway, Shah denounced what he called “baseless propaganda.” He referred to an incident where someone falsely claimed that dacoits were hiding along the road. “Such misleading stories should not be spread,” he said.
He also shared that PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah had written to him about a pressing issue, and he had already directed officials to resolve it.

From a generator room to a home: Alkhidmat offers a lifeline to Pakistan’s forgotten orphans and widows,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321385-from-a-generator-room-to-a-home-alkhidmat-offers-a-lifeline-to-pakistan-s-forgotten-orphans-and-widows,"When Noor Afshan’s husband passed away suddenly, her life collapsed overnight. Only 33, and left alone with three young daughters, she found herself in a hostile environment. With no parents of her own to turn to and her in-laws pressuring her to marry her late husband’s bedridden, unemployed elder brother, Noor faced a heartbreaking choice: submit to a life of quiet desperation—or walk away into uncertainty.
She chose the latter.
With the help of a distant cousin, Noor escaped her in-laws’ home, taking her daughters with her. But with nowhere to go, they ended up in a generator room on the rooftop of a commercial building in Karachi—a stifling, windowless space not meant for human habitation. The heat was suffocating, the noise relentless, and the nights long and sleepless. “There were times I thought we wouldn’t survive it,” Noor said.
During the day, Noor worked as a teacher at a low-paying private school, struggling to feed her children. At night, she would fan her daughters to sleep amid the whirring machinery and unbearable heat. Yet, through it all, she kept her daughters in school, refusing to let their dreams be buried by poverty.
Her turning point came when someone told her about the Orphan Family Support Program run by Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan—an initiative providing structured financial and emotional support to families like hers. Noor filled out the forms. Her situation was verified, and soon she began receiving monthly aid that covered school fees, books, uniforms, healthcare, and essential nutrition for her children.
“It was the first time in years I felt seen,” she recalled.
That Ramadan, her daughters were invited—alongside hundreds of other orphaned children—to an Eid shopping event organized by the foundation. “Each child was told to pick whatever they liked, within a fixed budget,” Noor said, tears brimming. “My girls bought new clothes—they hadn’t worn anything new in years. How could I ever thank the people of Alkhidmat?”
The next miracle came from a Pakistani woman now settled in Canada, who donated a modest apartment to the foundation. Today, Noor and her daughters live in that home—with two bedrooms, a small balcony, bathrooms, and a kitchen. “At first, they couldn’t sleep,” Noor said. “They weren’t used to the silence, to the comfort. From the corner of a generator room to a home—it still feels like a dream.”
Noor now helps other widows and orphans access Alkhidmat’s services, guiding those in distress to a path she once had to find alone. “I know their pain. If I can help even one mother avoid the humiliation I went through, then maybe all this suffering had a purpose.”
But Noor’s story is just one of thousands.
According to the United Nations, there are more than 4.6 million orphaned children in Pakistan, most of them under the age of 17. These children—many of whom are victims of poverty, conflict, or disease—are often denied basic rights such as education, healthcare, and protection. Globally, UNICEF estimates over 153 million orphans, but Pakistan's orphan crisis is uniquely severe due to deep-rooted social stigmas, institutional neglect, and a weak safety net for widows.
Alkhidmat Foundation, Pakistan’s largest nonprofit dedicated to orphan welfare, is currently supporting more than 32,000 orphan children through its Orphan Family Support Programme. Under this model, financial assistance is deposited directly into the accounts of the widowed mothers or legal guardians, enabling them to live with dignity while caring for their children.
Speaking to The News, Shoaib Hashmi, Senior Manager Media & Public Relations at Alkhidmat Foundation Pakistan, said:
“We don’t just provide monthly stipends. Our program is structured—covering education, food, healthcare, clothing, psychosocial support, and character development. We also conduct annual medical screenings for the orphans and their mothers.”
In many cases, widowed mothers are offered interest-free microfinance loans to start small businesses—selling clothes, running tuitions, or setting up kitchen-based enterprises—so they are no longer dependent on charity. “The aim is to empower the family unit, not just sustain it,” Hashmi emphasized.
Beyond home-based support, the foundation operates 22 high-standard residential facilities known as Aghosh Homes, where over 2,000 orphaned children without guardians live in a structured, secure environment. These homes provide education, regular meals, healthcare, recreational activities, and trauma-informed psychological care. Nine more such homes are currently under construction across Pakistan.
In 2024 alone, Alkhidmat Foundation spent Rs342 million on orphan care initiatives. “That figure tells you both the scale of the problem and our commitment to solving it,” said Hashmi.
Yet what truly sets Alkhidmat apart is the dignity with which it treats its beneficiaries.
“We are not in the business of handing out charity,” Hashmi said. “This is about human dignity. These children are not a burden—they are the future of this country. Every child deserves to grow up with love, protection, and opportunity.”
As Eid-ul-Azha approaches, Alkhidmat is calling upon individuals and families across Pakistan and the diaspora to donate their Zakat, Sadaqat, and other charitable contributions toward orphan support.
“Noor Afshan’s story is just one,” Hashmi said. “There are thousands more. Children waiting for someone to believe in them. Widows waiting to be seen. All it takes is one contribution, one act of compassion, to change everything for a family that’s lost everything.”
Those wishing to support Alkhidmat Foundation can visit https://alkhidmat.org/donate, call their helpline at 0800-44448, or donate via Meezan Bank, Account No. 02140100861151. The foundation also facilitates cash pickups and accepts in-person donations.  “What might feel small to you,” Hashmi concluded, “could be a child’s first step toward hope.”

Expert warns of threat of social engineering attacks in cyberspace,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321386-expert-warns-of-threat-of-social-engineering-attacks-in-cyberspace,"Former Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) director general Dr Sanaullah Abbasi has said social engineering is increasingly recognized as a dominant threat vector in the modern cybersecurity domain, and scammers act as banks or tax officers.
Talking to The News upon cybersecurity, he said that unlike traditional hacking, which exploits software vulnerabilities, social engineering attacks manipulate human behaviour to bypass even the most secure technical systems.
The methods have changed the economic and social behaviour of individuals in particular and societies in general and are designed to psychologically exploit individuals, making human error the weakest link in cybersecurity.
Internationally, social engineering has cost businesses and governments billions of dollars annually. This happens when attackers get into or mimic business emails to trick victims. Pretexting occurs when scammers act as banks or tax officers to get sensitive info, while baiting uses USB drives full of malware left in public to infect unaware victims.
Former FIA DG Abbasi further said that Pakistan, on the other hand, is still catching up. The country is experiencing a rapid digitization boom with e-governance platforms, digital banking, and healthcare records moving online. Yet, cyber literacy remains low. According to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), over 50 per cent of internet users in Pakistan are unaware of basic digital hygiene practices. Coupled with an inadequate legal framework, limited law enforcement training, and cultural over-reliance on trust, the environment becomes fertile ground for cybercriminals.
He added that the importance of understanding social engineering within Pakistan cannot be overstated. As the country increasingly relies on digital platforms to provide services, manage finances, and maintain citizen records, the risks associated with human-centric cyberattacks are rising exponentially.
Abbasi said that economically, businesses, especially in the banking and fintech sectors, are frequent targets. In 2022, a leading Pakistani bank reportedly lost over Rs200 million through a combination of phishing and social engineering attacks targeting its call center staff. Beyond monetary loss, such incidents cause reputational damage and customer mistrust, leading to long-term operational setbacks.
Social engineering attacks have evolved into a sophisticated toolset used by cybercriminals worldwide. The tactics involve exploiting cognitive biases such as authority, urgency, fear, and curiosity. These strategies bypass technological barriers and directly target human behaviour.
He added that in Pakistan, this is happening because people don't know much about staying safe online. They often miss the warning signs. What's more many scams use Urdu or Roman Urdu, which English-based systems can't catch. Also Pakistani culture puts a lot of weight on trusting family and being polite in social situations. This makes people easy targets for tricksters who use these cultural values to fool their victims.
On societal level, parties to social contract use social engineering tricks to mess with public opinion and cause trouble in society to their advantage. They do this through things like astroturfing, which makes it seem like lots of folks support certain ideas on social media when they don't. They also create bubbles that make people stick to what they already believe causing more division.
Baiting is another trick where they try to fool people into giving away private info. They even play on how our brains work to affect how we make choices. These tricks often show up online to change political talks, spread fake news, make divisions worse. This can hurt  reputation of natural persons and legal persons  leading to social problems.
Abbasi said this demonstrates that social engineering in Pakistan is a growing threat that exploits human psychology more than technological flaws. The attacks are diverse in technique, frequent in occurrence, and devastating in their impact on both individuals and society.
While global examples offer blueprints for prevention, Pakistan needs a context-specific approach tailored to its sociocultural and linguistic landscape. A national strategy must be designed that includes legal, educational, and technical reforms.
The former FIA director general further stated that social engineering must no longer be seen as a niche or rare problem—it is a central challenge in Pakistan’s journey toward a secure digital future. To combat social engineering we need a holistic approach, mass awareness campaigns in multiple languages with media and influencers, cyber literacy in schools, regular corporate training simulations like phishing tests.

10-day Sindh Theatre Festival Larkana 2025 kicks off,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321387-10-day-sindh-theatre-festival-larkana-2025-kicks-off,"LARKANA: The Arts Council of Pakistan Karachi, in collaboration with the Arts Council Larkana, held a grand inauguration of the “10-day Sindh Theatre Festival Larkana 2025” at the Arts Council Larkana. The event was graced by the chief guest, Commissioner Larkana Tahir Sangi.
Prominent attendees included Chairman Folk Heritage Committee Arts Council Karachi Dr Ayub Shaikh and Chairman Music Committee Amjad Hussain Shah. President Arts Council Larkana Ismail Jatoi, Secretary Hanif Suhag, along with theatre artists, showbiz personalities, and a large number of local citizens, also participated enthusiastically.
Speaking at the opening ceremony, Commissioner Larkana Tahir Sangi stated, “The work we should be doing is already being done by the Arts Council of Pakistan Karachi. After attending this event, I feel like a changed man — one who now truly understands the importance of cultural connections. Through cultural engagement, many social evils can be addressed and eliminated.”
Chairman Folk Heritage Committee Dr Ayub Shaikh praised the ongoing efforts of Muhammad Ahmed Shah, president of the Arts Council of Pakistan Karachi, saying, “Ahmed Shah is actively revitalizing arts councils across Sindh. Theatre festivals, music festivals, and other cultural activities are being financially supported by the Arts Council Karachi throughout the province. His vision is to create a strong network among artists and promote a rich cultural atmosphere in Sindh.”

Work on motorways from Karachi to Sukkur to start this year: Aleem,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321389-work-on-motorways-from-karachi-to-sukkur-to-start-this-year-aleem,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan has disclosed that in line with the promise to the public, construction of the Karachi-Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorways will have to commence this year.
He added that the Islamic Development Bank has expressed willingness to fund the project while final decision regarding the loan approval is expected in September this year after its board meeting.
Commenting on the media talk of Chief Minister of Sindh regarding the Motorways, Aleem Khan expressed that as the federal minister, he takes responsibility for the past year only but does not want to comment on the inaction of previous governments regarding the construction of the Sukkur, Hyderabad, and Karachi motorways.
He emphasized the corporate importance of connecting Karachi Port to the National Motorway network, highlighting that without this connection, the motorway’s utility for import, export, and business would be of no use. He pointed out that different political parties, including the Pakistan Peoples Party, remained in power but unfortunately, several years were wasted due to the failure to initiate these critical infrastructure projects like motorways of Karachi-Hyderabad-Sukkur.
Aleem Khan reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to construct not only the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway but also the Hyderabad-Karachi section as well while the aim is to complete the entire route within two years. Furthermore, the Northern Bypass will be converted into an 8-lane Highway and linked to the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway.
He added that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway has been divided into 5 zones. The Islamic Development Bank will finance three of these zones while funding for the remaining two will be sought from other banks or donor agency. The federal minister for communications extended his thanks to the Chief Minister of Sindh and stated that the federal government would definitely not hesitate to request the Sindh government’s contribution of PKR 25 billion, if needed.
He affirmed the federal government’s desire to complete this USD2 billion project as swiftly as possible through its own resources. Moreover, Aleem Khan stated that the National Highway Authority (NHA) is actively working on the Lyari Expressway. This project will also be upgraded to meet international standards and, upon completion will be presented as a gift to the people of Karachi.

596 minority students awarded scholarship cheques,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321390-596-minority-students-awarded-scholarship-cheques,"Resuming its scholarship programme after two years, the Sindh Minorities Affairs Department on Saturday held a ceremony in Karachi to award cheques of Rs50,000 each to 596 students belonging to minority communities.
The event was held at Minorities Affairs Secretary Anjum Iqbal Jumani’s office. Special Assistant to the Chief Minister on Minorities Affairs and Pakistan Peoples Party Minority Wing Sindh President Dr Lalchand Ukrani was the chief guest.
Dr Ukrani congratulated the scholarship recipients, stressing the government’s commitment to minorities’ welfare and development. “After a two-year gap the minorities affairs department has successfully resumed its scholarship programme.”
He said the scholarship amount has been increased from Rs25,000 to Rs50,000 on the recommendation of the Sindh Non-Muslim Welfare Committee. “In this era of inflation, financial assistance such as this can make a meaningful difference in helping students complete their education.”
He also said the government is providing equal opportunities and rights to minorities, with the scholarship programme serving as a key example. Moreover, he added, the department runs various welfare schemes, including financial aid for religious festivals, weddings, medical emergencies and natural disasters.
Anjum said the department had received 645 applications from different educational institutions, of which 594 were approved for scholarships. “We’re proud to support these hard-working and dedicated students, and we believe they’ll go on to achieve great things for themselves and their communities.”
She said the department continues to work for the welfare of minority groups across the province. Every member of society, regardless of their background, is an equal citizen of Pakistan, she added.

Sindh raises health budget to Rs372 billion for FY2025–26,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321391-sindh-raises-health-budget-to-rs372-billion-for-fy2025-26,"In a significant move aimed at enhancing healthcare services across the province, the Sindh government has increased the total health budget to an estimated Rs371.87 billion for the fiscal year 2025–26, up from Rs 347.57 billion in the previous year.
The new allocation includes both the non-development and development components of the health sector, reflecting a focused push towards accessible and specialized healthcare.
According to official documents and the provincial budget speech by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, the non-development (recurrent) allocation for health has risen from Rs 302.2 billion in FY2024–25 to Rs 326.5 billion in FY2025–26, registering an increase of approximately 8 per cent. This segment covers salaries, operational expenses, and maintenance costs of hospitals and health programmes across Sindh.
Complementing this, the Annual Development Programme (ADP) for the health sector has also seen a boost, with the government earmarking Rs45.37 billion for FY2025–26, up from Rs 45.31 billion last year. While the nominal increase in development spending appears marginal on the surface, detailed analysis of Volume V of the PSDP reveals that the number of health development schemes has grown from 140 to 178, indicating a broader expansion in infrastructure and outreach.
Chief Minister Shah, while presenting the Rs 3,450 billion provincial budget, reaffirmed that “health for all” remains one of the top priorities of the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government. He said the enhanced allocation will be used to further strengthen critical institutions like the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), Sindh Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (SICVD), Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT), Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), and Indus Hospital.
Over the past year, these institutions have provided free care to millions of patients. The NICVD treated over 1.4 million people, including 160,000 from other provinces, with thousands of emergency angioplasties and pediatric heart surgeries performed. The SICVD network, with its 10 hospitals and 29 chest pain units, offered over 2 million cardiac treatments across the province.
The Sindh Institute of Child Health and Neonatology (SICHN) has also emerged as Pakistan’s largest neonatal care network, operating more than 700 beds, 262 incubators, and 269 ventilators, and serving over 1 million newborns and children since its inception.
At GIMS Gambat, Sindh’s flagship multi-organ transplant and specialty center, the current fiscal year saw 308 liver transplants, 44 kidney transplants, and 84 cochlear implants performed, in addition to advanced robotic surgeries and bone marrow transplants. Similarly, the SIUT, which remains the largest dialysis and kidney transplant center in Pakistan, performed over 7,500 free transplants and served over 4.2 million patients this year alone.
The chief minister also highlighted Sindh’s partnership with Indus Hospital, which has made major strides in pediatric cancer care, cochlear implants, prosthetics, and emergency services.
“Access to free, dignified and quality healthcare is not a luxury—it is a right. We are proud to lead Pakistan in providing the most expansive and equitable public health network in the country,” Murad Ali Shah stated during his address to the Sindh Assembly.
The health sector's total share in Sindh's overall development portfolio now stands at roughly 13.6 per cent of the Rs 333 billion ADP, a clear indication of the government's policy to prioritize health amid fiscal constraints.
While health experts have welcomed the increased allocations, they caution that implementation and governance will determine the real impact. “It's not just about funds; it's about ensuring these resources translate into functioning health units, trained staff, and availability of medicine and diagnostics across rural and urban Sindh,” said a Karachi-based public health specialist.
As Sindh braces for ongoing public health challenges, including non-communicable diseases, maternal and neonatal mortality, and malnutrition, the increased budgetary commitment sets the stage for potentially transformative outcomes—provided the momentum is sustained.

Sindh police chief orders suspending poorly performing investigation officers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321394-sindh-police-chief-orders-suspending-poorly-performing-investigation-officers,"Concerned over investigation officers’ poor performance, Sindh police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon has ordered the investigation DIG to suspend the negligent officers and send them to B Company of the police headquarters, Garden.
According to the order issued by the Central Police Office (CPO), IG Memon has taken notice of IOs not taking an interest in preparing case files, and updating records in the Police Station Record Management System (PSRMS).
The letter issued to the Karachi police chief, the investigation Addl IG and all the DIGs states that the PSRMS is a mandatory project for supervisory officers and prosecutors to monitor investigations, and that such a failure is alarming, and negates the project’s purpose.
Therefore, being the PSRMS focal person, the crime & investigation DIG is authorised to place cops from police constables to inspectors, who are non-compliant with the above directions, under suspension and close them to B Company at the police HQ.
The DIG is also authorised to initiate departmental proceedings against them. However, misconduct reports in respect of the relevant DSPs and SSPs of investigation units, if found negligent, may be sent to the CPO for further necessary action.
Earlier, Memon had said the provision of maximum resources to the investigation branch is the need of the hour.
“The investigation department is the identity of the police department, and the only option we have is to be a good investigator.”
He said that all the authority that the law gives police is that of investigation, and the officers’ enthusiasm for improving the investigation department is palpable.
“If the IO prepares himself, works hard, makes a case, then he gets self-confidence in him. We’re making the investigation department financially independent, and it’s very important to strengthen the capabilities of the investigation branch.”
He also said the Crime Scene Unit is doing a great job. The use of latest technology in collecting evidence from the scene has improved significantly, and the PSRMS should be upgraded further, he added.
He also ordered the crime & investigation DIG that the PSRMS be linked to the Case Flow Management System. He said the move is aimed at preserving complete case records. It is the prerogative of the IO to make an investigation bill of up to Rs200,000, he added.
He also said police stations have been made financially independent, with the allocation of a budget. “SHOs should use the allocated budget. We want to work for your growth and career planning.”
The IG said that this time trainees have been authorised to choose their own training centres. This time no unfit officer or jawan will be able to go to any departmental promotion course, he added.
“I wish that a fit officer or a young man be promoted in every respect. We have a special focus on the investigation department. You detect crime; future crime will automatically stop.”
He said that the biggest and most important role in crime detection is the investigation department. The identification parade of criminals is an important part of the investigation department, he added.
“Our biggest strength is investigation. Officers associated with investigation should participate in departmental courses so that they can become the best and experts in their field.”

SHC issues show-cause notice to Wapda chairman for not filing report on Nai Gaj Dam project,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321395-shc-issues-show-cause-notice-to-wapda-chairman-for-not-filing-report-on-nai-gaj-dam-project,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued a show cause notice to the Water & Power Development Authority (Wapda) chairman for not complying with a court order with regard to the Nai Gaj Dam project in Dadu, and directed him to appear in person and file a compliance report.
The show cause notice was issued on a petition of a private joint venture construction firm that sought implementation of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the completion of the Nai Gaj dam project in Dadu.
A division bench of the SHC headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha had directed Wapda to remove obstacles hindering the smooth operation of the project and clear the outstanding dues of the petitioner, if any, on account of any price escalation as stipulated in the original agreed upon MoU that was in place before the disputed decision caused such escalation.
The high court had directed the petitioner to complete any necessary remedial or other works on the project within four months stating that Wapda would make separate provisions and reimburse the petitioner for those works undertaken during these four months, subject to the work being completed on the spot.
The Sindh High Court  further observed that reimbursement rate would be based on escalation in the originally agreed upon MoU which incorporated the issue of price escalation. The SHC had told the parties to renegotiate an extension of the existing contract if the same was coming to an end so that the project could be completed through continuity in a timely fashion for the benefit of the people of Sindh and it was not left as a half-built project/monument to the wastage of taxpayers’ money.
The SHC had also the asked the parties to jointly appoint a well-qualified senior member of the Pakistan Engineering Council who should ascertain precisely the amount of work completed by the construction company whose cost of appointment shall be borne equally by the parties whose assessment may assist the parties in determining whether or not to extend the contract. The high court had directed the Wapda chairman to submit a compliance report on directions of the court.
The bench observed that no compliance report had been filed by the Wapda chairman in compliance with the court order and issued a show cause notice to him telling him to appear in person and file a compliance report on the next date of hearing.
The SHC directed the Wapda chairman to ensure that the compliance report was placed on record. The high court observed that no counsel for Wapda had appeared before the court in spite of the fact that it was a date-fixed matter.
The bench ordered that the show-cause notice shall be sent to the Wapda chairman through fax and electronic modes.
It is pertinent to mention that the petitioner and Wapda had entered into a contract on April 12, 2011 in relation to a public-sector development project for the construction of the Nai Gaj Dam in Dadu but the same could not be completed due to price escalation and multiple litigations by the parties over the implementation of the contract.

Noor Muhammad and Haroon alias Aziz were found guilty of barging into a house within the jurisdiction of the Korangi Industrial Area (KIA) police station and escaping with Rs250,000 in cash, four tola gold and two mobile phones after holding the family hostage.
Additional Sessions Judge (East) Shahid Ali Memon observed that the prosecution succeeded in establishing the case against the accused persons beyond any shadow of doubt; therefore, under such circumstances, they deserve to be punished in accordance with law.
He sentenced the convicts to life imprisonment for offence punishable under Section 395 (punishment for dacoity) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
They were handed down additional seven-year imprisonment with a Rs50,000 fine for committing offence punishable under Section 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) of the PPC.
All the sentences shall run concurrently, said the judge.
According to the prosecution, on July 6, 2021, two accused along with their absconding accomplices stormed the house of a scrap dealer, Muhammad Anwar, in Mazoor Colony and beat his sons Hamza Anwar and Safdar Anwar. They held the family members hostage in a room and took away Rs250,000 in cash, four tola gold and two mobile phones.
The accused were initially arrested by the Awami Colony police on October 4, 2021 and they later admitted their involvement in this incident during interrogation, it mentioned.

JI urges govt to support Iran in war against Israel,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321355-ji-urges-govt-to-support-iran-in-war-against-israel,"LAHORE : Jamaat-e-Islami emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has urged the government to take immediate and practical steps in support of Iran.
“Israel has become a rampaging elephant, posing a grave threat to regional security,” he said while addressing the newly elected Central Consultative Council (Majlis-e-Shura) at Mansoorah on Saturday.
“We strongly condemn Israel attack on Iran. It is a dangerous escalation that threatens the peace and stability of the entire region,” he said, reaffirming the party’s solidarity with the government and people of Iran. The people of Pakistan, he said, stand firmly with Iran in the face of Israeli aggression.
The three-day session of the Shura is being held at the JI headquarters in Lahore, with elected members from across the country in attendance. Over ninety male and female members took oath at the opening session. A unanimous resolution was also passed condemning Israeli terrorism and expressing support for Iran. Hafiz Naeemur Rehman is chairing the proceedings.
In his keynote address, Rehman recalled how JI founder Syed Maududi supported the government during the 1965 war despite political differences with President Ayub Khan. He added that the JI revived that spirit during the recent Pakistan-India military crisis by prioritising national interest over political disagreements.
Commenting on the attack on Iran, Rehman said, “It is tragic and condemnable. Jamaat will play its role in this critical hour. The government must step forward in Iran’s support. Iran is a major force backing resistance movements like Hamas.”
He appreciated the recent resolutions passed by the National Assembly and Senate in support of Iran, and also welcomed the National Assembly Speaker’s statement rejecting the recognition of Israel.
Highlighting Israeli atrocities in Palestine, Rehman called it the worst form of oppression in human history. He expressed deep disappointment at the silence of the international community, including the United Nations, the OIC, and Muslim governments. He urged the government to reflect the will of the nation and take a leading role in protecting the people of Gaza from Israeli terrorism. He demanded a clear message be sent to Israel and its ally, the United States, that terrorism against Muslims and humanity must end. He also called for urgent arrangements to deliver food, medicines, and aid to Palestinians.
On the Kashmir issue, Rehman reiterated Jamaat-e-Islami’s long-standing position that the dispute must be resolved in accordance with UN resolutions. He condemned India’s continued human rights violations in Occupied Kashmir and stated that no negotiations with India should proceed without addressing Kashmir.

In your memory papa…,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321358-in-your-memory-papa,"Another Father’s Day is going to pass but I yet remember the exact moment when my brother started quivering and with shivering lips, after gathering courage disclosed “Papa is no more”. The initial shock was terrible. It brought home the reality. We never know what’s going to happen.
Impulsively, ducked around a corner to avoid this truth. I’d just learned of my father’s death, tongue-tied. What I did know was that our lives would never be same again. For the next few days I had low-grade fever. I had been fighting strange battle. There was moment of quiet. I was sitting in shocked silence when Mom hugged me, tears were now streaming down my face, she threw her arms around me, holding me tight she kept on saying some comforting phrases for giving hope in overwhelming time. Eyes welling up with tears. I couldn’t stop my tears. Laid my head in her lap, breathed deeply and finally embracing her let out a bewildered cry. I collapsed screaming incoherently.
Just like cactus I grew up on the path of life, really so wild. The poisonous pointed thorns inward, constantly sting. Each and every time I lashed out at people, every chance I got. Why? Because not so strong enough to make me forget that pain. When relatives and friends came to know that you are no more they descended upon us in hordes, armed with sympathy and suggestions. I didn’t like. “Keep me out of it”, I always cried. Your so-called family, kept them out of consoling scene. No phone call, no support, no care, no worries. They properly attempted to delete our existence on earth. But we grew. I am strong enough to combat life. Still, I am prison of fear- fear of losing someone, dear one.
Everything has tipped into abstractions after your demise. Today I have been realizing that I want you desperately. I want to do something to stop this, but grief is more complicated, more intense and longer lasting. I think sometimes will never get over it. Even sometimes the feelings over-come. Now, right after you these are legacies: anger, profound grief. To me, your death is simply a part of. In your presence our lives were like can of rainbow colours. But unfortunately right after you everything hurls in a huge globe of black. We can’t get out of it, in search of escape I am. I tried a lot to add infinite colours which I gathered from palette of life but black remained dominant.
We grew up .We didn’t talk to mother that way, not even when she’d managed to lose what was important in her life. Besides her, I never was much for talking, not about what we really think. Today I love my mother more than ever, although I would never have admitted it then. I love her because after you courageously and alone she held herself wire-taut readiness to protect us from every harm. There were wonderful challenges in our life. I have had plenty of setbacks and disappointments. I’d shed my tears privately. Each and every time she picked me up, dusts me off and focused on what’s out in front. She gave me the confidence that I could do whatever I set out to do.
After you I felt so betrayed. I couldn’t stand to hear anything. Each and every day I found myself thinking of you, without the blood slamming around inside my skull. I usually think about the saying you had liked so much. You usually kept on saying to me, as elder kid, that to take cares of things. Well, I do now going to take care of. Whenever watch other at play it remind me of that unforgettable time when we too had done the same things. I yet can smell the fragrance of my childhood in garden, living room…..Yes. I do have early memories of you at all. You are always around us, truly, my nerves always cry to let you back into our life to punish me, nag me for my mischievous acts, but I do know it isn’t possible.
Confronting abusive paternal family who is always there to let me down since your demise in 1995—getting strength from their abusive strikes which are getting worst day by day either in public or before any court of law. You weren’t only my father but also my loving, caring and intimate friend.My mother thinks I’m stronger emotionally. Truly I’m not. She used to say that the stars are the eyes of the dead.That’s why I always talk to you while seeing those sparkling and twinkling stars, shining up on the huge canvas of sky, assuming that up there you are smiling. Whenever I am desperate and broken I share feelings with you, it truly soothes that yet you are around me, you can hear me. It cherishes, I don’t have words to narrate that satisfaction I usually feel after talking to you. Usually I think about how much we have missed over the past eight years and how much more we will miss.
Sometimes I asked quietly to myself ‘what made me think, I could take something you left for us’. So, here is the answer -your profound love and it will never fade away. Even now I get sudden ambushes of terrible sadness and grieving and I do know it will probably for the rest of my life. When one loses somebody, some hidden emotions can sneak up at any time, in any situation. Whenever it happens I head to your memories, to your stuff, to preserved moments in form of photos andwhile seeing I talk to you, sprinting down memory lane. This is where I wished to be alone and to mourn the biggest loss of our life. At stake due to malafide intentions and foul games of the paternal family, their facilitators and counsels that are intentionally filling frivolous applications since I stood for my legal rights. The language used is unreasonable and outrageous-highly objectionable and is based on humiliating statements and scandalous statements. Even in profound depression whenever I pay a look at your portrait it compels me to have a smile- it’s a journey without you but marked by courage, resilience, and hope since I am proud of being your daughter.
After your demise I did cry a lot .I didn’t know what was going on. I do try a lot to keep up a front. Truly, yet I don’t have enough courage to step into the DHA’s cemetery. Standing outside I just stare the graves, where you and grandparents are sleeping till the trumpet of Israfil should awaken you all.
Since your death values have shifted. Now the life is not as simple as it was in your presence.I deadly want to press back space key button but to re-shift my past but discovered working position out of order.
I sought solace in books, my paints and canvas. I decided good intentions-never enough. I became fiercely protective of our happiness. Happiness became my yard-stick of success. I spent lot of time thinking about what I wanted to be when I grew up. Finally I became journalist. Because, ultimately ’the truth’ is a mission, sorry yours mission because you usually kept on saying that one day I would be your ‘Parwaz’.

The delegation included Prof. Dr. Amjad Abbas Khan Magsi, former President FAPUASA, President Punjab University Academic Staff Association, and Dr. M Islam President FAPUASA (Punjab Chapter). The delegation urged the minister to address several urgent concerns in the upcoming provincial budget.

The minister promised to enhance the recurring grants substantially for the universities in the coming budget, which will be elevated further in the coming years. It was demanded that there should also be a substantial increase in the salaries of government employees and Disparity Reduction Allowance on the pattern of Federal government.
The minister assured of a healthy pay increase in the upcoming budget.

"Plane crash survivor Zafar Masud shares lessons on life, healing in new memoir",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321341-plane-crash-survivor-zafar-masud-shares-lessons-on-life-healing-in-new-memoir,"Islamabad : Zafar Masud, President and CEO of The Bank of Punjab, officially launched his memoir “Seat 1C: A Survivor’s Tale of Hope, Resilience, and Renewal” during a special edition of ‘Breakfast with Jang’ on Saturday. The book recounts his extraordinary journey as one of only two survivors of the tragic 2020 plane crash, offering readers a deeply personal narrative of trauma, reflection, and transformation.
Seat 1C does more than recount the harrowing minutes of the crash—it digs deep into the psychological and emotional aftermath of facing death and the clarity it brings to life’s true priorities. Interwoven with testimonies from the only other survivor, key witnesses, and accounts of his miraculous rescue, the memoir explores how such a life-altering experience reshapes one's worldview. Masud uses his story to urge readers to seek a life aligned with purpose and impact—a life without regret.
The event, attended by a wide cross-section of society—bureaucrats, journalists, writers, academics, bankers, and students—featured a heartfelt conversation with Masud and Jang Group Managing Director and President All Pakistan Newspaper Society, Sarmad Ali. The session was moderated by Aliya Agha, lawyer and Deputy Convener of the ADR Committee.
The event began with a minute of silence in memory of the recent Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad. “What’s lost cannot be undone,” Masud said, “but we can honour the departed by committing ourselves to addressing the causes behind such tragedies.”
Echoing Masud’s concerns, Sarmad Ali called for stricter regulations around airport safety, including restrictions on residential development near airports and measures to control bird populations in those areas. He praised Masud’s memoir as an act of service “a way of giving back to society.”
Comparing the survival of two passengers in plane crash of 2020 in Pakistan and that of Vishwashkumar Ramesh, the lone survivor of the Air India crash, Masud noted that both had changed seats shortly before take-off. “International media is trying to prove that it was the location of seat that saved us which was next to entry and the emergency doors,” he remarked. “But I believe it was nothing short of a miracle that I’m sitting here with all of you today.”
Masud shared the core of Seat 1C, which is structured around key lessons drawn from what he calls his “30 seconds before death.” “In that moment,” he recalled, “it felt as though I was in a courtroom—facing my own self, accountable for the life I had lived.”
He spoke candidly about the psychological toll of surviving and the continuing need for therapy. “Even after publishing the book, I’ve had to return to psychotherapy,” he admitted. “Given the intense pressures of modern life and how the world is evolving, we all carry emotional burdens. Seeking help is not weakness—it’s wisdom.”
Masud emphasized the critical role of his support system—his family, friends, and colleagues—in helping him heal. “I was lucky to be surrounded by love and strength. Without that, recovery would have been very difficult.”
Masud revealed that discussion in book talks has inspired him to write a sequel of his memoir. He said that while the writing process was a learning experience, listening to the public perceptions gave him a deeper insight. He also announced that an Urdu translation of Seat 1C is underway and will be available in the coming months. He concluded his talk by reading a powerful excerpt from his book:
“Surviving a plane crash introduces incongruous thoughts you never imagined could exist in your brain. You feel horrified and devastated by the tragedy surrounding you, yet simultaneously relieved at your survival. And despite that relief, you question why you survived. When survivor’s guilt takes even the smallest hold in your mind, it becomes a constant, unrelenting struggle—to balance grief and gratitude, pain and peace, depression and a new hunger for life—all at once.”
The event ended with a vibrant question and answer session, leaving the audience moved, inspired, and reflective.

‘18% GST on solar panels a misstep’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321342-18pc-gst-on-solar-panels-a-misstep,"Islamabad : Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI, has said that the budget’s regressive taxation structure, particularly the 18% General Sales Tax (GST) on solar panels, is a “misstep” that undermines Pakistan’s climate ambitions and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
Dr Suleri was addressing a post-budget media briefing organised by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) here Friday.
Dr Suleri said that this move contradicts the newly introduced carbon levy and global commitments to phase out fossil fuels.
He highlighted Pakistan’s pressing fiscal constraints saying that the government has only Rs11 trillion at its disposal amid massive debt repayments and increasing defence needs.
He said that India’s $80 billion defence budget dwarfs Pakistan’s $7 billion. The government is compelled to ramp up defence spending, especially after recent tensions with India, but this comes at the cost of development expenditure, he regretted.
The budget reflects an increase in pension expenditures over salaries and development allocations have seen cuts despite pressing needs, he added. “The allocation for dams remains ‘business as usual,’ even as the Indus Waters Treaty stands suspended. Water should be treated with the same urgency as defence,” Dr Suleri suggested.
Dr Sajid Amin Javed, Deputy Executive Director, SDPI, pointed out that the budget was designed to meet short-term IMF targets but lacked long-term structural reforms. The focus is clearly on meeting the conditions for the next IMF tranche rather than steering economic transformation, he said.
With Rs600 billion in new taxes, mostly indirect, and inflation expected to stay high, he warned that the budget will squeeze the salaried class while offering tax breaks to sectors like real estate and large retailers. The expected growth rate of 4.2% may realistically fall between 3.5% to 3.7% amid global uncertainties, particularly the Iran-Israel conflict’s impact on oil prices. Dr Amin noted that the agriculture sector, critical to Pakistan’s economy, remains underprioritised.
Dr Shafqat Munir, SDPI Deputy Executive Director, acknowledged the tough economic conditions under which the budget was framed, stating that every government tries to cut the cloth according to the size. He welcomed the 6% budget allocation for climate-related commitments and the 8.6% of development funding directed at climate adaptation. However, he pointed out the contradictions that jmposing 18% GST on solar panels while introducing a carbon levy of Rs2.5 per litre sends mixed signals.
Highlighting the global decline in humanitarian aid, he urged Pakistan to invest in anticipatory resilience and disaster risk reduction, calling this budget the first to meaningfully acknowledge climate impacts.

NCSW concerned over Pakistan’s ranking in gender gap report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321344-ncsw-concerned-over-pakistan-s-ranking-in-gender-gap-report,"Islamabad : National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) has expressed strong concerns over Pakistan's ranking in the Global Gender Gap Report 2025 by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
In a statement issued on Saturday, the NCSW Chairperson, Ume Laila Azhar, has questioned the report's methodology, citing issues with data representation and visibility.
She said that the data is present but not visible, and the report's findings do not accurately reflect the country's progress on gender parity.
The Commission has taken serious note of the report's methodology, which relies on perception surveys with limited sample sizes, predominantly filled out by men rather than women themselves. NCSW believed that this approach has led to a skewed perspective and undermines the true progress made by Pakistan on gender equality.
Notably, the report's inaccuracies are evident in the ""Women in Ministerial Positions"" indicator, where Pakistan is given a 0 score despite having a female minister at the federal level, a female Chief Minister, and female ministers in the provincial cabinets of Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan. NCSW has decided to collaborate with relevant authorities to collect and disseminate accurate data, ensuring a precise representation of women's status in Pakistan.
The statement says that the Commission will enhance activities for updated data on the National Gender Data Portal to provide a true reflection of gender parity in the country. Furthermore, NCSW will conclude a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Mishaal Pakistan, which will facilitate the development of a comprehensive National Gender Gap Report 2026 featuring a standard format and baseline dataset from its already functional National Gender Data portal as regular feature.

Iesco to discontinue bills’ collection through Pak Post from July 1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321345-iesco-to-discontinue-bills-collection-through-pak-post-from-july-1,"Islamabad : Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO) has suddenly withdrawn the electricity bills collection service from Pakistan Post from July 1, says a press release.
The aim of this move by Iesco is to digitalise the manual system of collections and avoid losses in cash collections. Meanwhile, sources in Pakistan Post expressed surprise at this sudden unilateral decision and assured that the institution has been receiving Rs8 per bill on utility bills for two decades, but due to high expenses, the institution is facing losses, despite this, the provision of services has been continued in view of the convenience of the public and the prestige of the institution.
Pakistan Post has collected 46.7 million bills of electricity, gas, telephone and WASA in the first 10 months of the current fiscal year and the number of utility bills will exceed 55 million by the end of June.
Public confidence in the institution is shown by the figures that during the last fiscal year, more than 42.8 million bills of electricity companies were collected in post offices. Of which 10 million bills are from IESCO alone. And during the current financial year, the figures so far are showing a significant increase.
All utility companies, including IESCO, already have an alternative proposed facility for submitting bills, but the public depends mostly on this national institution. Meanwhile, sources said that the process of digitizing Pakistan Post is going on rapidly, but despite this, this sudden decision will cause severe difficulties for the public, especially rural consumers.

FAPUASA announces nationwide protests against neglecting higher education,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321348-fapuasa-announces-nationwide-protests-against-neglecting-higher-education,"Islamabad : In an Executive Council (EC) meeting of Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) held on Friday, the EC unanimously expressed serious concern over the Federal Government's neglect of the higher education sector in the recently announced budget for FY2025-26.
The meeting was presided by Dr Mazhar Iqbal (President).
Despite repeated assurances, the Federal Government once again failed to address the critical financial needs of universities. It lamented that the annual recurring grant for higher education remained stagnant at Rs65 billion since 2018, despite a massive increase in the overall federal budget, from Rs 5.9 trillion in 2018 to Rs17.5 trillion in 2025, marking a 196% increase. Over the same period, the number of public sector universities increased from 126 to 156, resulting in significant financial pressure that remains unaddressed.
Adding to the crisis, provinces, with the exception of Sindh, have not allocated any meaningful support to universities, leaving most public sector institutions struggling to meet even their basic obligations such as payment of salaries, pensions and operational expenses. The situation is pushing many universities to the brink of financial collapse.
FAPUASA emphasised the urgent need for an immediate and substantial increase in the recurring grant, at least Rs200 billion to ensure the financial sustainability of the higher education sector.
In addition, FAPUASA expressed strong reservations regarding the unresolved issue of the 25% tax rebate for teachers and researchers.
During the 14th meeting of the Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by Dr Nafisa Shah, the Secretary Revenue assured committee members that the clause ""and shall cease to have effect after tax year 2025"" would be removed.

NIETE project cost triples amid concerns over training,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321349-niete-project-cost-triples-amid-concerns-over-training,"Islamabad : The National Institute of Excellence in Teacher Education (NIETE), a teacher training project in Islamabad, is under scrutiny following a sharp rise in its cost and widespread criticism of its training programmes.
Approved by the Departmental Development Working Party in March 2023 at a cost of Rs960.761 million, the project has now been revised to a staggering Rs2,552.327 million, a 266 per cent increase.
The revised PC-1 is currently under review by the Central Development Working Party.
According to official figures, Rs515.506 million has already been spent by December 2024, yet training outcomes remain unsatisfactory. The project’s gestation period has also been extended from 24 months (ending June 2025) to 37 months (now set to complete in February 2028).
Until now, Rs515.506 million has already been spent by December 2024, despite the project's ongoing training programmes being widely criticised as ineffective and poorly executed.
An official from the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives said education projects often fell short due to scope creep, communication failures and corruption.
""Awarding the teacher training contract to a single bidder compromised the quality and transparency of the project,” he said.
Frontline educators echo these concerns. A woman teacher from a model public college in the capital city criticised the NIETE's digital training strategy, saying it is unsuitable for students in grades 1 to 5 and a waste of public funds.
“The online content is full of errors and doesn't align with the curriculum, leading to confusion among students,” she said.

Mental Health First Aid importance underlined,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321399-mental-health-first-aid-importance-underlined,"PESHAWAR: A mental health expert has likened Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for the mind, urging people-especially students-to learn these essential skills and train others in communities to better cope with rising psychological challenges.
“Just as CPR can save a life during cardiac arrest-when the heart stops beating or fails to circulate blood to the brain and vital organs-MHFA is equally important for mental health crises,” said Prof Dr Ali Ahsan Mufti, head of the Department of Psychiatry & Behavioural Sciences at Jinnah Medical College, Peshawar. He was speaking at a session titled “The Power of Mental Health First Aid” hosted by the Abasyn University.
Addressing faculty and students, Dr Mufti said not all wounds are visible. “Mental health struggles don’t always show on the outside-there are no bruises or bandages,” he remarked.
“What appears as isolation, anger, or fatigue may actually be anxiety, depression, or trauma. Your empathy could be the first step in someone’s healing journey. This begins with noticing, reaching out, and offering care,” he added.
Dr Mufti, who also serves as Director and Consultant Psychiatrist at Ibadat Hospital, Nishtarabad, and Chapter Chief of the Pakistan Psychiatric Society, stressed that mental health challenges often remain hidden. “Colleagues may be silently suffering. “It’s essential to be observant and offer support-not judgment. A simple act of kindness can be a step toward recovery,” said the doctor who also holds a directorial position at Greenfield Hospital of Psychiatry in Islamabad.
Quoting World Health Organization (WHO) data, Dr Mufti highlighted the alarming frequency of suicide worldwide-one person dies by suicide every 40 seconds, which amounts to 1.5 deaths per minute, 90 per hour, and over 800,000 deaths annually. He noted that suicidal behavior is more prevalent among adolescents.
Regarding panic disorders, he cited global statistics showing that 13 to 28 per cent of people experience a panic attack at some point in their lives, with 1.7 to 3.5 per cent  affected in any given year.
Touching on anxiety disorders, Dr Mufti referenced WHO surveys that estimate 13 16 per cent of the population suffers from them, though they remain under-diagnosed due to stigma, limited awareness, and inadequate access to mental healthcare.
Explaining the fundamentals of first aid, he referred to the WHO and American Red Cross definitions: “First aid is the immediate and temporary care given to an ill or injured person before professional medical help is available.”

Traders in Malakand reject federal budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321402-traders-in-malakand-reject-federal-budget,"MINGORA: Malakand Division Traders Federation president Abdul Rahim on Saturday outrightly rejected the recent federal budget, terming it “anti-public and unconstitutional.”
Talking to reporters at the Swat Press Club along with president of Swat Hotels Association Zahid Khan, spokesperson of Swat Traders Federation Dr Khalid Mehmood and Hayat Ali, he strongly condemned the imposition of a 10percent sales tax on raw materials in Malakand Division.
He warned that the business community would launch a vigorous protest movement if the constitutional special status of Malakand Division is not restored.
“Unfortunately, all policies in Pakistan are crafted under IMF directives, benefiting only the bureaucracy and elite, while pushing the poor into deeper misery,” he went on to add.
Rahim said the new federal budget continues this trend of economic exploitation, especially targeting local industries and small traders in Malakand with the new tax. “As per Pakistan’s Constitution, Malakand Division holds a unique status in recognition of the historic sacrifices of its people,” he asserted.
He warned the government that traders would never accept the erosion of Malakand’s constitutional standing. “Since becoming part of Pakistan in 1969, we have endured terrorism, earthquakes, and floods, and made countless sacrifices. Yet, today we are treated like a testing ground,” he lamented.
Criticizing powerful industrial lobbies, he urged Punjab-based industrialists to stop exploiting Malakand’s business sector. “Stop the conspiracies, or we will respond in kind,” he warned.
Abdul Rahim also criticised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, blaming his incompetence for the suspension of development funds in the region and continued underdevelopment.
He announced that a joint meeting of all trader organisations across Malakand Division would soon be convened to decide the next course of action. He said political parties, lawyers, industrialists, PSMA, and civil society would be invited to join the upcoming protest movement.

Mohmand jirga urges govt to fulfill demands,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321403-mohmand-jirga-urges-govt-to-fulfill-demands,"GHALLANAI: A jirga of the Khwezai tribes on Saturday urged the government and relevant departments to fulfill their demands or else they would launch a protest movement for their rights.
Convened in Ataa Bazaar under the banner of Da Khwezai Jirga to press for the resolution of longstanding demands, the elders put forward a list of 15 key demands.
The demands included the reopening of the Gorsal Road, shifting of all departments in the newly-built political compound, provision of full staff in schools and hospitals, implementation of the Lift Canal Scheme from the Kabul River, acceleration of construction work on the Gorsal Road, reopening of the Benazir Income Support Programme point, inauguration of the DSL exchange, appointment of staff at the electricity gridstation, establishment of a Rescue 1122 centre, local youth recruitment, and inclusion of area-specific development schemes and others.
Bezai Subdivision Nazim Bismillah Jan Rahimi, chairman Ibrahim Khan, president Bakht Biland, general secretary Niaz Wali Khan, Tafseer Mohmand, Malik Rustam, Ilyas Afzal, Azim Khan and others said that they represented thousands of residents in the border subdivision of Khwezai along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
They emphasized that repeated appeals had been made to senior authorities and local parliamentarians to address their grievances but to no avail.
They highlighted that the local hospital has expensive X-ray and ultrasound machines that are lying unused due to the absence of technical staff, and that there was no clean drinking water available in the facility.
Many schools in the region, the speakers complained, operateed with only a single teacher and several were completely non-functional. They also criticized the fact that only Mohmand’s Gorsal and Nawapas trade routes with Afghanistan remain closed, while other merged districts enjoy access.

Illegal structure along Kunhar River demolished,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321404-illegal-structure-along-kunhar-river-demolished,"MANSEHRA: The district administration on Saturday launched an anti-encroachment drive along the Kunhar River in Balakot tehsil, demolishing dozens of illegal structures.
“This operation has been initiated on the directives of the Peshawar High Court and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief secretary to preserve the river’s ecology and protect human lives in case of flooding,” Assistant Commissioner, Balakot, Nadir Khan, told reporters on Saturday.
Led by the assistant commissioner, a team comprising officials from various departments and equipped with heavy machinery began demolishing illegally constructed hotels, houses and other structures along the Kunhar River in Kaghan valley.
“This is the first phase of the operation. The operation will be launched in other areas of Balakot tehsil in the second phase. The Kunhar River, which originates from Babusar Top and flows downstream to Azad Jammu and Kashmir, must remain unobstructed,” he added.
He said that the operation was carried out under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rivers Protection Ordinance, 2002, and that all encroachments within a 200-foot radius of the river were being removed.
“Structures that hamper the natural flow of the river, many of which were built by land grabbers, are being demolished,” he said, adding that the deputy commissioner of Mansehra was overseeing the operation.”
The assistant commissioner also urged encroachers to voluntarily remove illegal constructions along the riverbank or face action.
“We will not allow anyone to endanger lives or damage the environment by altering the natural flow of the Kunhar River, which is fed by glacial meltwater from the Kaghan valley,” he added.
He lamented that the natural beauty and ecological balance of the region, including the popular tourist destination of Kaghan valley, had been marred by unregulated and abrupt construction.

Probe sought into frequent wildfires,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321406-probe-sought-into-frequent-wildfires,"BATKHELA: A Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) local leader on Saturday alleged that the recent spate of wildfires in the mountainous regions of Malakand were not natural, but part of a deliberate plan to cover up corruption in the Billion Tree Tsunami project.
Speaking at a joining ceremony held in the hilly area of Banjoo Nanda here, PMLN Malakand district president Sajjad Ahmad Khan said, “For the past several months, wildfires have been breaking out across various hills of the district. These are not natural incidents; they are being set intentionally to destroy evidence of mismanagement and corruption in the Billion Tree project.”
He demanded that the Forest Department conduct a thorough investigation and ensure that those responsible are held accountable.
Sajjad Ahmad Khan said that PMLN was a strong political party with a solid record of economic stability and national defense.
“Inflation was brought under control during our tenure, and the economy saw improvement. On the defense front, Pakistan’s armed forces earned the respect of the nation and the world,” he added.

Failure to submit comments: Court orders to withhold salaries of officials,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321407-failure-to-submit-comments-court-orders-to-withhold-salaries-of-officials,"ABBOTTABAD: The Peshawar High Court Abbottabad circuit bench on Saturday ordered withholding the salaries of the officials concerned for failing to submit comments in a case related to mine blasting activities.
The court directed the Senior Inspector of Mines to appear in person and ordered the withholding of salaries of two officials until they complied with the court orders.
Justice Sadiq Ali and Justice Mudassir Ameer heard the case. The Senior Inspector of Mines was directed to appear in person before the court due to the failure to submit required comments despite ongoing blasting activities.
Similarly, the salaries of the Senior Inspector of Mines and DPO Abbottabad would be withheld until they filed their para-wise comments as per the court’s earlier directions.
In an earlier judgement passed by Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel the court modified an earlier order, directing the leaseholder to refrain from using explosive materials for blasting mines.
The court ordered the Senior Inspector of Mines and DPO Abbottabad to enforce the court orders.  Barrister Hashim Iqbal Jadoon represented the petitioners.

Cop killed in Battagram,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321408-cop-killed-in-battagram,"BATTAGRAM: A constable identified as Ghulam Ishaq was killed at a filling station when he was refueling his car in the remote Battagram district, police sources said on Saturday.

It was learnt that the cop was refueling his vehicle when armed men opened fire on him, killing him on the spot. The accused fled the scene. The police launched an investigation to probe the matter.

Meanwhile, the local people staged a protest against the killing and asked the police to solve the case. Speaking on the occasion, Shaukat Hayat, a prominent social activist in the region, asked the police to bring the culprits to justice.
Saeed Malklal, a political figure from Battagram said that this murder is a sad reflection of the lawlessness that sometimes plagues our society.

UN backs development push in south Punjab to tap economic potential,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321292-un-backs-development-push-in-south-punjab-to-tap-economic-potential,"KARACHI: The United Nations is stepping up support for economic and social development in south Punjab, a region seen as critical to Pakistan’s agricultural economy, said UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Mohammad Yahya on Saturday.
Speaking at the Multan Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI), Yahya said the UN has over 4,000 personnel working across Pakistan and is focused on bolstering infrastructure, climate resilience, agriculture and technology in south Punjab.
“South Punjab is an important geographical area, and the UN will continue its support in tackling challenges related to climate change, technology, agriculture and other sectors,” Yahya said. He also invited business leaders from the region to Islamabad to collaborate on strategies for attracting greater investment.
The visit, led by Senate Chairman’s Adviser Misbah Khar and industrialist Ghulam M. Yahya Khar, comes amid renewed attention on underdeveloped regions of Pakistan. South Punjab lags behind much of the country in education, health and infrastructure despite its central role in agriculture.
Fernanda Thomaz, representative of the UN’s International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), highlighted ongoing poverty alleviation programmes in the region. These include livestock provision to 400,000 poor women, housing for 7,300 landless women, and the operation of 40 community food banks benefitting 30,000 households across 10 districts.
MCCI President Bakhtawar Tanvir Sheikh said south Punjab still faces deep-rooted structural challenges across sectors, including agriculture, climate adaptation, and girls’ education. He urged the UN to expand its focus and support for the region. Sheikh also credited Senate Chairman Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani with advancing several major development projects.
In their remarks, Misbah Khar and Yahya Khar called for enhanced partnerships to promote girls’ education and improve healthcare access in the region.
The event was attended by a number of local stakeholders, including Senator Rana Mehmood ul Hassan, MCCI Vice President Muhammad Azhar Baloch, and other business and political leaders.

Stocks likely to stay rangebound amid geopolitical tensions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321293-stocks-likely-to-stay-rangebound-amid-geopolitical-tensions,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) posted a modest gain during the outgoing week, with the benchmark KSE-100 index rising by 0.4 per cent on a week-on-week (WoW) basis.
While investor sentiment was buoyed early in the week by a market-friendly budget and strong economic data, mounting geopolitical tensions by the week’s end weighed on gains and triggered a round of profit-taking.
The market is expected to remain range-bound in the near term, as geopolitical risks may temper bullish sentiment. Investors will also closely watch for any further developments regarding foreign inflows, external financing and potential revisions to the budget proposals as the debate in parliament unfolds.
The market opened on a positive note as the federal budget for FY26 sparked optimism among investors. The government’s decision to keep capital gains tax (CGT) and dividend tax rates unchanged, along with its broader fiscal consolidation approach, was perceived favourably by market participants. “The PSX welcomed Budget FY26 as the government did not announce any adverse measures for the capital markets, where CGT provisions were better than expected, encouraging mutual funds to divert funds towards equities,” said Syed Danyal Hussain, analyst at JS Global.
The KSE-100 index climbed as much as 2.2 per cent in the first two sessions of the week, reaching an all-time high of 124,353 points. However, sentiment turned cautious on Friday following global developments. The US imposed a 50 per cent tariff on steel imports from key trading partners, while tensions escalated in the Middle East following an Israeli strike in Iran that killed senior military personnel. These developments triggered a correction at the close of the week.
On a weekly basis, the KSE-100 gained 502 points, equivalent to a 0.4 per cent rise. Average daily traded volume surged to 907 million shares, up 37 per cent week-on-week, while average daily traded value rose by 33 per cent to Rs37 billion. “The budget’s overall tone of fiscal prudence combined with incentives for the salaried class and construction sector created a constructive environment for equities,” noted analyst Nabeel Haroon at Topline Securities.
The finance minister unveiled a Rs17.3 trillion budget for FY26. The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3.9 per cent of GDP and achieve a primary surplus of 2.4 per cent. Tax revenues are projected at Rs14.1 trillion, up 19 per cent year-on-year, while the public sector development programme (PSDP) has been allocated Rs1 trillion, representing a 29 per cent increase. Relief measures for the salaried class included tax cuts in the first three income slabs, while additional initiatives were announced to boost construction activity.
Macroeconomic indicators also added support to market performance. Remittances in May stood at $3.7 billion, marking a 16 per cent month-on-month (MoM) and 14 per cent year-on-year increase, making it the second-highest monthly inflow on record. For the eleven months of FY25, cumulative remittances reached approximately $35 billion, up 29 per cent from the same period last year. The government signalled plans to secure $2 billion in financing from commercial banks to help raise the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange reserves to $14 billion by the end of June.
Further bolstering sentiment was data showing large-scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 1.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in March 2025, indicating signs of a gradual recovery in industrial activity. Meanwhile, car sales rose sharply in May, posting a 31 per cent year-on-year increase, another signal of improving consumer confidence.
In the government’s T-bill auction during the week, Rs853 billion was raised against a target of Rs900 billion. Yields declined between 1 and 25 basis points, suggesting lower inflation expectations and potential room for monetary easing in the months ahead.
Analysts anticipate selective interest in stocks linked to construction, banking and consumer sectors as clarity emerges on budget execution and international developments.

"Karachi business leaders call federal, Sindh budgets biased",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321294-karachi-business-leaders-call-federal-sindh-budgets-biased,"KARACHI: Chairperson of the Businessmen Group (BMG) Zubair Motiwala and President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) Muhammad Jawed Bilwani have strongly criticised the Federal and Sindh Budgets for FY2025-26, calling them deeply disappointing and discriminatory towards Karachi -- the economic hub of the country.
In a joint statement, the KCCI leadership expressed serious concern over the continued neglect and repeated denial of essential development funds for both Karachi and Sindh. They particularly condemned the gross underfunding of the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway -- a strategic infrastructure project vital for regional economic connectivity. Despite the project’s total cost exceeding Rs400 billion, only Rs15 billion has been allocated in the federal budget, which they said reflects a clear disregard for Sindh’s development priorities. Karachi, as Pakistan’s commercial capital, stands to benefit significantly from the project’s completion.
Similarly, they criticised the federal government’s lack of commitment to the long-delayed K-IV Water Supply Project, a critical initiative for water-deprived Karachi. Despite repeated assurances, including from the prime minister, the centre has allocated a mere Rs3.2 billion against the required Rs150 billion. This allocation, they said, is not only inadequate but also casts doubt on the government’s sincerity in resolving Karachi’s water crisis.
The KCCI leadership also voiced disappointment with Sindh’s budget, expressing that the provincial government, too, had failed to meet Karachi’s urgent needs. Only Rs100 million has been earmarked for the K-IV project and Rs15 billion for the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway -- figures they described as symbolic and insufficient for meaningful progress. Alarmingly, this marks the third consecutive year without the announcement of any new mega development project for Karachi.
The Rs8 billion allocated for the continuation of older projects is seen as a token gesture, with most schemes moving at a sluggish pace.

Pakistan cuts interest costs to free up room for development spending: expert,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321295-pakistan-cuts-interest-costs-to-free-up-room-for-development-spending-expert,"KARACHI: Pakistan has significantly reduced the share of its revenue consumed by interest payments, offering some fiscal breathing room after years of debt-driven pressure that left little space for development spending.
According to data from Topline Securities, interest expenses as a percentage of total government revenue fell to an estimated 49 per cent in FY2025, down from a record 61 per cent just a year earlier. The government is now targeting a further reduction to 39 per cent in FY2026, signalling a potential shift towards increased allocations for health, education and infrastructure. “This is a remarkable improvement,” said Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, in a social media post on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday. “But more progress is needed so critical spending can resume and grow.”
Interest payments had surged sharply following the macroeconomic crisis of recent years, peaking in FY24 as policy tightening and mounting debt obligations squeezed fiscal space. The current decline reflects stabilising interest rates, currency adjustments and efforts to raise revenue through tax reform.
Still, with nearly half of all government income going towards servicing debt, Pakistan remains vulnerable to shocks, including global rate hikes and domestic slippages in reform momentum.
The long-term trend in the chart shared by Topline shows how interest costs have grown steadily since FY18, jumping from 29 per cent of revenue that year to 43 per cent by FY19, before spiking in FY23 (59 per cent).

SBP amends export declaration format under PSW,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321296-sbp-amends-export-declaration-format-under-psw,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has revised the export declaration format under the Pakistan Single Window (PSW) system, aimed at evolving business dynamics and system upgradations, its latest circular said.
According to the instructions of the Foreign Exchange Manual, exporters of goods are required to file an undertaking or declarations in the PSW system for receipt of payments through a bank (authorised dealer). “The undertaking/declaration for exports was earlier part of the Manual E-Form/Electronic Form-E (EFE). Considering the evolving business dynamics and system upgradations, it has been decided to amend the undertaking/declaration,” the SBP said.
“Henceforth, authorised dealers (ADs) are advised to obtain the revised declaration from the exporters through the PSW system at the time of initiating their respective export transactions.”

Second Afghan transit trade vessel berths at Gwadar Port,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321297-second-afghan-transit-trade-vessel-berths-at-gwadar-port,"KARACHI: A vessel carrying 20,000 metric tonnes of Di-Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) fertiliser has successfully berthed at Gwadar Port, marking the second shipment under the Afghan Transit Trade framework.
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Saturday welcomed the development, calling it “another milestone in enhancing regional trade connectivity”.
He said the shipment originated from Townsville, Australia, and represents the second successful docking under the revised Afghan Transit Trade framework, following the arrival of MV Beyond 2 on 4 February 2025. “This is part of our sustained efforts to operationalise the Gwadar Port as a strategic trade gateway for landlocked Afghanistan,” the minister said in a statement. “Gwadar’s growing role in transit trade reflects our commitment to enabling smooth access for Afghanistan to international markets.”He noted that the recent decision by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to replace the bank guarantee requirement with an insurance guarantee for Afghan transit cargo via Gwadar has significantly improved the ease of doing business and expedited cargo clearance.
The minister added that the arrival of MV ASL ROSE is a strong indicator of growing international confidence in Gwadar’s operational capacity and infrastructure, reinforcing Pakistan’s role in facilitating reliable regional transit trade.
Chaudhry directed port authorities to ensure prompt berthing and efficient cargo handling, reaffirming that the Gwadar Port is fully equipped to manage increasing volumes under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA). He expressed confidence that the latest development would help reduce transit costs, improve trade efficiency and strengthen economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He added that it also positions the Gwadar Port as a key hub for wider regional economic integration.

Expert highlights shifting priorities in digital connectivity landscape,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321298-expert-highlights-shifting-priorities-in-digital-connectivity-landscape,"KARACHI: With over 60 per cent of Pakistan’s population under 30, the country’s digital future depends not only on expanding access but also on ensuring that platforms reflect the needs and behaviours of a young, connected population, says expert.
While infrastructure remains critical, some industry actors are beginning to focus more on how people experience digital services -- whether through entertainment, self-care tools, or social platforms.
One example is Jazz, which has expanded its suite of digital products through a dedicated business unit, offering services such as Tamasha (a streaming app), SIMOSA (a self-care platform), and Social+, among others.
According to the company, Tamasha has grown to over 16.5 million monthly active users, while SIMOSA reportedly serves 21 million users. The company’s digital team says the focus now is on evolving these platforms to support not just content consumption, but also user engagement and participation -- especially among younger audiences.
Aamer Ejaz, who leads the digital platforms division at Jazz, says platforms today are expected to offer more than utility. “Users are increasingly looking for platforms where they feel seen and heard,” he says, noting that connectivity is no longer just a technical service but a social and cultural one as well.
Ejaz points to a broader shift in platform design, from passive delivery to more personalised, locally relevant experiences. He also highlights the importance of local data hosting in ensuring accountability and aligning with national privacy expectations. While digital expansion is often framed in terms of numbers, Ejaz argues that long-term relevance depends on understanding how users relate to digital tools. “There’s a growing need to move beyond utility and think about digital spaces as part of people’s everyday lives,” he says.
In a recent market shift, mobile viewership in Pakistan has reached levels comparable to television, according to a March 2024 report by Pulse Consultant. The company sees this as a sign that advertising strategies may need to adapt accordingly, especially with younger audiences shifting their media consumption habits.
Ejaz also notes the importance of wider ecosystem development if digital platforms are to have long-term impact. “Usage alone does not indicate value. The real opportunity lies in enabling users to create, transact and contribute.”

SBP launches PRISM plus,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321299-sbp-launches-prism-plus,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) announced the launch of the Pakistan Real-Time Interbank Settlement Mechanism Plus (PRISM+) on Wednesday, aimed at enhancing transparency, interoperability and automation across the payment and settlement ecosystem.
“As envisaged in its Vision 2028, the SBP is launching the Real-Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) and Central Securities Depository (CSD) system, PRISM+, effective June 16, 2025. The completion of this strategic project substantially upgrades the National Digital Payments Infrastructure,” the SBP said in a circular.
“PRISM+ is built on the ISO 20022 financial messaging standard, which supports structured and data-rich financial communication, enabling enhanced transparency, interoperability and automation across the payment and settlement ecosystem,” it said.
“It includes new features for liquidity management, transaction queuing and prioritisation, and scheduling of future-dated payments,” it added.
According to the SBP, the system offers customizable dashboards, alerts, query tools and downloadable settlement position statements using a web-based module for real-time initiation, monitoring, and approval of transactions.
The new system also provides a central securities depository (CSD) platform for money market operations such as auction of government securities, sale and purchase of securities in the secondary market, collateral management and open market operations.
The SBP said that for settlement purposes, transitory accounts have been opened in the new system. At the start of each business day, the system will transfer 80 per cent of balances from the participants’ current account held with SBP BSC (Karachi) to their respective transitory accounts.
To facilitate participants in managing their day-to-day liquidity, they will be able to transfer funds between their current and transitory accounts at any time during business hours. Participants can also allocate funds for ancillary clearing needs (eg, Raast, NIFT, and 1Link). Accordingly, to mitigate systemic risks, participants are advised to maintain sufficient funds for their settlement needs on a proactive basis.
“Participants are also advised to ensure operational readiness for performing their Straight-Through Processing (STP) via PRISM+ through either the APIs or the file adapters facility offered by the system,” the circular said.
“All participants are advised to use Raast over-the-counter (OTC) facility for branch initiated customer transactions that are presently being transferred using RTGS. Accordingly, all participants shall replace the RTGS OTC facility with Raast OTC in all their branches by September 30, 2025,” it added.
The SBP advised banks to review and align their operational processes and frameworks to ensure seamless and efficient integration and adoption of the new system.

"Trump reports more than $600m in income from crypto, golf, licensing fees",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321300-trump-reports-more-than-600m-in-income-from-crypto-golf-licensing-fees,"Donald Trump reported more than $600 million in income from crypto, golf clubs, licensing and other ventures in a public financial disclosure report released on Friday that provided a glimpse of the vast business holdings of America’s billionaire president.
The annual financial disclosure form, which appeared to cover the 2024 calendar year, shows the president’s push into crypto added substantially to his wealth but he also reported large fees from developments and revenues from his other businesses. Overall, the president reported assets worth at least $1.6 billion, a Reuters calculation shows.
While Trump has said he has put his businesses into a trust managed by his children, the disclosures show how income from those sources still ultimately accrue to the president -- something that has opened him to accusations of conflicts of interest.
Some of his businesses in areas such as crypto, for example, benefit from US policy shifts under him and have become a source of criticism.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The financial disclosure was signed on June 13 and did not state the time period it covered. The details of the cryptocurrency listings, as well as other information in the disclosure, suggest it was through the end of December 2024, which would exclude most of the money raised by the family’s cryptocurrency ventures.
Given the speed at which the Trump family has made deals during his ascent to the presidency, the filing is already a time capsule of sorts, capturing a period when the family was just starting to get into crypto but was largely still in the world of real estate deals and golf clubs.
A meme coin released earlier this year by the president -- $TRUMP -- alone has earned an estimated $320 million in fees, although it’s not publicly known how that amount has been divided between a Trump-controlled entity and its partners.
In addition to the meme coin fees, the Trump family has raked in more than $400 million from World Liberty Financial, a decentralised finance company. The Trump family is involved, also, with a bitcoin mining operation and digital asset exchange-traded funds.
In the disclosures, Trump reported $57.35 million from token sales at World Liberty. He also reported holding 15.75 billion governance tokens in the venture.

TRUMP MEDIA
The wealth of the Republican businessman-turned-politician ranges from crypto to real estate, and a large part on paper is tied up in his stake in Trump Media & Technology Group, owner of social media platform Truth Social.
Besides assets and revenues from his business ventures, the president reported at least $12 million in income, including through interest and dividends, from passive investments totalling at least $211 million, a Reuters calculation shows.
His biggest investments were in alternative fund manager Blue Owl Capital Corp and in government bond funds managed by Charles Schwab and Invesco.
The disclosure often only gave ranges for the value of his assets and income; Reuters used the lower amount listed, meaning the total value of his assets and income was almost certainly higher.
The disclosure showed income from various assets including Trump’s properties in Florida. Trump’s three golf-focused resorts in the state -- Jupiter, Doral and West Palm Beach -- plus his nearby private members’ club at Mar-a-Lago generated at least $217.7 million in income, according to the filing.
Trump National Doral, the expansive Miami-area golf hub known for its Blue Monster course, was the family's single largest income source at $110.4 million. The income figures provided are essentially revenues, not net profits after subtracting costs.
The disclosure underlined the global nature of the Trump family business, listing income of $5 million in license fees from a development in Vietnam, $10 million in development fees from a project in India and almost $16 million in licensing fees for a Dubai project.
Trump collected royalty money, also, from a variety of deals -- $1.3 million from the Greenwood Bible (its website describes it as “the only Bible officially endorsed by Lee Greenwood and President Trump”); $2.8 million from Trump Watches, and $2.5 million from Trump Sneakers and Fragrances.
Trump listed $1.16 million in income from his NFTs -- digital trading cards in his likeness -- while First Lady Melania Trump earned around $216,700 from licence fees on her own NFT collection.

AI’s arrival at work reshaping employers’ hunt for talent,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321301-ai-s-arrival-at-work-reshaping-employers-hunt-for-talent,"PARIS: Predictions of imminent AI-driven mass unemployment are likely overblown, but employers will seek workers with different skills as the technology matures, a top executive at global recruiter ManpowerGroup told AFP at Paris’s Vivatech trade fair.
The world’s third-largest staffing firm by revenue ran a startup contest at Vivatech in which one of the contenders was building systems to hire out customisable autonomous AI ‘agents’, rather than humans.
Their service was reminiscent of a warning last month from Dario Amodei, head of American AI giant Anthropic, that the technology could wipe out half of entry-level white-collar jobs within one to five years.
For ManpowerGroup, AI agents are “certainly not going to become our core business any time soon,” the company’s Chief Innovation Officer Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic said.
“If history shows us one thing, it’s most of these forecasts are wrong.”
An International Labour Organisation (ILO) report published in May found that around “one in four workers across the world are in an occupation with some degree of exposure” to generative AI models’ capabilities. “Few jobs are currently at high risk of full automation,” the ILO added. But the UN body also highlighted “rapid expansion of AI capabilities since our previous study” in 2023, including the emergence of “agentic” models more able to act autonomously or semi-autonomously and use software like web browsers and email.

‘Soft skills’
Chamorro-Premuzic predicted that the introduction of efficiency-enhancing AI tools would put pressure on workers, managers and firms to make the most of the time they will save. “If what happens is that AI helps knowledge workers save 30, 40, maybe 50 per cent of their time, but that time is then wasted on social media, that´s not an increase in net output,” he said.
Adoption of AI could give workers “more time to do creative work” -- or impose “greater standardisation of their roles and reduced autonomy,” the ILO said. There’s general agreement that interpersonal skills and an entrepreneurial attitude will become more important for knowledge workers as their daily tasks shift towards corralling AIs.
Employers identified ethical judgement, customer service, team management and strategic thinking as top skills AI could not replace in a ManpowerGroup survey of over 40,000 employers across 42 countries published this week.
Nevertheless, training that adopts those new priorities has not increased in step with AI adoption, Chamorro-Premuzic lamented. “For every dollar you invest in technology, you need to invest eight or nine on HR, culture transformation, change management,” he said. He argued that such gaps suggest companies are still chasing automation, rather than the often-stated aim of augmenting human workers’ capabilities with AI.

AI hiring AI?
One of the areas where AI is transforming the world of work most rapidly is ManpowerGroup’s core business of recruitment. But here candidates are adopting the tools just as quickly as recruiters and companies, disrupting the old way of doing things from the bottom up.
“Candidates are able to send 500 perfect applications in one day, they are able to send their bots to interview, they are even able to game elements of the assessments,” Chamorro-Premuzic said.  That extreme picture was not borne out in a survey of over 1,000 job seekers released this week by recruitment platform TestGorilla, which found just 17 per cent of applicants admitting to cheating on tests, and only some of those to using AI.
Jobseekers’ use of consumer AI tools meets recruiters doing the same. The same TestGorilla survey found almost two-thirds of the more-than-1,000 hiring decision-makers polled used AI to generate job descriptions and screen applications.
But a far smaller share are already using the technology to actually interview candidates.
Where employers today are focused on candidates’ skills over credentials, Chamorro-Premuzic predicted that “the next evolution is to focus on potential, not even skills even if I know the skills you bring to the table today, they might be obsolete in six months”.
“I’m better off knowing that you’re hard-working, that you are curious, that you have good people skills, -- and that, AI can help you evaluate,” he believes.

BankIslami wins Best Campaign Award,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321303-bankislami-wins-best-campaign-award,"KARACHI: BankIslami Pakistan Ltd won the Jury Award for Best Campaign at the 2025 Pakistan Digital Awards, recognising its national initiative ‘Saving Humanity from Riba’ aimed at raising awareness of interest-free Islamic banking.
The campaign, which combined digital and traditional media, was noted for its bold messaging and strategic clarity in promoting ethical, Sharia-compliant finance. BankIslami said the campaign was part of its broader push to make Islamic banking more inclusive and accessible across Pakistan.
“What may appear as just another marketing campaign to others was the beginning of a movement for BankIslami,” said Head of Marketing and Strategy Hasan Saeed Akbar. “Our ambition was to promote ethical finance across Pakistan and move closer to a system free from the injustice of riba.”
The award follows recent international recognition for BankIslami, which was named Pakistan’s Best Islamic Bank by Euromoney. The bank continues to expand its outreach through technology-led initiatives, new Sharia-compliant products, and grassroots partnerships aimed at boosting financial literacy.

"Mentorship, not lone geniuses, fuels entrepreneurial success, say experts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321304-mentorship-not-lone-geniuses-fuels-entrepreneurial-success-say-experts,"LAHORE: Entrepreneurship flourishes not in isolation but within tightly knit networks, where successful founders support aspiring risk-takers with capital, mentorship and honest feedback, say experts.
While individual successes are often celebrated as strokes of genius, economists increasingly agree that entrepreneurship is seldom a solo endeavour. The romanticised image of the lone maverick entrepreneur, they argue, is largely a myth.
“Entrepreneurship drives innovation, economic growth and job creation,” says Syed Nabeel Hashmi, a pioneer in Pakistan’s auto sector. “But it cannot be nurtured through government schemes alone. Real momentum comes from peer-driven guidance -- when established entrepreneurs actively mentor and sponsor newcomers.”
Hashmi highlights that governments across the globe have struggled to replicate Silicon Valley, despite significant investment. “Malaysia spent $150 million trying to build a BioValley, but only a handful of biotech firms emerged. Moscow invested $2 billion in IT incubators with little to show for it. In Pakistan, we are investing peanuts in incubators in Lahore and Karachi -- unsurprisingly, we have not seen any breakthrough startups,” he notes.
He laments that few successful Pakistani startups give back. “There’s no real ecosystem here. Graduated startups rarely mentor the next generation. We need an organisation to connect emerging entrepreneurs with mentors and investors. The journey to success is riddled with pitfalls -- experienced founders can help others avoid them.”
Textile entrepreneur MI Khurram emphasises that entrepreneurial networks do not begin with infrastructure or government incentives, nor do they emerge spontaneously. “A few pioneering founders must be supported in their early stages. Then, they must actively spread the entrepreneurial spirit by mentoring, inspiring, and investing in others.”
Khurram adds that while mentorship is crucial, long-term success hinges on competence and innovation. “When successful entrepreneurs collaborate across companies and industries, it benefits the ecosystem. Global research confirms that just a few high-impact entrepreneurs can spark a multiplier effect.”  He notes that successful founders bring together three essential forms of capital -- financial, human and social -- which can then be reinvested in new entrepreneurs. “That’s how entrepreneurial culture is sustained: each generation inspires the next.”
Mohsid Syed, an aviation entrepreneur, concurs that entrepreneurship does not spread by chance; it must be actively cultivated. “Even the best ideas fail without proper guidance. Seasoned entrepreneurs help new entrants identify weaknesses in their strategies, business models, team structures and marketing plans.”
Syed warns that early success is only the beginning. “Scaling up is the most treacherous phase. Young founders need mentorship to navigate that journey. Research shows that in thriving ecosystems, successful entrepreneurs don’t vanish after an IPO or exit. They stay involved and help guide the next wave.”  He adds that in cultures where mentorship is embedded, young entrepreneurs see it as their duty to offer support. “Sadly, that culture of collaboration is lacking in Pakistan -- which is why we’ve produced so few true entrepreneurs.”
Drawing a contrast with India, he says: “The first Pakistani tech firm to list on Nasdaq left no legacy. Meanwhile, India’s Infosys not only made waves in Silicon Valley but also inspired an entire generation of tech entrepreneurs back home.”

"LCCI condemns Israeli strike on Iran, urges global action to avert regional escalation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321305-lcci-condemns-israeli-strike-on-iran-urges-global-action-to-avert-regional-escalation,"KARACHI: The Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry (LCCI) has strongly condemned Israel’s recent military strike on Iran, calling it a “grave violation of international law” and warning of dire regional and economic consequences if tensions continue to escalate.
In a joint statement, LCCI President Mian Abuzar Shad, Senior Vice President Engineer Khalid Usman, and Vice President Shahid Nazir Chaudhry described the attack as a dangerous provocation that risks plunging the Middle East into deeper conflict.
“The unprovoked assault is not just a breach of the UN Charter -- it is a threat to global peace and a destabilising act that must be addressed urgently by the international community,” the officials said.
The LCCI leaders warned that prolonged instability in the region could disrupt global trade routes, roil energy markets and shake investor confidence worldwide. “This is no longer just a political issue; it is an economic and humanitarian crisis in the making,” the statement read.
“Silence in the face of such aggression is not an option. The international community must uphold international law and protect the lives and rights of all nations equally,” the LCCI officials said.

"After conquering Europe, PSG now have sights set on Club World Cup glory",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321324-after-conquering-europe-psg-now-have-sights-set-on-club-world-cup-glory,"Los Angeles, United States: Freshly crowned kings of Europe, Paris Saint-Germain arrived this week in the United States for the Club World Cup and are treating FIFA´s lucrative new competition not as a nuisance at the end of an exhausting season but as a serious objective.
“I think it is an incredible competition,” PSG coach Luis Enrique said of the Club World Cup in the immediate aftermath of his team´s UEFA Champions League triumph in Munich two weeks ago.
“Our aim is to be competitive and try to win a fifth trophy of the season.”
The Qatar-backed French giants could be forgiven for wanting some time to bask in the glory of their 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich which allowed them to finally win the Champions League for the first time in their history.
There had been numerous agonising failures in Europe´s elite club competition, as well as billions of euros spent on transfer fees on stars like Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, prior to captain Marquinhos raising the trophy aloft.
“We have made history for the club, for the city and for the whole country,” defender Lucas Hernandez told sports daily L´Equipe after the PSG squad paraded their trophy down the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris, attended a reception with President Emmanuel Macron and celebrated with almost 50,000 fans at their Parc des Princes stadium.
PSG have played 58 matches since last August and also swept all the available domestic trophies in France this season, as has become the norm in recent years.
But there is simply no time to stop and reflect.
Many of their players, including Champions League final hero Desire Doue, spent last week on international duty before returning to their club and departing for Los Angeles, where they will begin their Club World Cup adventure this weekend.
“The tournament itself is a really attractive prospect,” Luis Enrique told FIFA.com.
“We have to strike the balance between managing the physical and mental fatigue we´re experiencing now at the end of a long season and harnessing the motivation that comes with being involved in the competition.”
PSG´s opening game will be against another European heavyweight as they take on Antoine Griezmann´s Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, just outside Los Angeles, on Sunday.
They will then also face South American champions Botafogo, of Brazil, before moving north to take on Seattle Sounders in their remaining Group B matches.
Expected to qualify for the knockout phase without too many issues, PSG could end up playing a total of seven matches if they make it all the way to the final in New York on July 13 -- just a month before their scheduled first game of next season in the UEFA Supercup against Tottenham Hotspur.
The strain of such a long campaign is telling, with Ousmane Dembele -- their top scorer this season with 33 goals -- struggling with an injury picked up playing for France last week.

Pakistan brace for tough challenge as Nations Cup Hockey starts today,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321325-pakistan-brace-for-tough-challenge-as-nations-cup-hockey-starts-today,"ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: The Pakistan national hockey team braces for a formidable test as they kick off their Nations Cup campaign this Sunday against hosts Malaysia in the vibrant city of Kuala Lumpur.
Entering the tournament alongside several top-tier international sides, the Men in Green find themselves in a demanding position, needing both resilience and tactical precision to make their mark.
Head coach Tahir Zaman, a seasoned strategist and former great of the game, acknowledged the uphill battle awaiting his side.
“This is going to be a rigorous challenge,” he said. “We’re up against highly ranked, battle-hardened teams that have been consistently active on the international circuit. Malaysia, in particular, have been in fine form, having toured Australia and Korea recently.
Unfortunately, we haven’t had that level of international exposure in the lead-up to the event.”
Despite the lack of pre-tournament match practice, Pakistan managed to squeeze in a solitary warm-up encounter against Korea, which ended in a narrow 2-1 defeat. But Zaman played down the result.
“It was a short-format match — just ten minutes per quarter — and very much an experimental run. We deliberately held back on revealing our full strategy, especially with the Malaysian contingent observing from the sidelines.”
The build-up was further disrupted by the cancellation of two scheduled warm-up matches due to the delayed arrival of France and South Africa. Nevertheless, Zaman sees a silver lining.
“One major advantage for us is that we arrived early in Malaysia,” he emphasized. “That has allowed our players to acclimatize to the intense heat and humidity — conditions that can prove decisive. The boys are now fully settled and physically conditioned to take on the challenge.”
Facing Malaysia on home soil, especially in a tournament opener, is never a straightforward task. “They’ll have the home crowd behind them, and they’re used to playing in these conditions,” Zaman admitted. “But our squad is fit, focused, and ready to rise to the occasion. I have faith in their ability to deliver under pressure.”
With a game plan meticulously crafted, Zaman expressed optimism about his team’s opening performance. “If we execute our strategy with discipline and precision, I’m confident we can make a strong statement from the outset.”
The FIH Nations Cup is widely regarded as a proving ground for elite teams not part of the FIH Pro League, and competition is expected to be fierce.
“Make no mistake,” Zaman noted, “this tournament features some of the finest sides outside the Pro League. While I won’t make bold predictions, I can assure fans that Pakistan will fight for every inch of turf. We’ll compete with pride and intensity — and we’re here to challenge, not just participate.”
The tournament’s opening day will feature a full slate of high-voltage matchups. Alongside the Pakistan-Malaysia clash, New Zealand will square off against Japan, while in Group A, France will lock horns with Korea, and Wales will meet South Africa.
As Pakistan steps onto the pitch under Kuala Lumpur’s blazing lights, all eyes will be on a team seeking to reignite its historic legacy on the global stage.
One thing is certain-they’re there with intent, and they’re ready to battle.

Cummins says WTC final ‘a bridge too far’ for beaten Australia,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321326-cummins-says-wtc-final-a-bridge-too-far-for-beaten-australia,"LONDON: Australia captain Pat Cummins said his side had been faced with a “bridge too far” after losing the World Test Championship final to South Africa at Lord´s on Saturday.
Cummins´ men, the reigning title-holders, were strongly fancied to defeat a South Africa side with few star names.
But they suffered a five-wicket defeat as South Africa, with opener Aiden Markram making a superb 136 and skipper Temba Bavuma 66, chased down a target of 282 before lunch on the fourth day.
Australia led by 74 runs on first innings but could never completely pull clear of the Proteas, with South Africa fast bowler Kagiso Rabada returning fine match figures of 9-110. “Things can change pretty quickly,” said Cummins at the post-match presentation ceremony. “Unfortunately, it was a bridge too far.”
Steve Smith´s first-innings 66 was the only score of fifty or more in the match by a specialist Australia batsman.
Smith, however, suffered a dislocated finger while dropping a slip catch and is now doubtful for the first Test against the West Indies in Barbados on June 25.
Australia, now at the start of a new WTC cycle, may have to review their batting options more broadly, with Marnus Labuschagne who averaged a lowly 25.63 in Tests during the 2024/25 season, out for 17 and 22 at Lord´s after being promoted to open the innings.
“We´ve got a couple of weeks before the first Test in the Windies, so we´ll sit down and have a bit of a think,” said Cummins. “To make these finals, it´s normally off the back of being really strong at home, but you´ve got to win some away series too,” he later told reporters at a post-match press conference.
“So, in some ways, it´s good we get to dust ourselves off and turn around in a couple of weeks and start looking ahead to the next one.
“That´s one of the good things about the World Test Championship, every Test series and every Test match feels like you´re playing for something significant.”

Markram leads SA to ‘special’ World Test Championship victory,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321327-markram-leads-sa-to-special-world-test-championship-victory,"LONDON: Aiden Markram´s magnificent century was the cornerstone of South Africa´s five-wicket victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord´s on Saturday as the Proteas ended decades of cricket heartbreak by at last winning a major global title.
South Africa, set 282 to win, finished on 282-5 before lunch on the fourth day, with opening batsman Markram falling for 136 after taking South Africa to within six runs of the title.
“It´s special in a lot of ways,” said Proteas captain Temba Bavuma in front of what was effectively a ´home´ crowd given the large number of South Africa fans who had packed into Lord´s.
“Also, it´s a chance for South Africa to be united,” said Bavuma, who has now joined Springboks Rugby World Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi in becoming a black African skipper of a South Africa side that has won a major global title.
The Proteas resumed on 213-2, needing just 69 more runs for victory.
Markram, dismissed for a duck in the first innings, was 102 not out and Bavuma unbeaten on 65 despite spending most of his innings limping with a hamstring injury.
But South Africa have such a long history of folding under pressure they could not take anything for granted against serial winners and defending WTC title-holders Australia. In 18 previous attempts in the one-day international and T20 World Cups, South Africa had only reached a solitary final.
That was in last year´s T20 World Cup in Barbados, when they lost to India despite needing just 30 runs from their last 30 balls, with six wickets standing.
But South Africa, so often labelled “chokers” for their failure to close out knockout games, held their nerve on Saturday as a largely unheralded side succeeded where star players such as Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock, AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis had failed.
South Africa´s path to the final was criticised, with the Proteas playing just 12 Tests in the WTC cycle and none against England or Australia.
But with Australia strong favourites to retain their title, South Africa posted an eighth successive Test win in impressive style.
“I hope our performance gives credit as to why we were in the final,” said Bavuma.
“Whilst we were batting, we could hear the Aussies using that dreaded word ´choke´. We´ve been etched in history, we´re part of something that has never been done.”
The celebrations spread across the Lord´s turf as each of the players took their turn with the silver and gold mace.
“It is emotional, it´s been a very long time coming,” said Markram, who was named player of the match. “We´ve got close in the past couple of years and not got over the line. The first one is always going to be the toughest.”
Australia led by 74 runs on first innings but never got completely away from South Africa, with Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada returning superb match figures of 9-110.
“Unfortunately, it was a bridge too far,” said Australia captain Pat Cummins, who led Australia to the 2023 WTC title after New Zealand won the inaugural 2021 final.
“They (South Africa) were fantastic in that fourth innings. There wasn´t a lot in the wicket but they didn´t give us a chance.”
South Africa suffered a setback early on Saturday when Bavuma, who had added just one run to his overnight score, was caught behind off Cummins to end a stand of 147 with Markram.
But Markram got the target down to 50 by pulling Cummins for four before left-arm quick Mitchell Starc (3-66) bowled Tristan Stubbs.
Australia took the new ball with South Africa needing just 14 more runs to win and Markram subsequently drove Josh Hazlewood for four and three to settle any nerves.
He couldn´t quite finish the job, though. His pull off Hazlewood was brilliantly caught by Travis Head at midwicket to end a 207-ball innings featuring 14 fours.
As Markram received a standing ovation on his way back to the pavilion, several Australia players shook his hand.
It was left to Kyle Verreynne to hit the winning run as South Africa completed the second-highest chase to win a Test at Lord´s, behind the West Indies´ 344-1 against England in 1984.

Russell fastest for Mercedes ahead of Norris in second practice,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321328-russell-fastest-for-mercedes-ahead-of-norris-in-second-practice,"Montreal: George Russell powered his Mercedes to the top of the times ahead of McLaren´s Lando Norris in Friday´s second practice for this weekend´s Canadian Grand Prix.
As four-time champion Max Verstappen struggled to reprise his pace-setting form for Red Bull in the opening practice session, Russell clocked a best lap in one minute and 12.123 seconds to beat Norris by 0.028 seconds.
Russell´s Mercedes team-mate teenage rookie Kimi Antonelli was third ahead of Williams´ Alex Albon, two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and championship leader Oscar Piastri in the second McLaren.
It was clear that McLaren were taking a measured approach to the weekend as they tested updated front wing and suspension.
Carlos Sainz was seventh for Williams ahead of seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the sole Ferrari, after team-mate Charles Leclerc had crashed and damaged his car in first practice.
Verstappen was ninth ahead of the two Red Bulls of Liam Lawson and Isack Hadjar.
For Russell, who started on pole last year, it was an encouraging session on a bright and clear day at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, where Ferrari are revered. It was the first time Russell had been fastest in a practice this year.
“It´s nice,” Russell said after the session. “It might be my first time topping a leaderboard this year, 10 races in. So obviously, it´s been a very positive day.”
The action began with a range of tyres chosen for use after the earlier session in which Leclerc had crashed and badly damaged the survival cell in his Ferrari. That required prolonged work to replace it and he was ruled out of FP2.
All this heaped more pressure on Ferrari and Hamilton as media speculation swirled and team boss Fred Vasseur hit back at “stupid” stories that threatened to undermine their season.
Russell set an early quickest lap before Stroll, the local hero, hit the wall at Turn Seven and damaged his Aston Martin´s front wheels. His race engineer Gary Gannon asked him to stop and park, his session over.
In improving conditions, Norris on mediums found his groove to go top before Albon and then Russell took control, the Mercedes man eight-tenths faster than his pole lap last year. Verstappen expressed his frustration at his Red Bull´s handling.
“The car´s jumping crazy at the rear,” he said, a complaint similar to one from Hamilton who reported “the rear keeps kicking out” asking his engineer for help.
Back on one of his favourite circuits, where he shares a record of seven wins with Michael Schumacher, Hamilton was showing pace to rise to second behind the ever-improving Russell, on mediums.
Both McLarens soon climbed into the top 10 after taking a methodical approach to the use of their new upgrades, Norris rising to second, but Mercedes with Russell on top and Antonelli third, appeared to be strongest with 15 minutes remaining.
As the teams began race-trim runs, there were 17 drivers separated by one second, ahead of Franco Colapinto´s Alpine - clear evidence that a closely-fought contest is in prospect for Saturday´s critical qualifying.

Rain washes out West Indies’ T20 clash in Ireland,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321329-rain-washes-out-west-indies-t20-clash-in-ireland,"LONDON: The West Indies´ second T20 international against Ireland was washed out by heavy rain in Bready on Saturday.
After the opening game of the three-match series was abandoned without a ball being bowled on Thursday, the West Indies were again frustrated by the weather.
The scheduled start was delayed and when the umpires eventually inspected the pitch they decided there was no prospect of starting the match. A statement on Cricket Ireland´s X account said: “The match unfortunately has been abandoned due to consistent wet conditions.” The final game of the series is due to take place at Bready on Sunday.
West Indies have already played a one-day international series in Ireland this year, drawing 1-1 in the three-match tussle in May. They are looking to bounce back after recent 3-0 series losses to England in both the one-day international and T20 formats.

Pakistan squad for AFC Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers named,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321331-pakistan-squad-for-afc-women-s-asian-cup-qualifiers-named,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) has officially announced a 21-member squad for the upcoming AFC Women’s Asian Cup 2026 Qualifiers, slated to run from June 29 to July 5 in Jakarta, Indonesia.
Drawn into Group E alongside Chinese Taipei, the host nation Indonesia, and Kyrgyzstan, the national women’s team will be aiming to create history by qualifying for the continental showpiece for the first time ever. The squad will be captained by Maria Khan, a veteran defender and key figure in Pakistan’s recent resurgence.
Squad: Goalkeepers: Jennah Farooki, Nisha Ashraf, Zeeyana Jivraj; Defenders: Aliya Sadiq, Layla Banaras, Maria Khan (C), Nizalia Siddiqui, Sophia Qureshi; Midfielders: Amina Hanif, Azwa Chaudhry, Marsha Malik, Rameen Fareed, Sanah Mehdi, Suha Hirani; Forwards: Anmol Hira, Aqsa Mushtaq, Isra Khan, Mariam Mahmood, Nadia Khan, Zehmena Malik, Zulfia Nazir.
Adeel Rizki will be the head coach. The roster combines overseas-based professionals with rising local talent, a strategic blend as the team faces stiff group-stage challenges—particularly against Chinese Taipei, currently ranked in the top 40 globally by FIFA.
Pakistan will begin its campaign on June 29 against Chinese Taipei, followed by matches on July 2 against Indonesia and July 5 against Kyrgyzstan. To prepare, the team will undergo an intensive training camp at Jinnah Stadium, Islamabad, from June 19 to 26.
Meanwhile head coach Rizk said: “The qualifiers are a pivotal step in our rebuilding process. We’re confident that this group can represent Pakistan with pride and push boundaries on the continental stage.” This marks a significant moment in Pakistan’s women’s football journey, following years of administrative setbacks that saw the team inactive on the international circuit. Federation officials view this campaign as a chance to showcase the country’s progress and potential.

Maria stuns Keys to reach Queen’s final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321332-maria-stuns-keys-to-reach-queen-s-final,"LONDON: German qualifier Tatjana Maria reached the Queen´s Club final with a stunning 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) win over Australian Open champion Madison Keys on Saturday.
Mother of two Maria has enjoyed a memorable run in the first women´s tournament at Queen´s for 52 years.
The 37-year-old reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022, but was forced to qualify for Queen´s after dropping to 86th in the WTA rankings.
Maria said she was “still living this dream” after shocking former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) in the quarter-finals on Friday.
The German can complete her fairytale week against Chinese top seed Zheng Qinwen Zheng or American world number 15 Amanda Anisimova in Sunday´s final.
Maria has never been past the second round of any Grand Slam except Wimbledon, but once again she is proving a formidable force on the grass courts.
Keys´ exit was a blow to her preparations for Wimbledon, which gets underway across London at the All England Club on June 30. Key has failed to get beyond the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in her 10 visits.

Five things to look out for as Club World Cup kicks off,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321333-five-things-to-look-out-for-as-club-world-cup-kicks-off,"Atlanta: Despite concerns over ticket sales and player fatigue, FIFA´s new expanded Club World Cup will throw up several intriguing storylines this summer in the United States.
AFP Sport picks five things to look out for on the pitch as teams compete to conquer the world and claim their share of $1 billion in prize money.
Messi back in the spotlight
Former Barcelona great Lionel Messi has spent the last two seasons at MLS side Inter Miami but the Club World Cup pits him against European opposition once again.
The 37-year-old superstar still possesses supreme quality but there are question marks over whether he and former top level stars Luis Suarez, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets can seriously compete against the cream of the crop.
Inter Miami face Porto in their second group match in Atlanta, a team Messi has faced once before, beating them with Barca in the UEFA Super Cup back in 2011.
Messi also featured against Porto in a friendly with Barca back in 2003, which was his first ever appearance for the club at 16 years old.
If he nets at the tournament, Messi would become the oldest ever Club World Cup goalscorer, while both he and Suarez trail the competition´s all-time top scorer, Cristiano Ronaldo, by two goals.
A new stage for Doue
Paris Saint-Germain´s Champions League final romp over Inter Milan was inspired by thrilling forward Desire Doue, who turned 20 earlier in June.
His spectacular burst into the limelight over the past few months means he is one of the players to watch this summer at the Club World Cup.
He struck twice in the final against Inter as well as setting up another goal and drew comparisons to Spanish starlet Lamine Yamal, who will not be playing this summer as Barcelona did not qualify.
PSG´s opening clash against Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles immediately gives Doue another stage to shine on as the world at large continues to discover his immense talent.
Pep Guardiola´s Manchester City endured a poor season by their lofty standards and immediately took action in the special transfer window to bolster their squad for the Club World Cup.
The Abu Dhabi-owned club have already splashed more than Â£100 million ($136 million) on Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Rayan Cherki.
With holding midfielder Rodri also returning to fitness after injury, City are hoping they can step up their game significantly.
French 21-year-old attacking midfielder Cherki is an exciting talent looking to show his quality at the top level.
“I really believe he can become a world-class player with our support and direction,” said City´s director of football Hugo Viana.
South American threat
While Europe´s elite are at the end of a long, hard season, South American clubs are midway through their campaigns and will be energised.
They have long revered the competition to a far greater degree than European sides, as it represents the chance to face the very best teams in the world.
Fans who do not regularly follow South American football can look forward to discovering some of the most exciting emerging talents in the world.
River Plate´s Argentine playmaker Franco Mastantuono will join Real Madrid after the tournament, while Chelsea-bound striker Estevao Willian is hoping to end his time at Brazilian side Palmeiras with a bang.
Atletico hunger
Atletico Madrid ended the season trophyless despite looking like potential contenders in Spain and Europe.
Diego Simeone´s side are proud of having reached the tournament ahead of La Liga rivals Barcelona and the coach has not hidden his desire to succeed this summer.
“I hope we can advance in the Club World Cup and lead Atletico Madrid to a privileged position,” said Simeone.
Atletico have not won a single trophy since lifting La Liga in 2021 and their last success outside of Spanish football came in 2018 with Europa League and UEFA Super Cup wins.
Their elimination by Real Madrid in the Champions League after Julian Alvarez´s controversial ´double-touch´ penalty was disallowed sent them into a spiral, which they only managed to shake off in the final weeks of the season, after their chances of success had vanished.

Rybakina dumped out of Queen’s by qualifier Maria,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321334-rybakina-dumped-out-of-queen-s-by-qualifier-maria,"LONDON: Former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina was dumped out of the Queen´s Club Championships on Friday by qualifier Tatjana Maria, who will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the semi-finals.
Chinese top seed Zheng Qinwen saw off the challenge of Britain´s Emma Raducanu in straight sets and will meet US eighth seed Amanda Anisimova in the last four on Saturday.
German mother of two Maria shocked Kazah fourth seed Rybakina, keeping her composure after failing to serve out the match to complete a 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) win.
A single break in the first set put the 37-year-old Maria in charge and she broke twice to lead 5-3 in the second.
But Rybakina, Wimbledon champion in 2022, upped her game to level at 5-5 and the set went to a tie-break.
The players were locked at 4-4 before Rybakina double-faulted and Maria, ranked 86th in the world, sealed victory with an ace in one hour and 45 minutes.
The German, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022, was forced to qualify for the grasscourt tournament in London.
“It means so much to me,” she said. “It´s like a perfect example to never give up and to always keep going, doesn´t matter what.
“I´m still here and living this dream. I have my family with me and amazing team.”
She added: “I´m super, super proud to be here in the semi-final and I hope in a few years you will see my daughter (aged 11) at the same stage here.”
In the first quarter-final on Friday, US second seed Keys came from a set down to beat Russian fifth seed Diana Shnaider 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Olympic champion Zheng joined Keys and Maria in the last four, breaking 2021 US Open champion Raducanu twice in the opening set and snuffing out a mini comeback in the second.
World number 37 Raducanu took a 3-0 lead in the second set with two breaks of serve but suffered three breaks of her own to bow out.
Anisimova beat compatriot and third seed Emma Navarro 6-3, 6-3 in the final match on Andy Murray Arena.

Burns fires 65 to grab US Open lead as big names stumble,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321335-burns-fires-65-to-grab-us-open-lead-as-big-names-stumble,"Oakmont, United States: Sam Burns matched the third-best US Open round ever fired at Oakmont, shooting a five-under par 65 to seize a one-stroke lead after Friday´s second round as big names struggled.
The 28-year-old American made six birdies against a lone bogey to stand on three-under 137 after 36 holes on the punishing layout.
“It felt like I played really well. Today was really nice,” Burns said. “There´s obviously a lot of golf left on a very tough course.”
The only two US Open rounds at Oakmont lower than Burns´s 65 were Johnny Miller´s final-round 63 to win in 1973 and a 64 by Loren Roberts in the 1994 third round.
American J.J. Spaun made bogeys on three of the last four holes to shoot 72 and stand second on 138 with Norway´s Viktor Hovland third on 139 after a 68 -- the top trio being the only players under par after 36 holes.
“I was definitely anxious to get back out here and see how the game would pan out, and it ended up being a pretty good day,” Spaun said.
“It was more of a true US Open round, a lot of back and forth, a lot of grinding, bogeys. It was still an overall good day. I´m still right there.”
World number 14 Hovland marveled at 22nd-ranked Burns and his stunning round.
“Super impressive,” Hovland called it. “It just feels like you have to play absolutely perfect and have some good breaks going your way, as well, but it´s definitely doable.”
Heavy rains drenched Oakmont, halting play for the day at 8:15 p.m. (0015 GMT) with 13 golfers yet to finish their second rounds.
World number two Rory McIlroy struggled to make the cut, with double bogeys at the first and third holes, but sank a five-foot birdie putt at the 18th to shoot 72 and stand on 146, securing a spot inside the low 60 and ties to make the weekend.
Bryson DeChambeau fired a 77 to stand on 150 and miss the cut, the first defending champion to miss the US Open cut since Gary Woodland in 2020.
Also missing the cut was six-time US Open runner-up Phil Mickelson, who needed a win to complete a career Grand Slam.
Top-ranked Scottie Scheffler and Spain´s Jon Rahm were seven adrift on 144. Scheffler fired a 71 with five bogeys and four birdies.
“Felt like me getting away with one-over today wasn´t all that bad,” Scheffler said. “It could have been a lot worse.”
Rahm fired a frustrating 75. “I´m too annoyed and too mad right now to think about any perspective,” Rahm said. “Very frustrated. Very few rounds of golf I played in my life where I think I hit good putts and they didn´t sniff the hole.” With few exceptions, Oakmont was delivering blows to golf´s top talent.
“Everyone seems like they´re exhausted when they come in off the course just because it´s a punch in the face,” American Denny McCarthy said. “It just takes a lot out of you.”
Back-nine starter Burns drained a 21-foot birdie putt at 11, a six-footer to birdie the par-three 13th and back-to-back short birdie putts at 17 and 18.
Burns answered a bogey at the first with a five-foot birdie putt at the second and reached the green in two to set up a tap-in birdie at the par-five fourth hole, then parred into the clubhouse, sinking a 22-foot par putt at the ninth to close his round.
“It´s really difficult,” Burns said. “Sometimes the best thing is just to take your medicine.” Burns, who shared ninth at last year´s US Open for his best major finish, last won at the 2023 WGC Match Play, but he fired a Sunday 62 before losing a Canadian Open playoff last week.
Australian Adam Scott and American Ben Griffin shared fourth on 140.
France´s Victor Perez aced the par-three sixth hole from 192 yards, hitting the 54th hole-in-one in US Open history but only the second ace at a US Open at Oakmont. Perez shot 70 to stand sixth on 141.

Zverev hopes Stuttgart final is third time lucky on grass,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321336-zverev-hopes-stuttgart-final-is-third-time-lucky-on-grass,"Stuttgart, Germany: German star Alexander Zverev gets a third chance on Sunday to win his first ATP tournament on grass after reaching the Stuttgart final with a 7-6 (10/8), 7-6 (7/1) victory over American Brian Shelton.
Zverev, who has reached the finals of the other three Grand Slams but never even got as far as the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, will face big-serving American Taylor Fritz.
Fritz, who does have a grass court pedigree having won three of his eight ATP titles on the surface, beat Felix Auger-Aliassime 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) earlier on Saturday to reach his first final this year.
Zverev, 27, was never under pressure on his serve, offering up no break points, but the top seed fell short when he had two chances to break third-seeded Shelton.
His laxness carried on in the first set tie-break when he let slip three set points at 6-3, though, he pulled himself together and prevailed 10-8.
He learned from the first set as he romped through the second set tie-break to win in just over two hours.
“It is my first final on grass since 2017,” said Zverev, referring to the Halle final where he lost to Roger Federer.
The tournament serves as a warm up for Wimbledon, where Fritz, even though his game is suited to grass, has never done better than the quarter-finals.

Pacers vow to ‘circle the wagons’ after Thunder loss,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321337-pacers-vow-to-circle-the-wagons-after-thunder-loss,"Los Angeles, United States: Indiana Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said his team will need to “circle the wagons” to resurrect their NBA Finals campaign after stumbling to a 111-104 defeat against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Friday.
The Pacers looked poised to take a commanding 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series after surging 10 points clear late in the third quarter in front of a raucous home crowd in Indianapolis. But a sensational fourth quarter from the Thunder -- who outscored the Pacers 31-17 in the final frame -- left the series knotted at 2-2 heading into game five in Oklahoma City on Monday.
“This is where we´re going to have to dig in and circle the wagons and come back stronger on Monday,” Carlisle said after the loss. “This is a big disappointment, but there´s three games left.

Putin tells Trump Russia ready for next round of Ukraine talks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321412-putin-tells-trump-russia-ready-for-next-round-of-ukraine-talks,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin told his US counterpart Donald Trump Saturday that Moscow was ready to hold a fresh round of peace talks with Kyiv after June 22, once the warring sides complete exchanging prisoners and soldiers’ bodies.
Ukraine’s leader Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile did not mention whether Ukraine would agree to the next round of talks, only saying that “the exchanges will be completed and the parties will discuss the next step.”
Putin and Trump held a call for the fifth time since the Republican took office and sought to reset relations with Moscow, in a stark pivot from the approach of his predecessor Joe Biden’s administration to Russia’s 2022 invasion of its neighbour.
Trump’s approach has stunned Washington’s allies, raising doubts about the future of US aid to Kyiv and leaving Europe scrambling to work out how it can fill any gap in supplies if Trump decides to pull US military, financial and intelligence support.
“Both leaders expressed satisfaction with their personal relations,” during the call, the Kremlin said.
It added that the presidents “communicate in a businesslike manner and seek solutions to pressing issues on the bilateral and international agenda, no matter how complex these issues may be.”
Zelensky urged the United States to “shift tone” in its dialogue with Russia, saying it was “too warm” and would not help to end the war.
“Any signals of reduced aid, or of treating Ukraine and Russia as equals, are deeply unfair. Russia is the aggressor. They started this war. They do not want to end it,” the Ukrainian President said on X.
The Ukrainian leader also warned against a drop in aid due to the escalating Israel-Iran conflict, at a time when European support is stalling without US engagement. Earlier on Saturday, Ukraine and Russia swapped prisoners in the fourth such exchange this week, part of a large-scale plan to bring back 1,000 wounded prisoners from each side and return bodies of killed soldiers.
The prisoner agreement was the only visible result of two recent rounds of talks in Istanbul.
Photos published by Zelensky on Telegram showed men of various ages, mostly with shaved heads, wearing camouflage and draped in Ukrainian flags.
Some were injured, others disembarked from buses and hugged those welcoming them, or were seen calling someone by phone, sometimes covering their faces or smiling.
Moscow’s defence ministry released its own video showing men in uniforms holding Russian flags, clapping and chanting “Glory to Russia” and “hooray”, some raising their fists in the air.

"France says supports Harvard, welcomes foreign students",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321413-france-says-supports-harvard-welcomes-foreign-students,"PARIS: France’s foreign minister on Saturday said his country supported students and staff at Harvard, after President Donald Trump tried to ban foreign students from the prestigious US university.
“We stand with universities facing the threat of government control, restriction to their funding, constraints on their curricula or research projects,” Jean-Noel Barrot said during a commencement address at the high-profile HEC business school in Paris.
“We stand with Harvard faculty, with Harvard students, facing unjustified stress and anxiety right now,” he added in English.
“Should US courts uphold decisions to ban international students, France will offer (them) a safe place to complete their degrees,” he said.
Universities and research facilities in the United States have come under increasing political and financial pressure under Trump, including with threats of massive federal funding cuts.
Harvard has been at the forefront of Trump’s campaign against top American universities after it defied his calls to submit to oversight of its curriculum, staffing, student recruitment and “viewpoint diversity”.
A US court last week put a temporary stay on Trump’s latest effort to stop foreign students from enrolling at Harvard.
A White House proclamation a day earlier had sought to bar most new international students at Harvard from entering the country, and said existing foreign enrollees risked having their visas terminated.
The US government has already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the institution from any future federal funding.
France and the European Union are seeking to encourage disgruntled researchers to relocate from the United States to Europe.
European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said last month that the EU would launch a new incentives package worth 500 million euros ($580 million) to make the 27-nation bloc “a magnet for researchers”.
French President Emmanuel Macron in April unveiled plans for a funding programme to help national universities and other research bodies cover the cost of bringing foreign scientists to the country.

Number of police injured in N Ireland anti-immigrant violence tops 60,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321414-number-of-police-injured-in-n-ireland-anti-immigrant-violence-tops-60,"BELFAST: Over 60 officers have been injured in an outbreak of anti-immigrant unrest in Northern Ireland, police in the British province said Saturday, following a fifth night of violence.
“Over sixty officers have now been injured as a result of protecting the community from the ongoing disorder this week,” police said in a statement, without giving a precise number.
Police used a water cannon Friday to contain violence in the town of Portadown, west of Belfast, said the statement.
Petrol bombs and fireworks were thrown at riot police during the disorder, according to local media.
A hotel was also attacked in Newtownabbey, near the capital Belfast, in a “racially motivated hate crime”, while a police vehicle was damaged in the region’s second city Londonderry, police added.
Three nights of violence had already hit Ballymena, some 30 miles (50 kilometres) northwest of Belfast, leaving a trail of damage.
The clashes first erupted in Ballymena on Monday night after two teenagers were arrested for the alleged attempted rape of a young girl at the weekend.
Police have not confirmed the ethnicity of the teenagers, who remain in custody and had asked for a Romanian interpreter in court.  The disorder then spread to Belfast and other provincial towns.

UK PM announces U-turn on child-sex scandal inquiry,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321415-uk-pm-announces-u-turn-on-child-sex-scandal-inquiry,"ON BOARD THE UK PM’s PLANE, United States: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday announced a national inquiry focused into a UK child-sex scandal that attracted the attention of US billionaire Elon Musk.
Starmer had previously resisted calls for an inquiry into the so-called “grooming gangs” in favour of a series of local probes.
But speaking to British reporters travelling with him to Canada, Starmer said his position on the issue had changed and he would accept the recommendation in an independent report into child sexual exploitation.
“I have never said we should not look again at any issue. That’s why I asked Louise Casey who I hugely respect to do an audit,” he said referring to a member of the upper house of parliament.
“Her position when she started the audit was that there was not a real need for a national inquiry.... She has looked at the material she has looked at and she has come to the view that there should be a national inquiry,” he added.
The scandal was over the exploitation of thousands of girls and young women over several decades in towns across England.
Gangs of men, often from Pakistani backgrounds, targeted mostly white girls from disadvantaged backgrounds, some of whom lived in children’s homes.
The gangs operated in several English towns and cities, notably in Rotherham and Rochdale in the north, but also in Oxford and Bristol, for almost four decades.
The issue of UK grooming gangs was thrust into the international spotlight in January when tech billionaire Elon Musk in January launched incendiary attacks on his X platform against the UK government for resisting the calls for a national inquiry.

UK moves warplanes to Middle East amid Iran crisis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321417-uk-moves-warplanes-to-middle-east-amid-iran-crisis,"ON BOARD THE UK PM’s PLANE, United States: Britain is deploying fighter jets and other “assets” to the Middle East amid an escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Saturday.
“We are moving assets to the region, including jets, and that is for contingency support,” Starmer told reporters travelling with him on his plane to Canada for G7 talks.
The UK leader said he had spoken with both US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu since Israel launched attacks on Iranian military and nuclear sites early Friday.
According to officials, dozens of people have been killed, including top army and Revolutionary Guards commanders as well as civilians.
Iran has responded with barrages of drones and missiles fired at Israel overnight Friday into Saturday.
Starmer said the situation was “fast moving” and “intense”.
“We’re having ongoing discussions with our allies all of the time, both myself and (foreign minister) David Lammy... who also spoke to the Iranians,” he said.
“Our constant message is de-escalate, and therefore everything we’re doing, all discussions we’re having are to do with de-escalation.”
The UK leader said his talk on Friday with Netanyahu had been “good and constructive” and had “included discussions about the safety and security of Israel”.
Foreign Secretary Lammy said earlier Saturday that he was “alarmed” by further strikes overnight.
“We must urgently de-escalate & prevent any further harm to civilians,” Lammy said in a post on social media, adding that he had spoken to his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi “to urge calm”.

Gaza rescuers say 41 killed by Israeli military,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321418-gaza-rescuers-say-41-killed-by-israeli-military,"GAZA CITY, Palestinian Territories: Gaza’s civil defence agency reported 41 people killed in Israeli military operations in the Palestinian territory Saturday, more than half of whom it said were killed while waiting for aid.
“Forty-one people were martyred due to the ongoing Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip, 23 of whom were waiting for aid,” Mohammad al-Mughayyir, an official from the agency, told AFP.
The Israeli military did not respond to AFP’s request for comment.
Israeli restrictions on media in Gaza and the difficulties of access on the ground mean AFP is unable to independently verify the casualty tolls provided by the civil defence agency.
Central Gaza’s Al-Awda hospital received eight bodies and 125 wounded after Israeli drone strikes targeted people gathering near an aid distribution centre near the Netzarim corridor, Mughayyir said.
Gaza City’s Al-Shifa Hospital received 11 bodies after an attack on people seeking aid on Saturday, he added, while four others were taken to the Al-Aqsa hospital in central Gaza and Nasser hospital in the south.
Dozens of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution points since the US- and Israel-backed organisation began operating in late May, according to the civil defence agency.
An officially private effort with opaque funding, the GHF began operating on May 26 after Israel cut off supplies into Gaza for more than two months, sparking international condemnation and warnings of imminent famine.
Mughayyir said that 18 people were killed in the north and south of the territory during various attacks by the Israeli army, including seven in Gaza City.
The Gaza Strip has been ravaged by more than 20 months of war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, with the situation continuing to deteriorate on the ground.
Nasser Hospital, one of the last partly functioning health facilities, has been targeted by Israeli strikes in recent days, according to medical sources who spoke to AFP.
AFP journalists on the ground reported that internet and fixed line communications were down in Gaza for the third consecutive day.
The Palestinian Authority’s telecommunications ministry said Thursday that Israeli forces targeted a fibre optic cable, triggering the outage.

"France boosts security, including around Jewish, US sites",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321419-france-boosts-security-including-around-jewish-us-sites,"PARIS: France is boosting security, including around Jewish and US sites on its territory, because of the conflict between Israel and Iran, the interior minister said in a domestic order sent on Saturday.
“Special vigilance” must be given “to all sites that could be targeted by terrorist or malicious acts by a foreign power,” Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said in a dispatch to French regional security chiefs that was seen by AFP.
He said security should be heightened around “places of worship, schools, state and institutional buildings, sites with high traffic”, including “festive, cultural or religious gatherings”.
The order applied also to “Israeli and US interests as well as to establishments in the Jewish community”, the order said.

Over 600 evacuated as Myanmar military fights anti-coup forces,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321420-over-600-evacuated-as-myanmar-military-fights-anti-coup-forces,"PEKON, Myanmar: Hundreds of Myanmar families were being uprooted from their homes on Saturday, a community organiser said, piling their belongings onto evacuation convoys to escape fighting between the military and anti-coup guerrillas.
Myanmar has been consumed by a many-sided civil war since the military snatched power in a 2021 coup, leaving more than 3.5 million people displaced according to United Nations figures.
Heavy combat has been raging since Monday around the village of Saung Nang Khae in the eastern state of Shan, according to locals and evacuation organisers.

US protesters hit streets before Trump’s military parade,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321421-us-protesters-hit-streets-before-trump-s-military-parade,"WASHINGTON: Thousands of people on Saturday rallied nationwide against the policies of US President Donald Trump ahead of a rare military parade on his 79th birthday -- but the killing of a Democratic lawmaker in Minnesota cast a pall over the day’s events.
Trump was quick to condemn the targeted shootings of two lawmakers outside Minneapolis -- one died along with her husband, while the other and his wife have been hospitalized with gunshot wounds.
The shocking murder was the latest in a string of incidents of political violence, including an attempt on Trump’s life in July last year, and an April arson attack on the home of Pennsylvania’s governor, who is a Democrat and Jewish.
The shootings prompted Minnesota state authorities to call on residents not to attend protests by the so-called “No Kings” movement organized across the United State, which began at noon (1600 GMT) in some East Coast locations.
Organizers said the rallies would be the largest since Trump returned to office in January, adding that they were “rejecting authoritarianism, billionaire-first politics, and the militarization of our democracy.”
“I’m here because the things that are happening in this administration are very disturbing,” Sarah Hargrave, 42, told AFP in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, where about 1,000 people rallied.
Organizers said they expected millions of people in more than 1,500 cities including New York, Houston, Seattle, Atlanta and Trump’s second home in Palm Beach, Florida to protest. A small group even gathered in Paris.
Thousands hit the streets in Philadelphia, one of the movement’s flagship events.
Thousands more demonstrators are expected to turn out in Los Angeles to protest against Trump’s deployment of troops in America’s second-largest city following clashes sparked by immigration raids.
Downtown, Trump planned a giant celebration of the US Army’s 250th birthday -- and his own -- in Washington with tanks, helicopters and nearly 7,000 troops at a reported cost of up to $45 million.
“This is a big day for America!!!” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
But the Minnesota shootings, the threat of thunderstorms in the US capital, and the barrage of missiles raining down in Tel Aviv and Tehran -- a conflict in which the American military is assisting -- could cast a long shadow over the president’s event.
Trump says the Washington parade will be “like no other” -- but has promised to use “very big force” if protesters attempt to disrupt the spectacle.
The rare military parade is the largest in the United States since the end of the Gulf War in 1991.

Trump condemns ‘terrible shooting’ of Minnesota state lawmakers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321422-trump-condemns-terrible-shooting-of-minnesota-state-lawmakers,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Saturday condemned the “terrible shooting” of two Minnesota Democratic state lawmakers, one of whom was killed.
“I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against state lawmakers,” Trump said in a statement.
“Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America.”A gunman shot two Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota early Saturday, killing one and her husband and wounding the other, in what the northern US state’s governor said were politically motivated attacks.
