Iran 'must make a deal before there is nothing left': Trump,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321108-iran-must-make-a-deal-before-there-is-nothing-left-trump,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump urged Iran on Friday to “make a deal”, warning that there will be more “death and destruction” after Israel launched deadly strikes targeting Iranian nuclear facilities.
“There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
“Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left... JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,” he said.
Earlier, Trump told Fox News he had advance knowledge of Israel’s air strikes on Iran, underscoring that Tehran “cannot have a nuclear bomb” and expressing hope for a return to diplomatic negotiations. Trump said that “Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb” and that the US was hoping to get back to the negotiating table. He also emphasised US’ readiness to defend itself and Israel in the event of Iranian retaliation. While the Trump administration reportedly informed a key Middle Eastern ally ahead of the strikes, it reiterated that the US was not directly involved.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio echoed this stance, stating, “We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.” He added a stern warning: “Iran should not target US interests or personnel.”
Trump, however, said on Truth Social on Friday that Israel had acted because a 60-day deadline that he had set for Iran had run out, implying that the two acted in concert. His boasts about the “finest” US equipment that Israel had used—a day before a huge parade in Washington on Trump´s 79th birthday featuring US aircraft and tanks—also muddied the waters.In an interview to Axios on Friday, Trump said that Israel used “great American equipment” during its attack on Iran. He said that Iran now has a stronger incentive to agree on a nuclear deal after Israel’s strikes, Axios reported. “I couldn’t get them to a deal in 60 days. They were close, they should have done it. Maybe now it will happen,” Axios quoted Trump as saying.

Saudi Arabia
“Saudi Arabia expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran, which undermine its sovereignty and security and constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms.”
Oman
“Oman considers this act a dangerous, reckless escalation, representing a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, the principles of international law. Such aggressive, persistent behaviour is unacceptable and further destabilises the regional peace and security.” “The Sultanate of Oman holds Israel responsible for this escalation and its consequences, and calls upon the international community to adopt a firm and unequivocal stance to halt this dangerous course of action.”
Iraq
Iraq strongly condemned the attacks, saying: “This act represents a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.”
Jordan
“Jordan has not and will not allow any violation of its airspace, reaffirming that the Kingdom will not be a battleground for any conflict,” a government spokesperson told AFP after Jordan closed its airspace.
Qatar
Gaza mediator Qatar expressed “its strong condemnation and denunciation of the Israeli attack,” the Gulf state´s foreign ministry said, adding that the “dangerous escalation threatens security and stability of the region and hinders efforts to de-escalate and reach diplomatic solutions”.
Turkiye
“Israel´s attacks on our neighbour Iran are a clear provocation that disregards international law,” said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a vocal critic of Israel and a fervent advocate of the Palestinian cause, urging the international community to “put an end to Israeli banditry”.
Afghanistan
Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted in a statement on X. “The continuation of such tension-provoking actions has made the situation in the region even more fragile and worrying,” he wrote.He said the Taliban authorities, which do not recognise Israel, called for all stakeholders to “address this issue and prevent the spread of further insecurity and instability in the region”.

It is a Rs38.458 billion deficit budget, as total revenue receipts are expected around Rs3,411.542 billion.
The new budget marks a 12.9 percent increase over the current fiscal year’s outlay of Rs3.056 trillion and promises relief for government employees, pensioners, small businesses, and the general public through both fiscal incentives and service expansions.
Presenting what he termed a forward-looking and inclusive financial plan, Shah said the budget aligns with the commitments under the IMF’s 2024 programme and aims to sustain development momentum while cushioning inflationary impacts.
SALARY, PENSION INCREASES ANNOUNCED
Among key highlights, the chief minister announced a 12 percent ad-hoc relief allowance for all government employees (BPS-01 to BPS-16), 10 per cent ad-hoc relief for employees (BPS-17 to BPS-22) and 8 percent increase in pensions, benefiting thousands of current and former civil servants. The overall financial impact of these measures is estimated at Rs52 billion per annum.
He also confirmed the continuation of personal pay for employees in BPS-1 to BPS-6, ensuring their salaries do not fall below the Rs37,000 minimum wage threshold.
In a significant step, all pension dues for civil servants retired on or before June 30, 2025, have been cleared, amounting to Rs35 billion.
BUDGETARY ALLOCATIONS: A SECTOR-WISE OVERVIEW
The Rs3.45 trillion budget comprises allocations of Rs2.15 trillion for current revenue expenditures, up 12.4 percent from last year, and Rs520 billion for Annual Development Programme (ADP). The development focus remains on education, healthcare, flood rehabilitation, infrastructure, renewable energy, and regional uplift.

TAXES ABOLISHED
Professional tax, cotton fee, entertainment duty, local cess and drainage cess

REVENUE TARGETS AND COLLECTION REFORMS
Sindh’s own-source revenue for FY25 is projected at Rs618.87 billion, with Sindh Sales Tax (SST) expected to contribute Rs300 billion—a 35 per cent increase from the previous year.
Digitization remains a core focus. The “E-Pay Sindh” platform will soon cover 34 provincial levies, 14 of which are already automated.
Non-tax measures and initiatives
Sindh announced several non-tax reliefs, including reduced fees for: Mutation and Sales Certificates (from Rs1,000 to Rs500), Certified Copies (50 percent cut), Solvency and Heirship Certificates (from Rs1,000 to Rs500).
Additionally, Shah proposed abolishing mandatory third-party insurance for motorcycles, terming it difficult to enforce and burdensome for low-income users.

Expected outcomes include 30–35 percent higher yields and 25 percent boost in farmer incomes.

Burgeoning unfunded pension liabilities: Aurangzeb backs raising retirement age to 62,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321112-burgeoning-unfunded-pension-liabilities-aurangzeb-backs-raising-retirement-age-to-62,"ISLAMABAD: Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb on Friday highlighted the fast ballooning of unfunded pension liabilities and extended his support for the idea of increasing the retirement age from 60 to 62 years.
During the Senate Standing Committee on Finance meeting, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, to finalise recommendations on the Finance Bill 2025-26, Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb stated that the unfunded pension liabilities were huge, so the government undertook pension reforms to stop the bleeding. The Defined Contributory Pension, he said, had already been implemented last year (for civilians only). Senator Farooq H Naek, belonging to PPP, proposed to the government to increase the retirement age from 60 to 62 years in order to curtail the escalation in the pension bill. He said that if the age of the judges could be increased, why the same policy could not be applied for the bureaucrats. Senator Naek said that the retirement age of 60 resulted in taking away an experienced person who could serve more.
Senator Anusha Rahman also supported it and argued that the retirement age could be extended to 65 or even 70 years. Minister for Finance cited the example of his previous banking sector job and stated that he had got approval from increasing retirement age from 60 to 65 years.
However, Ministry of Finance official apprised the committee that the increasing retirement age would not help saving any substantial amount because the Army personnel got retired much earlier and major chunk of pension bill generated to pay their pension. The Ministry of Finance shared a detailed presentation on budgetary numbers for 2025-26 and stated that the government allocated Rs510 billion for special package for Army, Navy and Air Force in the budget for 2025-26 against Rs463 billion in the outgoing fiscal year.
Senator Faisal Vawda said that the NFC made it hard to balance the numbers of budget making for the federal government so it requires changes. He said that the requirement of seeking certificate from Income Tax Commissioner for buying property was totally unacceptable so it should be withdrawn. He also proposed to provide similar incentives for both seller and purchaser of properties. He also asked the finance minister to abolish 7E in the budget for 2025-26.
Responding to the long-standing debate on agricultural taxation, he asserted, “Earlier it was said agriculture tax can never be imposed. Now, they say it can’t be collected. We will collect it — just give us the chance. Provinces are set to begin agricultural income tax collection from July 1, 2025.”

NA debate: Opposition rejects budget amid praise for PM,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321113-na-debate-opposition-rejects-budget-amid-praise-for-pm,"ISLAMABAD: As former PM Raja Parvaiz Ashraf showered praise on prime minister and his cabinet for taking difficult decisions to bolster country’s economy, the opposition leader Omar Ayub Khan rejected the budget, decried heavy taxation to the tune of over Rs42 trillion in last three years and belied government’s claims of reduction in inflation rate.
Taking part in debate on budget proposals, the PPP parliamentarian Raja Parvaiz Ashraf said the government risked ruling party’s popularity among masses and took very difficult decisions to overhaul national and broaden the tax base.
“Whether anybody admits or not, it will have to acknowledge that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his cabinet took such difficult decision which were unpopular and every government hesitate to take”, Raja Parvaiz Ashraf while taking part in debate on budget proposals said.
He said that it was a reality that the government of Shehbaz Sharif took very difficult decisions which no regime could afford to take.
At the same time, he also mentioned that the leadership of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) also extended every possible moral support to the incumbent government. “We feel that while putting aside politics, we should extend moral support to the government”, he said.
While acknowledging complexity of the national economy, he emphasised that it is the government’s responsibility to meet the country’s challenges and provide relief to all segments of the society.
Former prime minister also pointed out that India picked up courage to attack Pakistan with an objective to weaken Pakistan both economically and politically as the adversary was already against existence of the Islamic Republic.
He said that India also wanted to pit people of Pakistan against its armed forces while running a maligned campaign on social media but he noted that the whole nation and political parties stood by the forces.
He praised the nation for rising like “a wall of lead” alongside its armed forces and credited the military for delivering a strong and effective response. He also paid tribute to the leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and honoured the sacrifices of the country’s martyrs.
Raja Parvaiz Ashraf also mentioned that Pakistan delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has been making hectic diplomatic efforts during the foreign visit while exposing effectively presenting country’s case and exposing adversary’s designs.
The PPP leader while addressing the opposition leadership, stressed that there should be self-respect for each other.
The PPP parliamentarian also observed that 10 percent increase in salaries of government employees was not sufficient in view of inflation.
He said that he had already demanded of the prime minister to focus on betterment of salaried class, pensioners and farmers and protect them.
The opposition leader Omar Ayub said that inflation and price hike had broken back of the common man reducing their by 58 percent in the last three year.
He mentioned that price of milk had been increased by 70 percent, cooking oil by 30 percent and tea by 74 percent in the last three years while 115 million are living below poverty rate. “While the government launches drone attacks of taxes and price hike, the unemployment rate has also increased by 22 percent during this period”, he said.
He alleged that three governments of PDM imposed Rs42.5 trillion taxes mainly depending on indirect taxation.
The opposition leader also demanded withdrawal over five times raise in salaries of the Senate Chairman and the National Assembly Speaker.
On that the Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said that increase in salaries of the Senate Chairman and the Speaker was neither approved by the two House nor the standing committees on finance. “Whosoever increased salaries can also withdraw the same”, he said adding that there would no objection if increase in salaries is taken back.  As the opposition leader alleged censoring speeches of the opposition members, the Speaker said the system had developed fault due to thumping of desks during the budget session. He said system is old one and parts are not available while a budget of Rs300 to Rs350 million would be required for restoration of the system. He alleged that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was enjoying more powers than the prime minister. “As caretaker Punjab chief minister facilitated import of Rs450 billion wheat which was a drone attack on farmers of the province”, he said.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry accused opposition parties of playing politics instead of helping the country in difficult times, especially regarding security challenges involving the Taliban and tensions with India. “They crossed the line between fair criticism and harming national interest,” he said.
He called for harmony among institutions and urged everyone to present a united front. “This is the time to show the world we are united,” he said.
Dr Tariq Fazal expressed disappointment while the international community praised Pakistan’s diplomatic response, some voices inside the country were still critical.
He praised the success of Pakistan’s anti-terror operations, saying India’s recent aggression was an attempt to sabotage Pakistan’s action in eliminating terrorist networks.
The minister highlighted the positive role of overseas Pakistanis, credited prime minister for encouraging legal remittances and cracking down on black money.
“In March 2025 alone, we received over $4 billion, and total remittances reached nearly $34.9 billion,” he said, calling it proof of overseas Pakistanis’ trust in Pakistan’s leadership.
He described the federal budget as a shared document for all citizens, not just a few. “This is a people-friendly budget. Every decision has been made in the national interest,” he said.
Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhary warned that any attempt by India to block Pakistan’s water share under the Indus Waters Treaty would be treated as a hostile act — equal to a declaration of war.
Turning to Balochistan, Dr Tariq Fazal said the current government is taking serious steps to address the province’s concerns, especially regarding fair resource distribution. “We are committed to peace in Balochistan and ensuring it receives its fair share of national development,” he said, stressing the importance of equity among provinces.
He accused India of supporting terrorism in Balochistan, particularly through backing the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). He said Indian-sponsored terrorists had even targeted schools in the province.
He warned that if India takes any aggressive step again, Pakistan will respond even more forcefully.
The PTI member Ali Muhammad Khan said Shah Faisal and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto were punished for establishing an Islamic block while the PTI Chairman was also punished for attempting to unite the Muslim countries and form their block. Condemning attack Israel’s attack on Iran, he said that it was also a message for Pakistan.
Calling for the national unity, the opposition member said that there was need for a national alliance while forgetting bitterness of the past.

Pakistan forms crisis committee as oil prices spike,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321114-pakistan-forms-crisis-committee-as-oil-prices-spike,"ISLAMABAD: In response to a sharp surge in global oil prices following Israel’s attack on Iran, the federal government has constituted a high-level committee to monitor petrol prices, ensure uninterrupted fuel supplies, and evaluate the fiscal fallout for Pakistan.
Chaired by the finance minister, the 16-member committee includes key economic and energy policymakers such as the Ministers for Petroleum and Power, the Governor of the State Bank, the FBR Chairman, and senior executives from OGRA, PARCO, PSO, and HUBCO.
The move comes amid heightened geopolitical tensions that threaten global oil flows and pose serious risks to Pakistan’s economy.
According to an official memorandum issued by the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division), the committee will closely track petroleum futures and supply chain predictability, evaluate foreign exchange implications, and recommend strategies to stabilize the domestic market during this volatile period.
The committee’s terms of reference also include devising contingency plans to prevent fuel supply disruptions and conducting a fiscal impact analysis in case of a prolonged conflict.

"Senators seek more funds for education, health, agriculture",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321115-senators-seek-more-funds-for-education-health-agriculture,"ISLAMABAD: The legislators in the Senate Friday urged the government to allocate more for education, health and agriculture sectors and draw a strategy to combat poverty in the country and opposed GST on solar panels.
Leader of the Opposition in the House Syed Shibli Faraz, who opened the budget debate, condemned the Israeli attack on Iran and said that the war has international repercussions with petroleum prices have started to rise and the region exposed to instability. The proposed federal budget for the next year, he claimed, had become controversial in the beginning as questions were being raised about the economic figures presented in the budget, insisting the sanctity of numbers in the budget looks compromised.
He alleged that the budget is a manipulation of figures as serious objections have been raised over it for the first time and added that the country had 6.2 percent GDP growth during the last PTI regime with the agriculture sector having a growth rate of 4.2 percent in 2022, which now stood at 0.6 percent under the current government.
Shibli pointed out that agriculture contributed 24 percent to GDP, which was the main driver of Pakistan’s economy but the policies of the government had broken the backbone of farmers after Punjab government abolished the support price of wheat.
He continued the other crops have also faced contraction this year as cotton, maize and wheat prices and supply chain are facing disruption and an element of uncertainty has been created in the agriculture sector.
PTI lawmaker claimed that industrial sector had grown at the rate of 7 percent during the last PTI government, which was now at 4.8 percent, according to figures provided by the Shehbaz Sharif administration.
When large-scale manufacturing is contracting continuously, he wondered how the government is showing the growth at 4.8 percent, adding this gives the impression that the budget figures are manipulated.
Shibli remarked, “This budget does not reflect the reality of Pakistan and this is anti-people and an IMF-dictated budget. The government has set wrong priorities for the annual Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP 2025-26, in which Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been badly ignored”. He alleged that the government has given unbridled powers to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) that would create an anti-business environment; the way the FBR is weaponised that is unprecedented.
Responding to the speech of opposition leader, the ruling PMLN parliamentary leader Irfan Siddiqui claimed that it was the PTI regime, which had played havoc with the economy, crushed the law and the constitution as well as the opposition.
Citing the statistics of 2017-18,he insisted that the economy not destroyed and joblessness was not caused in a day, it was the bitter reap of the crop, they had sowed. “We are reaping it today and perhaps will keep doing it for years to come,” he remarked. He also said that PTI government was removed through the first and the last vote of no-confidence from the platform of Parliament, adding it was neither a regime change, nor involvement of the military or US.
Senator Irfan said Nawaz had said bye-bye to the IMF in 2017 on completion of its programme, overcome energy crisis, the menace of terrorism and the stock exchange was taken to 55000 points and inflation was recorded at 3.4 percent but then that government was pushed when some met the people of powerful circles.
He also called for not winding up institutions of literature and knowledge and promotion of Urdu language like Pakistan Academy of Letters, Urdu Science Board, Iqbal Academy, Urdu Dictionary Board. “Please don’t place them under the universities, which already are facing so many issues, including paying their employees,” he contended. PPP’s Senator Shahadat Awan said according to the World Bank report, 44.796 percent Pakistanis, i.e. 107 million people, live below the poverty line, their daily income is less than 1200 rupees and unfortunately, no road map has been given in the current budget to reduce this poverty.
“Likewise, in the face of rising inflation, the minimum salary of Rs37,000 that was kept is absolutely low and that is why Pakistan People’s Party has been demanding that this salary be increased to at least Rs50,000 and the federal government should ensure that it should be implemented in the public and private sectors,” he said.
According to the current cost of living, he pointed out, his party wants that the salaries of federal employees should have been increased substantially.

Pakistan condemns ‘illegitimate’ Israeli aggression against Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321116-pakistan-condemns-illegitimate-israeli-aggression-against-iran,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Friday condemned “unjustified and illegitimate” aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The Foreign Office said Israeli military strikes violated the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran and clearly contravened the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. “The international community and the United Nations bear responsibility to uphold international law, stop this aggression immediately and hold the aggressor accountable for its actions,” it added.
DPM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar termed the attack a brazen violation of Iran’s sovereignty. “This abhorrent action has shaken foundations of international law as well as conscience of humanity; and gravely undermines regional stability & int’l security,” he wrote on X. He said Pakistan stood in solidarity with the government and people of Iran.
Ishaq Dar also held a telephonic conversation with Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, during which he strongly condemned the Israeli aggression against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
According to the Foreign Office, Dar expressed Pakistan’s deep concern over Israel’s blatant violation of international law and the UN Charter. He reiterated Pakistan’s firm support to the government and the brotherly people of Iran in their efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region.
The DPM also conveyed his heartfelt condolences over the loss of innocent lives in the Israeli attacks, and expressed solidarity with the families of the victims.
The two foreign ministers discussed the regional situation in light of recent developments and reaffirmed their commitment to close cooperation for peace, stability, and security in the broader region.
President Asif Ali Zardari strongly condemned the blatant Israeli aggression against Iran. “The Israeli military strikes are a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran, and amount to total disregard of the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law,” he said in a statement, issued by the President House on Friday.
President Zardari conveyed his deepest sympathies to the brotherly people of Iran on the loss of lives in the attack. He also urged the international community and the United Nations to hold the aggressor accountable and take immediate action to prevent the situation from further escalation.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the unprovoked attack on Iran by Israel. “This grave and highly irresponsible act is deeply alarming and risks further de-stabilising an already volatile region,” he said, urging the international community and the United Nations to take urgent steps to prevent any further escalation that could imperil regional and global peace.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif Friday directed all authorities concerned to ensure the safety and swift return of Pakistani Zaireen currently in Iran.
A Crisis Management Cell has been set up at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor developments and coordinate support. The Pakistani Embassy in Iran has also been placed on high alert and tasked with assisting pilgrims. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared the embassy’s emergency contact: (0098)-2166941388.
PM Shehbaz stressed the urgent need for all possible steps to protect Pakistani citizens and facilitate their safe return. He ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the embassy in Iran to stay on high alert until regional tensions ease.
The Foreign Office has also advised Pakistani pilgrims to reconsider travel to Iran and Iraq due to the deteriorating security situation.
The Senate and the National Assembly (NA) also passed resolutions rebuking Israel for resorting to “war crime by attacking our brotherly country Iran”.
In Senate the resolution was tabled by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and in the National Assembly, it was tabled by PPP MNA Naveed Qamar.
The Senate resolution condemned the Israel’s military attack, declaring it a violation of international laws and the UN conventions and emphasised the House stands resolute with the brotherly country Islamic Republic of Iran.
“Israel attack is a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the UN and all international norms. It has put peace and security in the region and beyond in grave danger. Over the years, Israel has been the source of countless deaths of Muslims around the world, particularly in Occupied Palestine,” reads the resolution.
The House regretted that the world and the Muslim Ummah were witnessing slaughter of children and civilians in Gaza for the last two years on an unimaginable scale. The inaction of the Muslim world against this genocide is especially troubling as it has now led Israel to attack another sovereign Muslim state, Iran.
“This House jointly and unequivocally condemns Israel and its heinous crimes against Muslim Ummah, especially against brotherly nations of Palestine and Iran. This House stands resolute with our Iranian brothers and sisters and supports their right to defend themselves against this aggression,” it concluded. The NA resolution strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against Iran, causing loss of lives and property in the brotherly country.
The House, through the resolution, noted with utter disgust and dismay that the strikes carried in the dark hours of June 13, 2025 were not only a serious violation of the sovereignty and integrity of a United Nations member state but also clearly contravened fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter.
“Iran has a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter,” the lower house maintained. The NA also reiterated that Pakistan stands in complete solidarity with the government, parliament and the people of Iran and prayed for those who lost their lives in the attack.
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that Israel’s attack on Iran was a tragic incident of history. He regretted that the Muslims could not act against Israeli aggressive acts in Gaza, which was a matter of grave concern.
PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also “strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran”. He also offered heartfelt condolences to the Iranian people during this difficult hour, calling on all responsible nations and the UN to work collectively towards de-escalation and to uphold international law.
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif strongly condemned the Israeli aggression against Iran in a message.
Taking to X, he stated that the Israeli assault is a blatant violation of Iran’s sovereignty. “We are deeply saddened by the loss of innocent lives,” said Nawaz Sharif. He expressed solidarity with the Iranian people, saying, “We stand with the people of Iran in this difficult hour.”
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman called attacks a “clear violation of international law” and a “dangerous provocation with potential global repercussions.”
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, while condemning Israeli attack, said: “Israeli aggression on Iran poses a serious threat to world peace.” She regretted martyrdom of Iranian officials in Israeli attack. Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman strongly condemned Israel’s attack on Iran, calling it a blatant act of terrorism.

"Govt to hike non-filer cash withdrawal limit to Rs75,000",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321117-govt-to-hike-non-filer-cash-withdrawal-limit-to-rs75-000,"ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to raise the cash withdrawal threshold for non-filers to Rs75,000 from Rs50,000, aiming to provide relief to middle-income bank users.
However, under revised budget proposals for fiscal year 2025-26, withdrawals exceeding the new limit will be subject to a higher 0.8 percent advance tax, up from 0.6 percent in the current year.
The decision, endorsed by Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Langrial and approved by the National Assembly’s Finance Committee on Friday, marks a significant shift in the government’s approach to revenue collection, balancing between facilitation and enforcement. The move also includes a key exemption for Asaan Accounts, widely used by low-income individuals, ensuring they remain untaxed.
The lawmakers and the FBR chief reached this agreement here in the NA standing committee on Finance and revenue. This decision will be now included in the finance bill 2025-26, slated to be passed by end of this month.
In a major win for the real estate sector, the government has decided to abolish the 3 percent to 7 percent federal excise duty on the purchase of commercial and residential properties and open plots—a controversial tax that the IMF had initially resisted. “We convinced the IMF that this excise duty was wrongly imposed, as it applies globally only on movable assets. And the revenue would not fall,” said Langrial during the meeting chaired by MNA Syed Naveed Qamar.
Under the revised taxation structure, property sellers will now pay significantly higher withholding taxes of 4.5pc for sales of property having gross value up to Rs50 million, 5pc for Rs50–100 million, and 5.5pc for properties over Rs100 million. Buyers, on the other hand, will see slightly reduced rates: 1.5pc, 2pc, and 2.5pc across the same value bands. For sellers, this means an across-the-board increase of 1.5 percentage points in withholding tax rates, chairman FBR said.
Meanwhile, the government is throwing a lifeline to the struggling equity market by rationalising dividend tax rates on Mutual Funds. Government is narrowing the tax advantage enjoyed by investors in government securities. The tax on investments in in government securities (including PIBs and T-bills) has been raised from 15pc to 25pc, while the tax on equity dividends remains at 15pc. “This will redirect capital from government securities to the stock market,” said Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani. “We want investors to shift their focus to equities, where the real economic growth happens.” High-income earners may breathe a small sigh of relief. The FBR chief revealed that the income tax surcharge on individuals earning over Rs10 million per month would be reduced from 10pc to 9pc, citing concerns over the growing exodus of high-skilled professionals. “This tax is contributing to brain drain,” Langrial said, calling for a more competitive fiscal regime to retain talent. A 0.5 per cent cut has been proposed to the super tax for incomes between Rs200 million and Rs500 million in FY2025-26. A 1pc on income between Rs150 million and Rs200 million, 1.5pc (Rs200m to Rs250m), 2.5pc (Rs250m to Rs300m), 3.5pc (Rs300m to Rs350m), 5.5pc (Rs350m to Rs400m), 7.5pc (Rs400m to Rs500m) and 10 percent for those having income above Rs500 million.
Notably, global tech giants like Google, YouTube, and Facebook will see their taxes jump. The government is increasing the tax on online advertisements from 10pc to 15pc, hoping to not only boost revenue but also push these platforms to establish offices in Pakistan, FBR chief said. Platforms with a physical presence will still benefit from a reduced 5pc withholding tax, but the FBR has now proposed a legal requirement for all digital advertisers to file quarterly statements detailing ad revenues generated in Pakistan.
Thar coal miners will now be allowed to sell coal to sectors beyond independent power producers (IPPs), for which 100% tax credit was previously granted. Under the revised policy, the tax credit will be proportionally reduced based on the share of coal sold outside the power sector, in a move aimed at boosting the use of local coal.
In a controversial move, the government also proposed to impose a phased sales tax in the erstwhile FATA and PATA regions, starting at 10pc and reaching 18pc over four years. MNA Shahram Khan Tarakai opposed the plan, citing worsening economic conditions in the tribal areas. However, Langrial assured that income tax exemptions would continue, and the new sales tax measure was developed in consultation with industry stakeholders to prevent abuse of the existing exemptions.

Alarm as tweaks to finance bill bring many pensioners into tax net,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321118-alarm-as-tweaks-to-finance-bill-bring-many-pensioners-into-tax-net,"ISLAMABAD: The proposed changes in the Finance Bill for 2025-26 have brought pension income exceeding Rs10 million per annum in the tax net at a rate of 5 percent, but this proposal has raised many eyebrows.
First of all, it seems that FBR proposed changes after which the commutation will become taxable for all practical purposes.
If the proposed changes get approval from Parliament, it would have serious consequences for all the pensioners. So the element of commutation needs some thorough review in the proposed changes in the law because every officer of higher grades who gets the maximum limit in advance will have to pay increased tax amounts.
Former Member FBR Policy Dr Muhammad Iqbal, when contacted, said that FBR ostensibly made changes in the tax regime applicable to pensions to tax pension income exceeding Rs10 million in a year, but ended up taxing the income of most of the pensioners drawing far less amount of annual pension at much higher rates.
Clause 12 of Part I of the second schedule to the Income Tax Ordinance is proposed to be omitted through the Finance Bill 2025. As a result, the pension income, which has always been a part of salary income given the definition of salary income provided in section 12 of the Ordinance, and taxable at the rates applicable to salary income.
All that the FBR was required to do was to treat the pension as a separate block instead of subjecting it to the rates applicable to salary income.
It tried to do this by proposing to add a proviso at the end of Table II in Division I of Part I of the First Schedule. This Table provides the tax rates applicable to various slabs of income, ranging from 1 percent (which was now proposed upward from 1 to 2.5 percent in the cabinet) to a maximum of 35 percent.
The slab rate of 35 percent is applicable on annual salary income of Rs4.1 million. The proviso proposed to be inserted through the Finance Bill reads as “Provided that the in case of an individual deriving income solely from pension, annuity, supplement to the pension or annuity and commutation of pension from former employer for tax year, the rate of tax on such annuity or pension income or commutation of pension shall be set out in the following table:”
The succeeding Table provides a flat rate of 5 percent on pension income exceeding Rs10 million in a year. What the drafters of this proviso did not realise was that the word “solely” used in the proviso made it inapplicable to all pensioners who have a source of income other than a pension.
Now, almost all pensioners have other sources of income, most commonly interest or profits from amounts kept in profit and loss accounts maintained in banks or savings schemes.

Iran-Israel military strength comparison,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321119-iran-israel-military-strength-comparison,"ISLAMABAD: Iran has numerically greater manpower, ground forces and navy than Israel, which is superior to its adversary in terms of air power and technology — the decisive elements of war.
In 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), Israel’s military spending jumped 65 percent to $46.5 billion, marking the largest yearly rise since the six-day war in 1967. In contrast, Iran’s actual military expenditure decreased to $7.9 billion in 2024, a 10 percent reduction.
More importantly, Israel is the sixth largest arms importer in the Middle East, and the 15th largest globally. The USA was its largest supplier in 2020–24 (66 percent) followed by Germany (33 percent).
Using data from the Global Firepower official website, a comparison of the military capabilities of Israel and Iran is presented below.
Active Personnel
Iran has 610,000 active personnel including 350,000 in the army, 190,000 in the IRGC, 18,000 in the navy, 37,000 in the air force and 15,000 in air defence. Additionally, it has a reserve army of 350,000. Conscription is mandatory for Iranian men aged 18 and above, with a few exemptions.
Israel has 169,500 active personnel, including 126,000 in the army, 9,500 in the navy and 34,000 in the air force. Israel has a reserve army of 465,000. Israel mandates conscription of most young men and women above 18 years of age, with certain exemptions.
Artillery and Armed Vehicles
Iran has at least 10,513 battle tanks, 6,798 artillery guns and more than 640 armoured personnel carriers. The army also has 50 helicopters, while the IRGC has five helicopters. Israel has about 400 battle tanks, 530 artillery guns and more than 1,190 personnel carriers.
Air Power
Iran’s air force has 312 combat-capable aircraft, and the IRGC has another 23. The air force has two attack helicopters, the army has 50, and the IRGC has five. Israel has 345 combat-capable aircraft and 43 attack helicopters.
Naval Power
Iran has 17 tactical submarines, 68 patrol and coastal combatants, seven corvettes, 12 landing ships, 11 landing craft, and 18 logistics and support vehicles. Israel has five submarines and 49 patrol and coastal combatants.
Ballistic Missiles
Iran has at least 12 different types of medium- and short-range ballistic missiles in its arsenal. These range from the Tondar 69, which has a range of 150km (93 miles), to the Khorramshahr and Sejjil, which range up to 2,000km (1,243 miles). Israel has at least four different types of small, medium and intermediate-range ballistic missiles, ranging from the LORA with a range of 280km (174 miles) to the Jericho-3 with a range between 4,800km (2,983 miles) and 6,500km (4,039 miles).
Air Defense
Israel’s air defence relies on what is known as the Iron Dome system, which is believed to have intercepted most of Iran’s missiles on Tuesday night. The system is equipped with a radar that detects an incoming projectile, as well as its speed and direction. The control centre then calculates whether the projectile poses a threat to Israeli towns. The projectiles that do not pose a threat are allowed to land in empty fields. If they pose a threat, the missile-firing unit launches missiles to shoot them down. The launcher contains 20 interceptor missiles. There are 10 Iron Dome batteries scattered around Israel. Other systems intercept medium and long-range missiles. The David’s Sling intercepts missiles ranging between 40km (25 miles) and 300km (186 miles). The Arrow System intercepts missiles with a range of up to 2,400km (1,491 miles). In February, Iran deployed the short-range, low-altitude Azarakhsh, which means “thunderbolt” in Persian. It is an infrared detection system, equipped with radar and electro-optic systems to detect and intercept targets. It can be mounted on vehicles. Iran has a range of different surface-to-air missile defence systems. These include over 42 long-range Russian-manufactured S-200s, S-300s and local Bavar-373; the over 59 medium-range US MIM-23 Hawk, HQ-2J and Khordad-15; and the 279 short-range Chinese-manufactured CH-SA-4 and 9K331 Tor-M1.

With backing from IFC: Reko Diq project set to add 1% to Pak GDP annually,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321120-with-backing-from-ifc-reko-diq-project-set-to-add-1pc-to-pak-gdp-annually,"ISLAMABAD: In a major leap for Pakistan’s economy, the Reko Diq Copper Project is set to contribute nearly 1 percent to the country’s GDP annually, positioning it as one of the most significant industrial ventures in country’s history.
“Backed by latest major financing package from the International Finance Corporation (IFC)- including a US$300 million direct loan and US$400 million in blended finance - the project marks IFC’s first mining investment in Pakistan and signals renewed global confidence in the country’s economic potential,” said Dr Tauqir Shah, top aide to the prime minister.
Talking to The News, he said the IFC will also act as the lead lender and environmental and social coordinator, ensuring the project aligns with international standards and sustainable practices.
Of late the IFC and the World Bank have approved a concessional loan of $700 million for the Reko Diq project.
A media report claimed that as a result of this approval, the private sector is expected to invest $2.5 billion in the Reko Diq project. Dr Shah has played a key role in this achievement.
The PM’s adviser claimed that Reko Diq is poised to become a cornerstone of Pakistan’s economy, generating up to US$2 billion annually in gross value added - equivalent to roughly 1 percent of the country’s GDP based on 2024 figures. The project will also provide vital foreign currency earnings, as 100 percent of revenues will be in foreign exchange.
Spearheaded by Reko Diq Mining Company (Private) Limited (RDMC), the venture is expected to become one of the world’s largest copper mines, unlocking massive economic, social, and environmental potential for the country.
Owned by Canada’s Barrick Gold Corporation (50 percent), along with Pakistani stakeholders including three state-owned enterprises (25 percent) and the government of Balochistan (25 percent), the Reko Diq mine boasts one of the largest untapped copper reserves on the planet. “With a projected mine life of 40 years, the operation is set to yield 200,000–250,000 tons of copper annually - at a time when global demand for copper is soaring, fueled by the clean energy transition and infrastructure growth, ” informed Dr Shah.
He added that at the peak of construction, the project is expected to create up to 10,000 jobs, prioritising local Baloch workers across skill levels. During its operational phase, the mine will support around 3,000 direct jobs and thousands more through indirect and supply chain employment. Importantly, RDMC is committed to inclusive hiring, with targeted programmes to enhance female participation in the workforce. Already, RDMC has invested US$2.5 million into local infrastructure, education, health services, clean water initiatives, and food security.
The company has pledged to contribute 1 percent of construction costs and 0.4 percent of annual revenue to community-led development throughout the mine’s lifespan.
Meanwhile, official sources said that with supporting infrastructure in power, water, and transport under development, Reko Diq could pave the way for further mineral exploration and broader regional investment.
As one of the most ambitious mining projects ever undertaken in Pakistan, Reko Diq is poised to reshape Balochistan’s economic future. With international backing, adherence to environmental and social safeguards, and deep community engagement, the project could serve as a blueprint for responsible resource development across the country, explained the sources.
There is a challenge for Pakistan Railways to upgrade railroads from Reko Diq to Karachi and build a new railway route from Reko Diq to Gwadar port. Meanwhile a senior official source lamented, “Considering that this huge reservoir of global proportions was always there - and almost on the surface - it is a sad commentary on governance and decision making of successive governments who failed to use this natural resource for welfare of people and the country.” He added, “This is an epic story, of whimsical decision making, incompetence and misplaced judicial activism, which wasted nation’s three to four decades.”

Military confrontation no solution to Kashmir dispute or terrorism: Bilawal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321121-military-confrontation-no-solution-to-kashmir-dispute-or-terrorism-bilawal,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and high-level parliamentary delegation called on the international community Friday to engage with India and emphasise that military confrontation is not a solution to the Kashmir dispute or terrorism, stressing that dialogue is the only way forward.
“We appeal to European Union to play its role for peace in our region,” he said in a press talk with media in Brussels after meeting with European External Action Service (EEAS).
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that US President Donald Trump once again said that he was ready to mediate and help on Kashmir and the progress in the United Nations is also before everyone. “And a positive response has also come from the European Union and United Kingdom,” he said adding that Pakistan is talking about the peace, the US is also talking about the peace but the India is only talking about the war and hope that India will change its position sooner or later.
In a reply to a question of Israel attack on Iran, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said, “We condemn Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran. The way Israel had earlier attacked its neighbours and perpetrated genocide in Palestine and now Israel brings the war in our region and we condemn Israel. We demand that the war should stop and the world should play its role, we do not want that this war should continue,” he said.
While in a strategic policy briefing and roundtable discussion with prominent Belgian and EU-based think tanks, academics, and policy experts in Brussels PPP chairman and high-level parliamentary delegation warned against weaponization of water as a dangerous new frontier in regional contestation.
The parliamentary delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari convened the event, titled “South Asia’s Security Landscape and the Imperative for Multilateral Engagement”, and it formed a key part of the delegation’s broader engagement to strengthen dialogue on critical regional and global developments. In his keynote address, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari presented a comprehensive assessment of the evolving geopolitical dynamics in South Asia and also warned against the weaponization of water as a dangerous new frontier in regional contestation and strongly criticised India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a cornerstone of transboundary water cooperation in South Asia.
He cautioned that such unilateral moves threaten ecosystems, livelihoods, and set a perilous precedent in an era already defined by climate stress and resource scarcity.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari expressed deep concern over India’s increasing departure from multilateralism and its growing tilt towards unilateralism, manifested through the violation of bilateral agreements, disregard for international law, and aggressive military posturing.
He noted that India’s recent actions, including unprovoked strikes on civilian targets and attempts to redefine regional norms without consultation or accountability, pose serious risks to regional peace and stability.
Throughout the discussion, the delegation reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to peace, dialogue, and regional stability.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari underlined Pakistan’s policy of restraint in the face of repeated provocations, reaffirming that Pakistan had no interest in conflict and remains committed to resolving all outstanding disputes, including Jammu and Kashmir, through peaceful means and in accordance with the UN Charter and Security Council resolutions.
He emphasised that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be resolved in line with United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Bilawal criticised India’s “new abnormal” policy of blaming Pakistan for any terrorist attack in India or Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir without evidence, leading to immediate threats of war. He recalled that Pakistan had proposed an impartial international investigation into the recent Pahalgam incident, but India rejected the offer.
Bilawal stated that India had failed to provide evidence linking Pakistan to the incident. “To this day, India hasn’t revealed the identities of the attackers or how they crossed the heavily militarised border,” he said, accusing India of violating Pakistan’s sovereignty with its recent airstrikes.
Bilawal urged Europe and the global community to intervene before tensions spiral out of control, warning that inaction could lead to another war between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Discussions also covered climate resilience, the need for equitable global governance, migration, youth engagement, and strengthening Pakistan-EU institutional partnerships.
The policy roundtable was part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to deepen diplomatic and intellectual engagement with the European policy community and to present its narrative on key issues of regional and global importance.
While Pakistani delegation held a significant meeting with Olaf Skoog, Deputy Secretary General for Political Affairs at the European External Action Service (EEAS).
During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on a range of issues, with particular focus on the peace and security situation in South Asia.
PPP chairman apprised the European Union leadership of the escalating threats to regional stability arising from India’s increasingly aggressive posture.
He emphasised Pakistan’s commitment to peace, underscoring the country’s consistent stance in favour of resolving all disputes through dialogue and diplomacy.
Highlighting a growing concern, Bhutto Zardari pointed to India’s alleged attempts to weaponize water resources, calling it a violation of international humanitarian norms and global legal standards.
He urged the international community to press India to uphold international law and refrain from unilateral actions that jeopardize regional peace.
“Pakistan desires peaceful coexistence,” he stated, “but India’s belligerence, particularly in manipulating shared water resources, is a dangerous provocation that must not be ignored.”
Bilawal also emphasised the importance of the European Union as a key pillar of the rules-based international order, expressing hope that the EU would play an active role in promoting peace and legal norms in South Asia. “The EU has a moral and strategic responsibility to support efforts for peace and uphold international laws across all regions,” he said.
Meanwhile, the European Union Special Envoy for Climate and Environmental Diplomacy, Anthony Agotha, called on PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, in Brussels.
The meeting took place in the context of the ongoing visit of the high-level parliamentary delegation of Pakistan to the European Union.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari welcomed the special envoy’s engagement and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to climate justice, inclusive environmental cooperation, and multilateralism.
Drawing attention to the growing convergence between regional stability and climate security, he expressed serious concern over India’s unilateral decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance.
He cautioned that such actions constitute a reckless assault on longstanding international agreements and set a dangerous precedent in the politicisation of natural resources, particularly in a climate stressed and densely populated region like South Asia.
PPP chairman briefed the special envoy on Pakistan’s acute climate vulnerability, noting that despite contributing less than one percent to global greenhouse gas emissions, Pakistan remains among the top ten countries most affected by climate induced disasters.
He recalled the devastation caused by the 2022 floods and underscored the urgent need for scaled up adaptation financing to build resilience among the most vulnerable communities.
The two sides also exchanged views on advancing Pakistan-EU green cooperation.
PPP chairman outlined Pakistan’s interest in forging deeper partnerships with the European Union on green technology transfer, including innovation in agriculture, water management, and renewable energy.
He emphasised that climate adaptation must go hand in hand with a sustainable energy transition and welcomed potential European collaboration in scaling up Pakistan’s renewable energy capacity, particularly solar and wind.
In addition, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari highlighted Pakistan’s efforts towards developing resilient infrastructure and nature based solutions to mitigate future climate shocks.
He stressed the importance of mobilising long-term investment in sustainable development while ensuring that equity and inclusion remain at the core of global climate responses.
The PPP chairman appreciated the European Union’s continued support to Pakistan in the aftermath of the 2022 floods and expressed the hope that both sides would continue to work together to build a climate-resilient and sustainable future.
The meeting reaffirmed the shared understanding that environmental challenges must not be politicised and that climate cooperation should be guided by principles of fairness, responsibility, and solidarity.

Exaggerated figures: KP to face over Rs500bn shortfall in federal receipts,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321122-exaggerated-figures-kp-to-face-over-rs500bn-shortfall-in-federal-receipts,"PESHAWAR: The budget figures of receipts presented by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government appear to be exaggerated, revealing a consistent gap of over Rs500 billion between projected and actual transfers from the federal government.
These receipts include KP’s share in federal taxes, net hydel profit (NHP), and grants for the merged tribal districts. Despite repeated promises, Islamabad has fallen short of delivering the committed funds, which has undermined KP’s financial planning and delayed development.
The year-wise data shows a growing trend of shortfalls in federal transfers.
The official documents revealed that in 2021–22, the province was allocated Rs1,118 billion but received only Rs1,028 billion — a shortfall of Rs90 billion. In 2022–23, KP was promised Rs1,332 billion but received Rs1,185 billion, resulting in a Rs147 billion shortfall.
Similarly, in 2023–24, out of an allocated Rs1,457 billion, the province received only Rs1,129 billion — a Rs328 billion gap. In the ongoing 2024–25 fiscal year, KP has so far received Rs1,273 billion against an allocation of Rs1,754 billion, resulting in a shortfall of Rs481 billion.
For 2025–26, the government has projected a federal transfer of Rs21802 billion, but officials doubt whether the actual receipts will match the projection, given past performance.
In addition to federal transfers, KP expects to generate Rs129 billion from provincial revenues, including taxes and fees. It also plans to secure Rs177.2 billion through foreign assistance, comprising Rs165.5 billion in loans and Rs11.6 billion in grants. The combined total receipts projected for 2025–26 from all three major sources — federal (Rs1802 billion), provincial (Rs129 billion), and foreign assistance (Rs177.2 billion) — amount to Rs2119 billion.
Officials warn that overreliance on federal transfers, without ensuring actual disbursement, continues to hurt KP’s development agenda. Delays in promised funds have already impacted key services and development schemes, especially in the merged tribal districts.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has repeatedly called on the federal government to ensure timely, transparent, and complete payment of all constitutionally mandated transfers.

PM orders review of medicine prices amid public outcry,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321094-pm-orders-review-of-medicine-prices-amid-public-outcry,"ISLAMABAD: Alarmed by soaring drug prices and growing public outrage over unaffordable medicines, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) to get the policy of medicine price deregulation independently reviewed to assess its impact on public affordability, officials confirmed on Friday.
Acting swiftly on the prime minister’s instructions, the Drap has approached the World Health Organization (WHO) country office in Islamabad to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the policy which was introduced during the 2024 tenure of the caretaker government led by Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar.
The WHO has been formally asked to examine the consequences of the deregulated pricing regime on patient access and recommend corrective measures.
“There is a growing unease among patients and healthcare providers about the unchecked rise in medicine prices,” a senior health official told The News. “The prime minister wants a neutral, technical review of the deregulation framework and its real-world consequences.”
Federal Minister for Health Mustafa Kamal and Minister of State for Health Malik Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath have also taken notice of the crisis and summoned a detailed report from the Drap on how much prices of non-essential medicines have increased over the past year, and what justifications pharmaceutical companies have offered for these hikes. “If a person’s monthly medicine cost has jumped from Rs800 to Rs2,200 or even Rs2,500, what is the justification for that?” questioned Dr Mukhtar while speaking to The News. “We’ve asked the Drap CEO to compile this data and explain what’s driving these increases.”
The deregulation policy was initially framed to tackle chronic shortages of essential medicines and attract multinational firms by giving them flexibility to adjust prices according to inflation and market forces. However, health officials, legislators and civil society groups argue that the policy has gone on unchecked, with some pharmaceutical firms hiking prices on a monthly or even weekly basis.
Industry data backs these concerns. According to IQVIA, Pakistan’s pharmaceutical market surpassed Rs1.049 trillion in sales by March 2025 	 a staggering 20.62 per cent growth in rupee terms. However, unit sales rose by just 3.63 per cent, confirming that growth has been driven almost entirely by price increases rather than increased medicine consumption. Nearly 69 per cent of the market growth was due to pricing changes alone. National firms sold 2.91 billion units, showing a modest growth of 4.98 per cent, while multinational companies saw a decline in volume but a sharp rise in sales value, underscoring how price hikes, not demand, drove revenue.
Even basic over-the-counter drugs like paracetamol have seen price instability.
The WHO’s review is expected to evaluate both economic and health outcomes of deregulated pricing.  A Drap official acknowledged the urgency of the matter and said the regulator was “fully cooperating” with the WHO to ensure a comprehensive and independent review. “The market cannot be left completely unregulated, especially for something as vital as medicine. This review will help us set a course towards pricing that’s both fair and sustainable.”
While pharmaceutical companies argue that deregulation is needed to sustain supply chains and hedge against inflation, federal policymakers now face mounting pressure to rein in the free-floating prices and ensure that life-saving medicines don’t become a luxury only the affluent can afford.

Pakistan to suffer if govt remains in power: Achakzai,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321095-pakistan-to-suffer-if-govt-remains-in-power-achakzai,"QUETTA: Chairman of the Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, has said that the Constitution is being continuously violated in the country, the people’s mandate has been stolen, and if the current government remains in power, Pakistan will suffer.
He expressed these views while addressing a press conference at the Quetta Press Club on Friday.
Achakzai said that the dire situation facing our region — and Pakistan in particular — is the result of the failures and weaknesses of both regional powers and our own rulers, despite the country’s abundant natural and mineral resources. Regretting the lack of foresight, he said he had been warning for years that Pakistan was once again becoming a battleground for international proxy wars, but sadly, no one paid heed.
“Pakistan has been mired in crises since its creation, and the current circumstances are a test of our collective wisdom and insight,” Achakzai added.
Referring to the Middle East, he said that developments in Iran and across the region are a warning sign for Pakistan. “We should not forget the examples of Libya and Iraq. Allegations are now being leveled against us too — it’s time to open our eyes,” he cautioned.
Achakzai said that not only were people initially denied the right to frame a constitution, but even after one was created, it was never allowed to function properly.
Quoting a recent World Bank report, he noted that more than 45 percent of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line while the country remains burdened with billions of dollars in debt. He said the entire national budget is consumed by defense expenditures and debt servicing, the judiciary has become ineffective, and the media is in chains.
He said the ruling elite indulges in luxuries while ordinary people struggle to put food on the table. “Public servants and public office holders, whose assets exceed their known sources of income, should have those assets confiscated to repay national debts,” he proposed.
Achakzai claimed the people’s mandate was forcibly snatched and that the current government was formed through money and might. “Everyone knows how this government came into being — it has no moral legitimacy,” he said.
He asserted that every citizen has the right to meet the founder chairman of PTI freely. Unfortunately, an officer sitting in jail is even denying Khan’s family members and elected representatives the right to visit him — a blatant violation of basic human and legal rights.
He reminded the public that every Member of Parliament has the right to visit prisons, yet they are being denied access even to their own leader.
Reiterating his earlier call, Achakzai urged that after Eid, protest demonstrations should be held every Friday in front of mosques to demand the release of Imran Khan and other political prisoners and to end this “illegitimate government.”
He said the Movement for the Protection of the Constitution of Pakistan represents those who truly love this country and called for a broad-based national alliance to save the nation. “This government must resign so that a national unity government can be formed,” he urged.
Achakzai strongly condemned the government’s restrictions on border trade by ordinary citizens and reminded the authorities that it is the state’s duty to ensure livelihoods and to protect the lives and property of its citizens — not to block their sources of income.

Karimabad showcases women revolution,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321101-karimabad-showcases-women-revolution,"KARIMABAD, Pakistan: In a sawdust-filled workshop nestled in the Karakoram Mountains, a team of women carpenters chisel away at cabinets -- and forge an unlikely career for themselves in Pakistan.
Women make up just a fraction of Pakistan's formal workforce. But in a collection of villages sprinkled along the old Silk Road between China and Afghanistan, a group of women-led businesses is defying expectations.
""We have 22 employees and have trained around 100 women,"" said Bibi Amina, who launched her carpentry workshop in 2008 at the age of 30.
Hunza Valley's population of around 50,000, spread across mountains abounding with apricot, cherry, walnut and mulberry orchards, follow the Ismaili branch of Shiite Islam.
Ismailis are led by the Aga Khan, a hereditary position held by a family with Pakistani roots now living in Europe.
The family opened a girls' school in Hunza in 1946, kickstarting an educational investment that pushed the valley's literacy rate to 97 percent for both men and women. That rate far outstrips the country average of around 68 percent for men and 52.8 percent for women. As a result, attitudes have shifted, and women like Amina are taking expanded roles.
""People thought women were there to wash dishes and do laundry,"" Amina said of the generation before her.
Trained by the Aga Khan Foundation to help renovate the ancient Altit Fort, Amina later used her skills to start her own business. Her carpenters are currently at work on a commission from a luxury hotel.
Only 23 percent of the women in Pakistan were officially part of the labour force as of 2024, according to data from the World Bank.
In rural areas, women rarely take on formal employment but often toil in the fields to support the family's farming income.
In a Gallup poll published last year, a third of women respondents said their father or husband forbade them from taking a job, while 43.5 percent said they had given up work to devote themselves to domestic tasks.
Cafe owner Lal Shehzadi spearheaded women's restaurant entrepreneurship in Hunza.
She opened her cafe at the top of a winding high street to supplement her husband's small army pension.
Sixteen years later, her simple set-up overlooking the valley has become a popular night-time tourist attraction. She serves visitors traditional cuisine, including yak meat, apricot oil and rich mountain cheese.
""At the start, I used to work alone,"" she said. ""Now, 11 people work here and most of them are women. And my children are also working here.""
Following in Shehzadi's footsteps, Safina quit her job to start her own restaurant around a decade ago.
""No one wanted to help me,"" she said. Eventually, she convinced family members to sell two cows and a few goats for the money she needed to launch her business.
Now, she earns the equivalent of around $170 a month, more than 15 times her previous income.
The socio-economic progress of women in Hunza compared to other rural areas of Pakistan has been driven by three factors, according to Sultan Madan, the head of the Karakoram Area Development Organisation and a local historian.
""The main reason is the very high literacy rate,"" he told AFP, largely crediting the Aga Khan Foundation for funding training programmes for women.
""Secondly, agriculture was the backbone of the economy in the region, but in Hunza the landholding was meagre and that was why women had to work in other sectors.""
Women's increased economic participation has spilled into other areas of life, like sports fields.
""Every village in the valley has a women's soccer team: Gojal, Gulmit, Passu, Khyber, Shimsal,"" said Nadia Shams, 17.
On a synthetic pitch, she trains with her teammates in jogging pants or shorts, forbidden elsewhere by Pakistan's dress code.
Here, one name is on everyone's lips: Malika-e-Noor, the former vice-captain of the national team who scored the winning penalty against the Maldives in the 2010 South Asian Women's Football Championship.
Fahima Qayyum was six years old when she witnessed the killer kick.
Today, after several international matches, she is recruiting the next generation.
""As a girl, I stress to others the importance of playing, as sport is very good for health,"" she told AFP.  ""If they play well, they can also get scholarships.""

IHC Bar president tells Insaf lawyers: Lawyers must not protest against legislation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321102-ihc-bar-president-tells-insaf-lawyers-lawyers-must-not-protest-against-legislation,"ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court Bar Association President Syed Wajid Ali Shah Gilani said Friday 26th Amendment was passed by the Parliament.
In a three-page response to the letter of Ali Bukhari, President of Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) Islamabad, Wajid Ali wrote lawyers were not legislators.
“Our mandate is to defend the constitutional structure, not to protest against legislation”, he explained.
He said main role of lawyers was to uphold Constitution in which the amendment had been approved by the legislators through voting.
He reminded Bukhari he had voted for him when he was a candidate for National Assembly in last general elections. “I must express my serious reservations about your letter”, he said.
Islamabad High Court Bar President said Insaf Lawyers Forum was not a registered body, nor a recognised organisation under Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973.
The rules and regulations of Islamabad Bar Council strictly prohibit any such group from influencing the Bar Association elections, he added.
“The basis of your letter and its claim to represent the ‘consciousness of the legal community’ is questionable”, Wajid Ali told Bukhari.

"To safeguard GSP Plus status: Pakistan steps up hazardous waste, chemical safety action",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321103-to-safeguard-gsp-plus-status-pakistan-steps-up-hazardous-waste-chemical-safety-action,"LAHORE: Pakistan is intensifying efforts to strengthen chemical safety and hazardous waste management as part of its strategy to safeguard preferential trade access to European markets under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP Plus), officials said on Friday.
A national training workshop, jointly organised by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination (MoCC&EC) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), brought together senior government officials, provincial regulators, industry leaders, and environmental experts to chart a path towards compliance with key multilateral environmental agreements.
It focused on aligning Pakistan’s practices with the Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm, and Minamata Conventions.
A significant portion of the training was dedicated to building capacity on the GHS framework, which promotes safer handling and use of chemicals in industrial processes through improved classification and labelling.
Pakistan’s export-driven economy relies heavily on preferential access to European Union markets.
However, its GSP Plus status is contingent upon compliance with 27 international conventions, including those governing hazardous waste and chemical management.
Any shortcomings in meeting these commitments risk undermining both environmental safeguards and critical trade benefits.
Participants reviewed the National Hazardous Waste Management Policy (2022), the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) for chemical classification and labelling, and enforcement mechanisms under provincial environmental frameworks.
Industry representatives explored practical approaches to waste minimisation, adoption of safer alternatives, and the phasing out of hazardous substances.
“This workshop represents a turning point in Pakistan’s efforts to modernise its chemical management practices,” said Ms Nazia Zaib Ali, Joint Secretary (International Cooperation) at MoCC&EC. In a key development, Zakya Rubab, National Project Coordinator at MoCC, announced the upcoming launch of Pakistan’s first online portal for obtaining No Objection Certificates  for the import of chemicals under the Basel Convention.

Rs163bn allocated for law and order after 26pc increase,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321050-rs163bn-allocated-for-law-and-order-after-26pc-increase,"Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday announced a budget of Rs163 billion for the provincial law and order, which shows a 26 per cent increase in comparison to the last year’s outlay of Rs125 billion.
The CM informed the Sindh Assembly that his government had increased the law and order budget from Rs125 billion to Rs163 billion in order to enable workforce expansion, technology adoption, operational capability and on-ground presence.
Shah said the law and order situation in Karachi, which was once synonymous with street crime, had witnessed measurable improvements as vehicular snatchings and theft had gone down from 256 cases daily to 176 cases, and violent robberies had reduced to just 1 incident per day. The detection rate for street crime had risen to 81 per cent, he maintained.
He added that these numbers were not mere statistics as they signified safer roads and revitalised public confidence. In the Kutcha region of Sindh, the CM said, 31 hardened criminals had been neutralised, 400 dacoits arrested and 775 honey trap abduction cases prevented.
He also discussed the government’s measures against the narcotics mafia stating that the aggressive stance against narcotics yielded significant results in 2024-25 as more than 18,000 drug-related cases were registered, over 21,700 arrests made, 83 FIRs lodged for drug peddling on campuses, and 33 online drug dealers arrested.
He said arresting criminals involved in narcotics trade was tantamount to defending the future of our youth. Shah said the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) made 42 strategic arrests. He added that the CTD Fusion Centre had been made operational and due to modernisation of technology, the Sindh Smart Surveillance System (S-4) now operated at 42 toll plazas with AI-powered cameras.
He said the coverage of the Highway Patrol Pilot Project would be soon expanded to 2,153 kilometres with 1,900 officers and 92 patrol vehicles. He also informed the House that the Sindh government was making traffic reforms through faceless e-Ticketing with 550 cameras that will reach 1,300 by December 2025, GPS tracking, mandatory driver education, issuance of over 100,000 e-driving licences in three months, and introduction of a de-merit point system for repeat offenders.
Shah said the government had also been working on modernising the investigations department and strengthening justice delivery. He said 50 Crime Scene Units had been deployed, and over 215 investigation officers trained in modern forensics. The Police Station Record Management System (PSRMS) was now linked to courts and labs and experience in investigation was now a criterion for promotions, he added.
Sharing steps taken by the government for police welfare, the CM said recruitment of over 25,000 cops was under way or completed, and 8,000 officers were promoted in the outgoing year. He also discussed the health insurance scheme for over 15,000 staff with Rs496 billion support.
He said the Shaheed packages now ranged from Rs23.5 million to Rs70 million and Rs1 billion had already been disbursed as compensation. He said 31 model police stations had been established and 50 more were in the pipeline, Rs3.74 billion had been devolved directly to police stations, and SHOs and SIOs had been designated as drawing and disbursing officers for localised decision-making, he added.
He maintained that police reforms that were being currently witnessed were a fundamental transformation that had made the streets safer, the forces more capable, and the communities more secure.

"JI to agitate against insufficient funds for Karachi in federal, provincial budgets",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321051-ji-to-agitate-against-insufficient-funds-for-karachi-in-federal-provincial-budgets,"The Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) has announced that it will launch an agitation drive against the federal and provincial governments neglecting Karachi in their respective budgets. This was decided at a high level meeting of the party chaired by Karachi JI Emir Monem Zafar Khan on Friday.
The meeting condemned the coalition government in the Centre and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government in Sindh for not allocating enough funds for the development of the megalopolis.
Khan said that unfortunately Karachi was taken for granted and just as an opportunity to mint money. He highlighted that the city contributed to exports of the country by 54 per cent, provided 67 per cent revenue for the national exchequer and 95 per cent budget for the Sindh province, but it was badly deprived of its due share in resources.
He lamented that the ruling parties had nothing to do with Karachi and its residents. He said that despite the city's significant contributions to the economy, its residents continued to face multiple crises.
The JI leader remarked that a mafia in the name of K-Electric had been imposed on the city and the electricity tariff for the city was Rs40 per unit compared to Rs35 for the rest of the country. Several areas of Karachi were facing the worst kind of loadshedding and overcharging, he stated.
Talking about the never-ending water crises in the city, he said there was no water to supply in the lines but the tanker mafia never faced any such shortage. He said the JI would not left the people of Karachi at the mercy of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, PPP, Muttahida Qaumi Movement and other ruling parties.

He said Pakistan had always advocated the option of holding talks to resolve regional and international disputes peacefully and cordially.  Shah further said that Israeli attacks on Iran could jeopardise the peace and stability of the entire region.
He appealed to the United Nations and the concerned international community to take cognisance of the deteriorating regional situation.  He mentioned that the Sindh government shared the grief of the suffering and aggrieved people of Iran. Shah said the concerned international community should play an effective role for long-lasting peace in the region.
The members of the Sindh cabinet were of the consensus view that Israeli attacks had violated international laws and accords which stood for the protection of human rights and peace at the global level.

"IGP wants action to end kidnappings for ransom, highway robberies",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321053-igp-wants-action-to-end-kidnappings-for-ransom-highway-robberies,"Sindh police Chief Ghulam Nabi Memon on Friday chaired a meeting at the Central Police Office in Karachi, where he took a review of the police performance in maintaining law and order and preventing crime in the province.
Officials said the meeting especially discussed efforts to solve kidnapping for ransom cases, prevent highway robberies, and arrest absconding and wanted suspects, besides future strategies and action plans.
Range and divisional DIGs briefed the meeting about kidnapping for ransom cases in their respective districts, prevention of highway robberies, arrest of absconding and wanted suspects.
IGP Memon praised the DIGs of West, Sukkur and Larkana for their satisfactory performance in dealing with kidnapping for ransom cases and said, “It is my wish and determination that the complaints of kidnapping for ransom should be completely eradicated from the province.”
Addressing the police officers present in the meeting, he said they have worked hard to protect hundreds of citizens from kidnapping for ransom and honey traps. He said they have worked hard to control crimes like honey traps, which have become an industry.
The Sindh police chief further said habitual, absconding and wanted suspects do not hesitate to commit serious crimes like murder whenever they get the opportunity. He said the Sindh Police Highway Patrol has been established to ensure safe travel on all main highways and crossings of the province. He said whenever the police, with their hard work and dedication, address the root cause of this crime, this crime resurfaces.
IGP Memon said complaints of robbery have come to notice in traffic jams caused by protests and sit-ins, for which the relevant districts are always ready and alert. In addition, the data of the accused and documents of the accused should be registered in PSRMS, while steps should be taken to parade the arrested accused and get their identity cards blocked by courts.
He gave instructions to ensure the installation of CCTV cameras at police stations and the deployment of polite staff, while all DIGs should also personally monitor unnecessary appointments and deployments of police station staff.
The meeting was attended by the DIGs of Admin Karachi, T&T, crime and investigations, establishment, finance, range and divisional DIGs and district SSPs, as well as officers of the investigation department.

"SHC grants GDA leaders protective bail in arson, terrorism cases",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321054-shc-grants-gda-leaders-protective-bail-in-arson-terrorism-cases,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday granted protective bail to Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) leaders and former members of the National and provincial assemblies Ghulam Murtaza Khan Jatoi and his brother Masroor Khan Jatoi in a case pertaining to arson, attempt to murder, police encounter and terrorism.
The applicants had approached the SHC for obtaining protective bail in three terrorism-related cases registered in the Moro area. Their counsel Omer Soomro and Haq Nawaz Talpur submitted that they were politicians and had nothing to do with criminal activities. They submitted that the ruling political party was bent upon to arrest the applicants in false and fabricated cases and they were booked in three terrorism-related cases due to political victimisation.
The counsel submitted that the applicants feared their arrest due to mala fide intentions of the government, which wanted to harass and humiliate them. They submitted that police had registered FIRs against the petitioners in a clear violation of the court orders and a private complainant of the case had failed to provide sufficient evidence to connect the applicants in the cases.
The counsel added that the brothers had been implicated in the cases on the basis of a confessional statement of co-accused wherein, in the original FIR, they had not been nominated as accused.
They submitted that numerous FIRs had been registered in respect of an incident in Moro, whereas the high court had already granted protective bail to Murtaza and Masroor in identical cases.
The counsel submitted that the applicants were willing to surrender before the trial court and requested the high court to grant protective bail to them so that they could appear before the trial court and face the trial court proceedings.
A division bench of the SHC headed by Acting Chief Justice Mohammad Junaid Ghaffar, without touching the merits of the cases, granted protective bail to the applicants against a surety of Rs25,000 each and directed them to appear before the trial court within two weeks.

Pakistan will not be allowed to become part of any proxy: Fazl,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321055-pakistan-will-not-be-allowed-to-become-part-of-any-proxy-fazl,"Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said on Friday that the United States has no right to object to the Pakistan-China friendship and Pakistan will not be allowed to become part of any proxy.
Talking to journalists at the residence of Federal Minister for Board of Investment Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh in Karachi, he said that we are not independent economically, politically and from defence point of view and are still in the hands of international institutions.
He said that we have to solve our own problems and if any foreign country wants to invest in the country, it should make agreements with Pakistan according to international principles. He said that Islam has given us an integrated economic system.
The JUI-F chief said that peace and prosperity are essential for the development of the country while the protection of human rights is a matter of life and property. He said that once we used to approve tax-free budgets and this was a sign of prosperity. He said that now a tax-rich budget is presented and rulers feel proud of presenting such a budget.
He asked what the inflation rate was 20 years ago and what the inflation rate is now. He also asked what the inflation rate was 30 years ago and what the GDP rate is now. We should compare it with the GDP of all neighbouring countries, he said.
He said the ruling class must abandon its focus on protecting it s interests. He said accountability laws seem as if all of the businessmen are guilty. He said that until the business community is protected, they will not invest in Pakistan and they will invest their capital abroad.
The JUI-F chief said countries are making progress where foreign investment is made but we are falling toward poverty. He said the country cannot progress until the colonial system is abolished as we are economically trapped in the hands of the global financial system and legislation is made at the will of international financial institutions.
He said that our economic decisions are made by the IMF and if we do not follow their instructions, aid is stopped. Maulana Fazl said the US is becoming the owner of our mineral reserves, and if any foreign country wants to invest, it should make agreements with Pakistan according to international principles.
Federal Minister Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh said Maulana Fazl has played an important role in important movements, including the PDM, and he is an admirer of his family. He said the business community has a vital role in the development of the country's economy and they should come to the parliament to highlight their issues. He said China has brought its people out of poverty and we have to work hard and bring our people out of poverty in the country. He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is working for the development of the country and inflation is on the decline while our economic indicators are becoming positive.

"Man who allegedly killed wife, son dies in police custody",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321056-man-who-allegedly-killed-wife-son-dies-in-police-custody,"A man who allegedly murdered his wife and son before attempting to take his own life died in police custody on Friday.
The incident occurred on June 4 in Surjani Town’s Yousuf Goth near Kareemi Chowrangi, where 45-year-old Faisal, son of Sagheeruddin, reportedly killed his 35-year-old wife Sana by slitting her throat and poisoned their 10-year-old son Ali.
After the murders, Faisal tried to commit suicide by cutting his own throat and was critically injured. Faisal was initially taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi for treatment. However, according to Surjani SHO Ali Shah, the hospital later discharged him, stating the patient was stable and the bed had been allocated to another patient.
Due to Faisal’s critical condition and medical needs, the investigating officer was advised by the SHO to take him to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH) and had him referred to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), as proper care — particularly oxygen support through his tracheal tube — could not be provided in a police lockup. However, the ASH reportedly refused to admit Faisal or issue a referral to the JPMC.
The officer then brought Faisal back to the police station. According to SHO, his family also declined to admit him to a private hospital. Faisal’s condition deteriorated during the night, and he died in custody between Thursday and Friday. Sana was the mother of three children.
The two surviving daughters, Aymal and Bareera, were unharmed and were taken into protective custody by neighbours before being handed over to their paternal uncle. The police was continuing their investigation into the case, including the circumstances surrounding Faisal’s death in custody.

Commissioner launches digital fine payment system,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321058-commissioner-launches-digital-fine-payment-system,"Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi on Friday introduced a digital fine payment system that allowed violators of price control regulations to conveniently pay penalties through mobile banking platforms, using invoices generated by 1-Link.
He announced the initiative while chairing a meeting at the Commissioner’s Office. The new system aims to streamline the fine payment process for the public while enabling the government to track and verify payments in real time.
This marked the first time the Government of Sindh had partnered with 1-Link to collect fines under the Prevention of Profiteering and Hoarding Act, 2005. With the launch of this initiative, the Commissioner's Office had officially ended manual cash collection in Karachi.
Previously, magistrates faced challenges in collecting fines from small shopkeepers and mobile vegetable vendors, many of whom evaded payment. The new digital system ensures a more transparent, efficient, and accountable process for fine recovery.
Naqvi presided over the meeting that marked the launch of the digital partnership. Senior officials from 1-Link (Pvt) Ltd and the Finance Department participated in the event. Notable attendees included 1-Link CEO Najib Agrewala, CEO Azeemullah Khan, Secretary and Chief Strategy Officer Syed Salman Hasan, and Head of Business Umair Shahid. Representing the Finance Department was Head of the Debit Unit, Kashif, while Additional Commissioner-I Ghulam Mehdi Shah and Assistant Commissioner Headquarters Rabia Syed represented the Commissioner Office.
The initiative was a significant step toward modernising enforcement mechanisms and improving governance through technology-driven solutions.

Mugger gets seven years in prison for snatching mobile phone from woman,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321059-mugger-gets-seven-years-in-prison-for-snatching-mobile-phone-from-woman,"A sessions court has sentenced a mugger to seven-year imprisonment in a robbery case. Zubair was found guilty of robbing a woman of her mobile phone at gunpoint within the remits of the Korangi Industrial Area police station in 2023.
Additional Sessions Judge (East) Shahid Ali Memon observed that the prosecution succeeded in establishing the case against the accused by producing cogent, strong and coherent oral as well as documentary evidence and that the defense could not shatter it.
He sentenced the convict to seven years in prison for offence punishable under Section 397 (robbery or dacoity, with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code. ""I must express my thoughts that nowadays, the street crimes are on high peak and public at large could not feel secure themselves at the hands of merciless muggers,"" the judge said.
""Thus under such circumstances, the release of accused based on minor or slightest contradictions would not be better for the society. Thus, the criminals who have created terror among the society and due to such kind of crimes, many innocents have even lost their lives and valuable belongings.""
According to the prosecution, on November 9, 2023, the accused along with his accomplice had snatched a mobile phone from Benisha Gul, the complainant of the case, at gunpoint near Chapra Hotel, Sector 6/B, Mehran Town, Karachi and sped away.
It said that Zubair was arrested in an injured condition by Landhi police and a snatched phone was recovered from his possession. He disclosed that he along with his accomplice Waqas had robbed a woman and later met an accident due to high speed, resulting in the death of his accomplice.
The accused in his statement denied the prosecution case, stating that it was fabricated one lodged by the police to show their efficiency. He said nothing was recovered from him but the police had foisted the alleged robbed mobile phone upon him.

Tax collection approach termed ‘highly flawed’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321008-tax-collection-approach-termed-highly-flawed,"LAHORE:Tax experts, business tycoons, policymakers and economists in a conference here termed tax collection approach highly flawed which needs revision. “Uraan Pakistan’s pilots are businessmen, and they should be provided business-friendly environment. Until local investors are satisfied, foreign investment will not come. Federal budget 2025-26 is not a business-friendly budget”.
“National Budget Conference” was organised here jointly by Institute of Cost & Management Accountants (ICMAP) and Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman Memorial Society.  In his address, Ghulam Mustafa Qazi, President of ICMAP International, said, “In this conference, we will review the budget to see whether the tax collection targets set are achievable, and what obstacles are in the way in meeting them. Government representatives present here will consider the recommendations from this conference”.
Adil Amin, Director of Telco Integrators, said changes have turned direct tax laws into draconian laws. “A culture of oppression has developed in our country where raising one’s head is not tolerated”, he stated.
He said the definition of fraud has been broadened, while Inland Revenue officers given excessive powers. Anyone who does not issue a sales tax invoice will be categorised as fraudster, he commented, adding Inland Revenue officers can detain a businessman even on suspicion.
“In such a situation business environment will become very tough for business community”, he observed. He commented, “A man running a business worth 50 billion may have CFOs, but he can be detained on mere suspicion”. Granting such powers is dangerous, he said.
Adil Amin said commissioners have been given authority for tax registration. Sales tax registration has been made mandatory for the lower-middle class. Some aspects of tax fraud, he said, are very alarming - fictitious documents and irregularities in returns have also been included. “Those who do not deposit withholding tax within three months will also be charged with tax fraud”, he added.
Nasir Qureshi, President of ICCI, termed the budget conventional. He said Rs4 billion is reported to have been allocated in the budget for construction of a cancer hospital in Islamabad, whereas construction of such a hospital is possible through CSR funds.
He said the focus of budget-makers is on investment, which means there is no growth. “A business-friendly environment must be provided to the businesses. Businessmen are like migratory birds - they fly to a place where environment is business-friendly”.
He noted foreign investment comes to where business environment is favourable. The federal budget is being presented to protect IPPs, he viewed. Naeem Siddiqui, Advisor to President of FPCCI, said business community is not afraid of taxes. The industry should be given opportunities to work peacefully, he asked. He suggested industries providing employment to 1,000 people should be exempted from taxes. On the contrary, notices are issued, he regretted, adding confidence of industry should be restored. “The definition of tax fraud has been widened, even broader than Section 302”, he remarked.
Anil Peter, a tax expert, said, “A 10pc tax is being introduced in FATA, whereas taxes are usually introduced at 3-4pc. We are imposing an 18pc tax on a 2pc growth rate”. Tariq Iqbal, Secretary FBR, said, “The role of FBR is that of a tax collection agent. We have to implement the policy set by others. The FBR does not make policies”.
Usman Shaukat, President of Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce, said businessmen need to be given confidence. An emergency should be imposed in the export sector. “If local investors are not satisfied, where will foreign investment come from?. Red tape and bureaucratic hurdles should be eliminated”, he suggested.
The CEO of Cost & Management Accountants said, “Cost management accountants, doctors and engineers should be given representation in the assembly. Our role should be in policymaking, and reserved seats should be allocated for us in the assembly”, he demanded.
Asad Hamid, head of ACCA, Abid Qayyum Suleri, Executive Director of SDPI, Faraz Fazal, President of Islamabad-Rawalpindi Tax Bar Association, Naeema Ansari, spokesperson of Women’s Chamber, also addressed the conference.

Other notable attendees included Lahore Press Club President Arshad Ansari, senior journalists Kazim Khan, Naveed Kashif, Hafiz Tariq, Ayaz Khan, Noorullah and Mohsin Mumtaz.

Training session on e-procurement system held,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321016-training-session-on-e-procurement-system-held,"LAHORE:The Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) in collaboration with the Punjab Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Friday organised a training and feedback session on e-Procurement System for officials of divisional, district, and tehsil-level across the Gujranwala division.
The session was aimed at building capacity among government officials and ensure smooth adoption of the e-Procurement system, which is being implemented across the province to enhance transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in public procurement.
PPRA Managing Director Waqar Azim provided a detailed overview of the legal and regulatory framework governing public procurement in the province. PITB’s e-Procurement team conducted hands-on training across various modules of the system and actively engaged participants through interactive Q\A sessions and feedback collection. The e-Procurement system, developed by PITB, leverages modern technology to facilitate secure, paperless, and efficient procurement. It allows vendors from across the province—and beyond—to submit bids online, eliminating geographical barriers and streamlining the entire procurement cycle.
In this regard, PITB Chairman Faisal Yousaf stated, “The digitisation of public procurement is a transformative step towards good governance. PITB’s e-Procurement system brings efficiency, fairness, and accountability into government purchasing processes. Through such training sessions, we aim to ensure seamless adoption of the system across Punjab and empower officials with the tools they need to lead the shift to digital governance.”

Dacoit involved in constable’s martyrdom killed in Wah shootout,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321023-dacoit-involved-in-constable-s-martyrdom-killed-in-wah-shootout,"Rawalpindi:Another dacoit involved in the martyrdom of Constable Syed Sajjad Hussain on Wednesday night was killed during a shootout with police in the Wah Saddar area late Thursday night.
According to the Rawalpindi Police spokesman, after the martyrdom of Constable Sajjad, police teams, including the Crime Control Department (CCD), were given a special task, to arrest the absconding suspects.
One dacoit was killed in Wednesday’s shootout. The teams blockaded roads in the area. One of the teams on Thursday night signalled two suspicious motorcycle riders to stop, but the later started firing on the police.
In the ensuing crossfire, one of the riders later identified as Qudratullah was killed while the other escaped. During the shooting, one fire hit Constable Mukhtiar Haider on the chest, who, however, remained safe due to the bulletproof jacket. The dead Qudratullah, an Afghan national, was wanted to police in dozens of robberies, including serious cases.

Time to take measures to minimise effects of severe heat,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321024-time-to-take-measures-to-minimise-effects-of-severe-heat,"Rawalpindi:Both the private and public sector healthcare facilities in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi have been receiving a significant burden of patients with heat-related problems particularly after a severe heat wave that has hit the population in the region in the last one week.
Health experts suggest that individuals must take necessary preventive measures well in time to avoid heat-related health threats otherwise the healthcare facilities would have to bear an extraordinary burden of patients with summer and monsoon related health hazards including heat exhaustion, heat stroke and gastroenteritis.
Data collected by ‘The News’ has revealed that the allied hospitals in town including Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Holy Family Hospital and Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital have already been receiving a greater number of both the child and the adult cases with diarrhoea and as well mild cases of heat exhaustion.
On average, almost every fourth patient visiting a public sector healthcare facility in emergency in the region is with some of the heat-related problems. The number of cases with gastroenteritis is also registering an upward trend.
Health experts say that to avoid summer related health hazards, people must be aware of various aspects of summer season illnesses and the preventive measures needed to avoid these. The warning signs of heat exhaustion include impaired consciousness, prolonged durations of sleep, restlessness and irritability, thunderclap headache, blurring of vision, tremors and fits and scanty dark urine in decreased quantity. Experts say that anyone having these symptoms should visit the nearest healthcare facility to avoid serious complications.
To avoid heat and summer related diseases, the most important preventive measure is to avoid going outside and spending long hours unnecessarily under the sun at day-time particularly from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. If one has to go outside, he or she should cover head with a cloth and try to avoid exposure to sunlight as much as possible. Experts say that if the body temperature of a person goes up and the body stops sweating, the person should immediately report to the nearest healthcare facility.
In many cases, blood cells burst causing massive nasal bleeding due to persistent heat. Also there are chances of ceasing of the cardiac activity at high temperatures while the consistent high temperature in the environment may cause stiffness of muscles bringing them in contracted state.
Experts say that infants, children and elderly people are at greater risk of suffering from serious complications after exposure to severe heat. To avoid heat exhaustion and heat stroke, lightweight, light-coloured and loose-fitting clothes should be put on while black, dark green, red and blue coloured clothes should be avoided. Direct exposure to the sun should be avoided and a hat or umbrella should be used for protection from sun while outside. Sunglasses should also be used and try to avoid spending time outdoors unnecessarily during the hottest hours of the day.

Public swimming pools: A much-needed facility in heat-stricken Rawalpindi,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321027-public-swimming-pools-a-much-needed-facility-in-heat-stricken-rawalpindi,"Rawalpindi:Every child has the right to play, and ensuring access to safe recreational spaces is vital for their physical and emotional well-being. Unfortunately, children and youth in Rawalpindi face increasing barriers to recreational activities due to the severe lack of public facilities—particularly swimming pools.
With soaring temperatures and recurring heatwaves hitting the region, the absence of public swimming pools is felt more acutely than ever. The Punjab government, local authorities, and private sector stakeholders must urgently prioritize the development of recreational infrastructure to provide the people of Rawalpindi, especially children, a healthy outlet during extreme summer conditions.
Swimming is not only a refreshing way to beat the heat but also promotes physical fitness, mental relaxation, and social bonding. It serves as an inclusive activity for people of all ages and economic backgrounds. Yet, in Rawalpindi, swimming remains an unaffordable luxury for many, with access mostly limited to private clubs or schools.
Currently, the city lacks dedicated public swimming pools. Most open spaces have been converted into parks, while the few remaining playgrounds often require paid access or membership. Public swimming pools in key locations across the city—such as Liaquat Bagh, Khayaban-i-Sir Syed, Rawal Road, Dhok Hassu, Satellite Town, and Dhoke Kala Khan—could serve as accessible and affordable cooling spots for thousands.
A standard public swimming pool at Allama Iqbal Park (Nawaz Sharif Park), for instance, would not only benefit families in the vicinity but also set a precedent for future recreational projects. The pool could operate on a nominal fee basis to cover maintenance costs, ensuring its sustainability while remaining accessible.
In addition, local authorities could encourage public-private partnerships (PPPs) by offering incentives for private parties to invest in community pool projects. Schools and colleges with existing facilities could also be engaged during summer vacations to allow limited public access under safety and supervision protocols.
Public swimming pools should be equipped with proper changing rooms, lifeguard services, and shaded rest areas to make them safe and family-friendly. Separate timings for men, women, and children can also help create an inclusive and culturally sensitive environment.
The people of Rawalpindi—particularly youth and low-income families—have long called for the development of such facilities. With Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif pledging to improve public welfare and city infrastructure, a network of public swimming pools could be a symbolic and practical gift to the city, showcasing her administration’s responsiveness to climate challenges and community needs.
As the summer intensifies, it is time for the government to act—not only to uphold the right to recreation but also to provide relief from the dangerous heatwaves that are fast becoming a seasonal norm.

Inquiry into billboard recovery embezzlement still pending after two years,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321028-inquiry-into-billboard-recovery-embezzlement-still-pending-after-two-years,"Rawalpindi:Nearly two years after a high-profile inquiry was launched into alleged irregularities in billboard tax recovery by the District Council Rawalpindi, the final report is still awaited. The delay in concluding the investigation has raised questions about the pace of accountability within the local government system.
In August 2023, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Rawalpindi Hasan Waqar Cheema, who also serves as the Administrator of the District Council, took prompt action after receiving reports of financial mismanagement in the recovery of billboard revenue. The recovery process was reportedly conducted without following proper tendering procedures, prompting the DC to order a detailed investigation and suspend the ongoing recovery operations.
Chief Officer (CO) District Council Fazal-e-Akram Khan was removed from his position at the time, and a formal recommendation was sent to the Secretary, Local Government and Community Development (LG&CD) Punjab, Dr. Muhammad Irshad. Acting on the DC’s recommendation, the Secretary transferred the officer on administrative grounds through Notification No. LCS (ADMN)-1(345)/2005. Fazal-e-Akram was directed to report to the Punjab Local Government Board, Lahore, while Ahmed Bilal Makhdoom was assigned additional charge as Chief Officer.
Other officials whose names surfaced during the preliminary probe included District Officer (Finance) Muhammad Faisal, Superintendent Sajid Naseer, and Assistant Superintendent (Building) Raja Muhammad Hafeez. A high-level inquiry was initiated, with the Additional Deputy Commissioner (Finance and Planning) Rameesha Javed tasked with compiling a detailed report.
Despite the urgency expressed at the time, the final outcome of the inquiry remains undisclosed as of June 2025. According to official sources, the matter continues to be under review, with no conclusive findings shared with the public.
The controversy revolves around the alleged unauthorized installation of over 1,000 billboards across District Council limits, which not only posed safety risks to pedestrians and motorists but also resulted in significant revenue losses. Concerns were raised over the lack of a transparent contract or tendering process in the collection of billboard revenue.
Citizens and taxpayers have called on the authorities to conclude the inquiry and make the findings public. “If any officials are found to have acted responsibly, they should be reinstated with dignity. If wrongdoing is confirmed, action must follow,” said one resident.
In a separate development, the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) has initiated strict oversight procedures. Under the leadership of Director General Kinza Murtaza, the RDA is cooperating with agencies including NAB, FIA, and the Anti-Corruption Establishment in other corruption probes amounting to billions of rupees, signalling an increased focus on transparency and accountability.
Meanwhile, some private contractors have reported delays in bill payments from the District Council's Finance Department, citing procedural hurdles and a need for greater transparency in financial dealings. Despite the passage of time, stakeholders continue to await clarity and resolution on the billboard embezzlement case, viewing it as a litmus test for local governance reforms.

Trump’s mediation nod marks turning point in Pakistan’s Kashmir diplomacy,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321029-trump-s-mediation-nod-marks-turning-point-in-pakistan-s-kashmir-diplomacy,"In the labyrinth of international diplomacy, some struggles are easily forgotten while others remain dormant, awaiting a leader bold enough to bring them back to the table. For decades, the people of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir have waited for the world to acknowledge their plight — and more importantly, to act.
Pakistan’s persistent efforts to highlight the Kashmir dispute on global forums, often in the face of India’s aggressive denial and diplomatic resistance, are now finally bearing fruit. A significant development has emerged in the form of a renewed statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has once again reiterated his commitment to resolving the long-standing Kashmir conflict. In a recent press talk, Trump asserted that he had “stopped a war” between Pakistan and India and that he remains willing to act as an arbitrator in the dispute.
This isn’t just diplomatic platitude. It represents a significant shift in tone — one that has surfaced after years of calculated diplomatic manoeuvring by Pakistan and a growing international awareness of India’s refusal to entertain third-party mediation. For Islamabad, which has long maintained that sustainable peace in South Asia hinges on a just settlement of the Kashmir issue, this endorsement from Washington marks a symbolic victory.
Speaking to reporters, Trump emphasized his role in defusing tensions: “Eventually, they were gonna go nuclear… and I stopped it. I called each leader… and I spoke to them and talked about trade,” he said, referring to a moment of heightened hostility between Pakistan and India during his presidency. “They have a large stockpile of nuclear weapons, and I think I should get some credit for bringing them back from the precipice.”
He added that both countries had been receptive to his intervention: “They were both unbelievable. They understood it exactly. They stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade.” Most notably, he reiterated his long-standing offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute: “I told the leadership of India and Pakistan — I can solve anything. I will be your arbitrator.”
Trump’s latest remarks align with statements from his time in office, where he publicly expressed willingness to play a mediating role — a proposal that Pakistan welcomed, and India flatly rejected. Responding to queries about Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Allison Hooker’s engagement with a Pakistani parliamentary delegation, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce reaffirmed that President Trump remains “ready to assist” in resolving the Kashmir dispute — a sentiment he has voiced repeatedly throughout his political career.
“Trump in each step that he takes, it’s made to solve generational differences between countries,” Bruce emphasized. This development comes at a time when Islamabad’s proactive diplomacy — including a recent visit by a delegation led by Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to Washington — has successfully kept Pakistan’s narrative alive in US policymaking circles. Bilawal’s meetings with more than a dozen US lawmakers and senior State Department officials underlined Pakistan’s growing concerns about Indian belligerence, violations of the Indus Waters Treaty, and New Delhi’s incendiary rhetoric.
Pakistan’s willingness to allow a neutral third party such as the United States to mediate in the conflict is both pragmatic and consistent with its longstanding call for international involvement. India, by contrast, clings stubbornly to the claim that Kashmir is a “bilateral matter” — even as it rebuffs every opportunity for actual bilateral engagement.
New Delhi’s refusal to even acknowledge Trump’s latest mediation remarks — let alone respond constructively — reflects a troubling trend: a superpower-in-the-making that would rather let conflict fester than consider solutions involving external facilitation. Yet Trump’s latest statement has once again placed the Kashmir dispute squarely on the international radar.
President Trump’s offer is not the first time an international leader has attempted to mediate the Kashmir conflict — nor is it the first time India has responded with obstruction. In 1962, British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan quietly offered to mediate, fearing the conflict could escalate during the Sino-Indian war. India rejected the offer outright, citing non-interference.
Later, in 1993, then United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali offered to mediate after Pakistan raised the issue at the UN Human Rights Commission. India dismissed the overture, claiming it was an “internal matter.”
In 2006, Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg indicated Oslo’s willingness to act as a neutral facilitator between India and Pakistan. Once again, India shut down the proposal, warning foreign governments against what it termed “interference.”
Fast forward to 2009, when UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown offered quiet diplomatic engagement between Islamabad and New Delhi after the Mumbai attacks, aiming to lower tensions and facilitate dialogue. India stonewalled the effort.
In more recent years, in 2019, just days after India revoked Article 370 — the provision that granted special autonomy to Jammu and Kashmir — President Trump publicly stated that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had asked him to mediate on Kashmir. India promptly denied any such request, causing confusion and embarrassment for the US administration. Meanwhile, Pakistan welcomed the offer, reiterating its openness to dialogue through international facilitation.
That Islamabad has managed to keep Kashmir visible in powerful capitals like Washington — even amidst competing crises from Ukraine to Gaza — is a testament to its persistent diplomatic strategy. Critics may rightly argue that statements alone do not solve entrenched conflicts. But acknowledgment is the first necessary step. By securing a public and repeated endorsement from a former U.S. President with ongoing political clout, Pakistan has cracked open a door India has tried desperately to keep shut.
As the world approaches the United Nations General Assembly session in New York this September, anticipation is building over whether a breakthrough — even a symbolic one — might be possible. Even a staged photo-op involving Indian and Pakistani leaders could mark a watershed moment.
Pakistan’s message is simple but resolute: We are ready to talk, to mediate, to seek peaceful solutions. India’s refusal to reciprocate only underscores its discomfort with transparency and its fear of international adjudication.
For the people of Kashmir — who remain voiceless under a prolonged occupation — the world must not reward silence, denial, or stubbornness. Trump’s renewed commitment may very well be the catalyst that breathes life into a peace process long stalled.
And for that, Pakistan’s persistence deserves recognition — not only in Washington but across the international stage. The path to resolution may be long, but momentum, once sparked, has a force of its own.

"Govt’s 10pc salary raise sparks outrage, not relief",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321030-govt-s-10pc-salary-raise-sparks-outrage-not-relief,"Islamabad:Presenting annual budget for the Fiscal 2025-26 in the National Assembly, Federal Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb has announced an increase of 10 per cent in the salary of employees working in public-sector institutions.
When the Minister was playing with statistics, graphs and tables, the protesters of All Government Employees Grand Alliance (AGEGA) which included many allies like Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) were staging demonstrations outside Red Zone here to press for their demands top of which was 50 per cent increase in their salary and pension and fixing Rs50,000 per month as minimum pay for a government employee.
Incidentally, PPP’s Labour Bureau Head Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed in a press conference where Nadeem Afzal Chan, PPP Information Secretary, was also present, had also demanded 50 raise in salary and pension a day before budget.
Fifty per cent versus 10%“Ik rayat-e-tankhwa mili, woh bhi 10 per cent, dekhay hein hum ne hoslay, wazir e rezgar (coins) kay.” It is a perfect occasion for Nadeem Afzal Chan to phone his aide in the village: “Mukhtariya! Tankhwa ‘wadh’ gayi ay per opposition dasdi naeen payee.”
Dear Minister! It appears in the name of Das Percent, you have done Das Numbri to the government employees. Keeping the rate of rise in pension even less than 10, you have ridiculed the senior citizens as well. “Tankhwa ‘wadh’ naeen gayee balkay ‘warh’ gayee ay.”
The Minister told reporters in his post budget briefing Wednesday that Climate Change is an existential threat. And to stop this, he imposed 18% duty on solar panels! As King Aurangzeb had taken the Mogul empire to a disaster, our Aurangzeb is taking this unfortunate nation to the same destination. Why is he so averse to a cheap, clean, environment-friendly and carbonless source of energy?
I think he knows the difference between “khirad” and “janun’ more than Hasrat Mohani. Should we expect steps against wind, tidal, hydel and geothermal energy in near future from such whiz-kids? What else is stored in the “zambeel” of our Umar-o-Ayyars in the government and bureaucracy?
How can Climate Change be forestalled? By creating ministry, division and department in the name of Climate Chang? No. Implant trees, forests, orchards, gardens and crops. Promote renewable sources of energy with no carbon emissions. Solar Panels also are an assurance against the government’s favourite announced or un-announced load-shedding at least in the day time. Kudos for a government that make payments in billions to independent power producers even without producing a watt but is not ready that general public produce their own electricity without involving a penny from the government!
This is our suicidal way of meeting existential threats!!!
Last but not the least. Now that the Finance Minister has increased the salary of government employees in a thumping way (or is in Trumping way), will he incorporate this raise in the recurring account-heads of institutions where these employees work?
Because, recurring grant of not a single public-sector non-military university in the country had any increase incorporated in its budget since 2018 which obviously would include this 10 per cent increase this year also. And the result is that after failing to pay successive increases in the last 7 years from their own sources, a retired Professors from the No 1 Quaid-i-Azam University has suggested that universities should collect “Qurbani ki Khalain” to pay salary and pension.
How about creating an Animal Skin Division under the Ministry of Education to arrange collection, procession, selling/exporting sacrificial animals’ hides and incorporating the amount thus collected into the recurring grants budget of Higher Education Commission?

District Police Officer (DPO) Waqar Ahmad said the shooting occurred due to an old enmity between the groups. One group, he said, launched an attack on the other, leading to a fierce exchange of fire.  As a result, four persons were killed on the spot while another sustained serious injuries. The deceased and the injured were immediately shifted to the hospital.“The two groups had a history of animosity. Initial investigations suggest the incident was premeditated,” said DPO Waqar Ahmad.

PHC orders detention of five govt witnesses,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321043-phc-orders-detention-of-five-govt-witnesses,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday ordered that five government witnesses be detained in lock-up until June 18 for repeatedly failing to appear in court to record their statements in a narcotics case.
The order was issued by acting Chief Justice SM Atiq Shah, who criticized the performance of the police investigation department, saying it had failed to satisfy the court. “Despite repeated court orders, witnesses have not appeared for several months, which undermines the delivery of justice,” he remarked.
Justice Shah further noted that due to lack of evidence, only 3 out of 100 cases were decided on merit. “As chief justice, I sit here to provide justice to the people of this province, yet in two years, the police have failed to present even five witnesses in some cases,” he said.
He acknowledged the role of the police in the war against terrorism but said “black sheep” within the department were tarnishing its image. “Why are such corrupt elements still being protected? This is the state’s responsibility,” he said.
The remarks came during the hearing of a bail application filed by a suspect in a narcotics case. Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Shah Faisal Utmankhel appeared in court, but when asked about the Inspector General of Police (IGP), he informed the court that the IGP was busy in a meeting and could not appear.
Justice Shah expressed displeasure, stating that failure to present evidence and witnesses had become a routine in police cases. “Despite multiple directions, court orders are being ignored,” he said. The Regional Police Officer (RPO) Mardan informed the court that an inquiry had been initiated against the officer concerned. He said that a memory card submitted as evidence in the case would be sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), although the chief justice pointed out that the card contained no video.
Justice Shah directed that the investigation department must improve its standards and stated that in 150 cases, prosecution had failed to produce witnesses. “We cannot allow the police to embarrass the judiciary. If even 4 or 5 witnesses are not produced in 24 months, the system is clearly flawed,” he said.
He added that in the past four decades, the police department had witnessed significant challenges, including frequent bomb blasts, but now internal corruption was a major issue. The RPO assured the court that strict action was being taken against such officials.
Justice Shah instructed the advocate general to hold a meeting with senior police officials and devise a mechanism to ensure compliance with court orders. The court gave a 30-day deadline for holding the meeting and submitting the minutes.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa budget: Protesting employees ask govt to allocate funds for universities,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321044-khyber-pakhtunkhwa-budget-protesting-employees-ask-govt-to-allocate-funds-for-universities,"PESHAWAR: The University Employees Grand Alliance Khyber Pakhtunkhwa held a protest outside the Peshawar Press Club on Friday, demanding that the provincial government to allocate funds for public universities in the upcoming budget.
Several teaching and non-teaching staff from various organizations participated in the protest, including the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA) KP Chapter, the Federation of All Public Sector Universities Administrative Officers Association, and the All Pakistan Universities Employees Federation KP Chapter.
Dr Dilnawaz, President of the University Employees Grand Alliance KP, Arbab Amir Khusro, President of the Universities Employees Federation KP, Dr. Feroz Shah, President of the Engineering University Teachers Association, Dr Zakirullah Jan, President of Puta, and Imdad Khan, President of the Class-IV Employees Association of the University of Peshawar attended the protest.
Addressing the gathering, speakers noted that after the 18th Constitutional Amendment, higher education had become a provincial subject, making it the constitutional and moral responsibility of the provincial governments to support their universities financially.
They highlighted that while Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan had fulfilled this obligation by providing financial assistance to their universities, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had yet to make any such decision. As a result, public universities in the province were now on the verge of collapse, they added.
“If immediate financial aid is not provided, the burden will fall on students and their families, who are already grappling with inflation and unemployment,” they warned. “Soaring fees, lack of educational facilities, and the deteriorating infrastructure will deprive our youth of access to higher education.”

"Pakistan, Israeli, Egyptian dollar bonds slide after Israeli strikes on Iran",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320953-pakistan-israeli-egyptian-dollar-bonds-slide-after-israeli-strikes-on-iran,"LONDON: Long-dated dollar bonds for Pakistan, Israel and Egypt slipped on Friday, and Israel’s shekel tumbled, after Israeli air strikes in Iran.

SBP to hold rates as tensions in Middle East overshadow growth push: report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320954-sbp-to-hold-rates-as-tensions-in-middle-east-overshadow-growth-push-report,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s central bank is expected to hold its policy rate on Monday, a Reuters poll showed, as many analysts shifted their previous view of a cut in the wake of Israel’s military strike on Iran, citing inflation risks from rising global commodity prices.
Israel said on Friday it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders in a “preemptive strike” to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon. Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict. The escalating hostilities triggered a sharp spike in oil prices -- a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.
Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll expected the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 12 per cent. Two forecast a 100 basis-point cut and one predicted a 50bps cut. “There remains an upside risk of a rise in global commodity prices in light of geopolitical tensions which could mark a return to inflationary pressures,” said Ahmad Mobeen, senior economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence.
“The resultant higher import bill could also threaten external sector performance and bring pressure to the exchange rate.” Inflation in the South Asian country has been declining for several months after it soared to around 40 per cent in May 2023.
Last month, however, inflation picked up to 3.5 per cent, above the finance ministry’s projection of up to 2.0 per cent, partly due to the fading of the year-go base effects. The SBP expects average inflation between 5.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent for the fiscal year ending June. The central bank paused its easing cycle in March after cumulative cuts of 1,000 basis points from a record high of 22 per cent, and resumed it with a 100-basis-point reduction in May.
The policy meeting follows the release a tight annual budget, which saw Pakistan raise defence spending by 20 per cent but overall expenditure was reduced by 7.0 per cent, with GDP growth forecast at 4.2 per cent.
Pakistan says its $350 billion economy has stabilised under a $7 billion IMF bailout that had helped it staved a default threat.Some analysts are sceptical of the government’s ability to reach the growth target amid fiscal and external challenges.
Abdul Azeem, head of research at Al Habib Capital Markets, which forecast a 50-bp cut, said a lower rate could “support the GDP target of 4.2 per cent and reduce the debt financing burden”.

"KP to receive Rs163.53bn foreign loan, Rs11.65bn grants in FY26",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320955-kp-to-receive-rs163-53bn-foreign-loan-rs11-65bn-grants-in-fy26,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government is set to receive a total of Rs177.18 billion in foreign assistance during the financial year 2025-26, according to official budget documents.
The amount includes Rs165.53 billion in loans and Rs11.65 billion in grants, to be utilised across 49 development schemes. The funds will be provided by 12 international donors, including both multilateral financial institutions and bilateral development partners.
The World Bank will be the largest contributor, offering Rs81.41 billion in loans for 12 schemes, accounting for 45.95 per cent of the total foreign assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) follows closely, with Rs72.08 billion in loans, supporting 14 projects. Its share in the total foreign aid stands at 40.68 per cent.
USAID (United States Agency for International Development) will provide Rs5.25 billion in grants for two projects, making it the top grant-based donor. Germany’s KfW will contribute Rs3.71 billion in grants to finance seven schemes, while KOICA (Korea International Cooperation Agency) will support one project through a grant of Rs1.4 billion.
The government of Japan will provide Rs1.02 billion in grants for two development schemes. The Saudi Fund for Development (SFD) will provide Rs2.24 billion in loans for two projects, while Italy will extend a loan of Rs3.92 billion for one scheme. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) will provide Rs5.88 billion in loans, funding a single development project. China is also listed as a bilateral donor, contributing a grant of Rs262 million for one scheme.
The total foreign assistance -- comprising over 93 per cent loans and less than 7.0 per cent grants -- reflects KP’s continued reliance on external support to finance key sectors such as infrastructure, health, education, agriculture, and rural development.
While the inflow of funds is expected to boost development activities, the heavy dependence on loans has sparked debate over the province’s growing debt burden and future fiscal sustainability.

Govt cuts RLNG prices slightly for June,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320957-govt-cuts-rlng-prices-slightly-for-june,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s energy regulator trimmed prices of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) for June, citing a marginal drop in terminal charges as the primary reason for the adjustment.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) reduced RLNG rates for both Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL), according to a notification issued Friday. The changes reflect slight declines of up to 0.09 per cent across transmission and distribution costs in line with federal policy directives.
For SNGPL consumers, the transmission price has been cut to $11.015 per million British thermal units (MMBtu), while the distribution rate now stands at $11.7816 per MMBtu -- both reflecting a 0.09 per cent decrease from May.
Similarly, SSGCL’s revised transmission price is set at $9.7284 per MMBtu, while the distribution rate has dropped to $10.865 per MMBtu, marking reductions of 0.09 per cent and 0.08 per cent, respectively.
The price revision is based on the government’s policy guidelines and cost components associated with LNG imports and re-gasification. The small downward adjustment offers limited relief to industrial and commercial sectors that rely heavily on RLNG as a key energy input amid broader energy cost pressures.
RLNG plays a critical role in Pakistan’s energy mix, particularly during periods of domestic gas shortfall. The government adjusts prices monthly, depending on import prices, exchange rates and infrastructure costs.

Rupee ends weaker against dollar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320959-rupee-ends-weaker-against-dollar,"KARACHI: The rupee ended lower against the dollar in the interbank market on Friday.The rupee closed at 282.96 per dollar, compared with the previous close of 282.67.
In the open market, the rupee also dipped, trading at 285.12 versus the dollar, compared with 284.82 on Thursday.Dealers said the local unit fell for a fourth consecutive session due to fiscal-year-end dollar demand for imports and other payments.
The rupee remained under pressure, despite an increase in the foreign exchange reserves.Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves reached a 163-week high of $16.875 billion as of June 6. The country’s reserves rose by $277 million in the reporting week, and have seen an increase of $2.88 billion so far this fiscal year.
The forex reserves held by the SBP rose by $167 million to $11.676 billion. The SBP’s reserves are enough to cover almost two months of imports.The SBP’s reserves continued to increase due to a current account surplus. Additionally, inflows from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), rollovers from friendly nations and the SBP’s dollar buying from the market played a crucial role in bolstering forex reserves.

Can government deliver affordable houses? Experts weigh in,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320960-can-government-deliver-affordable-houses-experts-weigh-in,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s new budget aims to boost the real estate sector with a focus on affordable housing, but clarity on tackling housing shortages hinges on the upcoming low-cost housing scheme.
The Shehbaz Sharif government has announced a set of incentives for the property sector in Budget FY26. This includes a total allocation of Rs10 billion in subsidies for the housing sector. Specifically, Rs5 billion is earmarked for direct housing support, while another Rs5 billion is allocated for a markup subsidy on low-cost housing. This initiative aims to build 200,000 homes for lower and middle-income segments of society.
Policymakers are focused on expanding access to mortgage financing. So, they have introduced a proportionate tax credit on loans obtained for the construction and acquisition of houses up to 250 square yards and flats of up to 2,000 square feet. Furthermore, the government plans to eliminate the federal excise duty (FED) of up to 7.0 per cent and reduce the advance tax on the purchase of immovable property by 150 basis points (bps). However, the advance tax on the sale of immovable property will increase by 150bps.
As the next fiscal year begins next month, households, builders and the real estate market are awaiting the State Bank of Pakistan’s rollout of the low-cost housing scheme and the introduction of a framework for mortgage financing.
“The allocated funds under the housing subsidy in the FY26 budget could support the construction of over 40,000 homes if utilised efficiently. However, this remains minimal compared to Pakistan’s annual incremental housing demand of over half a million units,” said Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities Limited.
Pakistan’s housing crisis is worsening due to rapid population growth, urbanisation, and a significant decline in people’s purchasing power. A report from the House Building Finance Company Limited indicates that housing is generally considered affordable if it costs no more than 30 per cent of a household’s gross income, including rent or mortgage payments and essential utilities.
Currently, many households in Pakistan face relatively high housing expenditures, leaving little room for savings. Even with low interest rates, high property prices compared to incomes can make homeownership unattainable for many Pakistanis.
“The IMF is against indirect subsidies, not direct subsidies, whereas increasing room due to robust growth in tax revenues and reduction in interest cost will make room for these subsidies,” Ashraf added.
But will the government’s plans actually make much difference? Or could they end up causing the same issues that led to the abrupt suspension of the ‘Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar’ programme in 2022, following pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to cut subsidy expenses?
Dr Anosh Ahmed, a US-based real estate investor, believes that this budget offers direct and indirect support across the entire property ecosystem. The Rs5 billion housing subsidy will help Naya Pakistan housing scheme beneficiaries, while the reinstated tax credit on mortgage facilities will ease long-term borrowing for middle-income households.
“The removal of excise duty and the lowered withholding taxes will further reduce the cost of buying and selling property,” Ahmed said. “These steps will increase confidence among both developers and end-users, stimulate construction activity, and improve the pace of real estate transactions. All of this is good for the economy -- and for families hoping to build their futures,” he added.
“By lowering transaction costs and increasing liquidity in the market, the government is taking a meaningful step toward formalising and scaling Pakistan’s property landscape. It is a bold and necessary move at a critical time.”
However, Ahmed states that there is a need to ensure that recent restrictions on non-filers don’t deter investment flows, particularly from overseas Pakistanis who may not yet be integrated into the local tax system.
He commends the fiscal discipline shown in the budget and the clear roadmap for growth. With the cost of doing business lower and the government’s policy direction clear, this is a good time to move forward with housing and infrastructure projects.
Syed Hussain Haider, chief investment officer at JS Investments Limited, says that the relief measures in FY26 signal intent, particularly through the removal of the FED and the reinstatement of the mortgage tax credit. However, the package lacks coherence and falls short of a broader strategic framework.
“There is a conspicuous absence of support for institutionalising the sector; for instance, no progress was made once again on extending the capital gains tax exemption under Clause 99A for REITs, a key enabler for formal capital formation in real estate,” Haider said.
“The continued policy fickleness remains a major impediment to long-term development. Moreover, token allocations, like the Rs5 billion housing subsidy, offer little in the face of a severe erosion in purchasing power,” he said.
“What is truly needed is a comprehensive economic overhaul that allows equity, fairness, and meritocracy to take root, alongside a paradigm shift in the social sector, because, in the end, everything is deeply interconnected,” he added.
According to Haider, these steps announced in the budget modestly improve transaction dynamics and affordability, particularly at the lower end. Reintroducing the mortgage tax credit and housing subsidy could encourage the uptake of formal financing channels; however, the scale of support remains limited. He thinks that without complementary structural reforms, especially to deepen REIT markets and incentivise documented activity, the sector’s true potential will remain untapped.
Experts noted that while there is not a distinct policy aimed solely at attracting foreign investors to real estate, budgetary reforms signal opportunities to overseas Pakistanis and international stakeholders. Improved transaction tax rationalisation and stronger documentation enforcement could enhance transparency, a crucial factor for attracting institutional capital.

"Tax hike on mutual funds, cash withdrawal criticised",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320962-tax-hike-on-mutual-funds-cash-withdrawal-criticised,"KARACHI: The government should withdraw the increase of tax rate on mutual funds, by an additional 10 per cent, which may discourage saving and investment trends among people, say experts.
Ibrahim Amin, a banking and financial expert, said that the government should refrain from targeting a sector contributing significantly to attract investments from local and foreign individuals and entities.
Asset management companies (AMCs) played a major role in enhancing the national saving-to-GDP ratio, financial inclusion and empowerment among people, particularly the middle class and their employer institutions over a period of a few years, he added.
In Budget FY26, the government has proposed revised tax rates for mutual funds based on the proportion of income derived from their average annual investments. Income from debt securities will be taxed at 25 per cent, while income from equities will be subject to a 15 per cent tax. Through this measure, the government aims to generate Rs1.4 billion in revenue during the upcoming financial year.
The government increased the tax rate on interest income from 15 per cent to 20 per cent for non-filers to generate an additional Rs 70-110 billion in revenue.
Chairperson Dellsons Associates Ibrahim Amin mentioned that the government terminated the tax benefits for investors of mutual funds a couple of years ago and now it enhanced the tax rate of a segment of mutual funds substantially.
He remarked that mutual funds have served as a trusted financial tool for freelancers and middle-class investors seeking safe, regulated, and professionally managed investment avenues. Increasing taxes up to 25 per cent on certain categories of mutual fund income could discourage voluntary compliance and disincentivise investment by Pakistan’s growing digital workforce.
In FY24, the saving-to-GDP ratio increased to 14.1 per cent from 12.6 per cent last year due to attractive rates offered by the financial institutions which also generated record tax revenues to the national kitty.
He also suggested the government introduce incentives for non-filers instead of overtaxing them for investments in the banking and financial sectors. It also increased withholding tax on cash withdrawals above Rs50,000 for non-filers.
The rise in withholding tax on cash withdrawals will increase currency in circulation in the national financial system, undermining the measures of the banking regulator and financial institutions for increasing financial inclusion. These measures risk derailing the positive momentum seen in financial inclusion and formal savings -- two essential pillars of economic stability and long-term growth, he added.

Investors fearing worst-case Middle East scenarios hunker down,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320963-investors-fearing-worst-case-middle-east-scenarios-hunker-down,"LONDON: Investors’ worst-case scenario of a full-blown Middle East conflict is coming into view, unleashing a flood of capital out of risk assets and into classic safe-havens, topped once more by the dollar.
Israel on Friday said it had launched a strike against nuclear facilities and missile factories in Iran and killed a swathe of military commanders in what could be a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran building an atomic weapon. Oil, which accounts for roughly 30 per cent of global energy demand, soared -- gaining almost 14 per cent at one point -- along with gold, while government bond yields fell briefly. Shares, near record highs, also declined, led by airlines.
“This is a dangerous situation,” said Francois Savary, chief investment officer at Genvil Wealth Management in Geneva. “This is one of those situations where everything is under control and then everything is not under control.”
Iran is one of the world’s largest exporters of crude. It also borders the Strait of Hormuz, a critical choke-point through which roughly a fifth of daily global consumption flows and which Iran has previously threatened to close in retaliation to Western pressure. US President Donald Trump suggested Iran, which promised a harsh response, had brought the attack on itself by resisting U.S. demands in talks to restrict its nuclear programme, and urged it to make a deal, “with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal”. In markets, focus returned the real-world implications of the flare-up.
Investors and central banks alike have been wrestling with the direction of interest rates from here, given the likely upward hit to consumer prices and growth from US tariffs. Friday’s strikes by Israel added to that dilemma, given the surge to 5-1/2 month highs in the oil price. US Treasuries struggled to gain much of a safe-haven tailwind, leaving 10-year yields holding steady on the day around 4.36 per cent.
DOLLAR BACK
The dollar, which for weeks has borne the brunt of investor risk aversion, again took up the mantle of ultimate safe haven.
“The dollar is reverting to that traditional role of safe haven, which we have not seen for months,” City Index strategist Fiona Cincotta said. “We’ve got the equities markets coming lower in the safe-haven, risk-off trade and giving the dollar some much-needed boost from the lows that it was trading at.” The S&P 500 fell 0.7 per cent in early trade on Friday, but remained near record highs struck in February.
The dollar, which is down 10 per cent against a basket of six others this year, has traded virtually in lockstep with stocks since Trump’s April 2 ‘Liberation Day’ unveiling of tariffs and subsequent erratic approach to trade policy that has shattered confidence in US assets.
That relationship began to erode on Friday, as investors embraced the dollar at the expense of stocks, crypto, industrial commodities and currencies such as the safe-haven Swiss franc and yen.
OIL SLICK
Brent crude oil prices were last up 7.0 per cent at $75.54 per barrel LCOc1, were set for their biggest one-day jump since 2022, when energy costs spiked after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
“If we see oil prices moving towards $80 and above then that becomes more of an issue for global central banks,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets.
Marlborough fixed income fund manager James Athey said there was a risk investors may be too quick to take a lack of ratcheting-up in tensions as a green light to dive back into things like stocks. “In general, markets tend to look through these sorts of events quite quickly but of course therein lies the risk of complacency,” he said. “The situation is genuinely tense and fraught and risk assets are still priced for perfection,” he said.

APBF backs Budget 2025-26,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320964-apbf-backs-budget-2025-26,"LAHORE: The All Pakistan Business Forum (APBF) has described the federal budget for 2025-26 as a promising and balanced effort, particularly given the government’s limited fiscal space and ongoing engagement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The forum defended the increase in defence spending, calling it a necessary line item in light of the evolving regional security environment. With India adopting a more aggressive posture and hybrid threats on the rise, the government has justifiably prioritised military preparedness by raising defence allocations by over 20 per cent.
APBF Chairperson Ibrahim Qureshi welcomed budgetary measures aimed at easing pressure on the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector -- a longstanding demand of the forum. In a climate of high interest rates and limited credit availability, he lauded steps such as enhanced access to soft financing through the State Bank’s refinancing schemes, reduced import duties on industrial inputs and targeted tax relief.
“Rather than blanket austerity, the government has introduced focused incentives -- particularly for exporters and SMEs. This reflects a coordinated approach by institutions such as the State Bank of Pakistan and the Ministry of Commerce, aligned with ground realities,” Qureshi said.

"Gold prices surge Rs4,600 on rising geopolitical tensions",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320965-gold-prices-surge-rs4-600-on-rising-geopolitical-tensions,"KARACHI: Gold prices in the local market soared by Rs4,600 per tola on Friday, reflecting a sharp rally in international markets as investors sought refuge in the precious metal amid escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and Eastern Europe.
According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), the price of gold rose to Rs361,500 per tola, while the rate for 10 grams of gold increased by Rs4,023, reaching Rs310,007.In the global market, gold prices surged by $46, closing at $3,421 per ounce, one of the highest levels recorded in recent weeks.
“Investors are turning to gold as a traditional safe haven in times of crisis,” said a goldsmith. “The rise in global political risk, particularly the potential for sanctions, oil supply disruptions and currency instability, is pushing demand for gold both internationally and locally.”
He warned that any significant currency movement, combined with continued geopolitical uncertainty, could push gold prices to new record highs in the coming weeks.Meanwhile, silver prices also posted gains. The APSGJA reported an increase of Rs35 per tola, bringing the price to Rs3,780, while the rate for 10 grams of silver climbed by Rs30 to Rs3,240.
With gold continuing its upward trajectory, jewellers anticipate more volatility ahead. “It is clear that the global uncertainty is far from over,” said one trader. “Investors are watching closely, and gold remains the asset of choice for security.”

‘I have left a big piece of my heart at Brentford’: Spurs boss Frank,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320986-i-have-left-a-big-piece-of-my-heart-at-brentford-spurs-boss-frank,"London: Thomas Frank said on Friday he had “left a big piece of my heart” at Brentford after taking on the daunting task of reviving Tottenham´s Premier League fortunes.
Spurs announced the Dane as their new head coach on a three-year deal on Thursday, as a replacement for the sacked Ange Postecoglou. Frank, 51, won 136 of his 317 matches across a seven-year spell at Brentford, taking them into the Premier League in 2021.
In an emotional message posted on Brentford´s website Frank said: “The time has come for me to move on. But, even as I leave, I know I have left a big piece of my heart at Brentford, not just at the football club but with the community and, of course, the incredible and loyal supporters.
“I want to extend my profound gratitude to the club for giving me the chance to pursue my dreams and for everyone involved who made the journey such a memorable one.” He said it had been a privilege to be allowed to be part of such a “special community”.
“Whatever we have achieved, we have achieved together, and our success is built on unity, spirit, courage and ambition at every level of the club and amongst the fans,” he said. “Everybody has contributed, and every contribution has been invaluable. I am not just leaving a football club, I am saying goodbye to friends whose support through good and bad times I will carry with me always.” Frank, who becomes Tottenham´s fourth permanent boss since 2021, is tasked with lifting the club back among the Premier League´s elite.
Spurs will play in the Champions League next season thanks to their Europa League success in Bilbao, where they beat Manchester United 1-0 in the final. Their first European trophy for 41 years delivered on Postecoglou´s boast that he always wins silverware in his second season.
However, the Australian paid the price for a miserable Premier League season in which Tottenham finished 17th after losing 22 of their 38 games. Tottenham finished seven places and 18 points below Frank´s Brentford.

Tudor signs new two-year deal with Juventus: club,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320990-tudor-signs-new-two-year-deal-with-juventus-club,"MILAN: Igor Tudor has signed a new contract with Juventus which will keep the Croatian coach in Turin for another two seasons, the Serie A club said on Friday.
In a statement, Juve said that Tudor “will lead the men´s first team until 30 June, 2027, with an option to extend by another year until 30 June, 2028”. Juve´s new general manager Damien Comolli had already confirmed earlier this week that Tudor, 47, would stay on as coach after the club failed to snatch Antonio Conte from Serie A champions Napoli.
Juve had pushed to bring back club icon Conte, who won three straight league titles as coach of the Turin giants between 2011 and 2014. But Conte decided to stay at Napoli and defend the Scudetto, leading Juve to decide to stick with Tudor who replaced sacked Thiago Motta in March and guided the club to next season´s Champions League.

From samurai threat to Asian Games as Japan cricket fights obscurity,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320991-from-samurai-threat-to-asian-games-as-japan-cricket-fights-obscurity,"SANO, Japan: Legend has it that death threats from disgruntled samurai warriors were behind Japan´s first cricket match in 1863 and the sport has battled for recognition in the baseball-mad country ever since.
But Japan´s cricket association, which operates out of a disused school near a wooded mountain, says the sport is slowly gaining popularity and hopes next year´s home Asian Games and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics can take it to a new level.
“My whole 11 years here have been about trying to provide people with opportunities to play,” said Englishman Alan Curr, Japan Cricket Association´s chief operations officer. “That´s a lot easier if they know the sport exists. Ultimately, you can´t be what you can´t see.”
Curr says cricket is growing annually in Japan with more than 5,000 adults and children playing the game regularly and about three times as many having tried it in some form. That is still a drop in the ocean compared to Japanese baseball, which is played by millions and produces global superstars such as the Los Angeles Dodgers´ Shohei Ohtani.
The two sports arrived in Japan at roughly the same time, although cricket´s origins were slightly less auspicious. A samurai threat to kill all foreigners who refused to leave Japan prompted a group of European residents to seek protection from the British navy in Yokohama.
They had a game of cricket to pass the time, playing with loaded guns tucked into their belts to guard against possible attack. A Scottish tea merchant founded the first cricket club in Japan five years later but it failed to catch on beyond expatriate circles.
Fast forward to the late 1980s and several universities began playing -- “students were looking for something unique”, according to global governing body the ICC. The sport has maintained a niche presence, although rising numbers of South Asian residents in Japan have boosted the playing population. Japan´s national teams reflect the sport´s Commonwealth roots, featuring several players with parents from cricket-playing countries.
The JCA, founded in 1984, has worked hard to introduce cricket to people with no previous experience, concentrating their efforts on selected hubs around the country. Japan women´s Twenty20 captain Mai Yanagida told AFP she “knew the name but didn´t really know what kind of sport it was” until she took up cricket at Waseda University in Tokyo.
“I played softball and baseball before that, but in cricket you can hit the ball 360 degrees,” she said at the Women´s Sano City International Trophy this month. “I think it´s more a sport where you need to play together as a team.”
The Sano City tournament was played at Japan´s cricket headquarters about 100 km (60 miles) outside of Tokyo, on the playing field of a high school that closed its doors more than a decade ago.
After losing their opening game, Japan went on to lift the trophy, beating Hong Kong in the final of a tournament that also featured fellow cricketing minnows China, the Philippines and Mongolia.
The win came weeks after Japan´s men qualified for next year´s Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Cricket will feature at next year´s Asian Games in Japan before it returns to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1900 at the Los Angeles Games.
Japan´s women won bronze at the 2010 Asian Games and the men made their debut at the 2023 edition, finishing with one win and one defeat. The men´s team featured former professional baseball player Shogo Kimura, who took up cricket in 2017 after a 14-year career with some of Japan´s biggest teams.
Yanagida believes the Asian Games in Nagoya-Aichi and the Olympics can “have a really big impact” on cricket´s profile in Japan. “It will be in the news as an Olympic sport so the media can help the name cricket become more widely known,” she said.
Qualifying for LA will be a tall order for Japan, whose men´s T20 team are ranked 42nd in the world, with the women 43rd. All the players are amateurs and Curr says organising games against teams from outside Asia can be difficult.
He concedes that there is “no silver bullet” to make cricket genuinely popular in Japan but that will not stop those who love the sport from trying. “You´re not an overnight success, there´s always a lot of stuff that goes on behind it and we´re in that phase now,” said Curr. “We´re building a platform that we hope can then shock people at some point.”

PSL franchise owners keen to retain rights amid future base price curiosity,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320992-psl-franchise-owners-keen-to-retain-rights-amid-future-base-price-curiosity,"ISLAMABAD: As the Pakistan Super League (PSL) prepares to enter a new decade, the billion-dollar question looming over the cricketing horizon is -- what will be the new base price of its eight franchises set to compete in the landmark eleventh edition in 2026?
Having completed their initial ten-year terms, the current six franchises are bracing for a crucial auction round that could redefine the commercial trajectory of Pakistan’s most successful sports venture. The auction for the next ten-year cycle is expected to take place within the next few months and with it, the stakes are higher than ever.
Sources within the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) have told ‘The News’ that all six existing franchise owners have officially expressed, in writing, their strong interest in retaining ownership for the upcoming decade. However, despite the show of commitment, nothing has been finalised yet -- leaving the room for potential new contenders to enter the high-stakes bidding war.
When approached at a recent event at PID, Lahore Qalandars CEO Atif Rana was asked directly whether his franchise had been given any assurance of renewal. Interestingly, Rana opted to dodge the question -- fueling further speculation that the playing field may still be open. Behind the scenes, however, a well-placed PCB official reiterated: “At this point, we can confirm that all existing franchise owners have expressed their willingness to retain the rights for the next ten years.”
More clarity is expected to emerge by late June or early July, when the PCB is set to unveil a comprehensive roadmap for the PSL’s next chapter, potentially including timelines for franchise bidding, team expansion, and structural reforms leading into the 2026 season.
The 2026 edition is anticipated to be historic -- not just for marking a new cycle, but also for expanding the league to eight teams. Faisalabad is currently the frontrunner for the seventh franchise, while Abbottabad, Sialkot, and Hyderabad are also in contention to complete the lineup.
A third-party evaluation firm has already been commissioned to assess the market worth of both existing and new franchises. Early projections suggest that franchise base prices may rise by at least 600% over their original purchase values from a decade ago.
Multan Sultans, having joined the PSL mid-stream, may follow a slightly different evaluation curve. But the real intrigue lies in the bidding dynamics. Will new entrants be permitted to table aggressive bids that exceed the base prices set for existing franchises? For instance, if Lahore Qalandars’ base price is pegged at Rs2 billion, could an external bidder raise the stakes to Rs2.5 billion or more?
According to insiders, the PCB’s overarching goal is maximizing profit -- meaning the auction could be opened to competitive bids, with first refusal granted to current owners. “If higher offers come in from new parties, there is no reason to reject them outright. The existing franchise owners will be given the first right of refusal, but if they don’t match the offer, the opportunity could pass to the highest bidder,” a source close to the matter said.
With franchise values potentially skyrocketing and more cities jostling for a place in Pakistan’s cricketing elite, PSL 2026 could usher in a new era of commercial and competitive expansion, one that might not only redefine local cricket economics but also position the PSL more aggressively on the global T20 map. The cricketing world waits with bated breath as Pakistan’s marquee league readies for its most transformative chapter yet.

Markram takes South Africa to brink of WTC final glory against Australia,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320993-markram-takes-south-africa-to-brink-of-wtc-final-glory-against-australia,"LONDON: Aiden Markram´s superb century on Friday left South Africa on the brink of a dramatic victory in the World Test Championship final against Australia after decades of heartbreak in major tournaments.
South Africa reached the close on the third day at Lord´s on 213-2 in their second innings, needing just 69 runs to win, with eight wickets still standing. Opener Markram, dismissed for a duck in the first innings, was 102 not out and South Africa captain Temba Bavuma unbeaten on 65 despite spending most of his innings limping with a hamstring injury. The pair have shared an unbroken stand of 143 as South Africa pursue what will be, if they achieve it, the second-highest successful run chase in a Test at Lord´s.
The highest chase was the 344 made by the West Indies in 1984. But South Africa, whose last International Cricket Council title came at the 1998 ICC Knockout, have such a long history of folding under pressure that their supporters will not be taking anything for granted against serial winners and WTC title-holders Australia. Australia´s Mitchell Starc had starred earlier Friday with both bat and ball to put his team in charge.
The tailender made 58 not out in Australia´s second-innings total of 207 and then, in his main role of left-arm fast bowler, dismissed Ryan Rickelton (six) and Wiaan Mulder (27) to leave the Proteas 70-2.
Starc almost had a third wicket when Bavuma got a thick edge only for Smith, in a helmet at an advanced slip position, to drop a fast-travelling catch and leave the field with a finger injury.
But with any early moisture in the surface long gone, conditions for batting at a sun-drenched Lord´s were now as good as at any time in the match. Markram, aggressive from the outset, punched and pulled Australia captain Pat Cummins for well-struck fours.
With Australia appearing to miss absent former captain Smith´s tactical input, Bavuma produced the occasional gem of a shot, including a glorious drive down the ground off Cummins. Australia spinner Nathan Lyon almost dismissed both batsmen, with Markram aiming a booming drive at a sharply turning off-break, only to miss the ball completely before it also beat wicketkeeper Alex Carey.
Bavuma had made 43 when a slog-sweep off Lyon just evaded a diving Sam Konstas at deep midwicket as the substitute fielder attempted to pull off a low catch only for the ball to run away for four.
Soon afterwards, the diminutive Bavuma, who has a history of hamstring trouble, completed a gritty 83-ball fifty. Markram went to 97 with a brilliant straight-driven boundary off Josh Hazlewood and, shortly before stumps, clipped the fast bowler through midwicket to complete his hundred with an 11th four in 156 balls faced. It was only the 30-year-old´s eighth hundred in 84 Test innings.
Earlier Friday South Africa enjoyed an early breakthrough when Kagiso Rabada had Nathan Lyon plumb lbw to leave Australia 148-9 in their second innings. But tailender Starc, dropped in the gully on 14 by Marco Jansen late on the Thursday, kept the Proteas at bay, ably assisted by Hazlewood, reaching the 11th fifty of his 97-Test career.

Sixers scoop up Babar for BBL,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320996-sixers-scoop-up-babar-for-bbl,"ISLAMABAD: The Sydney Sixers have secured Pakistan’s star batter Babar Azam as a pre-draft international signing for the upcoming Big Bash League (BBL) season.
Babar joined Steve Smith in the Sixers lineup, becoming their designated overseas recruit ahead of the official draft set for June 19. Under BBL rules, each team is allowed to sign one international player before the draft. The Sixers were the last franchise to make such a move, finalising their pick with Babar.
Their squad now features Sean Abbott, Joel Davies, Ben Dwarshuis, Jack Edwards, Moises Henriques, Todd Murphy, Mitch Perry, Josh Philippe, and Jordan Silk, alongside Smith and Babar.
Babar expressed his excitement in a team statement: “It’s an exciting opportunity to play in one of the world’s best T20 leagues and be part of a successful, respected franchise. I’m looking forward to contributing to the team, connecting with the fans, and sharing the experience with my supporters in Pakistan.”
Other Pakistan stars such as Shaheen Afridi, Shadab Khan, Haris Rauf, and Mohammad Rizwan will be part of the overseas draft next week. Babar brings extensive T20 experience with over 320 matches under his belt. In the recent Pakistan Super League, he captained Peshawar Zalmi, finishing as the team’s top scorer with 288 runs in 10 innings, striking at 128.57, despite the team finishing second last.

Australia’s Smith dislocates finger in WTC final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320998-australia-s-smith-dislocates-finger-in-wtc-final,"LONDON: Australia´s Steve Smith was taken to hospital with a dislocated finger after dropping a catch in the World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord´s on Friday.
The batsman, fielding with a helmet, was standing in an unusually advanced slip position when he could not hold on to a fast-travelling edge from South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, who had only made two at the time.
After on-field attention, Smith left the field -- evidently in pain -- with South Africa then 76-2 chasing 282 to win on the third day. A Cricket Australia statement said: “Steve Smith has suffered a compound dislocation of his right little finger while fielding in the slip cordon during the ICC Men´s World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord´s.
“He was assessed by Australian team medical staff at the ground and taken to hospital for X-rays and further treatment.” Smith has scored more than 10,000 Test runs at a superb average of more than 56.
The 36-year-old former Australia captain made a valuable 66 in the WTC title-holders´ first innings at Lord´s. His injury will be a concern to Australia ahead of their three-Test series away to the West Indies, starting in Barbados on June 25.

Club World Cup a test of Chelsea’s elite credentials,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320999-club-world-cup-a-test-of-chelsea-s-elite-credentials,"LONDON: After securing their return to the Champions League on the final day of the season, Chelsea have an early chance to show they belong back among the elite this summer at the Club World Cup.
Enzo Maresca´s side beat Nottingham Forest in their last Premier League match to clinch fourth place after an inconsistent campaign, ending a two-season absence from Europe´s top competition.
The Blues, who reached FIFA´s revamped and expanded event by landing a second Champions League triumph in 2021, have been handed a favourable opening raft of fixtures in the United States. Chelsea begin their Club World Cup campaign in Group D against Los Angeles FC, who battled through a play-off round against Club America to replace the disqualified Club Leon.
After that opening fixture in Atlanta on Monday, Chelsea head north to face Brazilian team Flamengo and Tunisia´s Esperance, both in Philadelphia. Los Angeles boast former Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud, although the 38-year-old is not a regular starter.
Flamengo, who qualified by lifting the Copa Libertadores in 2022, are coached by well-regarded former Chelsea and Atletico Madrid defender Filipe Luis. Esperance have won eight of the last nine Tunisian league titles but are considered the weakest team in the group.
In the knock-out rounds tantalising potential clashes against Bayern Munich and Champions League holders Paris Saint-Germain may lie ahead. Chelsea won the competition in its previous format in 2022, beating Brazil´s Palmeiras in the final.
There will be special interest in how new Chelsea signing Liam Delap fares after his recent move from relegated Ipswich. The Blues beat Manchester United among other clubs in the race for the 22-year-old striker who netted 12 times in 37 top-flight matches and moved for Â£30 million ($41 million). Chelsea lacked firepower up front this season with Nicolas Jackson inconsistent and Christopher Nkunku struggling badly for form.
Delap, the son of former Stoke midfielder Rory Delap, came through the Manchester City youth academy like Chelsea´s star player, Cole Palmer. The England international´s revival towards the end of the season is a positive sign, with Palmer dazzling in the Conference League final win over Real Betis.
The 23-year-old missed Chelsea´s pre-season tour of the US last summer and Maresca said it was a chance for the playmaker to take the country by storm. “Palmer is up there with the very best top players who can produce something at any moment, create something out of nothing,” said the coach.
“He wasn´t with me on the USA tour last summer, so it will also be a chance for him to experience the environment there and to introduce himself to North America.” Beating Betis in Poland earned Maresca his first trophy as Chelsea manager and a deep run in the United States would be another sign that the Blues are heading in the right direction.
On an upwards trajectory and with a young squad, Chelsea have plenty of potential to improve in the years to come. “(Critics) were saying that we were not able to win... because we´re too young, because we´re not experienced,” said Maresca after sealing fourth place in the Premier League.
“Unfortunately for them, they have all been wrong.” Summer success is also important to the club´s co-owners, US businessman Todd Boehly and private equity firm Clearlake Capital, with nearly Â£100 million on the line for the winners.
While not among the set of top favourites, including English rivals Manchester City, 15-time European champions Real Madrid and PSG, Chelsea are still expected to reach the last eight. With fans not fully sold on Maresca´s brand of possession football, and even Palmer saying he was “sick” of the ball going from side to side in the Conference League final, another trophy could help soothe any building tension in south-west London.

US judge blocks Trump administration from overhauling federal elections,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321064-us-judge-blocks-trump-administration-from-overhauling-federal-elections,"BOSTON: A federal judge on Friday blocked President Donald Trump’s administration from implementing parts of his sweeping executive order overhauling federal elections, including by requiring proof of US citizenship to register to vote and barring states from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day.
US District Judge Denise Casper in Boston issued a preliminary injunction at the behest of 19 Democratic-led states who had argued that the Republican president lacked the authority to mandate changes to elections and the states’ voting procedures.
The lawsuit is one of several across the nation challenging Trump’s March 25 executive order, which he signed after years of raising doubts about the integrity of the US electoral system and falsely claiming that his 2020 loss to Democratic former President Joe Biden resulted from widespread voter fraud.
While parts of Trump’s order had already been blocked in April by a judge in Washington, Casper’s ruling went further as she concluded the states had established key pieces of the president’s order were likely unlawful and unconstitutional.
“The Constitution does not grant the president any specific powers over elections,” Casper, an appointee of Democratic President Barack Obama, wrote.

"France ‘determined’ to recognise state of Palestine, says foreign minister",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321065-france-determined-to-recognise-state-of-palestine-says-foreign-minister,"PARIS: French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Friday France was determined to recognise a Palestinian state despite what was happening in the region.France would “uphold the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination by recognising the State of Palestine,” Barrot said during his speech at the civil society event, “Paris Call for the Two-State Solution, Peace and Regional Security,” hosted by the Paris Peace Forum.
“I say it again here: whatever the recent developments in the region, France is determined to do so.”Barrot warned that it is time to bring a political solution to the Palestinians and that they will focus on it during the upcoming UN-backed conference on the two-state solution, co-organised by France and Saudi Arabia in New York later this month.
“This political solution involves the creation of a viable Palestinian state with renewed governance, strong security guarantees for both Israelis and Palestinians,” he said.Barrot urged for “courage” and “strong mobilisation” from the international community toward to “path of peace,” reiterating the need for “an immediate ceasefire, the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages, and the massive and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza.”
“The two-state solution, to which we remain firmly committed -- a condition for peace and security in the region, and a requirement under international law -- is now facing existential threats: the multiplication of unilateral measures on the ground, the acceleration of settlement expansion and the prospect of annexation, the deepening of hatred, and the collapse of the peace process,” he stressed.
Barrot said “too many” civilians were paying the price of the war in Gaza “that has gone on for far too long.”“We owe them our compassion, and every minute should be dedicated to achieving a ceasefire,” he said.

Pizza delivery monitor alerts to secret Israel attack,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321066-pizza-delivery-monitor-alerts-to-secret-israel-attack,"WASHINGTON: The timing of Israel´s plan to attack Iran was top secret. But Washington pizza delivery trackers guessed something was up before the first bombs fell.
About an hour before Iranian state TV first reported loud explosions in Tehran, pizza orders around the Pentagon went through the roof, according to a viral X account claiming to offer “hot intel” on “late-night activity spikes” at the US military headquarters. “As of 6:59 pm ET nearly all pizza establishments nearby the Pentagon have experienced a HUGE surge in activity,” the account “Pentagon Pizza Report” posted on Thursday.

Airlines halt many Middle East flights after Israel hits Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321067-airlines-halt-many-middle-east-flights-after-israel-hits-iran,"PARIS: Global airlines on Friday cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran and other Middle East destinations, or rerouted planes, as airspaces were shut off following Israeli strikes on Iran.
Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan and Syria closed their airspaces after Israel hit military and nuclear facilities in Iran. Israel said Tehran launched drones in retaliation. Air India´s New Delhi-Vienna and Mumbai-London flights were about to enter Iranian airspace when Israel launched its attack, forcing the planes to turn back to their origin, according to aircraft tracker Flight Aware.
Its London-New Delhi flight had just entered Iranian airspace and was rerouted over Iraq before arriving in India one hour late, according to Flight Aware. Air India diverted or called back a total of 16 flights between India and London and cities in Canada and the United States “due to the emerging situation in Iran”.
Emirates, the Middle East´s largest airline, cancelled flights to and from Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Iran after Israel launched the strikes. Qatar Airways, the country´s national carrier and one of the Middle East´s largest, said it had “temporarily cancelled flights to Iran and Iraq due to (the) current situation in the region”.
Air France said it was suspending its flights to and from Tel Aviv “until further notice” following the closure of Israeli airspace. “Air France is closely monitoring the situation in the Middle East in real time,” a spokesman for the French airline told AFP, adding that “the safety of its customers and crews is its absolute priority”.

Marines ordered by Trump to LA start deploying,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321068-marines-ordered-by-trump-to-la-start-deploying,"LOS ANGELES, United States: The first US Marines ordered by Donald Trump to Los Angeles will deploy late on Friday, the Pentagon said, raising the stakes in a standoff that pits the president against protesters claiming growing authoritarianism.
The approximately 200 Marines are part of a group of 700 set to join 4,000 National Guard soldiers, while local police conduct a crackdown on unrest over Trump´s sweeps for undocumented migrants. The Marines -- normally used as crack troops in foreign conflicts -- will be equipped with riot gear to guard a federal building starting from 12:00 pm (1900 GMT), Major General Scott Sherman told reporters.
An intense legal battle is underway over Trump´s authority to deploy troops on US soil, as the country braces for widespread protests Saturday, when the Republican will be overseeing a rare large-scale military parade in Washington.
The parade celebrates the 250th anniversary of the US Army but also coincides with Trump´s 79th birthday and will be the first time tanks and other heavy weaponry has rolled through the capital city in three decades.
A “No Kings” movement has sprung up promising to stage protests in more than 2,000 places across the country in response. Trump dispatched about the California National Guard to Los Angeles last weekend following mostly peaceful, but occasionally violent protests against a surge in immigration raids in the second-largest US city.

UK lawmakers vote to ban assisted dying ads,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321069-uk-lawmakers-vote-to-ban-assisted-dying-ads,"LONDON: British MPs on Friday backed a ban on adverts for assisted dying if proposed UK legislation allowing terminally ill people to be helped to die becomes law.
Protesters both for and against the bill gathered outside parliament, as lawmakers debated the contentious proposals for legalised euthanasia currently making their way through parliament. Opening the debate, the legislation´s sponsor MP Kim Leadbeater proposed an amendment that would require the government to introduce regulations banning advertisements promoting assisted dying services.
Lawmakers backed the amendment alongside another preventing health professionals raising the subject of euthanasia with child patients. MP Paul Waugh said he feared private companies could “profit from death”, arguing unsuccessfully for even tighter restrictions to prevent adverts than Leadbeater. “The online harm of an ad for a website about assisted dying shared on TikTok could be a reality” for teenagers without the very tightest of restrictions, he said.
The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill is at the report stage of the lengthy parliamentary process where lawmakers can propose amendments. The bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults with an incurable illness who have a life expectancy of fewer than six months and are able to take the substance that causes their death by themselves.

Joy and grief for lone India crash survivor’s family,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321070-joy-and-grief-for-lone-india-crash-survivor-s-family,"LEICESTER, United Kingdom: The UK-based family of the lone survivor of the Air India crash were torn on Friday between joy at his miracle escape and grief at the loss of his brother.
“We are happy Vishwash has been saved, but on the other hand we are just heartbroken about Ajay,” his cousin told AFP outside the family home in central Leicester. Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, 40, is believed to be the only person to have survived the crash when Air India Flight 171 plummeted from the sky shortly after taking off from the northern Indian city of Ahmedabad.
His brother, Ajay Kumar Ramesh, was on the same flight, but is believed to have perished in the disaster. There were 242 passengers and crew on the plane, including 53 British citizens. At least 24 people were killed on the ground, officials said, after the aeroplane landed on a canteen building where students were having lunch.
Since Thursday´s tragedy, the small Leicester street where Ramesh´s parents and younger brother lived has been flooded with visitors. Ramesh lives not far away with his wife and son, his cousin Hiren Kantilal, 19, told AFP.
Ajay also lived in the town, one of the oldest in England, and the two brothers ran a confectionary business together. “They are wonderful people, and heartful people. They are greatest men I have ever seen in my life, both of them,” said Kantilal.
The brothers were returning to the UK after spending a few weeks on holiday in India, and the family had been waiting to go and pick them up at Gatwick airport. Shortly after the crash, they were shocked when Ramesh, who had reportedly been in seat 11A, called his father to say he was alive. Ajay was seated at the other end of the row.
“Our plane has been crashed,” Ramesh told his dad, according to his cousin. “He was bleeding all over him, in the face and everything, and he said: ´I am just waiting for my brother and I don´t know how I get out of the plane´.
“He said: ´do not worry about me, try to find about Ajay Kumar´ and he said: ´I am totally fine´.” Kantilal said his cousin had waited for about 10 to 15 minutes seeking his brother, and then was whisked away to hospital by the rescue services.
Images which went viral on social media apparently showed Ramesh walking away from the wreckage of the 787-8 Boeing Dreamliner, and have been splashed across the front pages of British media along with a photo of him in his hospital bed.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid a visit to Ramesh on Friday at the hospital where he is being treated for burns and other injuries, footage on his YouTube channel showed. “Everything happened in front of me, and even I couldn´t believe how I managed to come out alive from that,” Ramesh said from his hospital bed, speaking in Hindi to national broadcaster DD News.
His parents had also been desperately trying to contact his brother Ajay on Thursday. “The call was going through, but no-one was answering the call,” Kantilal said. At the family home, relatives were frantically scanning their phones to try to buy a flight to Ahmedabad later on Friday afternoon. Downing Street said that the foreign ministry had been in touch with Ramesh to offer him consular assistance.

Two UK men jailed for ‘brazen’ gold toilet heist,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321071-two-uk-men-jailed-for-brazen-gold-toilet-heist,"LONDON: Two men who smashed their way into an historic English property and ripped out a £4.5 million ($6 million) solid-gold toilet were on Friday jailed for their part in the theft.
James Sheen, 40, and Michael Jones, 39, were jailed at Oxford Crown Court in central England for four years and 27 months respectively. The sentences came as it was revealed that Sheen is already serving 19 years in jail for a string of other offences including a museum burglary and attacks on cash machines.
The fully functioning 18-carat artwork was stolen in a raid on an exhibition at Blenheim Palace -- the birthplace of Winston Churchill -- near central Oxford in September 2019. The toilet artwork dubbed “America” was created by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan and had been on display as one of the star attractions at an exhibition in the 18th-century home.
Passing sentence, Judge Ian Pringle said: “This bold and brazen heist took no more than five-and-a-half minutes to complete. “America has never been seen again.” Weighing around 98 kilograms (216 pounds), the artwork was insured for $6 million and was made with 20 kilograms of gold valued at around £2.8 million.
It was stolen just hours after a glamorous exhibition launch party by the sledgehammer-wielding thieves. Prosecutors said the work was likely broken up or melted down and sold soon after the theft. The gold has not been recovered.
It is believed that Sheen took the 20 kilos of gold to the Birmingham Jewellery Quarter on September 2019 and sold it for £26,000 a kilogram -- earning £520,000. Jurors heard earlier that Sheen first got in touch with a third man, Frederick Doe, two days after the raid to ask if he could help him sell some of the gold.
Doe replied to Sheen in a WhatsApp message: “I do know just the man you need to see.” The 37-year-old, described by a judge as a “foolish” middleman, escaped jail for his role in the heist.
He was handed a suspended sentenced last month after being found guilty of conspiracy to transfer criminal property. Jones previously said he used the toilet at Blenheim Palace the day before it was taken. Asked what it was like, he told the court it was “splendid”.

Russia says it tests new laser defences against drones,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321072-russia-says-it-tests-new-laser-defences-against-drones,"MOSCOW: Russia said on Friday it had conducted large-scale tests of new laser-based systems to defend against drones.
A government statement described the new technology as “promising” and said it had been tested against various types of drone in different weather conditions. It said the anti-drone lasers would become part of a “universal air defence system” that President Vladimir Putin said this week Russia needed to build.
“The test results will be used to refine existing models and create systems capable of providing reliable protection against modern air attack weapons. Conducting tests allows us to move on to serial production and upscaling,” the statement said. An accompanying video showed charred debris from a destroyed drone.

EU extends Ukrainians’ right to stay until March 2027,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321073-eu-extends-ukrainians-right-to-stay-until-march-2027,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: EU countries on Friday approved a one-year extension of the temporary protection offered to Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia´s war, allowing them to stay in the bloc until March 2027.
Some 4.3 million Ukrainians are registered as refugees across the European Union, with Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic hosting the largest communities. “While Russia continues to terrorise Ukrainian civilians with indiscriminate air strikes the EU continues to show its solidarity,” said Tomasz Siemoniak, the interior minister of Poland, which holds the European Union´s rotating presidency.
“We will continue to offer protection for millions of Ukrainian refugees for another year”. The 27-nation bloc granted Ukrainians temporary protections in the weeks after Moscow´s full-scale invasion of its neighbour in February 2022.
After several roll-overs, the measure was set to expire next March -- but it will now be extended until March 4, 2027. The move, proposed by the European Commission last week, was backed by the European Council representing member states during a meeting of interior ministers in Luxembourg Friday with “unanimous support”, the council said.
Ministers also started debating preparations for an end of the system -- which is expected to see some Ukrainians return to their country, while others could seek the right to stay on in the bloc.
“The Polish presidency also initiated discussion on a strategy to phase out temporary protection once a just peace is achieved,” said Siemoniak. “In the near future, we will work towards common, EU-wide solutions in this area, including in the context of returns to Ukraine.”

"Nations advance ocean protection, vow to defend seabed",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321074-nations-advance-ocean-protection-vow-to-defend-seabed,"NICE, France: A global oceans summit wrapped up on Friday with world leaders taking major steps toward marine protection and vowing a showdown when nations meet to negotiate rules for deep-sea mining next month.
But as a cacophony of ship foghorns sounded the close of the UN Ocean Conference in France, a lack of funding pledges and the total omission of fossil fuels disappointed some observers. The summit was just the third -- and largest yet -- dedicated entirely to what the United Nations calls an “emergency” in the world´s oceans.
More than 60 heads of state and government joined thousands of business leaders, scientists and environmental campaigners over five days in the southern city of Nice. There was unanimous praise for efforts to ratify the high seas treaty designed to protect marine life in the 60 percent of oceans that lie beyond national waters. Some 19 countries formally ratified the pact at Nice, taking the overall tally to 50 -- but 60 nations are needed to bring the treaty into force.
