Crisis deepens in KP Public Service Commission,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316353-crisis-deepens-in-kp-public-service-commission,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Public Service Commission (KPPSC) is facing a severe crisis, with only three members currently serving out of the required eleven, although the chairman remains in place.
As a result, over 6,000 candidates are still awaiting their interviews, and the recruitment process is increasingly slowing down.
The delay is not only disrupting the internal operations of the commission but also adversely affecting recruitment across various provincial government departments, leaving applicants in deep uncertainty and distress.
Recently, Commission Member Razia Sultana resigned from her post after being appointed Vice Chancellor of Women University, Mardan. Sources say her resignation was primarily due to the uncompetitive salary package and lack of incentives offered to commission members.
Sources further revealed that a summary for the appointment of five new members has already been approved, and the chief minister has formally advised the Governor, who is the appointing authority under the law, to appoint them. However, for the past two weeks, the Governor’s signature on the file is awaited, further delaying critical recruitment processes. Well-placed officials also cited the salary gap as a major deterrent. While a BPS-19 government officer currently earns approximately Rs350,000 a month, KPPSC members are paid just Rs240,000, and the chairman receives Rs340,000. These figures are widely regarded as insufficient for the level of responsibility involved, making it difficult to attract competent professionals to these posts.

"Govt, sugar mills agree on cost audit, temporary price cut",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316354-govt-sugar-mills-agree-on-cost-audit-temporary-price-cut,"ISLAMABAD: The federal government and sugar millers on Wednesday agreed to appoint an independent third-party firm to audit sugar production costs — while millers also committed to temporarily reducing ex-mill prices to offer immediate relief to consumers until Eidul Azha.
This step of independent cost audit is aimed at ensuring transparency in the determination of production expenses and price setting, thereby creating a fair and data-driven pricing framework for the future. The agreement was reached during a follow-up meeting chaired by Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, amid growing concerns over pricing disputes and public outcry over rising costs of essential commodities.
Hussain welcomed the sugar mills’ decision to temporarily lower ex-mill sugar prices until Eidul Azha, calling it a positive step to provide immediate relief to consumers. He said the move reflected the industry’s willingness to cooperate with the government for market stability and public welfare. A new pricing formula, based on the audit findings and mutual consultation, will be finalised after Eid, he said.
The minister reaffirmed the government’s focus on curbing artificial inflation, strengthening regulatory oversight, and encouraging public-private coordination to protect consumers. Ensuring food security and fair pricing requires trust, data-driven policies and continued dialogue, he added.
The ministry pledged to maintain active engagement with all market players to promote responsible practices and protect public interest in the run-up to Eid and beyond.
As of now, the ex-mill price stands at Rs159 per kg, while the retail rate in the open market has shot past Rs180 per kg. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) puts the average retail price at Rs175/kg — far above the government’s officially fixed price of Rs164/kg, notified on March 19.
The current pricing dispute traces back to the government’s decision to allow the export of over 700,000 metric tonnes of sugar last year, when it had set the retail price at Rs144/kg. A 10-member committee, led by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, later on March 19, approved the current ex-mill price of Rs159/kg, up from Rs141.14/kg.
Official sources told The News that millers are now pressing for another hike to Rs164/kg, while the government is inclined to raise it modestly to Rs160/kg — pending the outcome of the cost audit.

Punjab to earmark Rs60bn to develop 60 archaeological & heritage sites,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316356-punjab-to-earmark-rs60bn-to-develop-60-archaeological-heritage-sites,"ISLAMABAD: The Punjab government has decided to earmark Rs60 billion in the upcoming provincial budget for the development of 60 archaeological and heritage sites across the province, in a major effort to boost cultural tourism and preserve historical assets.
The selected sites encompass a diverse range of museums and religious landmarks that represent multiple faiths. The development plan also covers the construction of supporting logistics and transportation infrastructure to improve accessibility and enhance the overall tourist experience.
The entire ecosystem will be developed to promote domestic tourism in the country’s largest populous province, including the reinvigoration of the Lahore Museum, which will be aligned with its rich history, at an estimated cost of Rs6 billion. Additionally, Taxila will be declared an International Heritage City, together with other important cities throughout Punjab.
According to top Punjab officials, PC-1 preparations for the development projects are already underway to ensure physical work begins at the start of the next fiscal year on July 1, avoiding a three-month delay in approvals.
The provincial government has developed an App for connecting 160 sites virtually for guiding the tourists in Murree and other selected areas of the province.
The provincial government has established the Tourist Force/Police, and the hiring process of 600 personnel is underway. Out of the total force, 200 personnel have been specifically deployed for Murree.
Out of the total 800 sites identified by Punjab government, which had largely remained neglected in the aftermath of 18th Constitutional Amendments in last one and a half decades, the government of Punjab has now decided to kick-start work on 60 sites to develop and promote domestic tourism in the province with the vision that everyone cannot afford to travel abroad.
The Lahore Museum will be developed by international standards in one year. Similarly, development of other archaeological sites will take some more time.
Keeping all tourism and heritage authorities aligned, the Punjab government also decided to rehabilitate 14 sites of PTDC along with important tourist destinations of tourist resorts.
To develop Taxila as an International Heritage City, the Punjab government is in the process of developing a comprehensive master plan on a short, medium, and long-term basis to attract domestic as well as international tourists to the historical city.
Under the short-term plan, the Punjab government will establish Taxila Heritage City’s Project Management Unit PMU, expansion of Taxila Museum, Digital Modelling of Taxila Monuments, construction of Ceremonial Gate, remodelling of roads, creation of Gandhara Crafts Street, creation of Open Air Museum at Bhir and Gandharan Tourist Trail to link Museum, Bhir, Dharmarajika, Sirkup, Mohra Muradu and Gandhara Art Village through electric carts may be placed on a short term list. The medium-term plan has been devised for the creation of a Tourist Facility, preservation of Sirkup Cluster with Kunala Complex, Kalawan Complex, and Ghiri Complex, further excavation at Bhir, and acquisition of Hathial Work of Gandhara Digital Archeology, Seismic Studies. Under the long-term plan, further expansion of the Tourist Trail to Ghiri and Bhallar is envisaged. The restoration of Dharmarajika, Mohra Moradu, Mankiala and Bhallar Complexes shall be major works in long term plan with any remaining works.
All these plans and visions of the Punjab CM cannot be fulfilled without the provision of a legal framework. For any interventions related to tourist activities, hotel construction, and restoration on World Heritage Site monuments, the intervention needs to be aligned with the frameworks and acts as applicable.
For legal protection of the World Heritage Site, the designated World Heritage Site area, under the protection of the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM), Punjab, falls within the jurisdiction of the Punjab Antiquities Act 1975.
The Section 10 of the Act states that any development or alteration within a protected immovable antiquity will require prior approval from the Director General. This provision imposes strict limitations on interventions, particularly regarding infrastructure development, to ensure the conservation and integrity of heritage assets. Any proposed modifications or construction activities within this area must comply with the legal framework outlined in the Act.
To ensure sustainable urban development while protecting the heritage site and its surroundings, the formulation and enforcement of specific byelaws and zoning regulations are imperative in line with the Habitat HUL framework.
When contacted, Senior Provincial Minister for Planning, Development, Environment and Tourism Marriyum Aurangzeb said that under the leadership of Punjab CM, the provincial government was developing a whole eco-system to promote domestic tourism in the Punjab. She said that there were sites which were ignored in the past, but now with effective planning, these will be preserved and promoted internationally.

Pakistan celebrates Youm-e-Takbeer with patriotic fervour,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316357-pakistan-celebrates-youm-e-takbeer-with-patriotic-fervour,"ISLAMABAD: The nation celebrated the Youm-e-Takbeer with patriotic fervour as rallies and ceremonies were held across the country to commemorate the day when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power.
Pakistan had announced a public holiday on Youm-e-Takbeer to remember the May 28, 1998, nuclear tests at the Ras Koh Hills in the Chagai District of Balochistan.
Codenamed Chagai-I, these tests marked Pakistan’s first public demonstration of its nuclear weapons capability, making it the seventh nation in the world and the first Muslim country to possess nuclear arms. This decision came as a direct response to India’s Pokhran-II nuclear tests, conducted earlier in May of the same year.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed their commitment to protecting Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity as the nation observed the 27th anniversary of its nuclear tests.
In his message on the occasion of Youm-e-Takbeer, the president stated that Pakistan’s nuclear capability, amid the current evolving regional security situation, continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees our peace and ensures that no one can undermine the country’s sovereignty and national security.
President Zardari said: “On this momentous occasion of Youm-e-Takbeer, I extend my heartfelt felicitations to the entire nation. Today, we observe the 27th anniversary of Youm-e-Takbeer — a day when we demonstrated our nuclear capabilities and established strategic deterrence.”
“This day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country,” the president added.
The president underscored that the nation, on this day, pays rich tribute to the scientists, engineers, and civil and military leadership, whose dedication and commitment made this achievement possible.
“We also pay tribute to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who laid the foundation of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, which made the country’s defence impregnable. We also acknowledge the role of Benazir Bhutto, whose stewardship further advanced and strengthened our nuclear programme,” he said.
President Zardari underlined that Pakistan does not seek conflict and is committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. In the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression, he said, Pakistan demonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace. “Our calibrated response, under Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, was measured and effective, which forced the enemy to cease its hostile actions,” President Zardari added.
The president urged the nation to renew its pledge while commemorating Youm-e-Takbeer, to uphold and safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
Also, PM Shehbaz hailed Pakistan’s nuclear journey and called for renewed unity and determination to transform the country into an economic power.
In his message on the occasion, the prime minister thanked Allah Almighty and congratulated the people of Pakistan, saying: “Today on Youm-e-Takbeer, I thank Allah Almighty and congratulate from the core of my heart the entire nation and all patriotic Pakistanis.”
Marking 27 years since Pakistan became the seventh nuclear power in the world and the first among Muslim nations, PM Sharif emphasized that Youm-e-Takbeer was more than a celebration and was a solemn reminder of Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty.
The premier linked this year’s commemoration with what he described as Pakistan’s recent success in defending itself from “an unjustified war imposed by India”. He hailed the nation’s spirit during the May 6-10 confrontation, stating: “The joys of Youm-e-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.”
Reflecting on the historic nuclear tests of May 28, 1998, conducted under the leadership of the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the PM noted that the decision to respond with six nuclear tests, compared to India’s five, was a demonstration of “iron resolve” in the face of global pressure and sanctions.
PM Shehbaz paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan’s nuclear programme including Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the scientific community, and the armed forces for their role in establishing Pakistan’s deterrent capability. He also lauded the public for its unwavering support and sacrifices throughout the journey. “I salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith,” he stated.
Drawing parallels between the historic journey of Pakistan’s nuclear programme and the formation of Pakistan itself, he invoked the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and said: “National history is a witness that the people and political leadership of Pakistan have always made the impossible possible.”
PM Shehbaz urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-e-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation. He said Youm-e-Takbeer is a day of unity of the nation and declaration of non-compromise on its freedom and sovereignty. “Today we pledge to make Pakistan an economic power and achieve its true place in the world. Insha Allah. Long live Pakistan.”
The armed forces of Pakistan, along with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and services chiefs, extended heartfelt felicitations to the people of Pakistan on the 27th anniversary of Youm-e-Takbeer.
According to an Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) news release, Youm-e-Takbeer commemorates the momentous occasion in 1998 when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power, restoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence.
This historic achievement epitomises the nation’s resolve, unity, and unwavering pursuit of a dignified and peaceful existence.
Pakistan’s strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people. The commemoration of Youm-e-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan’s defence unassailable, the ISPR said.
This day underscores Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity. It affirms our doctrine of credible minimum deterrence, rooted in the principle of maintaining peace and strategic stability in the region.
The ISPR said the armed forces reiterate their unflinching resolve to defend the motherland against all threats across the full spectrum of conflict. As responsible custodians of the nation’s strategic assets, we reaffirm that our nuclear capability remains solely for defensive purposes and stands as a guarantor of peace, it added.
“Let this day renew our collective pledge to remain vigilant, united, and resolute in our commitment to the security, progress, and prosperity of our beloved homeland.
“The armed forces stand in solidarity with the nation, honouring the sacrifices that made this milestone possible and continuing the journey toward strength, stability, and self-reliance,” the military’s media wing maintained.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office of Pakistan said the nation reaffirms its unwavering commitment to stand united in safeguarding Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and independence against any threat or act of aggression. “We remain resolute in our dedication to promoting peace and stability — both in the region and beyond — through collective strength and unity,” the FO said.
Meanwhile, federal and provincial ministers and local leadership of PMLN said that in the recent Indo-Pak war, the brave armed forces of nuclear Pakistan changed the balance of power in the region. Despite intense international pressure, Nawaz Sharif had given a message of sovereignty to India by carrying out 6 nuclear explosions. On May 10, in response to Indian aggression, our brave armed forces sealed this sovereignty.
They expressed these views while addressing the Youm-e-Takbeer ceremony organised by the PMLN. Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi, Federal Parliamentary Secretary for Information Daniyal Chaudhry, Senior Provincial Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb also spoke at the ceremony.
On this occasion, members of the National and Provincial Assembly of PMLN, party officials, workers and citizens participated in large numbers.
Meanwhile, Mayor Karachi Barrister Murtaza Wahab emphasized the historical significance of May 28, marking it as a pivotal day in Pakistan’s history. Celebrating this day as Youm-e-Takbeer commemorates Pakistan’s emergence as a nuclear power fulfilling the vision of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of making the nation’s defence unassailable.
The mayor paid tribute to all contributors to this achievement highlighting the resolute message it sends to any adversaries. Speaking to the media at a rally at Frere Hall, Wahab underscored the determination and unity symbolised by Youm-e-Takbeer.
The mayor reiterated that the day is a reminder of Pakistan’s readiness to defend itself reflecting national sovereignty and pride. The event was attended by Deputy Mayor Karachi Salman Abdullah Murad, Municipal Commissioner Afzal Zaidi among other dignitaries and citizens.  Rallies were also organized in all major cities of the country.

ECP postpones Senate by-poll in Punjab,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316358-ecp-postpones-senate-by-poll-in-punjab,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Wednesday decided to postpone the by-election for a general seat in Punjab on the eve of polling, owing to the hearing in reserved seats case in the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
According to the schedule announced by the Election Commission, all the related process had been completed and polling was due in the Punjab Assembly Thursday.
A senior official of the Election Commission confirmed to The News that the polling process had been postponed keeping in view the pending case of reserved seats in the apex court and ‘incomplete quorum of seats’.
He explained that the date for the by-election will now most likely to be announced after the issue of reserved seats is settled and the apex court delivers its related judgement.
The general seat had fallen vacant following the passing away of Senator Prof Sajid Mir on May 3, who had made his way to the Senate on the PMLN ticket.

Imran rejects dialogue path despite Gandapur’s ‘important message’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316359-imran-rejects-dialogue-path-despite-gandapur-s-important-message,"ISLAMABAD: Just as hopes for a fresh round of dialogue between the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and the federal government appeared to be gaining momentum -- reportedly with encouragement from key quarters -- PTI Chairman Imran Khan has opted once again for mass mobilisation over negotiations.
According to well-placed sources, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Ameen Gandapur had recently told Khan and his party leaders to have received a positive signal from the ‘right quarters’ to initiate talks with the federal government. These signals were interpreted as an indirect nod from the establishment, which has distanced itself from direct political engagement with PTI in recent months.
However, when the message was conveyed to the incarcerated PTI chief, he reportedly declined the offer and instructed his party leadership to prepare for street agitation instead. Party insiders claim that Khan remains convinced that public pressure remains the most effective tool to force a political breakthrough.
This marks the second major breakdown of a possible dialogue initiative in recent months. In November last year, another attempt collapsed when PTI’s leadership, allegedly under the influence of former First Lady Bushra Bibi, decided to push its rally beyond Sangjani to D-Chowk in Islamabad. The move, sources admit, alienated potential mediators and hardened the other side’s stance at a time when it was reportedly open to talks.
Interestingly, this time around, Barrister Gohar had conveyed Khan’s approval in principle to respond positively to a public dialogue offer made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the floor of the National Assembly. The offer came in the wake of PTI’s rare display of unity with the government and armed forces during the recent border tensions with India. Yet, within a week, Khan reversed his position in a subsequent meeting with senior party leaders, citing a “misunderstanding” and reiterating that no negotiations would take place unless they were directly with the establishment.
Sources familiar with internal deliberations said that CM Gandapur informed the PTI leadership that there was a clear indication from influential power brokers to move ahead with government-level talks. Leaders aligned with Gandapur believe that any understanding with the government would carry the implicit endorsement of the establishment and could open doors for legal relief for Khan as well as a broader political normalisation. However, with the establishment firmly refusing to engage directly, attention has now turned to a delegation of US-based Pakistani doctors currently visiting Pakistan. Speculation is rife that informal backchannel efforts could be channeled through this group to help break the deadlock.
Despite repeated setbacks, there remains cautious optimism within some PTI circles that dialogue remains the only viable path forward. But with Khan once again betting on street power over negotiation, the stalemate appears far from over.
It is believed the move to push for or prefer agitation and commotion over negotiations would certainly cost the PTI an opportunity to settle things before any adverse decisions are announced in May 9 cases or second Toshakhana reference. Mass mobilisation to secure release of Imran Khan is seemingly impossible, a source said, adding adversarial legal battle is not over yet and is time consuming.

Trump aide claims tariffs helped broker India-Pakistan ceasefire,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316360-trump-aide-claims-tariffs-helped-broker-india-pakistan-ceasefire,"KARACHI: A top aide to US President Donald Trump has claimed that Trump’s use of tariffs and trade incentives was instrumental in brokering the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, warning that curtailing presidential power could undermine regional security and derail future diplomatic efforts.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made the assertion in a legal filing submitted to the US Court of International Trade (CIT) on May 23. The filing was part of the Trump administration’s defence against a lawsuit brought by small businesses challenging the legality of sweeping global tariffs imposed during Trump’s presidency.
The tariffs, which affected nearly all US trading partners, were enacted under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — a law intended to address national emergencies. The Trump administration has argued that IEEPA grants the president broad discretion to impose economic measures not just for economic reasons but also as diplomatic and national security tools.
“This ceasefire was only achieved after President Trump interceded and offered both nations trading access with the United States to avert a full-scale war”, Lutnick stated in the court filing. “An adverse ruling that constrains presidential power in this case could lead India and Pakistan to question the validity of President Trump’s offer, threatening the security of an entire region and the lives of millions.”
While Pakistan has acknowledged Washington’s role in defusing tensions, India has strongly denied that any international mediation was involved. Indian Foreign Minister S Jaishankar has publicly maintained that the truce was the result of direct talks initiated by the Pakistani military.
The claim marks the first time Trump’s administration has cited trade leverage as a peacekeeping tool in an official court document. However, Trump had previously alluded to it publicly and on his social media platform, Truth Social.
On May 10, Trump was the first to announce what he called a US-brokered ceasefire between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. “Not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great Nations”, he posted a day later, linking trade access to the de-escalation. Two days later, he claimed at a White House event: “I said, come on, we’re gonna do a lot of trade with you guys. Let’s stop it. Let’s stop it. If you stop it, we’ll do a trade. If you don’t stop it, we’re not gonna do any trade.”
Despite Indian resistance to Trump’s narrative, his administration has continued to double down on the link between trade and peace in the ongoing legal battle.
The lawsuit before the CIT argues that the IEEPA does not authorise the imposition of tariffs for routine trade matters, and should be reserved for “unusual and extraordinary threats.”
In addition to Lutnick, the court received statements from US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, all supporting the view that IEEPA tariffs are a vital part of the president’s foreign policy toolkit.
Lutnick also cited China as a success story for Trump’s tariff strategy, claiming that punitive levies “applied additional pressure” on Beijing to lower its own tariffs on US goods and return to the negotiating table.

FBR briefs Aurangzeb on tax proposals,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316361-fbr-briefs-aurangzeb-on-tax-proposals,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has briefed the Minister for Finance, Muhammad Aurangzeb, on a variety of tax proposals received from different stakeholders with regard to the upcoming budget.
The minister was briefed in the last 48 hours on a variety of tax proposals and shared the reasons for acceptance or rejection of the tax proposals going to be incorporated in the upcoming Finance Bill 2025-26.
The government has decided in principle to tighten its noose against potential tax dodgers with the possibility to incorporate all proposals which were introduced through in shape of Tax Laws Amendment Bill 2025 as part of the next Finance Bill 2025-26.
It has been proposed that the GST exemption on import of solar panels may be withdrawn but it is under consideration to impose reduced rate of GST. If the GST rate of 18 percent is slapped on imported panels, it will increase the price of solar panels in the domestic market. There are other products where there is reduced rate of GST, including fertilizer, pesticides and some other items.
On the income tax side, the government had proposed restrictions on property transactions beyond Rs10 million as the eligible person was supposed to declare assets in the filed returns of the last five years. It was decided that Income Tax Law under section 114C, in clause (1) (b), the word “Board” be replaced with the word “Federal Government”. The federal government will determine the value threshold for transactions affected by this restriction to ensure that property transactions conducted by common citizens and the lower- and middle-income class, particularly first-time property buyers or those purchasing their primary residential property, are not impacted.
For declaring ineligible, the “sufficient resources” shall mean one hundred and thirty percent of the cash and equivalent assets comprising cash denominated in local or foreign currency, fair market value of gold, net realisable value of stocks, bonds, receivables or any other cash equivalent asset as may be prescribed, declared by a person either in his sources of investment and expenditure statement, or wealth statement filed for the latest tax year and in the case of a company or association of persons, cash and equivalent assets, declared in the financial statements attached with the income tax return for the latest tax year: Provided that where an asset mentioned in sub-section (1), other than its clause (d), has been purchased by way of exchange of capital assets already declared in the wealth statement, or financial statement, or sources of investment and expenditure statement, the disposal of such capital assets shall be treated to be part of cash equivalent assets to the extent of value mentioned in the agreement.”

"BCCI to invite armed forces chiefs to IPL final, echoing Pakistan’s PSL",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316362-bcci-to-invite-armed-forces-chiefs-to-ipl-final-echoing-pakistan-s-psl,"ISLAMABAD: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Indian Cricket Board (BCCI) have decided to invite the Indian armed forces service chiefs to the closing ceremony of the Indian Premier League (IPL), in what seems like a move copying the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
The IPL final will be played in Gujarat state -- at the Ahmedabad Narendra Modi stadium on June 3. Indian TV channels have reported that the BCCI, following in the footsteps of the PCB, has made arrangements for the final. In Pakistan, the PSL final was played in Lahore, where President Asif Ali Zardari was present as the chief guest. In an earlier match in Rawalpindi, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir was the chief guest. Likewise, in the presence of their respective chiefs, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and Pakistan Navy (PN) were paid befitting tributes as well.
The BCCI chief has also announced a donation of INR 20 crores to the Indian armed forces on the occasion, presumably for their role in Operation Sindoor.

Awais not at ease with Nepra decisions about K-Electric,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316363-awais-not-at-ease-with-nepra-decisions-about-k-electric,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Power Division Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari has voiced concerns over the multiple decisions taken by Nepra about K-Electric arguing these will pose serious implications for the power sector.
In his X tweet, Leghari said that the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) has observed some serious concerns regarding Nepra’s multiple decisions about K-Electric’s licenses for generation, transmission, distribution, and supply. These decisions also touch upon the investment plan for the upcoming multi-year tariff period.
“These rulings have significant long-term effects on consumer tariffs and the federal government’s subsidies within a uniform tariff regime.”
He asserted that the Power Division was planning to review the recently issued determinations related to transmission, distribution, and supply. Meanwhile, a reconsideration of the earlier generation tariff decision is awaiting Nepra’s attention, despite being submitted back in December 2024. “This delay poses serious financial implications for the power sector and its subsidies.”
“Additionally, if certain areas are not addressed, they could negatively impact consumers and the regulatory environment, potentially hindering Pakistan’s efforts to encourage private participation in the distribution sector.”

FO hits out at Modi over ‘inflammatory monologue’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316364-fo-hits-out-at-modi-over-inflammatory-monologue,"ISLAMABAD: For the second time this week, Pakistan condemned remarks by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and asked him to clear his conscience before issuing threats to others as was expected from a leadership truly in pursuit of international respect.
“It is regrettable, though not entirely unexpected, that the Indian prime minister has, once again, set aside the ongoing project of historical revisionism and the internal repression of minorities to deliver yet another inflammatory monologue. His references to weaponising water, a shared, treaty-bound resource, reflect a troubling departure from international norms and a stark contrast between India’s conduct in the region and its declared global ambitions,” said the Foreign Office on Wednesday.
Speaking to a youth rally in Gujrat, Modi questioned the contents of the Indus Waters Treaty. He said, “If you study the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, you’ll be shocked.” He continued, “It was decided that the dams built on the rivers of Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned… For 60 years, these gates were never opened. Reservoirs that were supposed to be filled to 100 per cent capacity have now been reduced to only 2pc or 3pc.” Stating that the treaty has only been held in abeyance as of now, he added, “Right now, I haven’t done anything, and people are sweating there [in Pakistan].”
In a terse reminder, Pakistan reminded Modi that the Indian government was linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion and was in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression, it was pointed out. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood.
“The ideological followers of India’s current government have normalised mob violence, promoted hate campaigns and targeted religious minorities. Such acts may serve domestic optics but cannot withstand international scrutiny. Nor do they inspire confidence in India’s image as a responsible regional power,” added the Foreign Office.
Instead, Pakistan urged India to return to the core principles of international order, including respect for sovereign rights of others and its treaty obligations, as well as restraint in both language and action.
“Jingoism may stir applause on the campaign trail, but it undermines long-term peace and stability. India’s youth, often the first casualty of chauvinistic nationalism, would do well to reject the politics of fear and instead work toward a future defined by dignity, reason, and regional cooperation,” said the statement.
Meanwhile Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar will visit Hong Kong, Special Administrative Region of People’s Republic of China, on May 29-30, 2025 to participate in the signing ceremony for the Convention on Establishment of International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed). He will sign the IOMed Convention and address the ceremony on May 30, 2025 and also hold several bilateral engagements on the sidelines of the meeting.
“Pakistan believes that peace and security, as well as global prosperity, can be promoted and preserved through strict adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, faithful implementation of UN Security Council resolutions as well as international law. Mediation, diplomacy, dialogue, and international cooperation constitute important cornerstones of this comprehensive approach,” said the Foreign Office while announcing the visit.
Pakistan has joined the IOMed as one of its founding members and remains strongly supportive of the aims and objectives of IOMed, recognising its potential for mediation as well as peaceful and pacific settlement of international disputes.

PMLN files additional grounds in reserved seats case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316365-pmln-files-additional-grounds-in-reserved-seats-case,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) will resume today (Thursday) hearing into review petitions filed against its judgment of July 12, 2024 declaring that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was entitled to get reserved seats for women and minorities in the National and provincial assemblies.
An 11-member constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, headed the review petitions case of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) against July 12, 2024 judgment on reserved seats for women and minorities in National and provincial assemblies.
Other members of the bench included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Musarat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi.
Faisal Siddiqui, counsel for Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), will continue his arguments on the point of maintainability of the instant review petitions.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the PMLN filed additional grounds in its review petition through an application in detailed as well as main judgment given on July 12, 2024 in the reserved seats case.
Filed through its counsel Barrister Haris Azmat, the PMLN contended that the powers under Article 187 of the Constitution were used in contradiction to establish judicial principles in the July 12 decision regarding reserved seats.
“These powers under Article 187 are meant to be used only in pending cases to ensure complete justice,” the PMLN submitted adding that the Sunni Ittehad Council had filed an appeal with 80 members to claim reserved seats. However, as a result of the court’s decision, the Sunni Ittehad Council is now left with zero members.
The PMLN further submitted that the powers under Article 187 are not unlimited adding that the issues on which the court gave its decision were never part of the official court record.
“Moreover, none of the 80 members of the Sunni Ittehad Council appeared before the court,” the application contended adding that the Sunni Ittehad Council and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) cannot be considered the same political party.
The PMLN submitted that it is an admitted position that the list of eighty (80) candidates shown in the list provided by the ECP (“ECP List”) all contested as independent candidates. None of the said candidates came to this court or the forums disputing this fact.
Furthermore, all eighty (80) candidates being independent have joined SIC and have given an affidavit to this effect. Neither they were impleaded before this court by the appellants nor were heard, the PMLN submitted.
It prayed that in view of the same, the unilateral observations against the record in the detailed reasoning from Paragraph No 106 onwards are liable to be recalled.
It further contended that taking up the case of forty-one (41) candidates from the ECP List, it is submitted that they have not shown linkage with PTI in any of the columns in the ECP List.
“It is shocking and surprising that the said candidates have been given fifteen (15) days to join any party,” the PMLN submitted adding that on the contrary, the Constitution provides three (3) days to do so, and that too from the date of their notification as a Returned Candidate.
It contended that in view of the same, there are two glaring errors apparent on the face of the record from the said findings alone: (i) the independent candidates cannot be given any choice that two months after the election and especially after they have joined a political party to join another party; (ii) when the Constitution provides only three days in terms of Article 51(6)(d) then the courts have no power to rewrite the Constitution.
The PMLN submitted that when the detailed reasoning itself has acknowledged in part (Paragraph No66, 79, 80) that SIC is not entitled to the reserved seats, then it could not have gone ahead and granted those seats to PTI, which was not before the court nor claimed the same before any forums below.
It prayed the court that the findings recorded are erroneous and are liable to be recalled. It further prayed to the court to allow this application to bring these additional grounds on the record in the interest of justice.

UK records sunniest spring in over a century,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316366-uk-records-sunniest-spring-in-over-a-century,"LONDON: The UK had its sunniest spring since records began, the Met Office said on Wednesday after weeks of above-average temperatures and dry weather in the country known for its rainy days.
With 630 hours of sunshine between March 1 and May 27, 2025 was the sunniest spring since 1910, the Met office said.
It beat the previous record set in 2020 by four hours -- with four days of the season still remaining.
“It has indeed been an extremely sunny and dry spring for the majority,” said Met Office scientist Emily Carlisle.
“But with a few days left of the season and more unsettled weather this week, it’s too early to say what will happen with other records.”
Other statistics, including for rainfall, are due to be published next week.
It has been a spring of records, as Britain logged its hottest ever May Day with temperatures soaring to 29.3 degrees Celsius (84.7 degrees Fahrenheit), after recording its sunniest ever April.
England also saw its driest start to spring in 69 years according to the government’s environment agency, raising fears of drought and stunted crops among farmers.
Earlier this month, the Environment Agency called a meeting of its national drought group after it said levels in reservoirs were “exceptionally low”.
Seven out of the 10 sunniest springs on record in the UK took place after 2000, according to the Met Office.
However in the spring of 2024, the country saw just 377 hours of sunshine, making it one of the dreariest on record.
Scientists warn that extreme and fluctuating weather events are becoming increasingly common as planet-heating fossil fuel emissions keep rising.

Eleven bodies found on boat washed up on Caribbean island,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316368-eleven-bodies-found-on-boat-washed-up-on-caribbean-island,"WASHINGTON: A boat carrying the remains of 11 people washed ashore on one of the islands of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, police said, adding that they were investigating the situation.
Officers discovered the bodies on Monday after receiving a report of a “suspicious vessel found along the coastline,” the Royal St. Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force said in a statement
The 14-meter-long (45-feet-long) vessel containing the bodies was found on the small island of Canouan, a tourist spot dotted with luxury hotels and white-powdered beaches.
Photos shared by police showed a small boat tipped on its side washed up on the sand.
“The remains were in an advanced state of decomposition, and some were not fully intact,” it said.
“Several passports were recovered at the scene, which appear to be from the Republic of Mali.”
Authorities were working to formally identify the bodies, which had been transported to the Caribbean nation’s capital Kingstown, the statement said.

Polypharmacy turns treatment into exploitation in Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316322-polypharmacy-turns-treatment-into-exploitation-in-pakistan,"ISLAMABAD: In a shocking case of medical excess, a 72-year-old female patient suffering from multiple chronic illnesses  including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, chronic kidney disease, hypothyroidism and Parkinson’s  was handed a prescription containing more than 34 medicines, many of them from the same therapeutic classes.
The prescription, issued by a senior internal medicine specialist in Islamabad, included antiplatelets, antihypertensives, thyroid supplements, calcium and vitamin D preparations, proton pump inhibitors, sedatives, antipsychotics and renal powders  stacked across the day in various combinations. This raises serious ethical concerns over irrational prescribing patterns, potentially motivated by financial incentives rather than patient welfare. This is not an isolated case. An in-depth review of prescriptions by psychiatrists, cardiologists, nephrologists, and orthopedic specialists from Islamabad shows a disturbing pattern of polypharmacy  patients being burdened with a laundry list of medicines, often duplicative or conflicting in action.
One psychiatrist prescribed nine different medications, including multiple sedatives and antidepressants with overlapping effects, to a young female patient coping with anxiety and sleep issues. In another instance, a cardiologist prescribed four cardiovascular medications along with supplements and painkillers, some of which were not clinically justified for the patient’s profile.
Multiple prescriptions also revealed the simultaneous use of two or more medications from the same class  such as two different proton pump inhibitors, sedatives like alprazolam and zolpidem together, or overlapping vitamin D preparations  which goes against rational pharmacological practices and significantly increases the risk of drug interactions, organ toxicity and long-term side effects.
Patients, many from low- to middle-income backgrounds, pay consultation fees ranging from Rs3,000 to Rs6,000 in private clinics only to walk away with prescriptions that can cost Rs10,000 to Rs20,000 monthly, often without any clarity or counseling on what is actually necessary. This unchecked and unethical prescribing practice is not only a burden on the patient’s finances but a serious threat to their safety and well-being.
Healthcare professionals and insiders blame the pharma-physician nexus  a toxic relationship where pharmaceutical companies allegedly incentivize doctors with foreign trips, gifts, cash payments and sponsorships to promote their branded drugs. In return, doctors write longer prescriptions, often including unnecessary medications just to meet sales targets.
Dr Faisal Sultan, a renowned public health expert and former federal health minister, acknowledged the gravity of the issue but cautioned against knee-jerk regulatory responses. “Yes, this is an issue. But then when our authorities take notice, if it sometimes ends up being over reach and restrictions with unintended consequences,” he said. According to Dr Sultan, there is no magic solution but a combination of small steps. “Education, reminders, a little inquiry, a little pushback  that’s what works.”
He suggested that patients should contest prescriptions, submit written complaints with evidence to the PMDC, and ask questions. “Very often people with chronic and multiple conditions will have justifiable long lists,” he said. “Anyone with hypertension may justifiably have two or three medications. Add diabetes, hyperuricemia  and it grows. It’s tricky. Not easy.”
Dr Sultan, currently the chief executive officer of the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, also shared practical steps taken at SKMCH&RC to combat this menace. “First, pharma reps are not allowed to visit our doctors. Second, we use structured prescriptions. Third, we have pharmacy review of each item  including dose and drug interaction  and for antibiotics, there’s a full stewardship program.” He also advocated introducing a standardized prescription format with a column for clinical indication beside each drug, and for warning patients about the dangers of polypharmacy and potential drug interactions.
Officials at the Pakistan Medical and Dental Commission (PMDC), speaking on condition of anonymity, admitted that patients across Pakistan are being burdened with unnecessary prescriptions, diagnostic tests, and even procedures. “Many of these are not required but are being done routinely,” one official said. While they advised patients to approach provincial healthcare commissions and the Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority, they also conceded that in extreme cases, complaints could be filed with the PMDC as well. However, they were quick to admit that the roots of the problem are deeper. “This is an ethical issue, and unfortunately, ethics are not being properly taught at the undergraduate level in our medical colleges. Without instilling moral responsibility in future doctors, reforms will remain incomplete,” one official said. They also called for mass education to empower patients to question unjustified prescriptions.

"Nawaz was unwilling for N-tests, claims Omar Ayub",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316323-nawaz-was-unwilling-for-n-tests-claims-omar-ayub,"ISLAMABAD: On the 27th anniversary of Pakistan’s nuclear tests, Youm-e-Takbeer, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub claimed on Wednesday that the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif was initially unwilling to go ahead with the nuclear tests, citing negotiations with the United States.
“May 28, 1998 was the day Nawaz Sharif’s legs were trembling. He had refused to conduct the nuclear tests and was negotiating a deal with the US administration to avoid going nuclear,” he said in a statement issued here.
Omar Ayub claimed that Nawaz Sharif was ultimately compelled to authorise the nuclear tests due to significant pressure from key figures within the government and national leadership.
“My late father Gohar Ayub Khan, the late Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the late Majeed Nizami, Raja Zafarul Haq, and Sheikh Rashid Ahmad, strongly advocated in the cabinet meeting for proceeding with the tests,” he claimed and noted that their firm stance left the cabinet with no choice but to agree.
Omar Ayub stated that Shehbaz Sharif himself had confided in his father that a deal was being discussed with the US government. “Shehbaz Sharif told my father that Nawaz Sharif was engaging in negotiations with the American president in return for not conducting the nuclear tests. My father responded by stating that Pakistan was fully prepared and must proceed,” he said.
Omar Ayub paid tribute to the efforts of those who ensured Pakistan’s defence and sovereignty by making the nation a declared nuclear power. “We remember and honour the patriots who stood firm in the national interest and safeguarded Pakistan’s strategic future,” he said.

French military reacts to Rafale downing by Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316324-french-military-reacts-to-rafale-downing-by-pakistan,"PARIS: The French military spokesperson’s reaction to the downing of France’s Rafale fighter jet by the Pakistan Air Force in the recent Indo-Pakistan war has been revealed.
On May 7, Pakistan shot down seven Indian aircraft, including three Rafales, in response to India’s aggression on Pakistani territory.
The international media has described the downing of modern aircraft like Rafale at the hands of the Pakistan Air Force as a humiliating defeat for India. According to military experts, Pakistan has proved its air superiority over India by shooting down modern aircraft like Rafale for the first time.
A French military spokesman has responded to this during a routine press briefing in Paris, saying that the details of the incident are still uncertain and many aspects need to be confirmed.
He said that France is closely monitoring the situation regarding Rafale’s performance and is in direct contact with its partner India to obtain information.
The spokesman said that according to reports, hundreds of aircraft participated in this battle, France wants to learn as much as possible from the experience of this battle. If the reports of the downing of a Rafale prove to be correct, it would be the first incident in the two decades of operational service of this aircraft.
In a briefing on May 9, in response to a question about the loss of Rafale aircraft, Air Marshal AK Bharti of the Indian Air Force said, “Losses are part of the fight and I cannot give more details than that, it benefits the opposing side.”
It should be noted that India purchased 36 Rafale aircraft from France after the destruction of two of its aircraft by Pakistan in 2019. Some 3 Rafale were destroyed by Pakistan in the recent war.

UK think tank notes Pakistan-India ceasefire remains fragile,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316325-uk-think-tank-notes-pakistan-india-ceasefire-remains-fragile,"LONDON: Experts at a leading defence strategy think thank have feared that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan remains fragile and the talks of the two South Asian rivals at a neutral or third party country could help restore stability in the region.
The discussion was arranged at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), a London-based think-tank, titled ‘The India-Pakistan military conflict and prospects for regional stability and security” to discuss what really happened when the two countries went to war a few days ago and the conflicting narratives and the aftermath.
In response to the Pahalgam attack on 22 April, India launched missile strikes in Pakistan on the night of 6th and 7th May. This led to a Pakistani counter-response and subsequent exchanges of drone and missile strikes and shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) by both countries, till a ceasefire was first announced by US President Donald Trump on 10 May.
Rahul Roy-Chaudhury, IISS Senior Fellow and Head of the South and Central Asian Programme, noted that there has been a sea of misinformation and disinformation from media and governments during the war, enabling both countries to proclaim victory and the successful attainment of their military objectives. He said: “The conflict has resulted in a hardening of both country’s position towards the other. India’s revised counter-terror doctrine, based on the next terror attack being an ‘act of war’, has created a new spectrum for future conflicts of potentially deadly nature. Pakistan has described the suspension of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) as an ‘act of war’ to which it would respond ‘with full force across the complete spectrum of national power’; and has suspended the Simla Agreement that validates the LoC.”
Rahul Roy-Chaudhury said that the fact that Pakistan’s Army Chief, Asim Munir, has been promoted as Field Marshal, shows that he “has emerged stronger and more popular after the contrast”.
“The regeneration of private and informal ‘track 1.5’ dialogues between Indian and Pakistani senior officials and influential experts held in third-party countries provide the best immediate prospect of a return to regional stability,” he added.
IISS expert Desmond Bowen said that before 22 April 2025, South Asia seemed to be a beacon of tranquillity in comparison to Europe, Africa and East Asia. “This has now gone. The risk register of South Asia is back at the top of international concerns. He said: “This conflict was not a self-regulating outbreak of violence. There was a need for outside intervention, which came from the UK, France, Saudi Arabia, UAE and the US. Although this started with the Pahalgam, the follow through came from both India and Pakistan. Both sides were willing to take risks in how they escalated the conflict.”
He said that both India and Pakistan don’t afford a war or the continuation of hot conflict. He said that Pakistan had serious economic issues to deal with whereas and a major conflict is not suitable to India as it seeks to lead in tech outsourcing and increase its technical capabilities. He said the risks had increased on both sides and its also proven that the world is interested in the possibility and avoidance of nuclear war.
IISS expert Antoine Levesques said that India and Pakistan have absorbed lessons from the Russia-Ukraine conflict in terms of the use of drones and missiles and the ability to use escalation as defence. He said the National Command Authority meeting called by Pakistan on the night of Friday 9 May, which was later called off, was important. “Regarding technology, there was the involvement of foreign tech, specifically Chinese versus Western origin defence technology. The misuse and misfiring are still not clear but will be important. There was no sign of joint command control with China, although there is some discussion on the use of satellite imagery. Chance has not significantly played a role in this conflict, unlike in 2019,” he said.
IISS Viraj Solanki noted that the conflict has put India and the USA at the opposite sides as far as narratives matter. He said President Donald Trump has repeated his statement that the US mediated the ceasefire in multiple speeches and talked about mediating a resolution to the Kashmir dispute. “This has also become a domestic political issue in India, including questions on whether India had accepted third party mediation on Kashmir, which the government has rejected. Pakistan welcomed the US role in ‘facilitating the outcome’ of the ceasefire and mention of wider resolution of the Kashmir dispute, but objected to India’s version of events.”

Pak nuclear tests restored regional balance: AJK president,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316327-pak-nuclear-tests-restored-regional-balance-ajk-president,"ISLAMABAD: President Azad Kashmir Barrister Sultan Mahmood Chaudhry has said that the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan on May 28, 1998, restored the strategic balance in the region and made Pakistan’s defence impregnable.
In a special message on Youm-e Takbeer, he commended the exceptional role played by then Prime Minister Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in initiating the nuclear programme. Barrister Chaudhry also highlighted Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto’s significant role in the development and advancement of missile technology.
“These initiatives have made Pakistan’s defence invincible,” the president said, adding that no enemy can even dare to cast an evil eye on the country.
The president, while emphasising the early and amicable settlement of the Kashmir dispute, said, “Kashmir, a nuclear flashpoint between India and Pakistan, has the potential to trigger a nuclear war.”
Any incident, regardless of its size, can potentially escalate into a larger conflict between India and Pakistan that can jeopardise the peace of the whole world,” Barrister Chaudhry added.
“The key to peace in South Asia lies in a just and honourable settlement of the Kashmir issue,” he remarked.
He said that it was high time the international community played its due role in resolving the long-standing Kashmir issue in line with the UNSC resolutions.
Terming Kashmiris as the major stakeholders in the dispute, the president stressed the need for associating Kashmiri leadership in the dialogue process to find a lasting solution to the Kashmir issue.

JI chief says nuclear capability an unforgettable gift,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316330-ji-chief-says-nuclear-capability-an-unforgettable-gift,"ISLAMABAD: Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Ameer Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has said that Pakistan’s nuclear capability, developed under the leadership of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, is an unforgettable gift to the nation that has empowered Pakistanis to hold their heads high globally.
He stressed that the country must not be intimidated by global powers seeking to divide and weaken Pakistan. “If Modi fires bullets, we will respond with the Ghauri missile,” he declared.
Speaking to the media after visiting the grave of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and offering prayers on the occasion of ‘Youm-e-Takbeer and Abdul Qadeer’, Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said the youth must reject despair and unite against those spreading hopelessness and division. “This country is ours, and we are its protectors. We still have to liberate Kashmir,” he stated, adding that any dialogue with India must include Kashmir on the agenda; otherwise “there should be no talks at all”.
A large number of people visited Sector H-8 graveyard here on Wednesday to offer Fateha at grave of Dr Abdul Qadeer and pay homage to the ‘Father of Pakistan’s nuclear programme’. Recalling the events of 1998, Naeemur Rehman said after India conducted nuclear tests, anxiety spread across Pakistan. “While the government hesitated due to international pressure and threats of sanctions, Jamaat-e-Islami and Islami Jamiat Talaba held rallies across the country to press the government to respond,” he recalled. “On May 28, Pakistan conducted nuclear tests and became invincible.”
He noted that while major world powers continue to expand their nuclear arsenals, it was Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and his team who ensured Pakistan’s place among the nuclear powers. “Today, we are here to remember and honour this national hero, whose contributions made Pakistan strong and respected worldwide,” he added.
He mocked Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speeches as empty bravado aimed at misleading the Indian public. “Modi is bragging, while 680 million Indians still lack access to basic sanitation,” he said. “The more he blusters, the fewer votes he’ll get.”
Naeemur Rehman also condemned India’s treatment of minorities, especially Muslims, Dalits, and Sikhs. “India is committing atrocities under the guise of Hindutva. The Sikh movement is gaining momentum, and India has lost credibility by targeting Sikhs in countries like the US and Canada.”
About Kashmir, he decried violations of human rights and said India was trying to turn the Muslim majority into a minority. “This is terrorism and the world must take a stand,” he said.
He criticised the US for its silence during Indian aggression against Pakistan, only stepping in for ceasefire talks once Pakistan retaliated. “If peace is to be achieved, India must withdraw its forces from Kashmir and let Kashmiris exercise their right to self-determination.”
Lashing out at the government’s handling of Youm-e-Takbeer celebrations, Naeemur Rehman condemned the exclusion of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan from official advertisements, saying the ruling PMLN prioritised images of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his family. “It’s shameful,” he said, noting that even former rulers didn’t attend the national hero’s funeral.
Responding to a question, he called the release of Jamaat-e-Islami’s Dr Azhar by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court a victory for justice. He urged the government to foster national unity and resolve the crises in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.

62 Levies suspended in 18 Balochistan districts,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316331-62-levies-suspended-in-18-balochistan-districts,"QUETTA: Director General of the Balochistan Levies Force, Abdul Ghaffar Magsi, has adopted a zero-tolerance policy against corruption and bribery at checkpoints, suspending 62 personnel from 18 districts with immediate effect.
The suspended officers include Risaldars, Naib Risaldars, Daffadars, Havaldars, sepoys, and drivers. These individuals belong to the districts of Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Chaman, Kachhi, Khuzdar, Musakhel, Barkhan, Sherani, Loralai, Zhob, Sibi, Washuk, Chaghi, Jhal Magsi, Mastung, Surab, Panjgur, and Noshki.

No single party made Pak defence invincible: PTI,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316332-no-single-party-made-pak-defence-invincible-pti,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Central Information Secretary Sh Waqas Akram on Wednesday said the achievement of making Pakistan’s defence impregnable was not the legacy of any single political party.
He paid glowing tribute to scientists, engineers and unsung heroes who burned midnight oil to make Pakistan’s defence invincible despite immense hurdles and international pressures.
Speaking at a news conference here, he said that on May 28, Pakistan emerged as the first nuclear power in the Islamic world and the seventh globally, and this momentous achievement sent a powerful message to the world that Pakistan is a resolute and indomitable nation. He paid a special tribute to Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, Dr Samar Mubarakmand and countless others who dedicated their lives to securing Pakistan’s sovereignty and turned the dream into a reality. “It is deeply regrettable that Dr AQ Khan, the father of Pakistan’s nuclear program, was forced to apologize on national television and PTI founder Imran Khan was the only political leader who condemned this humiliation and stood by him, for he is, was and will forever remain our national hero, a symbol of Pakistan’s pride and resilience,” he noted.
Turning to the current political and judicial situation, Waqas criticized the 26th Constitutional Amendment, calling it the burial ground of the Constitution. He declared that justice has become a rare commodity in Pakistan, as the judicial process is plagued by delays, inefficiency and a blatant disregard for constitutional principles. He lamented that the current system was stealing justice rather than merely delaying it. “The most alarming example is that we are forced to protest just to get the PTI founder’s case heard,” he said and went on to say that members of provincial and national assemblies from Sindh, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have been compelled to take direct action, simply to demand a hearing for a political leader’s case.
Waqas noted that despite repeated assurances from the acting chief justice of IHC, no progress has been made so far, as the Punjab Police disregarded the court orders with complete impunity. The PTI CIS warned that Pakistan’s judiciary has become a global topic of discussion for all the wrong reasons, adding that the judiciary today appears powerless or unwilling to uphold justice. “We are not asking for special favours; we are demanding the release of our leader who is being held unjustly,” he asserted.
Reminding the nation of the PTI’s unwavering stance against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Waqas quoted the PTI founder as saying: “Modi is a shameless man; he will betray again.” He reiterated the PTI’s commitment to Pakistan, saying: “We are ready to sacrifice our wealth, our lives and even our children for this nation but unity is the need of the hour.”
However, he made it clear, “Unity is needed not just in war, but even in peace, we deserve justice, dignity and our constitutional rights.”

Chinese technology overtaking West in key area: Mushahid,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316334-chinese-technology-overtaking-west-in-key-area-mushahid,"ISLAMABAD: Praising Chinese technology for overtaking western technology in key areas, including defence, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed has said China is a part of South Asia, playing a positive role for peace and stability.
He made these remarks in the Chinese capital, where he was invited to chair the global political parties dialogue on “Asia in a Changing World”. About 250 political parties leaders and representatives from 29 countries took part in this high-level conference, hosted by the International Department of the Communist Party of China (IDCPC).
Senator Mushahid was bestowed this honour in his capacity as Co-chairman of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (ICAPP). The Dialogue-l, presided over by Mushahid included the Minister of IDCPC, Liu Jianchao, former speaker of Thailand, Bokin Balakula and the former foreign minister of Mongolia, Damdin Tsogtbaatar.
In his remarks opening the dialogue, Senator Mushahid said: “The global centre of gravity is shifting, inexorably and irreversibly, from the West, which is in decline, to the East and the world is witnessing the ‘Rise of the East’ with the dawn of the ‘Asian Century’.”
He acclaimed China’s role as a peaceful power and reliable partner which has risen through economic development and not through conquest, colonisation, aggression or invasion of any country. “China is part of South Asia and is a source of stability for our region,” he said. Mushahid extolled China’s progress in science and technology, referring to a recent cover story in The Economist which called China a “Scientific Superpower”, adding: “Whether it is J10C fighter jets or Deep Seek AI or electric vehicles, China is surpassing the West in technology”.
IDCPC Minister Liu Jianchao, responding to a question about the “Chinese Model”, said: “While China doesn’t believe in exporting its political ideology, China’s experience in poverty alleviation can be useful for developing countries”. He added: “China is also a part of South Asia, having several countries in the region as neighbours, adding that China has borders with 14 countries but border dispute with only India which China feels should not be the sole determinant of relations between the two countries and the border dispute should be resolved peacefully.”
Pakistan was also represented by former chairman Senate Nayyar Hussain Bokhari and Senator Anusha Rehman, as well as Ambassador of Pakistan to China Khalil Hashmi, besides some business leaders and think tank representatives.
In a separate meeting with Senator Mushahid, Minister Liu Jianchao referred to high-level exchanges of successful visits between Pakistan and China, citing his own visit to Pakistan in June 2024 and the recent visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Beijing. He emphasised that the Communist Party of China will continue to deepen its friendly relations with all political parties of Pakistan.
Messages of congratulations to the IDCPC conference were specially sent by the prime ministers of Pakistan and Malaysia.

Covid-19 cases surge again in Pakistan amid global spike,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316335-covid-19-cases-surge-again-in-pakistan-amid-global-spike,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is among the countries currently witnessing a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, with the virus test positivity rate climbing to 17 per cent in April 2025—one of the highest in the Eastern Mediterranean region, World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Wednesday.
Although it slightly declined to 15 per cent in early May 2025, the spike marks a significant resurgence of SARS-CoV-2 in the country, surpassing last year’s levels during the same period.
WHO’s surveillance data from sentinel sites indicate that Pakistan, along with Egypt, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, is experiencing elevated Covid-19 circulation.
The country has also been flagged by the global health agency due to the limited reporting of hospitalisations, ICU admissions, and deaths, making it difficult to assess the actual burden on the healthcare system.
Amid the rising transmission, officials at Karachi’s Aga Khan University Hospital have confirmed that at least four people have died from Covid-19 over the past two weeks. All four individuals were immunocompromised and had underlying health conditions, including diabetes, cancer, or cardiovascular disease.
They were admitted with Covid-related complications and could not survive despite intensive care.
Globally, Covid-19 activity has also surged. Since mid-February, the test positivity rate has increased from 2 per cent to 11 per cent across 73 reporting countries, a level not observed since July 2024.
The most significant increases are being reported from the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. While the African Region, Europe, and the Americas are reporting lower positivity levels, some sub-regions like the Caribbean and the Andes are beginning to show upward trends. Wastewater surveillance data from Europe and North America currently indicate low SARS-CoV-2 activity.
WHO has also raised concerns over a new “variant under monitoring”, NB.1.8.1, which now accounts for 10.7 per cent of global reported sequences, up from 2.5 per cent just four weeks earlier.
The variant is a descendent of the JN.1 lineage and carries spike protein mutations associated with increased transmissibility and reduced antibody neutralisation.
While no NB.1.8.1 sequences have yet been reported from Pakistan, WHO notes that the variant is rising in all three regions with active genomic sequencing: Western Pacific, the Americas, and Europe.
Vaccination remains critical, yet uptake among high-risk groups remains low worldwide. From January to September 2024, only 1.68 per cent of older adults and 0.96 per cent of healthcare workers in reporting countries received a Covid-19 vaccine dose. Higher uptake was recorded in the Americas and Europe, with significantly lower rates in low- and middle-income countries.
WHO has urged immediate vaccination of high-risk groups, advising that any available vaccine is better than delaying immunisation while waiting for variant-updated formulations.
Since the official end of the Covid-19 Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) in May 2023, countries have adopted varying strategies.
Some have integrated Covid-19 into existing respiratory disease control systems, while others remain in transition. However, financial constraints, workforce shortages, and competing health priorities continue to hinder long-term preparedness in many countries.
Despite fewer deaths and hospitalisations than in earlier years, WHO still classifies the global Covid-19 risk as high. This is largely due to unpredictable variant evolution, lack of seasonality, and ongoing circulation. WHO emphasises that the current dominant variants, LP.8.1 and NB.1.8.1, do not appear to cause more severe disease than previous strains but warrant close monitoring.
Countries are encouraged to maintain genomic surveillance, sentinel testing, and reporting to assess disease trends and impacts. WHO also reminds member states that its International Health Regulations (IHR) Standing Recommendations remain valid through April 2026 and should guide national Covid-19 policies. No travel or trade restrictions are currently advised.
As part of long-term threat management, WHO said it was supporting countries through updated strategic frameworks, technical guidance, and coordination. These plans aim to embed Covid-19 control into broader respiratory disease preparedness efforts, ensuring that countries remain ready to manage future coronavirus threats alongside seasonal influenza and other respiratory pathogens.

YAUM-E-TAKBEER: Echoes of 1998’s nuclear tests were heard again on May 10: Tessori,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316306-yaum-e-takbeer-echoes-of-1998-s-nuclear-tests-were-heard-again-on-may-10-tessori,"A special ceremony was held at the Sindh Governor House on Wednesday to commemorate Yaum-e-Takbeer, in which Governor Kamran Khan Tessori said that the echoes of the nuclear tests conducted on May 28, 1998, were heard again this May 10, when the enemy’s arrogance was shattered.
Tessori said May 28 is a day of pride, determination and dignity for the entire nation. Declaring the nuclear tests a guarantee of Pakistan’s security and sovereignty, he said Yaum-e-Takbeer is a golden chapter in the nation’s history that can never be forgotten. He remarked that challenging Pakistan in May is equivalent to challenging the will of its people.
Referring to the Indian aggression of May 10, he said that when the enemy tested us, it was stunned by the passion and unity of the Pakistani nation. He praised Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for inspiring the nation with renewed spirit, hope and courage through his professional leadership.
The governor also paid rich tributes to Pakistan’s nuclear scientists and patriotic leadership, saying that the entire nation holds those who made Pakistan a nuclear power in high regard. He expressed confidence that Pakistan would also climb the ladder of economic success, and the world would witness its commercial growth.
Commenting on the recent cowardly terrorist attack in Khuzdar, he said that such acts cannot break the spirit of the Pakistani nation. The enemy has witnessed the practical demonstration of Pakistan’s unity, faith and sacrifice, and nations who stand united cause fear in their enemies’ hearts, he added. He affirmed that the heirs of Pakistan’s martyrs remain proud and resolute, and their sacrifices would never go in vain.
Addressing the youth, Tessori urged them to recognise that they are citizens of a sovereign, dignified and powerful state. He made the assurance that all minority communities in Pakistan live with complete freedom and protection. The ceremony was attended by notable personalities from various walks of life.

‘Strong message’
In his message, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah extended heartfelt congratulations to the nation on the occasion of Yaum-e-Takbeer, marking the day as a symbol of Pakistan’s defensive sovereignty and national dignity.
“May 28 is a historic day when Pakistan, in 1998, conducted successful nuclear tests and demonstrated to the world that we will never compromise on our defence,” said Shah. He emphasised that Yaum-e-Takbeer reflects the nation’s unwavering determination, the relentless efforts of its scientists, and the farsighted decisions of its leadership.
Paying tribute to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, he recalled that after India’s nuclear tests in 1974, Bhutto laid the foundation of Pakistan’s nuclear programme and famously said: “We will eat grass, but we will make the atomic bomb.”
He also praised Benazir Bhutto for her pivotal role in strengthening Pakistan’s defence. “She not only advanced the nuclear programme but also took bold steps such as initiating the ballistic missile programme, which significantly enhanced our national security. Her leadership prepared the country to face future threats with resilience.”
The CM said that Pakistan’s nuclear tests were not merely a technical success but a powerful assertion of sovereignty and a strong message to adversaries. “Today we salute the sacrifices and patriotism of our great leaders and scientists who made this achievement possible.”
He concluded his message with a pledge: “We reaffirm our commitment to realising the dreams of our martyrs and visionary leaders. We will continue striving to build a strong, prosperous and sovereign Pakistan.”

JI commemorates Dr AQ Khan on May 28,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316307-ji-commemorates-dr-aq-khan-on-may-28,"The Karachi chapter of the Jamaat-e-Islami observed May 28 as Dr Abdul Qadeer Day to pay tribute to the nuclear scientist who founded the nuclear programme of the country.
Camps were set up and banners fastened in all towns to pay rich tribute to Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan.
Karachi JI Emir Monem Zafar Khan visited a camp in the Saeedabad area of Karachi's Keamari district where he saluted the late Dr Khan for his key role in making Pakistan undefeatable.
He said the nation would always remember the role, contribution and sacrifices made by Dr Khan for the nuclear programme of Pakistan.
Those who tried to defame Dr Khan landed in the dustbin of the history, he remarked, adding that the nuclear scientist was still alive in the hearts of the nation.
Talking about the prevailing global scenario, he said Pakistan had emerged as a powerful state after the recent skirmishes with India. The next target for the nation and those in the corridors of powers would be to get Pakistan recognised as a strong sovereign country, he said.
He hailed the nation for an exemplary display of unity during the tensions with India and stressed the need for continuity of that spirit.
The JI leader said that against the backdrop of the changed global and regional scenarios, the country needed to be strengthened to the extent that Islamabad could stop what India was committing in Kashmir.
He further said that the nuclear bombs in the arsenal of Pakistan were the most strong and powerful defence deterrence and the nation was thankful to Dr Khan for that gift.

The incident had occurred within the jurisdiction of the Boat Basin police station, where an unidentified man opened fire on 25-year-old Zain Ali Raza while he was on duty. The attacker fled the scene after the murder.
FIR No. 401/25 was filed at the Boat Basin police station under sections of murder and the anti-terrorism law on the complaint of Inspector Tariq Javed, section officer of the Sultanabad traffic section.
According to the complainant, he was informed by Chowki Incharge Deen Muhammad that Constable Raza had been shot. Upon reaching the scene near the Mai Kolachi railway crossing, the inspector met a railway employee named Qasim Zubair.

towards Tapu.
The constable succumbed to his injuries before reaching the hospital. A large number of senior police officers, including Karachi police chief Addl IG Javed Alam Odho, DIG Irfan Baloch, DIG Fida Hussain Mastoi and the traffic police chief, attended the funeral of the martyred constable.

The P&D minister said that various provincial government departments have proposed new schemes for the next fiscal year, many of which have been suggested to be executed at local level. The CM instructed the relevant departments to shortlist the fresh proposals for development schemes, and present them in the next meeting.
“We will review funding in a separate meeting, and finalise the new schemes accordingly,” he said, adding that during 2023-24 the government had initiated 1,937 new development schemes worth Rs88.3 billion. “Most of those 1,937 schemes will be completed now.”

In his message in connection with International Day of Action for Women’s Health, the CM reaffirmed his government’s commitment to improving women’s health across the province.
“This day serves as a reminder to highlight the health challenges women face, and to encourage effective and sustained action to address them. A healthy woman is the foundation of a healthy society.”
He emphasised that his government has launched multiple programmes aimed at enhancing women’s health. “A comprehensive maternal and child health programme is under way across the province to safeguard the lives of mothers and newborns by providing them with essential healthcare services.”
He highlighted that 23,185 lady health workers have been deployed throughout Sindh to deliver healthcare services directly to women at the doorstep. He also pointed out the success of the National Health Support Programme, which is being implemented with the support of the World Bank.
He pointed out that this programme primarily focuses on improving care for pregnant women, mothers and newborn babies in order to ensure better health outcomes.
“The efforts of the Sindh government are proving to be a milestone in the journey towards safeguarding women’s health, security and well-being,” he concluded, reiterating his government’s resolve to continue prioritising women’s health and empowerment for a stronger, healthier society.

"Wall collapse kills boy as windstorm, rain hit Kotri",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316311-wall-collapse-kills-boy-as-windstorm-rain-hit-kotri,"HYDERABAD: A wind storm and rain in Hyderabad, Jamshoro and Kotri on Wednesday evening brought some relief from the intense heat and humidity that had persisted for several days. However, the weather also disrupted the power supply system.
According to a spokesperson for the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco), trees, flags and billboards were knocked down by the strong winds, causing power poles and cables to fall in various areas, severely affecting the electricity supply.
The spokesperson said that 62 feeders had tripped and suspended power supply, adding that restoration work began once the rain subsided, but due to fallen poles and cables on several feeders, it can take up to 24 hours to fully restore electricity.
Life in Jamshoro and Kotri was also disrupted by the storm and rain. In Kotri a boy named Ahsan Soomro died after a wall collapsed near the sessions court.
In Jamshoro a roof collapse left Huzoor Bakhsh Rind seriously injured, while two more people were injured in separate incidents.

SHC directs KMC to restore Khajji Ground,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316313-shc-directs-kmc-to-restore-khajji-ground,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has directed the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to undertake restoration activities at the Khaji Ground in the Gulbahar area.
The direction came on a petition seeking removal of encroachments and garbage from the ground.
The petitioners had submitted in the petition that the Khajji Ground was developed by the local administration in the late 1990s after the city witnessed a distressful law and order situation.
They submitted that the ground was a well-known football and cricket ground and park for the locals but the same had now been misused for dumping of garbage. They submitted that two schools were next to the ground and dumping of garbage had created an unhealthy atmosphere for the students who were constantly troubled by malodour caused by the garbage.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab submitted that a misstatement had been made by the North Nazimabad Town Municipal Corporation (TMC) chairman that Rs360 million had been allocated for the restoration of the park.
He said that no funds had been provided to the KMC in such regard and if any disbursement was made, it must have been made to the Karachi Development Authority.
He said the KMC exercised domain under the schedule II of the local government law in respect of parks and playgrounds and anti-encroachment activities within its jurisdiction.
Counsel for the KMC and North Nazimabad TMC submitted that the KDA may also be impleaded as a party in the petition. The high court granted the request, directed the petitioner to make the KDA as a party in the case and issued notices to the authority.
A division bench of the SHC headed by Justice Agha Faisal directed the KMC to undertake restoration activities at the subject playground. The SHC decreed that the KMC shall remain at liberty to seek assistance from any other authority and/or law enforcement agency to peform the task.
The SHC also directed the North Nazimabad TMC chairman to appear in person on the next hearing.

Disappearance turns out voluntary as missing son of govt officer found,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316314-disappearance-turns-out-voluntary-as-missing-son-of-govt-officer-found,"A kidnapping case turned out to be that of self-abduction as the Darakhshan police recovered the 24-year-old son of a senior government officer who had gone missing under suspicious circumstances.
According to police, Javed Solangi, a resident of DHA Phase VI and government officer, had lodged a report stating that his son Hassan Solangi had left home in his private vehicle but did not returned.
Initially, there was brief contact with Hassan over the phone, during which he informed his family that he would be back shortly. However, shortly thereafter, both his mobile numbers were found switched off, and he became completely unreachable.
An abduction case was registered at the Darakhshan police station and police initiated action to recover the youth. Using modern investigative techniques, including mobile data tracking and CCTV footage analysis, police launched a thorough
investigation.
As a result, Hassan was recovered safely from the Pak Colony area along with his private vehicle. However, during the course of further inquiry, it was discovered that Hassan had not been kidnapped.
Instead, the case was classified as a self-abduction case. Hassan was later handed over to his father.
Police said investigations were under way to ascertain Hassan’s motive behind
disappearing.

SHC tells govt to make interim arrangements if Sepa DG not appointed under eligibility criteria,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316316-shc-tells-govt-to-make-interim-arrangements-if-sepa-dg-not-appointed-under-eligibility-criteria,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has observed that the Sindh government should make interim arrangements for the appointment of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa) director general (DG) if the eligibility criteria are not fulfilled for the post.
The interim order came on a petition of Javed Iqbal who had challenged the appointment of the Sepa DG by the government.
A counsel for the petitioner, Mohammad Vawda, submitted that under the service structure notification, either the DG in grade 20 should be appointed directly with a PhD degree in environmental engineering or through promotion.
The counsel referred to the minutes of a meeting of the board in which it was decided to appoint the DG directly, whereas the respondent DG was promoted as an additional
director general but
immediately he was promoted to DG.
He said the post of Sepa DG had to be fulfilled through the procedure and rules laid down in the law but the selection board appointed its own officer as the DG after promoting him as additional DG.
He submitted that the respondent lacked qualification for the post of Sepa DG and requested the high court to set aside the impugned notification with regard to the appointment.
A division bench of the SHC headed by Justice Mohammad Faisal Kamal Alam after a preliminary hearing of the petition observed that the contention raised in the petition required consideration.
The high court issued notices to the Sindh government, Sepa and others, and called their comments on August 12.
The SHC observed that in the meantime, the Sindh government should make interim arrangements if the eligibility criteria were not fulfilled for the regular appointment as laid down in the notification.
It is pertinent to mention that the Sindh government had posted Waqar Hussain Phulpoto as the Sepa DG following his promotion to the post of additional DG on May 2.

Man handed down life imprisonment for stabbing brother to death,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316317-man-handed-down-life-imprisonment-for-stabbing-brother-to-death,"A model court has sentenced a man to life imprisonment for the murder of his brother in 2020.
Asad Sohrab was found guilty of fatally stabbing his elder brother Qamar Sohrab at his shop in Quaidabad on September 20, 2020.
Additional Sessions Judge Niaz Hussain Soomro of the Model Criminal Trial Court (Malir) observed that the prosecution had successfully proved its charge against the accused and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for life.
The convict was also ordered to pay Rs100,000 as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased.
The judge noted that before the commencement of trial, the court had ordered a mental health assessment of the accused because of his appearance and conduct. The accused was found to have history suggestive of bipolar affective disorder with episodic relapses upon stopping medication but there had been no psychotic symptoms affecting judgment or awareness of reality.
He said that Asad was found to be fit to stand trial.
According to state prosecutor Ghulam Mustafa Mahar, Asad attacked his elder brother Qamar with a knife at his shop in Quaidabad on September 20, 2020, leaving him critically injured. The victim later succumbed to his injuries during treatment at a private hospital.
The prosecutor contended that the prosecution had successfully proved the charge against the accused through both ocular and medical evidence. He stated that the accused had previously assaulted the victim with a knife, but no criminal proceedings were initiated at the time due to their sibling relationship.
He claimed that the accused had not been suffering from mental disorder or illness and was aware of his acts and consequences as reported by the medical board, therefore, act on the part of the accused showing himself to be mental patient would not be helpful for him or absolve him of the criminal act of killing his own brother.
In his statement recorded under the Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused denied the allegations levelled against him and prayed for acquittal. He said that he was suffering from mental disorder and remained in the psychiatric ward of jail for eight months.

Arts Council holds condolence reference for filmmaker Furqan T Siddiqui,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316318-arts-council-holds-condolence-reference-for-filmmaker-furqan-t-siddiqui,"The Arts Council of Pakistan, Karachi, (ACP) on Tuesday organised a condolence reference in memory of filmmaker, director and digital media professional Furqan T Siddiqui at the Haseena Moin Hall.
The event began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, followed by heartfelt tributes from different showbiz personalities.
ACP President Mohammad Ahmed Shah recalled his deep bond with Qureshi describing him as an affectionate, sincere, and multi-talented individual. ""Even today, it feels as if Furqan is still among us. His departure has left a significant void in the industry. He had a remarkable ability to connect people and maintained a close relationship with the Arts Council,"" he said, assuring that the ACP and its governing body stood in solidarity with the late filmmaker’s family during the time of grief.
Amjad Hussain Shah, the chairman of the ACP music committee, shared that Qureshi was a genuine soul who was always smiling and caring for others while concealing his own struggles. ""His loss is not just a personal loss for his family, but a collective loss for all of us,"" he added.
Actor and host Nadeem Jaffri lamented that ours was a thankless society that waited for artists to die before it acknowledged their worth.
Jibran T Siddiqui recalled Qureshi’s association with the ACP and his love for Karachi, saying, ""The city ran through his veins. He entered the media industry at a young age through PTV and quickly proved his talent. The night of March 24 remains unforgettable. He taught us that the real purpose of life is to serve others.""
Actor Kamran Jilani emotionally remarked that he felt as if Qureshi would walk out of the picture any moment. “He did so much for the industry and his friends, but unfortunately, the industry did not do justice to him,"" he said.
Sohail Hashmi praised Qureshi’s artistic excellence, saying, ""He had a rare ability to make everyone feel like family.""
Renowned actors Syed Shehzad Raza Naqvi and Adnan Shah Tipu also attended the event.

"2,723 scholarships for university students approved",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316319-2-723-scholarships-for-university-students-approved,"The Sindh government has approved scholarships for 2,723 students pursuing higher education.
Officials said the decision was made during a board meeting of the Sindh Education Endowment Fund Trust (SEEF) chaired by Sindh Education minister Syed Sardar Ali Shah.
The scholarships, approved for the academic year 2023–24, are intended for students from Sindh currently enrolled in universities across the country.
Shah chaired the meeting in his capacity as the chairman of the SEEF Board of Trustees. The meeting was held in Karachi and attended by College Education Secretary Shahab Qamar Ansari, School Education Secretary Zahid Ali Abbasi, Additional Secretary Judicial & SEEF Iqbal Jamani, SEEF board members and other relevant officials.
Speaking on the occasion, the education minister stated that the Sindh Education Endowment Fund was established to support higher education of underprivileged and talented students. “Through the SEEF scholarships, students from Sindh can pursue higher education at over 90 public and private universities across the country,” he remarked.
“Our goal is to provide equal opportunities for quality education to bright students from financially challenged backgrounds,” he said.
The board also approved renewal of scholarships for 4,877 existing students, bringing the total number of beneficiaries this year to 7,600. The meeting was informed that the SEEF’s total capital had reached Rs. 9.2 billion, and the profit generated from this amount was used to pay the students’ fees. Over the past two years, an additional Rs2 billion had been invested to further strengthen the fund.
The board resolved to present recommendations in the next meeting on linking the SEEF scholarships with university admissions. The education minister emphasised the need for persuading the universities to simplify the admission process for students awaiting scholarship approval.
“Many students cannot reach universities due to financial constraints. We aim to further streamline the scholarship acquisition process,” he said. He also ordered complete digitisation of the scholarship application process to make it entirely paperless. A digital dashboard and automated scrutiny system would also be developed to enhance transparency, he said.
Shah expressed displeasure at the absence of the university vice-chancellors who were board members from the meeting stating that they should attend and offer suggestions to ease students’ access to education.
Since its establishment in 2003, the SEEFT has supported over 37,550 students for completion of their higher education.

"Man arrested for killing sister, staging suicide",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316262-man-arrested-for-killing-sister-staging-suicide,"LAHORE : Shad Bagh police arrested a man accused of murdering his sister and attempting to stage the crime scene as a suicide. Initial reports indicated that the woman had taken her own life by slitting her wrist, prompting police to arrive at the scene and take the body into custody. However, police officials noticed visible signs of violence on the victim’s face and neck. On questioning, the victim’s brother—initially treated as a witness—soon confessed to the crime.
According to investigators, the suspect admitted to killing his sister over the suspicion that she had stolen money from a cupboard in their home. In an attempt to disguise the murder, the suspect allegedly cut his own nails to eliminate scratch marks and then cut his sister’s wrist to simulate suicide. Police registered a case and shifted the body to the morgue.

Commits suicide
A 37-year-old man allegedly took his own life by shooting himself in the head at his office in the Gulberg area, reportedly after suffering heavy financial losses in business.
The deceased was identified as Hassan Maqsood, a resident of DHA Phase III.
According to police, the incident occurred inside his office where the sound of gunfire prompted nearby office staff to alert emergency services. Rescue teams and law enforcement officials reached the scene and shifted the body to the morgue. Investigators collected forensic evidence, including the pistol and shells from the crime scene. While initial findings suggest suicide, police say multiple aspects are being examined. Statements from family members and close associates of the deceased are also being recorded as part of the investigation.

913 tax evasion cases revealed,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316263-913-tax-evasion-cases-revealed,"LAHORE : A new financial scandal linked to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government has come to light, as the Public Accounts Committee-II (PAC-II) disclosed 913 cases of financial irregularities during the fiscal year 2021–22.
The committee revealed that the negligence of 39 revenue officers resulted in a staggering loss of Rs 698 million to the national exchequer. According to the PAC-II report, the financial mismanagement stemmed from the failure of revenue officials to collect due taxes on property transactions across various cities in Punjab. These lapses allowed buyers and sellers to evade property-related tax obligations, leading to massive shortfalls in revenue collection.
Despite the revelation of these cases, no recovery has been made to date. More alarmingly, no disciplinary or legal action has been initiated against the responsible revenue officers. The PAC-II, headed by Chairman Syed Ali Haider Gilani, has directed the Board of Revenue to recover the entire amount within one month. The committee expressed strong dissatisfaction over the absence of Nabeel Javed, Senior Member of the Board of Revenue, who was summoned to appear before the committee to explain the situation.
His failure to attend the proceedings was seen as a serious disregard for accountability, prompting stern remarks from the chairman. Speaking to The News, sources stated that the corruption cases identified in the audit report were grave and must be addressed urgently. However, he also confirmed that the committee, instead of resolving the matter, has put it on hold due to the non-cooperation of senior revenue officials. The Rs 698 million discrepancy, according to the report, is directly linked to systemic administrative failures within the revenue department, particularly in the assessment and collection of taxes on property purchases. The case has reignited concerns over rampant mismanagement during PTI's tenure and raised serious questions about the accountability mechanisms in place for public sector departments.

Country’s sovereignty invincible: PA speaker,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316267-country-s-sovereignty-invincible-pa-speaker,"LAHORE : Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan has extended heartfelt congratulations to the people of Pakistan and the Muslim Ummah on the occasion of Youm-e-Takbeer, calling it a golden chapter in the country’s defence history.
Malik Ahmad Khan, in his message on Wednesday, stated that Youm-e-Takbeer is the day when Pakistan sent a clear message to its adversaries that our sovereignty is invincible. It is not just a date on the calendar, but a day of renewed commitment to national pride, independence, and the defence of our homeland.
PA speaker emphasised that on May 28, 1998, Pakistan thwarted hostile intentions by successfully conducting nuclear tests, proving that the nation would never compromise on its security. He credited this historic achievement to the bold leadership of Nawaz Sharif, the tireless efforts of Pakistani scientists, and the professional excellence of the armed forces — all of whom, he said, will forever be remembered by the nation.
Malik Ahmad highlighted the role of the armed forces in making Pakistan’s nuclear programme secure, credible, and unassailable. “From the mountains of Chaghi to every border of the homeland, the Pakistan Army has always stood tall in defence of the nation,” he added.
He further stated that Youm-e-Takbeer is a reminder of the enduring legacy of standing strong against aggression. He said Pakistan’s brave, united, and strategic response to recent Indian hostility reflects this very tradition. “The entire nation, the government, our institutions, and the armed forces stood together as one and thwarted every threat to our sovereignty,” the speaker said.
The speaker noted that Pakistan’s nuclear capability has not only ensured internal stability but has also guaranteed external security. “Youm-e-Takbeer is, in fact, a celebration of national confidence, sacrifice, and unwavering resolve and foundations on which our invincibility rests,” he remarked.
He paid tribute to the great leaders, scientists, engineers, military officers, and patriotic citizens whose sacrifices made this milestone possible.

Director General Sports and Youth Affairs Khizar Afzaal said, ‘Our scientists and national leaders made our country impregnable by conducting six nuclear tests on May 28, 1998. On this day, we should all reaffirm a strong resolve to utilise all our energies and abilities for the development and bright future of our country”.

NCHR recommends 60-day timeline to complete challan of UTPs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316282-nchr-recommends-60-day-timeline-to-complete-challan-of-utps,"Islamabad : National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) has recommended an amendment in the law to give a timeline of 60 days for the submission of a complete challan of under trail prisoners (UTPs), except as otherwise extended by the court.
The recommendation was made in a letter written by the NCHR Member Punjab Nadeem Ashraf to the Chief Secretary, Government of Punjab. The letter says that Section 9 (6) of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service (Constitution, Function and Powers) Act 2006 allows submission of interim report or challan in case of incomplete investigation.
“However, no period has been specified for submission of the final report or challan, which results in delays in the trail, at times for months. This amendment is expected to expedite the trails by providing a specific timeline for submission of complete challan in the court,” states the letter.
The letter also contains minutes of the meeting held on April 16, 2025 where the issues of under trail prisoners due to delay in investigation and trail were discussed extensively. The meeting was held under the Chairmanship of NCHR Member Punjab Nadeem Ashraf and was attended by DSP Legal for Punjab Iqbal Najam, Deputy District Public Prosecutor Naveed ul Zafar and Deputy District Public Prosecutor Muhammad Naeem Tahir.
The meeting discussed the issues regarding the overcrowding of the under-trail prisoners (UTPs) across jails in Punjab.  Participants of the meeting emphasised that as per Pakistan’s commitment under UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the due process of law shall be enforced on all citizens.
Chair of the meeting stated that 72 per cent of the inmates in prison in Punjab were under-trial whereas, as per the Mandela Prison Rules, the ratio should not accede 20 to 25 per cent. It was also highlighted that more than 320,=
-7000 FIRs are registered annually in Lahore. Only 48 criminal courts are functioning in the division which makes it unfeasible for the trials to commence in timely manner.
Similarly, the issue of interim 20 was also discussed in the meeting regarding delays in trials besides the overburdened forensic labs which has been seen creating additional challenges for the under-trial prisoners. The participants were informed that there are 53 probation officers for a population of over 125 million in Punjab, indicating an alarming and a serious human resource constraint as regards effective probation system.
DSP (Legal) Najam Iqbal apprised the participants regarding the monthly meeting of criminal justice coordination committee, which were being convened under the chairmanship of district and session judge, where a list is provided to police of the cases involving non-submission of challans. It was further stated that a digital tracking system is being developed and is in its final stages for the submission of challans.
Other recommendations given by the participants included adoption of Alternate Dispute Resolution (ADR) system in criminal cases, incorporation and implementation of video trails to expedite and facilitate trails, presence of complainant at the time of submission of challans so that the latest development in the cases i.e. compounding or compromise, if any may come into notice of court.
Talking to ‘The News’, Chairperson NCHR Rabiya Javeri Agha stressed the need to increase the number of prosecutors as well as deployment of a dedicated prosecutor per police station to improve coordination and case handling. “Additionally, measures such as the issuance of diary number or receipt upon challan submission from the prosecutor to investigation officer, establishing more state-of-the-art forensic laboratories at all divisional headquarters of Punjab and expansion of medico legal facilities for timely issuance of Medico-legal Certificate (MLC) to cater to the issue of over burdening of doctors needs to be taken to improve the situation,” she said.

Vigilance needed to avoid incidences of CCHF while handling cattle,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316283-vigilance-needed-to-avoid-incidences-of-cchf-while-handling-cattle,"Rawalpindi : Incidences of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever, a deadly infection, cannot be ruled out at the time when a huge number of cattle, sacrificial animals, are being brought to town from far flung areas of the country ahead of Eidul Azha and a big number of them might not be taken here after proper handling and surveillance.
Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever that was first described in Crimea in 1944 and identified in 1956 in Congo is zoonotic, a disease that animals cause to humans. The CCHF is caused by Nairovirus of the Bunyaviridae family transmitted to humans by the bite of Hyalomma tick found on the skin of animals including cattle, goat and sheep or by direct contact with the blood of an infected animal or human and that is why its incidence is anticipated every year on or before Eidul Azha, at the time of mass handling of cattle.
The Ixodid (hard) ticks, especially those of the genus Hyalomma, are both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus. Animals, such as cattle, goats or sheep become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites.
It is important that the CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health as the virus can lead to epidemics, has a high case fatality ratio (10–40%), potentially results in hospital and health facility outbreaks, and is difficult to prevent and treat.
Health experts say that the sacrificial animals being brought to the region for sale may carry the ticks causing CCHF if proper preventive measures are not taken well in time. It is therefore suggested that all the concerned departments including health department, agriculture and livestock departments and tehsil municipal administrations should plan to carry out necessary preventive activities to avoid incidences or a possible outbreak of the deadly infection.
Since the diagnosis of the first human cases of CCHF in 1976, sporadic cases have continued to occur across Pakistan. Although Balochistan remains the most affected province yet cases have been reported from almost all geographical regions of the country.
Last year, from May to July, the CCHF had claimed at least four lives here at Benazir Bhutto Hospital in town. CCHF is a viral hemorrhagic fever transmitted to humans by bite of ticks; usually from infected sheep, goat or cows, exposure to the blood or tissue of the infected animal during or post slaughtering and direct contact with blood or secretions of the infected person.
The most important preventive measure is to handle sacrificial animals properly and keep skins of the animals free from any type of ticks. Sacrificial animals being taken to house, if having any type of ticks on their skin should be given a thorough bath with water carrying DEET or Potassium Permanganate.
Experts suggest that people should reduce tick infestation on cows, sheep and goats with the help of insecticides. Acaricides, the pesticides that kill ticks and mites may be useful on domestic animals and insecticidal sprays must be ensured in the cattle markets, slaughter houses, dairy, Gawala colonies, sacrificial animals’ sale yards and other animal gathering places. Also insect repellents containing DEET are effective in protecting against ticks.
It is suggested that people should wear protective clothing when working with livestock and take measures for early and correct removal of ticks. People should ensure examination of diseased animals from veterinary doctors so that transmission of CCHF to human beings could be avoided.
The signs and symptoms of CCHF appear 1-9 days after infection which include sudden onset of illness with high grade fever over 38.50C for more than 72 hours. The fever is usually associated with headache, muscle pains and bleeding manifestations such as petechial or purpuric rash, bleeding from nose, mouth, gum bleeding, vomiting of blood, and blood in stools.

Pak-EPA cracks down on brick kilns damaging environment,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316288-pak-epa-cracks-down-on-brick-kilns-damaging-environment,"Islamabad : As a part of zero-tolerance towards polluting brick kilns in the within Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), enforcement teams of the Pakistan-Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) conducted crackdown a targeted operation against non-compliant and polluting brick kilns in the H-16 and H-17 sectors of Islamabad, Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination’s media spokesperson Mohammad Saleem Shaikh said here on Wednesday.
Sharing details of the operation against the environmentally-damaging brick kilns, the ministry official said that five brick kilns operating illegally without environmentally-friendly zigzag technology were sealed.
During the inspections, the Pak-EPA’s enforcement team found five brick kilns operating in active violation of environmental standards, which were issued prior warnings/directives. Despite repeated warnings, these operators failed to adopt the modern zigzag technology, which has been proven to substantially reduce emissions, said the media spokesperson Mr. Saleem added.
He said that before the crackdown, on-site notices were issued to the violators to shift to new zigzag technology or face legal proceedings under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997.
“The enforcement action was taken in response to multiple public complaints and prior field inspections by the Pak-EPA’s enforcement team, which found out that several kilns were still continuing to use outdated straight-fire technology, also known as Fixed Chimney Bull Trench Kilns (FCBTKs)”, he remarked.
FCBTKs is a traditional method of brick production, where bricks are arranged in a straight line for firing. This method is highly inefficient in terms of fuel consumption and energy efficiency, leading to high emissions. Zigzag technology, on the other hand, which is being promoted by Pak-EPA in ICT, involves arranging bricks in a zigzag pattern, which improves energy efficiency and reduces climate-altering emissions.
This traditional method is notorious for causing severe air pollution, environmental degradation, and multiple health hazards to surrounding communities, contributing significantly to smog and deteriorating air quality.
Pak-EPA Director General Nazia Zeb Ali highlighted the agency's stance against polluting traditional brick kilns operating in ICT, warning their owners to shift their kilns onto the zig-zag technology or face stern actions under the relevant environmental laws.
“The strict enforcement of environmental laws will continue and those violating them at any level would be taken to task,” the capital’s environmental watchdog head Nazia Zeb Ali remarked.
She reiterated the agency’s zero-tolerance policy toward practices that harm public health and the environment at any level.
Pak-EPA Director General Nazia Zeb Ali emphasised that this operation is, in fact, a part of Pak-EPA’s ongoing efforts to combat air pollution and promote sustainable industrial practices throughout the Islamabad Capital Territory.

Modi’s war drums echo dangerously across South Asia,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316290-modi-s-war-drums-echo-dangerously-across-south-asia,"In South Asia, peace has always been fragile—but under the reign of Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), it has begun to feel like a distant illusion. Over the past decade, India’s political climate has been increasingly shaped by the language of belligerence, not diplomacy; by threats, not talks. From the Pulwama-Balakot episode to the more recent cross-border escalations, every confrontation with Pakistan has been seized by Modi as an opportunity to stoke nationalistic fervor, whip up war frenzy, and posture as a strongman.
Now, with India’s recent skirmishes with Pakistan making global headlines and the public demanding accountability, it appears Modi has resorted once again to his old, tired trick—provocative rhetoric. His speech in Gujarat this week, laced with ominous threats and taunts, was less a statement of policy and more a desperate face-saving tactic. “Live peacefully and eat your bread, or else my bullet is ready,” he warned Pakistanis, as if peace were a gift to be offered at gunpoint.
This is not the language of a statesman—it is the language of someone trying to claw back a narrative that has slipped from his grasp. With his image taking a hit at home and abroad, Modi seems to be betting on bluster to mask blunders. But in doing so, he is not just undermining his own credibility—he is risking the stability of an entire region.
This chilling pronouncement is not just a slip of the tongue or a stray campaign flourish. It is a calculated, dangerous provocation issued by the leader of a nuclear-armed state. Such saber-rattling, masquerading as patriotic fervor, is reckless in a region that has already seen too many brushes with catastrophe. Modi’s words strike not only at Pakistan but at the fragile peace of the entire subcontinent.
Behind the prime minister’s rhetoric lies a disturbing strategy: using threats of war to whip up domestic support, distract from growing internal discontent, and whitewash rising authoritarianism under the banner of nationalism. Whether it is unemployment, inflation, the systematic persecution of minorities, or the rising disillusionment in Indian-occupied Kashmir, Modi’s war talk serves as an aggressive smokescreen for domestic failures. For a man who claims to lead a global economic powerhouse, resorting to playground threats of bullets and bombs reflects not strength but desperation.
What’s equally alarming is Modi’s casual invocation of past military strikes, including dubious claims of the destruction of “terror bases” and airfields. He celebrates these actions like a medal ceremony rather than the grave affairs of statecraft they are. His reference to Operation Sindoor as an “expression of India’s emotion” is a disturbing testament to the personalization of military might—using the army not as an institution of national defense but as an extension of political branding.
The juxtaposition of these threats with boasts about India’s economic rise is telling. “We have surpassed Japan,” he declared proudly, as if GDP growth somehow licenses violent rhetoric against a neighboring country. This conflation of development and destruction is not only intellectually bankrupt—it’s morally corrosive. It suggests that economic progress absolves a country from upholding international norms and decency.
Pakistan’s official response rightly condemned Modi’s statements as “hate-driven” and in “violation of the UN Charter.” The Foreign Office spokesperson’s remarks also pointed to a critical truth: that India’s real challenge with extremism lies not across its borders but within them. The rise of majoritarian Hindutva, state-sponsored intolerance, and the demonization of minorities in India has become one of the defining features of Modi’s governance. To project blame externally while fanning the flames of internal communalism is hypocrisy of the highest order.
International observers cannot afford to dismiss this rhetoric as routine campaign noise. With both nations possessing nuclear capabilities and a long, bitter history of conflict, language matters. A threat from the prime minister of India is not just another headline—it has the potential to destabilize the region, derail diplomatic efforts, and embolden extremist elements on all sides.
If India wishes to truly emerge as a global leader, it must adopt the language of peace, diplomacy, and restraint—not that of fire and fury. The international community, particularly those nations that claim to champion global peace and the rule of law, must take serious note of these developments. Silence in the face of incendiary rhetoric is complicity.

‘Korangi fish harbour revamp to give $100m boost to maritime economy’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316291-korangi-fish-harbour-revamp-to-give-100m-boost-to-maritime-economy,"Islamabad : Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, Federal Minister of Maritime Affairs, has said that transformative project to modernise Korangi Fish Harbour (KOFHA) is projected to generate over $100 million in direct and indirect economic activity over the next five years as part of its commitment to advancing the blue economy.
Mr Chaudhry speaking on the occasion said this project is expected to create more than 3,000 jobs spanning construction, logistics, fish processing and the fishing sector, while enhancing seafood processing capacity by 50 per cent. This strategic move will make a meaningful contribution to Pakistan’s $375 billion GDP, strengthening the maritime economy and supporting long-term national growth, he stated.
Central to this transformation is the redesign of the fish auction hall, which will be upgraded with state-of-the-art facilities to improve efficiency, ensure transparency and elevate hygiene and handling standards, the minister noted. He opined that this will be in addition to a floating jetty which will significantly enhance the operational capacity of the harbour.

‘May 28 a memorable day in history of Pakistan’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316292-may-28-a-memorable-day-in-history-of-pakistan,"Rawalpindi : May 28th is a memorable day in Pakistan’s history. On this day, Pakistan responded to India with a befitting reply by conducting nuclear explosions, making the country invincible.
Islamic countries need to unite to protect their faith and Muslims, which is in the best interest of all, says a press release.
Chairman ‘Tahreek-e-Difa-e-Pakistan’, Zahid Bukhari, while addressing a gathering on the occasion of ‘Youm-e-Takbir’ (May 28th), said that this day is a memorable day in Pakistan’s history. On this day, Pakistan responded to India with a befitting reply by conducting nuclear explosions, making the country invincible and becoming the first nuclear power in the Islamic world.
He praised the late Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, the creator of the atomic bomb, saying that his contribution to Pakistan and the Islamic world would be remembered forever. Zahid Bukhari emphasized that unfortunately, Islamic countries are not united, which allows anti-Islamic forces to oppress Muslims. The world and Islamic countries remain silent on atrocities in Palestine.
He warned that if Islamic countries continue to remain silent, it would embolden the infidels and lead to more oppression of Muslims. Zahid Bukhari expressed pride in Pakistan’s atomic bomb and its armed forces, which have defended the country’s borders and responded bravely to Indian aggression on May 9th and 10th.
He concluded that Pakistan has become invincible, and anyone who dares to attack it will be taught a lesson that will be remembered for generations to come.

Alleged anomalies in solarisation scheme: Anti-graft body restrained from action against company,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316203-alleged-anomalies-in-solarisation-scheme-anti-graft-body-restrained-from-action-against-company,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has restrained the Anti-Corruption Establishment from taking action against a private company in connection with an inquiry into alleged irregularities in the solarization scheme of mosques in various constituencies of Mardan.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Ejaz Anwar and Justice Inamullah Khan heard the writ petition filed by Abdul Sattar Khan, CEO of Best Sun Power and Pak Friends Construction and Development Limited.
The petitioner made the Director of Anti-Corruption, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and others respondents in the case. During the hearing, the petitioner’s counsel, Advocate Ahmad Farooq Khattak, informed the court that the petitioner’s company was duly registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) in Peshawar.
The Tehsil Municipal Administration (TMA) Mardan had floated tenders for the solarization of mosques in constituencies PK-51, PK-58, and PK-53, in which the petitioner company participated and was declared successful.
He stated that a formal agreement was signed between the company and the Mardan TMA, under which the company completed the project.
A physical inspection of the project was also carried out, and a report was submitted to the concerned authorities. Payments were subsequently made to the company.
However, MPA Muhammad Salam from PK-56 later levelled allegations of corruption in the scheme, claiming that government funds allocated for the project were embezzled and procurement officers misused their authority. Based on this complaint, the Anti-Corruption Department conducted an audit.
The petitioner’s lawyer argued that the audit report, dated May 19, 2025, was prepared without any inspection or proper record verification and is baseless and contrary to facts.
He added that the petitioners were neither heard nor was any physical verification of the project sites conducted. Despite this, proceedings were initiated against them. The lawyer contended that the audit report was unlawful and lacked transparency, violating the fundamental rights of the petitioner company.
He requested the court to declare the audit report and the resulting proceedings as illegal and to order a fresh inquiry or audit, including a site visit and an opportunity for the company to present its version.
The court observed that the petitioner company had already completed the project. However, according to the company, it is now being made a scapegoat for political reasons.

Prolonged loadshedding: Angry protesters block KKH in Mansehra,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316206-prolonged-loadshedding-angry-protesters-block-kkh-in-mansehra,"MANSEHRA: Residents of various localities blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) for over two hours on Wednesday, demanding an end to prolonged and unscheduled loadshedding in the city and its suburbs.
“Peshawar Electric Supply Company suspends electricity supply over 10 hours a day amid a scorching heatwave, and women, children, and elderly people are the worst affected,” said Mohammad Sohail, one of the protesters, while addressing the crowd.
Residents of Dhodial and adjoining areas took to the streets and blocked the Karakoram Highway to all types of traffic for over two hours. They raised slogans against the government and Pesco to demand an immediate end to the power outages.

He added that people had also met with senior officials of Pesco and the deputy commissioner, seeking an end to the prolonged outages during the extreme heat, but to no avail.

Symposium: New treatments for leishmaniasis discussed,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316207-symposium-new-treatments-for-leishmaniasis-discussed,"PESHAWAR: A one-day symposium on cutaneous leishmaniasis brought together leading health experts for an in-depth discussion on combating this painful and disfiguring skin disease, which has been on the rise in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in recent years.
Titled “Leishmaniasis: Challenges and Opportunities in Treatment, Diagnosis and Management”, the event was organized by the Institute of Pathology and Diagnostic Medicine at Khyber Medical University (KMU) to highlight urgent strategies for prevention, treatment, and public awareness.
The Alexander Fleming Hall of KMU welcomed students, public health practitioners, and media professionals during the symposium.
Experts who shared their views included Dr. Khalid Rehman (Public Health Department, KMU), Dr. Aakifullah Khan (Director, IRNUM - Photodynamic Therapy), Dr. Adnan Amin (Professor, Gomal University, D.I. Khan), Dr. Qaisar Jamal (Professor, Zoology Department, University of Peshawar), Dr. Yaser Mehmood (Director, IPDM, KMU), Dr. Gulab Fatima, Taj Ali Khan (Immunology, KMU), Ms. Bibi Zainab (Clinical Psychologist, Special Education), and Dr. Salauddin (Entomologist, Vector Control Programme, KP).
Participants agreed to launch cutting-edge, research-based clinical trials at the IRNUM hospital for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis using Photodynamic Therapy. This emerging treatment utilizes a photosensitizing agent and light to selectively destroy diseased cells while sparing healthy tissue.
In addition to Photodynamic Therapy, a clinical trial will be conducted on Leish-Nat Z, an indigenous herbal formulation developed by Dr. Adnan Amin (Gomal University) and Dr. Momin Khan (Associate Professor of Microbiology, KMU). Dr. Aakifullah Khan informed participants about promising results in treating several patients at IRNUM using Photodynamic Therapy.
Dr. Momin presented trial data on Leish-Nat Z, a compound developed after five years of research, comprising herbal ingredients such as Allium Sativum, Pistacia Vera Oil, Cinnamomum Verum, Syzygium Aromaticum (Clove), Nigella Sativa, and Azadirachta Indica (Neem Tree).
Dr. Qaisar Jamal emphasized the need to focus on prevention and vector control by using insecticide sprays and innovative techniques like toxic sugar bait, which have shown success internationally. He noted that over 90 sand fly species are known vectors of Leishmania parasites. He further explained that sand fly larvae, which feed on feces, can be targeted during their growth stage through insecticide-treated bait.
Salauddin Marwat of the Vector Control Programme shared that the majority of CL cases in Pakistan are reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. So far in 2025, 8,475 cases have been reported in the province, compared to 59,053 cases in 2023.
He said that UNICEF had recently provided 75,000 doses of Glucantine injections, which have been distributed across various healthcare facilities in the province.
“The Vector Control Department has submitted a summary for the purchase of machinery for treating CL using Cryotherapy (application of extreme cold) or Thermotherapy (heat-based treatment),” Salauddin added. However, the summary has yet to be approved, causing delays in equipment procurement.
Ms. Bibi Zainab, a clinical psychologist, highlighted the psychological impact of disfigurement caused by the disease, especially when it affects exposed parts of the body. “In addition to dermatological treatment, the government should also prioritize the emotional well-being of patients by arranging psychological counseling,” she urged.

"Petition about reward mechanism: Court puts FBR, others on notice",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316208-petition-about-reward-mechanism-court-puts-fbr-others-on-notice,"PESHAWAR: A bench of the Islamabad High Court, headed by Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas, has issued notices to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the federal government, and other relevant authorities in response to a writ petition challenging a separate reward mechanism devised for senior officers while ignoring non-cadre officials involved in tax collection.
The writ petition was filed through Advocate Ishaq Ali Qazi on behalf of Akbar Nawaz and other land revenue officers and employees of the Income Tax Department.
It stated that the petitioners were employees of the Income Tax Department and had been actively involved in tax collection duties for several years.
According to the petition, department employees have traditionally been awarded incentives based on the proportion of tax collected, encouraging them to perform their duties with dedication and ultimately benefiting the national exchequer.
However, in 2025, a new Statutory Regulatory Order (SRO) was issued that created a separate additional cadre exclusively for CSP (Civil Services of Pakistan) officers. Previously, rewards were distributed evenly among all officers.
The petition argued that this new policy discriminated against non-cadre officers and amounted to biased treatment.
Advocate Ishaq Ali Qazi told the court that tax collection was a joint effort involving all staff members, from Class IV employees to senior officers.
He questioned why only CSP officers should receive rewards when all employees contribute equally to tax collection.

Elders in Kurram strike peace agreement,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316209-elders-in-kurram-strike-peace-agreement,"PARACHINAR:  The elders of upper and central Kurram on Tuesday signed a peace agreement paving the way for lasting peace and development in the violence-hit tribal district.
The tribal elders from key areas, including Karman Gram, Alam Sher, Dongila, Khumad, Khumsa, Para Chamkani and others participated in the negotiations and formally agreed to uphold peace.
A grand tribal jirga was held in the Khumsa area, where a large number of tribal leaders from the Turi, Bangash and Para Chamkani tribes were joined by district officials. Deputy Commissioner Ashfaq Ahmed and Additional Deputy Commissioner Aamir Nawaz also addressed the gathering.

Jirga threatens to besiege gridstation if power cuts not reduced in Takhtbhai,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316212-jirga-threatens-to-besiege-gridstation-if-power-cuts-not-reduced-in-takhtbhai,"TAKHTBHAI: A grand jirga of all political parties and civil society organisations on Wednesday announced to besiege the electricity gridstation and stage a protest sit-in in Jalala if excessive power loadshedding was not reduced by June 2.
Speaking at a press conference, convener of the grand jirga and Jamaat-e-Islami PK-60 leader Nauman Yousaf, Awami National Party’s Muhammad Ayub Yousafzai, Pakistan People’s Party’s Aurangzeb Khan, former lawmaker Mian Nadir Shah, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl’s Dost Muhammad Darvesh, Abdur Razzaq Mastkhel of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, Youth Parliament founder Allama Muhammad Siddiq, Tahreek-i-Tahaffuz Takhtbhai chairman Sardaraz Khan, Takhtbhai Tehsil Council chairman Muhammad Saeed and others said that electricity was being generated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but the people here were experiencing excessive laodshedding in extreme heat while Punjab and Islamabad enjoying their electricity.
They said that in extremely hot weather, people were subjected to 12 to 18 hours loadshedding daily that had also severely affected businesses.
The speakers said that most electricity feeders in Takhtbhai had 90 percent recovery, but still the power distribution company was unfairly carrying out excessive loadshedding due to its own line losses, electricity theft, and failure to recover payments from other areas.
They said that this injustice was unacceptable, adding that officials concerned had pledged a few days ago to reduce power cuts but that did not happen.
They demanded that at least Rs1 billion out of the uncovered Rs500 billion mega scandal should be given to power supply companies to get the people rid of the excessive loadshedding.
They warned that if unjust loadshedding was not reduced by June 2, the grand jirga along with thousands of people would besiege the Jalala Gridstation and launch a strong protest sit-in for which all preparations had been completed.

Tax office destroys over one million counterfeit cigarettes in crackdown on illicit trade,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316215-tax-office-destroys-over-one-million-counterfeit-cigarettes-in-crackdown-on-illicit-trade,"KARACHI: In a major enforcement action against the illicit tobacco trade, the Regional Tax Office-I (RTO-I) Karachi has destroyed 1,070,000 non-duty paid and counterfeit cigarettes, with an estimated market value of Rs11 million.
The operation was a joint initiative between RTO-I and the Intelligence and Inspection Wing (Inland Revenue), which organised the destruction of the seized goods in Gadap Town. The effort forms part of the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) wider campaign to tackle tax evasion.
Speaking at the event, RTO-I officials said that the operation demonstrated the government’s commitment to enforcing tax laws and promoting economic transparency.
They warned that strict action would continue against individuals and entities involved in the manufacture, distribution or sale of illegal tobacco products.
They further emphasised that tax evasion in any form would not be tolerated, and that action in accordance with the law would be taken to challenge the culture of tax avoidance and ensure due revenue is collected across all sectors.

CCP fines housing developer Rs150m over misleading claims,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316216-ccp-fines-housing-developer-rs150m-over-misleading-claims,"KARACHI:  Pakistan’s antitrust authority has fined a real estate developer Rs150 million for misleading advertisements related to a housing project.
The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) found that the project, contrary to its claims that it was in Islamabad, is located in Mouza Choora, in Rawalpindi. The company was also found to have falsely claimed affiliations with the government’s Naya Pakistan Housing Programme and its associated authority, NAPHDA.
The penalty follows a suo motu investigation by the CCP’s Office of Fair Trade, which concluded that the company disseminated misleading information in violation of Sections 10(2)(a) and 10(2)(b) of the Competition Act, 2010. The Commission levied Rs75 million for each infraction.
The CCP further noted the developer’s persistent non-compliance, including failure to submit audited financial statements, disregard for regulatory directives and absence of filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) for multiple years -- issues that raise red flags over the company’s governance and transparency.
In a statement, the CCP reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding consumers and promoting fair competition in the country’s housing and real estate sector.

More than 200 jobs cut at ILO as US slashes funding,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316217-more-than-200-jobs-cut-at-ilo-as-us-slashes-funding,"GENEVA: The Geneva-based International Labour Organisation (ILO) has axed about 225 jobs due to cutbacks in US funding at the United Nations agency, its head said on Wednesday.
The job losses, which affect posts at the ILO’s Geneva headquarters and in the field, follow the US administration’s decision to reduce voluntary contributions under President Donald Trump, ILO Director-General Gilbert F Houngbo said.
“One job loss is too many ... You would not imagine the mood that has generated within my staff,” he told reporters in Geneva.
The ILO head also raised the possibility of relocating some of the agency’s operations out of Geneva, one of the world’s most expensive cities, to ease financial pressures, which is also part of broader talks on reform.
Potential locations could be European cities such as Turin, Budapest, or Bonn, or further afield in places including Doha and Pretoria, Houngbo said.
Short-term contractors and employees at some other UN agencies like the International Organisation for Migration have already been informed of redundancies. But thousands more job losses could be on the way as international agencies grapple with funding shortages due to the withdrawal of aid by the Trump administration and other donors.
“The US is the top contributor for assessed and voluntary contribution, so our challenge is double,” Houngbo said, highlighting also a broader pullback in financial support among member states.
The US accounts for 22 per cent of the ILO’s $880 million two-year budget for 2026-2027, expected to be approved at the ILO’s International Labour Conference next week.
“Worst case scenario, we may have to consider a revised budget. I don’t recall the last time that happened to the ILO,” Houngbo said.
He said he is developing a business continuity plan in case of further cuts to financial support, and that the ILO will be implementing a freeze on external recruitment, as well as launching a voluntary redundancy programme.

"Stocks wobble as relief rally fades, Japan debt sale disappoints",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316218-stocks-wobble-as-relief-rally-fades-japan-debt-sale-disappoints,"LONDON: Stock markets dipped on Wednesday as optimism over easing trade tensions ran out of steam and a weak Japanese debt sale fuelled concerns about rising bond yields.
European and Asian equities struggled to track a rally the previous day on Wall Street fuelled by forecast-beating US consumer confidence data and easing tensions between the US and European Union.
“The fizz of relief boosting stocks so far this week looks set to go a little flat, as a wait-and-see mood looks set to spread on Wall Street,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.
Markets had been lifted at the start of the week after US President Donald Trump delayed 50 per cent tariffs on the EU that had sparked a market rout.
But “risk sentiment has lost some steam on Wednesday”, said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading group XTB.
“There are no major drivers of sentiment this morning, however, multiple factors have led to a softening in risk appetite including, higher bond yields after a weak auction of Japanese debt,” she added.
London, Paris and Frankfurt were all lower in midday deals, after giving up earlier gains. In Asia, Hong Kong fell while Shanghai and Tokyo were flat at the close.
Wellington was also in the red even after New Zealand’s central bank cut interest rates for the sixth meeting in a row.
The yen lost some of its early gains after the auction of 40-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) was met with the worst take-up since July.
That came after last week saw the worst auction of 20-year notes for more than a decade.
The cost of government debt has risen around the world in recent weeks -- notably hitting record highs last week in Japan -- amid worries about rising spending as leaders try to support their economies and after Trump’s April 2 tariff blitz. The Bank of Japan’s decision to reduce its purchases of JGBs as it looks to tighten monetary policy in the face rising inflation has added to the rising yields.
The gloomy auction reversed Tuesday’s rally that came after Japan’s Ministry of Finance sent a questionnaire to market players regarding issuance, fuelling talk that it was considering slowing its sales, meaning there would be less supply. Bonds yields rise and prices fall when demand is weak.
Still, Masahiko Loo, senior fixed-income strategist at State Street Global Advisors, said the JGB panic may have been overdone. “Any perceived supply-demand imbalance is more a matter of timing mismatches, which is a technical dislocation rather than a fundamental flaw.” “We expect these imbalances to be resolved as early as the third quarter of 2025,” he said.

Govt borrowing from banks falls to Rs2.8tr amid fiscal discipline,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316219-govt-borrowing-from-banks-falls-to-rs2-8tr-amid-fiscal-discipline,"KARACHI: The government’s borrowing from banks decreased to Rs2.881 trillion between July 1, 2024 and May 16, 2025, down from Rs6.795 trillion a year earlier, according to the latest data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
During the period from July to May in FY2025, the government borrowed Rs2.137 trillion from the banking system for budgetary support, a significant decline from the Rs5.657 trillion borrowed during the same period last year.
“The government has reduced its borrowing for budgetary needs by 60 per cent, demonstrating fiscal discipline, and is targeting a primary surplus of 2.1 per cent of GDP for the current year. Additionally, it has repaid Rs648 billion in debt to the State Bank of Pakistan,” said Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities Limited.
“However, the bulk of the increase in money supply is driven by a rise in cash in circulation, which raises concerns about a potential shift towards undocumented economic activity,” Ashraf added.
Pakistan is set to announce its federal budget for fiscal year 2026 on June 10. Analysts anticipate that this budget will emphasise fiscal consolidation, adhere to International Monetary Fund (IMF) guidelines, and broaden the tax base to include untaxed or low-tax areas. Additionally, the government has committed to continued fiscal consolidation in the FY26 budget to ensure debt sustainability, as agreed with the IMF.
“The government targets a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP (vs 2-2.1 per cent of GDP in FY25), a surplus for the third consecutive year after two decades. The government has also committed to using any windfall dividend expected from the central bank over and above 1.0 per cent of GDP to retire debt,” said Topline Securities in a report published last week.
According to data from the SBP, while government borrowings from banks are declining, lending to the private sector is on the rise, indicating a growing credit demand from businesses and consumers amid economic recovery and decreasing borrowing costs. Between July 1, 2024 and May 16, 2025, banks provided Rs681.6 billion in loans, compared with Rs277.2 billion during the same period last year. This month, the SBP lowered its benchmark interest rate by 100 bps to 11 per cent, marking the continuation of a series of rate cuts that reduced the rate from a record high of 22 per cent after a brief hold in March. The policy rate has fallen by 11 percentage points since June 2024.

NBP launches ATM services at cattle market to promote cashless transactions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316220-nbp-launches-atm-services-at-cattle-market-to-promote-cashless-transactions,"KARACHI: The National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) has installed an ATM booth at the cattle market near the Northern Bypass in Karachi to provide fast, secure and convenient banking services during the busy Eid season, a statement said on Wednesday.
This initiative, part of the State Bank of Pakistan’s ‘Go Cashless’ campaign, is designed to promote digital transactions and financial inclusion. Dedicated NBP staff are stationed on-site to support customers and ensure smooth ATM usage, enhancing overall user experience.
The availability of ATM services within the market reduces the need to carry large sums of cash, increasing both convenience and safety for traders, farmers and buyers.
Faisal Ahmed Topra, SEVP and Group Chief (A), Retail Banking Group at NBP, emphasised the bank’s commitment: “We are proud to extend our ATM services to the cattle market in Karachi, enabling secure and convenient cashless transactions. This initiative supports seamless business activity and reflects our commitment to financial inclusion.”
By offering modern banking tools in traditionally cash-heavy environments, NBP is helping drive economic activity and customer trust, especially in preparation for Eid-related livestock sales.

"PBF calls for cotton tax relief, SME lending in pre-budget talks",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316221-pbf-calls-for-cotton-tax-relief-sme-lending-in-pre-budget-talks,"KARACHI: A delegation from the Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) has urged the government to provide targeted relief for the agricultural sector, including the removal of sales tax on domestic cotton and reduced import duties on cotton ginning machinery, as part of the upcoming federal budget.
At a meeting with Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, the delegation called for measures to reduce cultivation costs and boost local cotton production, warning that sustainable economic growth is not achievable without direct support for agriculture.
“The government must take concrete steps to lower the cost of cultivation,” said one delegate, pointing to tax relief on fertilisers and an end to the 18 per cent general sales tax on domestically produced cotton.
The minister indicated broad alignment with the proposals, noting that his ministry is already working to remove the GST on local cotton and resolve longstanding Cotton Cess liabilities that have constrained the Central Cotton Committee’s funding.
“We are also considering restrictions on tax-free yarn and fabric imports under the Export Facilitation Scheme to protect local producers,” he said. “This year’s target is to produce 10 million cotton bales, and we are committed to supporting farmers through the budget.”
The delegation also recommended decentralising agricultural research by deploying seed varieties and technologies developed by the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council to local levels, and bridging the gap between federal research and provincial implementation.
Separately, the group welcomed the easing of cotton seed imports and called for legislation to encourage banks to increase lending to small and medium-sized enterprises, saying current reluctance to finance smaller firms is hindering industrial growth.

Retailers pummelled by Trump’s trade war entertain more ‘take-private’ offers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316222-retailers-pummelled-by-trump-s-trade-war-entertain-more-take-private-offers,"NEW YORK: Boards and the owners of retailers whose shares have been pummelled by US President Donald Trump’s trade war are increasingly warming to offers to sell -- and to escape the market chaos that has caused company valuations to seesaw in recent months.
Following sneaker-maker Skechers’ take-private deal earlier this month, dealmakers expect other retailers to clinch their own deals to go private in the near-term, especially if Trump does not soon settle on a more stable trade policy, according to interviews with 10 investment bankers and M&A lawyers.
Retailers in particular have been hard-hit by Trump’s rapidly shifting tariff announcements, and are frustrated with an inability to provide earnings guidance.
Skechers was in talks with investment firm 3G Capital long before its market value began a precipitous drop from an all-time high of around $11.85 billion on January 30 -- the day before the White House announced its first round of tariffs against China -- according to two people familiar with the matter.
The flood of tariff announcements beat the company’s value down to about $7.4 billion by the end of April. Skechers, which manufactures most of its goods in China and Vietnam, pulled its 2025 earnings guidance around that time, citing “macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies”.
Skechers is majority-owned by the Greenberg family. The tariff turmoil made the idea of going private all the more attractive to the Greenbergs, said the sources, who asked not to be named because the negotiations were private.
The company announced plans on May 5 to sell to 3G Capital in a so-called take-private deal for about $9.4 billion. Selling to a privately held firm like 3G removes the company’s shares from public exchanges, which effectively shields its earnings from public scrutiny and protects its valuation from unpredictable market swings.
Skechers declined to comment.
Other retailers are already in talks to sell to investment firms and other companies, the sources said.
“The breakneck pace of the instability, the volatility, and the macro changes have made board members start thinking, ‘Would it be better to manage this business in private where we don’t have to report out to the street with the same quarterly cadence and where we can control operational, financial, and capital allocation decisions in private?’” said Kurt Anthony, head of consumer and retail investment banking for the Americas at UBS.

TAKE-PRIVATE TARGETS
Few industries have been hit harder by Trump's tariffs than retailers, many of which manufacture most of their goods overseas and have had to pull earnings guidance amid fickle foreign policy. After de-escalating his trade war, Trump on Friday levied fresh threats against Apple and the European Union (EU), sending markets that had mostly recovered from his initial trade moves reeling once again. The S&P Retail Select Industry index had fallen by 6.0 per cent year-to-date as of Friday's market close, while the broader S&P 500 Index had fallen 1.1 per cent in the same period.
“There are a lot of CEOs that reached out to me and said ‘I’m tired, I love what I do, but maybe it’s time I go private,’” said Jamie Salter, CEO of Authentic Brands Group. The company, which owns the intellectual property of several apparel companies including Reebok and Champion, acquired Dockers’ IP from Levi’s last week. “I think you’re going to see good companies either stay private, or go private.”
And companies where a family -- as in the case of Skechers -- or a single investor has a controlling stake can sign these deals faster and more easily than those that need broad shareholder approval.
Investment bankers and advisers pointed to other retailers with similar ownership structures as potential take-private targets: Under Armour where founder and CEO Kevin Plank has majority voting control, Columbia Sportswear Company where chairman and CEO Timothy Boyle and his family are the biggest shareholders, and Birkenstock with private equity firm L Catterton holding a majority stake. Under Armour, Columbia, Birkenstock and L Catterton did not respond to requests for comment.
In Skechers’ case, navigating the market uncertainty in private made sense to father-son duo Robert Greenberg, chairman and CEO, and Michael Greenberg, president, said the two people familiar with the family’s thinking. And a buyer like 3G, which has held some investments for over a decade, can afford to ride out short-term tariff and market volatility compared with traditional private equity firms that tend to hold their investments for a handful of years, the people said.

"Sterling steady against the dollar as economic data, trade deals offer support",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316223-sterling-steady-against-the-dollar-as-economic-data-trade-deals-offer-support,"Sterling was steady against the dollar on Wednesday, hovering near Monday’s three-year high, as it continued to be supported by favourable economic data last week as well as Britain’s recent trade deals.
Investors also looked towards a multi-year spending review by finance minister Rachel Reeves in two weeks which will set the budgets for public services.
Sterling was little changed at $1.3511 but stayed close to the three-year high of $1.3593 it touched on Monday. It was little changed against the euro, with the euro broadly flat at 83.86 pence in its seventh week of losses against the pound.
“Sterling’s done pretty well recently,” Rabobank strategist Jane Foley said, pointing to stronger-than-expected inflation and slightly stronger retail sales data last week and trade deals that Britain struck with both India and the US as reasons for the currency’s resilience.
However, the spending review is pushing attention back onto the challenges that Reeves faces around the fiscal situation in the country, Foley said, as the government, which had pledged not to increase taxes and keep spending tight while still fuelling economic growth, seems to be prepared to pour more money into defence and health, among other issues.
Reeves is due to set out budgets for individual government departments for the next three years in a spending review on June 11, after the overall total was outlined in October. “There’s obviously a bit of a conundrum for her to face, and that could create perhaps a few headwinds for sterling, given that it has had a reasonably good run for now,” Foley said.
Sterling has risen by 8.0 per cent against the dollar so far this year, and has regained ground against the euro in the past weeks from its April lows at 87.38 pence. Last week’s data showed that British retail sales jumped in April, while the inflation print erased market expectations for a cut at the Bank of England’s next meeting in June. “The BoE is still trying to manage these dual elements of sticky inflation and sluggish growth,” said Paul Hollingsworth, head of developed markets economics at BNP Paribas, during a call presenting the French bank's global economic outlook.
Despite optimism around the “green shoots” from consumer spending data, Hollingsworth warned of supply-side woes and the prospect of further fiscal consolidation measures over the coming months.

"Mango deal sweetens ties between Bangladesh, China",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316224-mango-deal-sweetens-ties-between-bangladesh-china,"DHAKA: Bangladesh waved off its first consignment of mangoes to China on Wednesday, a largely symbolic export as Beijing sweetens ties after relations soured between Dhaka and former ally and neighbour India.
Bangladesh, still reeling from the political fallout of a 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina -- who fled by helicopter to New Delhi -- has since been courted by Beijing.
“It is such a great pleasure to jointly witness this historic moment, as the first consignment of Bangladesh’s premium mangoes sets off for China,” China’s ambassador to Bangladesh Yao Wen said, alongside government officials.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy.
Interim Bangladeshi leader Muhammad Yunus’s first state visit was to China, while Bangladesh has also moved closer to Pakistan.
“President Xi Jinping has emphasised on several occasions that China’s door of opening up will not close, but will only open wider,” Yao said, at a small ceremony at the airport alongside Bangladeshi ministers.
“I am confident that the export of Bangladeshi mangoes to China is just the beginning,” he added.
In China, the fruit has a particular historic diplomatic resonance -- including the curious cult of the mango.
After Chairman Mao Zedong was pictured gifting a mango to a group of workers in 1968, during the mania of the Cultural Revolution, the fruit became an object of veneration.
Those mangoes were reportedly a gift from the foreign minister of Pakistan -- and at that time, in 1968, Bangladesh had yet to win its independence from Islamabad.
Export levels are small so far, just 50 tonnes in an initial phase, but both Bangladesh and China said they hoped to increase that.
In the past year, China has sponsored several tours for Dhaka’s political party leaders, and has begun hosting Bangladeshi patients in its hospitals.
India has long been wary of China’s growing regional clout and the world’s two most populous countries compete for influence in South Asia, despite a recent diplomatic thaw.

How elite capture is undermining Pakistan’s growth,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316225-how-elite-capture-is-undermining-pakistan-s-growth,"LAHORE: The core challenge facing resource-rich Pakistan is not a lack of potential, but a deeply entrenched elite that is unwilling to relinquish even the smallest of privileges. As a result, the country has lived beyond its means for far too long -- a crisis rooted in poor governance.
The privileged classes have repeatedly secured bailouts, largely due to Pakistan’s strategic geopolitical importance. While these bailouts have safeguarded elite interests, they have left the broader economy in a state of chronic instability.
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) continue to impose a heavy burden on the national exchequer. These entities enjoy significant competitive advantages, including outright subsidies, concessionary financing, government guarantees, monopoly status and exemption from bankruptcy rules. Such preferential treatment has created an uneven playing field, making it nearly impossible for private enterprises -- which operate without these benefits and face strict banking regulations -- to compete effectively.
The cumulative losses of major SOEs such as Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan Railways, and Pakistan Steel Mills amount to approximately Rs1 million per minute, based on annual losses of Rs500-700 billion.
Despite these challenges, a turnaround remains possible -- provided that merit-based governance and prudent reforms are adopted. The ongoing economic turmoil is more a consequence of mismanagement than corruption. Decades of elite capture have led to a crowding out of investment in human development, leaving over 110 million young people with limited skills and education, and unable to participate meaningfully in economic growth. What could have been a demographic dividend is fast becoming a demographic crisis.
To catch up with regional competitors such as India and China, Pakistan must aim for a growth rate of 8-9 per cent annually. This would require significant reductions in the size of government, clear priority setting, and urgent investment in infrastructure.
Foreign aid, rather than catalysing reform, has often postponed it -- with vested interest groups capturing donor funds. Greater emphasis should be placed on regional trade, particularly with fast-growing markets in the East. Pakistan has yet to effectively integrate with neighbouring economies; despite proximity, trade with Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Myanmar, and the Central Asian Republics accounts for less than 2.0 per cent of total trade. Although Afghanistan remains a lucrative market, it is also unstable. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), if fully operational, could open up opportunities for expanded trade with Central Asia, China and Russia.
Sustainable growth will require Pakistan’s elite to abandon narrow self-interest and support meaningful reforms. While the business community continues to call for lower interest rates, such a move is not currently feasible due to high government borrowing, which places upward pressure on demand within the banking sector. Interest rates can only be reduced once this demand subsides.
Macroeconomic indicators such as inflation and exchange rate stability remain encouraging. In the meantime, planners must urgently set the right priorities and fix infrastructure gaps to bring the economy back on track.

"Extreme heatwave threatens environmental, water security, warns expert",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316226-extreme-heatwave-threatens-environmental-water-security-warns-expert,"KARACHI: Pakistan is facing one of the most intense heatwaves in its history, with temperatures soaring well above seasonal norms and raising alarms about the country’s environmental and water security.
Prof Dr Muhammad Ismail Kumbhar, a renowned expert in sustainable development, has warned that while the current heatwave captures headlines, the deeper environmental crises it signals are being dangerously ignored.
“This is not merely an extreme weather event,” said Dr Kumbhar. “It is a stark warning of the accelerating climate emergency that directly threatens our food systems, water supply and energy security.”
He pointed out that global academic institutions like Imperial College London and the University of Hawaii are actively studying the effects of climate change in Pakistan. However, within the country, research institutions, policymakers, and the media remain largely disengaged from the gravity of the situation. “We are in a crisis, yet national attention remains superficial,” he said.
Dr Kumbhar highlighted a critical issue rarely addressed in public discourse: the rapid depletion of groundwater. In Islamabad, for instance, groundwater levels that were once accessible at 70 feet now lie beyond 400 feet. “If this trend continues, even water tanker services will collapse under the strain. The silence on this matter is deeply troubling,” he noted.
He also warned of the compounding effects of climate change -- frequent glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), extensive deforestation, rising sea levels threatening major cities like Karachi, and drying rivers. “Pakistan is standing on the edge of an ecological breakdown. Without urgent intervention, the damage may be irreversible,” Dr Kumbhar cautioned.
Historically, Pakistan has suffered from deadly heatwaves, but their frequency and severity have sharply increased in recent years. In 2015, a heatwave claimed over 1,200 lives in Karachi alone, exposing the lack of preparedness and resilience in urban infrastructure. Subsequent years have seen repeated temperature spikes, with many regions recording highs above 50 degrees C. This year, vast stretches of Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan have been placed under red alerts by meteorological authorities.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified South Asia, including Pakistan, as one of the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions. Factors such as rapid urbanisation, deforestation, poor water management and limited public awareness exacerbate the impacts of global warming in the country.
Dr Kumbhar called for a nationwide climate resilience strategy that places environmental sustainability and water governance at the heart of all development plans. “Universities, think tanks, civil society and political leaders must collaborate on urgent climate action. Without this, we are endangering not only our present but the very survival of future generations,” he stressed.
As Pakistan braces for further climate shocks in the months ahead, experts agree that this heatwave must serve as more than a temporary alarm. It is a call for systemic change.

CEO Mobilink Microfinance Bank says digital loans are powerful tool for inclusion,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316227-ceo-mobilink-microfinance-bank-says-digital-loans-are-powerful-tool-for-inclusion,"KARACHI: Haaris Mahmood Chaudhary, CEO of Mobilink Microfinance Bank, highlighted the transformative impact of digital loans offered through JazzCash, emphasising their critical role in promoting financial inclusion and supporting microentrepreneurs, a statement said on Wednesday.
JazzCash issues over 140,000 loans daily. Notably, around 25 per cent of these loans are extended to women, underscoring the platform’s commitment to empowering underserved segments of the population. Explaining the unique nature of these products, Chaudhary said that digital loans are designed to offer short-term credit, ranging from just 1 day up to a maximum period of eight weeks, but these loans are usually for very short durations -- sometimes only 5 to 7 days.
The loan comes with a low, non-compounding weekly fee, which remains unchanged throughout the 8-week period. Once the loan reaches the 8-week mark, the payable amount remains constant and unchanged. This means that customers must pay back the same amount regardless of how much time has passed. Through ReadyCash service, customers can confidently enjoy the benefits of a short-term loan without worrying about escalating costs. In partnership with EFU Life Assurance, JazzCash also offers free life and health insurance for nano-loan customers borrowing Rs6,000 or more. This initiative redefines responsible lending practices and ensures that individuals and families have access to essential protection, safeguarding their financial future. With complimentary life and health insurance, customers are covered for unforeseen macroeconomic shocks.
Chaudhary stressed that digital loans fill a crucial gap in the financial ecosystem. “Before these formal financial products, many individuals had to rely on informal lenders who were often not transparent with their terms and conditions.” He added that nano loans offered by credible digital financial service providers offer a dignified, respectful alternative. Borrowers can access quick credit through mobile apps, repay on time, and maintain their self-respect. This is true financial inclusion.

Zheng feeling the love in Paris but wary of ‘hungry’ Mboko,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316246-zheng-feeling-the-love-in-paris-but-wary-of-hungry-mboko,"PARIS: China’s Zheng Qinwen said Wednesday she was feeling the love of the Paris crowd where she won Olympic gold last year but is wary of Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko who now awaits in the third round of the French Open.
The 22-year-old Zheng dispatched Colombia’s Emiliana Arango 6-2, 6-3 in the second round with 18-year-old Mboko easing past Germany’s Eva Lys 6-4, 6-4 in the French capital.
The Chinese eighth seed has won eight straight matches on the red clay of Roland Garros after her run to Olympic gold last year.
“Of course after the Olympic Games, there is more French fans they know about me. If I don’t play with a French player, of course they’re going to support me,” Zheng told journalists.
“I’m happy to get liked by the crowd, because always when the crowd is with you, of course you feel more energy, you can get more inspired from the crowd. You can get more motivation from them.”

Pakistan face Kyrgyzstan in CAVA League tomorrow,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316247-pakistan-face-kyrgyzstan-in-cava-league-tomorrow,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been grouped with Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in the 4th Central Asian Volleyball Association (CAVA) League starting from today (Thursday) in Fergana (Uzbekistan).
Both India and Pakistan have been included in different groups in the CAVA that was earlier scheduled to be held in Islamabad. Since India are a weaker side, their chances of reaching the semi-finals are remote hence no clash against Pakistan.
Pool A includes host Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Iran and India. Defending champions Pakistan will open their campaign against Kyrgyzstan tomorrow (Friday) and will take on Kazakhstan the next day (May 31).
Pakistan have already reached Fergana to figure in the event. The team players trained on Wednesday and planned another set of training for today (Thursday).

Kohli primed to banish years of heartache in IPL playoffs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316248-kohli-primed-to-banish-years-of-heartache-in-ipl-playoffs,"NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli can fulfil his dream of finally winning the Indian Premier League when the playoffs begin this week, desperate to banish the “heartbreak” of losing the final as captain nine years ago.
Kohli’s Royal Challengers Bengaluru face table-toppers Punjab Kings on Thursday in Mullanpur after securing second place by chasing 228 to beat Lucknow Super Giants on Tuesday.
The winners go straight into the final in Ahmedabad on June 3.
But even if Bengaluru lose that encounter, they will have another chance to reach the final against the winners of Friday’s “eliminator” between Gujarat Titans and Mumbai Indians.
The 36-year-old Kohli recently retired from Tests having already walked away from T20 internationals after India’s World Cup triumph last year.
But the hunger to lift the IPL trophy still burns bright for the two-time World Cup winner, who played a leading part in India’s 50-over Champions Trophy victory earlier this year.
“I had two heartbreaks in my life in 2016,” Kohli told Indian broadcaster JioStar.
“First was the World T20 and then the IPL final.”
Affectionately known as “King Kohli”, he has scored more runs than anyone in IPL history and is the only player to have spent all 18 seasons of the league with one team since its inception in 2008.
He has been on the losing side in the final three times, in 2009, 2011 and 2016, but fans believe that it is an omen that Kohli wears number 18 on his shirt -- and that it will be 18th time lucky this year.
He has been in vintage form as he pursues his goal: his 54 on Tuesday that set up victory against Lucknow was his eighth half-century of a season in which he has made 602 runs at an average of 60.20.
A delay to the season caused by the conflict with Pakistan means some overseas players will be missing from the playoffs including Gujarat’s Jos Buttler, who has international commitments with England.
But Australia pace bowler Josh Hazlewood returned to the Bengaluru squad on Sunday and is expected to play on Thursday, having left when the IPL was suspended on May 9. There had been doubts over his return because of a shoulder niggle and the playoffs clashing with preparations for Australia’s World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord’s on June 11.
Punjab will be without left-arm quick bowler Marco Jansen, who has left to join South Africa’s training camp ahead of the Test showpiece.
“Every team’s missing players,” Punjab head coach Ricky Ponting said.
“We’d like to think we’ve got good depth, and be able to cover for Marco, despite it being a big miss.”
Five-time champions Mumbai, led by Hardik Pandya, seem to have been the worst hit by the extended schedule overlapping with the international calendar.
They have lost England’s Will Jacks and the South African duo of Ryan Rickelton and Corbin Bosch for their eliminator against Gujarat.
The Titans, IPL champions on their debut in 2022, have a formidable batting line-up even without Buttler.
Skipper Shubman Gill, who has taken over from the retired Rohit Sharma as Test captain, and fellow opener Sai Sudharsan are the top two on this season’s batting charts, with 679 and 649 runs respectively.
Gill will take charge of India for the first time when they embark on a five-Test tour of England, starting at Headingley, Leeds, on June 20.

Toothless Man Utd beaten in Malaysia friendly,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316249-toothless-man-utd-beaten-in-malaysia-friendly,"KUALA LUMPUR: Manchester United’s dismal season suffered fresh embarrassment as they were beaten 1-0 by a Southeast Asian XI in sweltering Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday in front of a crowd of 72,550.
Ruben Amorim’s side, who finished 15th in the Premier League for their worst season since 1974, looked lethargic and devoid of ideas in the heat.
Some fans at Bukit Jalil national stadium left before the end and a few boos rang out at the final whistle.
In their first of two post-season games in Asia, United started with several regulars including Harry Maguire, Rasmus Hojlund, Casemiro, Diogo Dalot, Manuel Ugarte, Kobbie Mainoo and Andre Onana.
In temperatures of 32 degrees Celsius (90 Fahrenheit) at kickoff, it was the ASEAN All Stars who looked more threatening.
Filipino defender Amani Aguinaldo blasted a shot just wide in the 16th minute.
Onana was called into action midway through the first half with a low save that endeared him to the largely United-supporting crowd.
Mainoo provided the first real threat for Manchester Utd with a 25-yard effort that was turned behind for a corner, before the young midfielder saw his shot cleared off the line in the 38th minute.
Captain Bruno Fernandes came on in the second half and his half-volley drew a loud cheer after a drab restart.
The Southeast Asian side stunned Amorim’s men through a brilliant counter-attack in the 71st minute.
Burmese attacker Maung Maung Lwin found himself clean through on goal and the 29-year-old fired emphatically into the top corner past Tom Heaton.
The home team could have had a second soon after, but Heaton came to the rescue to prevent further embarrassment.  United now head to Hong Kong for a friendly on Friday.

"Djokovic powers through as Gauff, Andreeva win",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316250-djokovic-powers-through-as-gauff-andreeva-win,"PARIS: Novak Djokovic made a clinical start to his latest pursuit of a record-breaking 25th Grand Slam title at the French Open on Tuesday, while women’s contenders Coco Gauff and Mirra Andreeva successfully got their campaigns under way at a windy Roland Garros.
The 38-year-old Djokovic had little trouble in seeing off 98th-ranked American Mackenzie McDonald 6-3, 6-3, 6-3, three days after becoming only the third man to win 100 ATP titles with his victory in Geneva.
“Well, the emotions were really nice,” said Djokovic, seeded sixth and playing in Paris for the first time since winning Olympic gold last August.
“But, you know, it was quite challenging conditions I think at the beginning of the match with the wind and rain and everything that was happening.”
The three-time French Open champion lost his opening matches in both Monte Carlo and Madrid earlier in the clay-court season, but was dominant against McDonald, despite failing to serve out the second set in the eighth game.
“I think it was good move to go to Geneva, to be honest, because I was also struggling a little bit with confidence level, doubting my game a bit,” said Djokovic.
“So it was good that I got four matches under my belt, won a title. Coming into Roland Garros, it feels different than I had comparing to the feeling I had three weeks ago. Let’s see how far I can go here, but I have a good feeling for now.”
The Serb, who withdrew injured before the quarter-finals in 2024, will next meet 73rd-ranked Frenchman Corentin Moutet.
Djokovic is on the same half of the draw as world number one Jannik Sinner and last year’s runner-up Alexander Zverev, who saw off American teenager Learner Tien 6-3, 6-3, 6-4.
World number three Zverev is hoping to go a step further than 12 months ago when he lost the final to Carlos Alcaraz, his third defeat in as many Grand Slam finals.
Zverev, who has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the last four French Opens, will next face Dutchman Jesper de Jong.
Former US Open champion and five-time Grand Slam runner-up Daniil Medvedev was dumped out in the first round for the sixth time in Paris, losing a dramatic clash with Cameron Norrie 7-5, 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-5.
Grigor Dimitrov retired injured for a fourth consecutive Grand Slam tournament, calling it quits due to a leg injury when leading American Ethan Quinn by two sets to one.
British fifth seed Jack Draper won his first match at the French Open, rallying past Italy’s 68th-ranked Mattia Bellucci 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 to reach the second round on his third attempt.
Ninth seed Alex de Minaur, a quarter-finalist at each of the past four majors, started well with an accomplished 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (8/6) win over Serbia’s Laslo Djere.
Miami champion Jakub Mensik came through an entertaining match against Frenchman Alexandre Muller, 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 6-3 victory.
In the women’s draw, 2022 runner-up Gauff brushed aside Australia’s Olivia Gadecki 6-2, 6-2.
Gauff, the 2023 US Open winner, has not won a tournament since last year’s WTA Finals but reached the finals at both Madrid and Rome this month.
The 21-year-old American has reached the quarter-finals or better in each of her past four visits to Roland Garros.
“I knew it wasn’t going to be a clean match with how windy it was,” said the second seed, who initially forgot her racquets which had to be collected by a ball boy.
“Honestly, it was two different matches depending on which side of the court you were on.”
Rising Russian star Andreeva is eyeing her maiden Grand Slam crown after WTA 1000 titles in Dubai and Indian Wells and recovered well after falling 3-0 down to Spaniard Cristina Bucsa in the first set.
The 18-year-old quickly overturned the double-break deficit and eventually cruised to a 6-4, 6-3 victory over the world number 98.
“With time I played better and better, so I felt like closer to the end of the match was playing good, not like in the beginning,” said the sixth seed.
Andreeva, who reached the semi-finals last year, will play American Ashlyn Krueger in the second round.
Third seed Jessica Pegula also made serene progress with a 6-2, 6-4 success against Romania’s Anca Todoni as the American returned to Roland Garros after missing the 2024 edition due to injuries.
Two-time former Australian Open champion Victoria Azarenka hammered Belgium’s Yanina Wickmayer, who will retire after Wimbledon, 6-0, 6-0 on Court 6, while Magdalena Frech knocked out three-time Grand Slam finalist Ons Jabeur.

Zidane ‘can’t wait to take ‘dream France job,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316251-zidane-can-t-wait-to-take-dream-france-job,"PARIS: Zinedine Zidane, widely tipped in France to take over as national coach after the 2026 World Cup, said the job would be “a dream” and that he was “looking forward” to taking it.
Zidane, who is 52, was speaking at an event on Monday organised by his long-time sponsors Adidas, French media reported.
“I feel qualified for the French team, where I played and spent practically 12, 13, 14 years as a player. Of course it’s a dream. I can’t wait,” said Zidane, a former captain of Les Bleus and the scorer of two goals as they won the 1998 World Cup final.
His midfield partner in that match and in France’s Euro 200 triumph, was Didier Deschamps who has been in charge of the French side since 2012. Deschamps led Les Bleus to the World Cup in 2018 but has announced that he will end his reign after the 2026 World Cup in the USA, Canada and Mexico.
As a coach Zidane took Real to three Champions League triumphs and two Liga titles but has not taken a coaching job since ending his second spell at Real in 2021.

Rugged Acerbi the symbol of Inter’s bid to make history,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316252-rugged-acerbi-the-symbol-of-inter-s-bid-to-make-history,"MILAN: Francesco Acerbi could crown his long, turbulent career with the biggest prize in club football after bouncing back from cancer, depression and alcoholism to play a key part in Inter Milan’s charge to the Champions League final.
The Italy international’s stoppage-time equaliser was probably the defining moment in Inter’s barely believable semi-final triumph over Barcelona, as the oldest player in an old team.
A 37-year-old centre-back, Acerbi had to be the most surprising goalscorer in a tie for the ages, finding himself in the opposition penalty area to smash in his first ever Champions League goal just as the game looked up for Inter.
Everything about his goal embodied the fighting spirit Inter have shown in their two classic wins over Barca and, in the previous round, Bayern Munich.
Acerbi hammered home Denzel Dumfries’ low cross with his unfavoured right foot which was wearing a boot with a hole in it, before stripping off to reveal a rangy body covered with tattoos.
The somewhat rustic image contrasted with slick, youthful Barca led by teenage phenomenon Lamine Yamal.
“It was a really special moment. I could feel that something changed when the ball hit the net,” said Inter midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu on Monday.
“It was the moment that we realised that we could win the match.”
Despite his age, Acerbi is Simone Inzaghi’s first choice in the heart of Inter’s three-man central defence and will start against paris Saint-Germain in Munich on Saturday.
Acerbi has come through some tough times both on the field and off it, battling depression following the death of his father while he was briefly at AC Milan over a decade ago, and then two bouts of testicular cancer which he believes were the catalyst for him to turn his life around.
“After my dad died I crashed and hit rock bottom. I was at Milan and nothing stimulated me. I didn’t even know how to play anymore,” he said in 2019.
“I started drinking, I drank everything. Cancer saved me. I had something to fight against again, something to overcome.
“I asked myself, ‘what do you do if it comes back?’ and I decided that I would face it again. I saw things clearly and I know that from one day to the next, everything could change.
“I’d even say that the disease improved me... I stopped dreaming, I prefer now to set myself achievable goals.”
One of those targets was the Italy team, which he reached at the age of 31 when -- after couple of friendly appearances earlier in his career -- he played his first official Azzurri match against Finland in September 2019, netting his one and only internation goal against Bosnia and Herzegovina two months later.
Acerbi has been rewarded for his memorable season by a recall to the Italy set-up for upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Norway and Moldova, a first call-up since March last year.
But he was forced to leave his last Azzurri training camp after allegations that he racially abused Juan Jesus during a highly-charged match between Inter and Napoli.
Acerbi was spared punishment by the Italian football federation (FIGC) due a lack of evidence, the disciplinary authorities saying that “the discriminatory content... seems to have been perceived only by the offended player”.

World’s top golfers expect tough test at US Women’s Open,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316253-world-s-top-golfers-expect-tough-test-at-us-women-s-open,"CHICAGO: Top-ranked Nelly Korda, world number two Jeeno Thitikul and third-ranked Lydia Ko chase a major title none of them has won when the 80th US Women’s Open tees off Thursday.
Defending champion Yuka Saso of Japan seeks her third US Women’s Open crown in five seasons at the par-72, 6,829-yard Erin Hills layout in Erin, Wisconsin.
“Conditions here can be very difficult,” Saso said. “I think it’s going to be a good challenge.
“It would be nice to win another one. Any other tournament would make me as happy, but if I win again, it would be more special. Winning keeps me motivated.”
Korda, a two-time major champion, seeks the only major title on home soil that has eluded her.
“It’s going to test everyone’s game, very demanding,” Korda said. “The bunkers are not easy. It doesn’t really matter how far you hit it. It’s all about accuracy at the end of the day.
“It’s firm. It’s fast as well. Even if you think you’ve hit it good, you can never exhale when you see it stop.”
Ill winds could blow away the chances of contenders, Korda warned.
“Weather plays a pretty big role out here, especially with no trees to block it,” Korda said. “When it gets windy out here, it’s really going to play with your golf ball.”

Pacers beat Knicks to move one win shy of reaching NBA Finals,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316254-pacers-beat-knicks-to-move-one-win-shy-of-reaching-nba-finals,"WASHINGTON: Tyrese Haliburton delivered his second career playoff triple double to power Indiana over New York 130-121 on Tuesday, lifting the Pacers one win from the NBA Finals.
Haliburton scored 32 points, passed off 15 assists and grabbed a career-high 12 rebounds while making no turnovers over 38 minutes -- becoming the first player in NBA playoff history with 30-15-10 and no turnovers.
Indiana, which blew a 20-point lead in a game three home loss, seized a 3-1 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals with the home triumph.
“I was just trying to be aggressive, trying to respond,” Haliburton said. “I felt like I let the team down in game three so it was important to come out here and just make plays.
“Guys put me in position to make plays and play my game and man, it’s a big win for us.”
Game five is set for Thursday in New York’s Madison Square Garden.
“I’m excited about it. It’s going to be a lot of fun,” Haliburton said. “It’s a tough environment to play in. We’ve got to be ready. Just one more game, take what we can from this and be ready for game five.”
The East winner will face either Oklahoma City or Minnesota in the NBA Finals starting June 5.
Haliburton’s father was in the arena after a month-long ban following an on-court incident with Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo earlier in the playoffs.
“Hell yeah. I’m glad pop is in the building,” Haliburton said. “It makes it that much more sweet. Had a little bit to do with it.”
Pascal Siakam added 30 points for the Pacers while Bennedict Mathurin added 20 points off the bench for Indiana.
“We just wanted to come out with more energy, more urgency, play Pacers basketball,” Siakam said. “I thought we did that from the beginning. They made runs but we stuck to our game plan.”
Jalen Brunson led the Knicks with 31 points while Karl-Anthony Towns had 24 points and 12 rebounds, O.G. Anunoby had 22 points and Mikael Bridges netted 17 points.
The Pacers last made the NBA Finals in 2000, losing to the Los Angeles Lakers, and have never won the NBA title.
The Knicks haven’t reached the NBA Finals since losing to San Antonio in 1999 and haven’t won the league crown since 1973.
Indiana won the first two games at Madison Square Garden and took a 55-35 lead in game three at home before the Knicks rallied to win, denying the Pacers a possible sweep.
That helped spark Indiana to a strong start in game four.
The Pacers closed the first quarter on a 12-5 run to seize a 43-35 lead, with Haliburton having 15 points, six assists and five rebounds in the period.
New York answered in the second quarter with a 9-2 run to pull level at 51-51 but a 6-0 Indiana run to close the quarter left the Pacers ahead 69-64, with Haliburton near a first-half triple double on 20 points, 10 assists and eight rebounds.
Indiana began the third quarter with a 7-0 run for a 76-64 lead, taking advantage of two forced turnovers for a 19-2 edge in fast break points, and a 9-4 run to close the third quarter stretched the Pacers’ lead to 102-91 entering the fourth.
New York went on a 10-2 run to pull within 115-109, but a Siakam three-pointer and Haliburton basket kept Indiana ahead 120-114 with 3:06 remaining.
Towns suffered a left knee injury defending a drive by Myles Turner with 2:10 remaining but stayed in the game.
The Pacers pulled ahead 123-114 with 1:44 to play and Obi Toppin sank a three-pointer with 46 seconds remaining for a 126-116 Indiana lead to seal New York’s fate.

"More to life than football, says Klopp after Liverpool parade crash",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316255-more-to-life-than-football-says-klopp-after-liverpool-parade-crash,"LIVERPOOL: Liverpool’s beloved former manager Jurgen Klopp said there are more “serious things in the world than football” after car ploughed into supporters at the end of a parade to celebrate the club’s Premier League title triumph.
A 53-year-old man from the Liverpool area has been held by police on suspicion of attempted murder and taking drugs after 65 people were injured in Monday’s shocking scenes.
Klopp, who left the English giants a year ago, was in attendance for the parade.
It was the first chance the club and supporters had to celebrate a title triumph together for 35 years as the 2019/20 league won by Klopp’s side came during a period of restrictions on public gatherings due to Covid-19.
“The mood was incredible and from one second to the other, everything changed because we then learned again there are more serious things in the world than football,” Klopp when being presented with an award by the League Managers’ Association.
“Thoughts and prayers go definitely to the, as far as I know right now, to the injured people, but to the families, of course, as well.
“It should have been one of the greatest days in the history of the city, after a long, long time, because we didn’t have the opportunity to do that the last time.”
Liverpool boss Arne Slot withdrew from the same event, where he was due to pick up a manager of the year award, out of respect for the victims.
In the shock that followed the incident, even Liverpool’s fiercest rivals Manchester United, Everton and Manchester City were among the clubs to offer their support to the Premier League champions and their fans.
“Football is and always should be a game built on rivalry, but it is also a great source of comradeship, especially at times like this,” Slot said in a statement.
“I would also like to pay tribute to the emergency services and other authorities in Liverpool who swung into action as soon as the incident happened.

Inzaghi eyeing Champions League glory and legend status at Inter Milan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316256-inzaghi-eyeing-champions-league-glory-and-legend-status-at-inter-milan,"MILAN: Simone Inzaghi is on the verge of becoming a true Inter Milan great as he leads his team to the Champions League final with another chance for an era-defining triumph to make up for the pain of conceding the Serie A title to Napoli.
Inter have become one of Europe’s top teams under Inzaghi and reaching the final of the continent’s leading club competition for the second time in three seasons is a testament to the impressive job he has done since taking charge in 2021.
The 48-year-old has had to navigate off-field turbulence and serious financial problems which have left Inter with a transfer budget which is a fraction of the what nouveau riche clubs like Saturday’s opponents Paris Saint-Germain have at their disposal.
But he will contest this weekend’s showdown with Qatari-backed PSG with potentially a better chance of winning the Champions League than he did in Istanbul in 2023, when Inter were narrowly beaten by possibly Pep Guardiola’s best-ever Manchester City team.
Last season’s league title, the first of Inzaghi’s coaching career, was immediately followed by an enforced takeover by US investment firm Oaktree after previous owners, China’s Suning, failed to repay a debt worth around 395 million euros ($448 million).
And there was little in the way of summer investment for an ageing team which features veterans like 37-year-old Francesco Acerbi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who is one year Acerbi’s junior.
Piotr Zielinski and Mehdi Taremi were both free transfers, second-choice goalkeeper Josep Martinez cost around 13 million euros, and January signing Nicola Zalewski came on loan from Roma.
None of those four have become first picks for Inzaghi with Taremi netting twice all season, both goals being late penalties in 4-0 wins over Red Star Belgrade and Lecce.
The lack of quality beyond the first XI, particularly in attack, and a gruelling Champions League campaign has taken its toll on Inter.
The biggest prize in club football would sit pride of place among the honours already won by Inzaghi at Inter -- one Serie A title, three Italian Cups and three Italian Super Cups.
Inzaghi had a lower-key playing career than his elder sibling Filippo, who was a prolific goalscorer for AC Milan and Juventus, a two-time European champion and World Cup winner.

PGA Tour eliminates starting strokes from Tour Championship,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316258-pga-tour-eliminates-starting-strokes-from-tour-championship,"MIAMI: Starting strokes will be eliminated from the season-ending Tour Championship, the PGA Tour announced on Tuesday, with the 30-man playoff finale being played as a 72-hole stroke-play tournament.
Players in past years had been given a staggered lead based on FedEx Cup season points, with last year’s winner Scottie Scheffler starting at 10-under and finishing on 30-under to beat fellow American Collin Morikawa by four strokes after Morikawa began on four-under.
Over 72 holes, Morikawa was 26-under and Scheffler was 20-under but the starting strokes edge gave Scheffler the FedEx Cup playoff crown.
The tour’s player advisory council and policy board approved changes to the playoff format on Tuesday that will have all players starting at level par as in a usual tournament.  The new format will be played in this year’s Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta from August 21 to 24.
“Today’s announcement is an important first step in the evolution of our post-season,” said PGA Tour commissioner Jay Monahan.
“The Player Advisory Council led a thorough process to respond to what our fans are asking for: The most competitive golf in the world, played for the highest stakes, in the most straightforward and engaging format.”
Other changes to the Tour Championship include changing course set-ups to encourage more risk-reward choices throughout each round to help build drama.
The playoff format will narrow the field to 30 golfers but the player advisory council is studying the qualification system with an eye to boosting the value of season points and keeping the field the toughest to reach on tour.
Other ideas are being considered with possible announcements coming later this year.
“We want the Tour Championship to be the hardest tournament to qualify for and the FedEx Cup trophy the most difficult to win,” world number one Scheffler said.

UN rights office ‘concerned’ as Kuwaitis lose citizenship,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316338-un-rights-office-concerned-as-kuwaitis-lose-citizenship,"DUBAI: The United Nations´ human rights office voiced concern on Wednesday after tens of thousands of Kuwaitis were stripped of citizenship, many of them women.
More than 37,000 people, including at least 26,000 women, have lost Kuwaiti nationality since August, according to an AFP tally of official figures, although media reports suggest the real number could be much higher.
The mass revocations have been cast as part of a reformist agenda spearheaded by Kuwaiti emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, in power since December 2023.
“We are deeply concerned about Kuwait´s recent nationality revocations, particularly of individuals who renounced previous citizenships, and about the extension of such revocations to their dependents,” UN Human Rights Office spokesperson Seif Magango told AFP. “Stripping people of their nationalities has a serious impact on their economic, social, cultural, and political rights.”
The new ruling applies to women who became Kuwaitis through marriage since 1987. Official data show 38,505 women were naturalised by marriage from 1993 to 2020.
It also targets people with dual nationality, which Kuwait does not allow and those who were naturalised for their achievements.
The campaign has left thousands of people in a legal grey area and scrambling to restore their previous nationality.
Kuwait has set up a committee to hear appeals, with more than 14,000 applying so far, according to the official Kuwait News Agency. However, Magango said: “Their inability to challenge these decisions in court also raises serious concerns.

French surgeon sentenced to 20 years for abusing children,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316339-french-surgeon-sentenced-to-20-years-for-abusing-children,"VANNES, France: A French court on Wednesday gave the maximum 20-year jail term to a surgeon who admitted sexually abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, but victims, some in tears, expressed disappointment with the verdict.
The three-month trial of Joel Le Scouarnec, 74, has brought to light the extent of his crimes and the suffering of his victims but also raised questions about why more was not done sooner to stop him.
Le Scouarnec, one of the most prolific convicted sex predators in France´s history, was already in prison after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces.
The 20-year sentence handed down by presiding judge Aude Buresi was the maximum that could be given on the charge of aggravated rape in France, where sentences are not added together on individual counts.

"Merz says Germany, Ukraine to jointly produce long-range weapons",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316340-merz-says-germany-ukraine-to-jointly-produce-long-range-weapons,"BERLIN: German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said on Wednesday during a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Berlin will help Kyiv develop new long-range weapons that can hit targets well inside Russian territory.
Both countries´ defence ministers later signed a memorandum of understanding for the production of long-range weapons systems, but without revealing technical details or naming the manufacturers involved.
“There will be no range restrictions, allowing Ukraine to fully defend itself, even against military targets outside its own territory,” Merz told a joint press conference.
Zelensky´s Berlin visit comes days after Russia launched some of its heaviest missile and drone attacks of the conflict on Ukraine, and as US President Donald Trump has voiced growing frustration with Russia´s President Vladimir Putin.
The Ukrainian president accused Russia of stalling peace talks and said Moscow did not want to halt its three-year invasion, adding that “they will constantly look for reasons not to end the war”.
Merz said that “the massive air strikes, particularly on the city of Kyiv over the weekend, do not speak the language of peace, but rather the language of a war of aggression”.
“This is a slap in the face of all those who are trying to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine itself, but also in Europe and the USA.”
He warned that “the Russian side´s refusal to hold talks, the refusal to observe a ceasefire, now really has consequences, and we are drawing these consequences every day”.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state media when asked about Merz´s weapons announcement: “All these actions naturally hinder peace efforts.”
Merz also pointed to reports that Russia and American investors are hoping to resume Russian gas deliveries through the destroyed Nord Stream pipelines running through the Baltic Sea and vowed that Germany will “do everything” to ensure this will not happen.
Merz, who took power early this month, has vowed to keep strongly backing Ukraine, but without giving details of which weapons Germany is sending, in line with a policy of strategic ambiguity.
The joint production of long-range weapons “can take place both in Ukraine and here in Germany,” he said. “We will not provide any further details until further notice.”
Merz hailed the project as “the beginning of a new form of military-industrial cooperation between our countries that has great potential”.
Merz had pointed out in a TV interview this week that already “there are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine -- neither by the British nor by the French nor by us nor by the Americans”.
“This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... With very few exceptions, it didn´t do that until recently. It can now do that.”
Germany´s defence ministry said the new agreement for direct investment “will enable a significant number of long-range weapons to be produced this year”.
Meanwhile, Russia said on Wednesday it had drafted a peace “memorandum” outlining its terms for ending the Ukraine conflict and would present it to Kyiv at a second round of direct talks in Istanbul next Monday.Ukraine did not immediately comment on Russia´s announcement, and the Kremlin has ruled out a three-way meeting between Vladimir Putin, Volodymyr Zelensky and US leader Donald Trump.
Delegations from Moscow and Kyiv previously met in Istanbul on May 16, their first face-to-face talks on the conflict in over three years amid a United States-led diplomatic push to end the fighting.”Our delegation, led by Vladimir Medinsky, is ready to present a memorandum to the Ukrainian delegation and provide the necessary explanations during a second round of direct talks in Istanbul on Monday, June 2,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a video statement.”
I would like to once again express our gratitude to our Turkish partners for providing a hospitable venue, as confirmed yesterday by Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan during his visit to Moscow,” Lavrov added.

China flexes military muscle with East Asian naval activity,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316341-china-flexes-military-muscle-with-east-asian-naval-activity,"BEIJING: China has flexed its muscles this month by sending an unusually large number of naval and coast guard vessels through a swathe of East Asian waters, according to security documents and officials, in moves that have unnerved regional capitals.
Since early May, China deployed fleets larger than usual, including navy, coast guard and other ships near Taiwan, the southern Japanese islands and the East and South China Seas, according to three regional security officials and documents of regional military activities reviewed by Reuters.
On May 21 and May 27, for instance, China deployed nearly 60 and more than 70 ships, respectively, around three-quarters of them naval, the documents show. These included guided-missile frigates, destroyers and coast guard boats.
Beijing also dispatched two aircraft carrier groups, with the Shandong now in the busy waterway of the South China Sea and the Liaoning off the southeastern coast of Taiwan, the documents show.
“They are exerting pressure on the whole of the first island chain amid global geopolitical uncertainties,” said one security official.
“They are trying to reinforce their dominance,” the source said, adding that drills this month by the Liaoning, the oldest of China’s three aircraft carriers, simulated attacks on foreign ships and aircraft around the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea.

Italy’s bishops cite more abuse victims in past two years,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316342-italy-s-bishops-cite-more-abuse-victims-in-past-two-years,"ROME: Italian Catholic Church dioceses documented 69 cases of alleged abuse of minors or vulnerable adults in the past two years, most within the parish setting, the Bishops Conference said on Wednesday.
In a 98-page report -- designed to track progress in tackling clerical sex abuse within dioceses -- it said the 69 cases over 2023 and 2024 involved 118 alleged victims, nearly a third of whom were between 10 to 14 years old.
In 2022, the survey documented 54 potential victims in 32 cases of abuse.
Eleven of the cases identified in Wednesday´s report involved sexual relations, with 19 involving sexual molestation and 25 cases of touching.
Out of 67 alleged perpetrators, 44 were clerics, 15 were defined as other religious people and the rest were lay people working in the parish.
They had an average age of 50 and all bar two were men.
Confronting a tide of revelations around the world about paedophile priests and cover-ups by senior clergy, the late Pope Francis vowed an “all-out battle” against paedophilia within the Church in 2019.
But critics say not enough is being done, and in Italy, lament the absence of a national inquiry.
The Italian Bishops Conference said the rise in potential victims and perpetrators “can be interpreted as the emergence of facts and situations that were hidden in the past”. “But it must still be noted as a wound that is still present in the ecclesial and social life of the Christian community,” it said.
Last year, only 373 people sought information, counsel or other services at one of the Italian dioceses´ 103 “listening centres” to support victims.
Those centres are mainly run by lay women, many of whom are psychologists or educators.
The centres reported only 14 cases in which they were aware of an abuse case being reported to secular judicial authorities.
The Vatican does not require bishops to automatically refer abuse cases to police.
For internal Church investigations, respondents said 16 cases were subject to a preliminary investigation and 11 cases resulted in penalties or other restrictions.
Six cases were forwarded to the Vatican´s powerful Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, whose duties include disciplinary matters involving sexual abuse cases.  One case resulted in a conviction and in five others the process was pending, the report found.

"In world first, Mexican voters to elect all judges",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316343-in-world-first-mexican-voters-to-elect-all-judges,"MEXICO CITY: Mexico is set to become the world´s only country to let voters elect all of their judges, sparking sharp disagreement about whether the reforms will diminish or strengthen criminal influence over the courts.
The government says the unprecedented popular vote for judges and magistrates at all levels -- including the Supreme Court -- is needed to address rampant corruption and impunity.
Critics argue it will undermine the judiciary´s independence and warn the participation of controversial candidates -- such as a former lawyer for notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman -- means it is doomed to backfire.
On Sunday, voters will choose several thousand federal, district and local judges and magistrates. Another election for the remainder will be held in 2027.
Not just anybody can run for one of these jobs. Candidates must have a law degree, experience in legal affairs, what is termed “a good reputation,” and no criminal record.
Opponents, including judicial workers, have held a series of mass street protests in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the reforms.
“Justice is not something you vote for” and it needs people with experience and specialized knowledge, said Olimpia Rojas Luviano, a 28-year-old lawyer.

"Global temperatures may top 1.5C in next five years, says UN",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316344-global-temperatures-may-top-1-5c-in-next-five-years-says-un,"GENEVA: The United Nations warned on Wednesday that there is a 70 percent chance that average warming from 2025 to 2029 would exceed the 1.5 degrees Celsius international benchmark.
The planet is therefore expected to remain at historic levels of warming after the two hottest years ever recorded in 2023 and 2024, according to an annual climate report published by the World Meteorological Organisation, the UN´s weather and climate agency. “We have just experienced the 10 warmest years on record,” said the WMO´s deputy secretary-general Ko Barrett.
“Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet.”
The 2015 Paris climate accords aimed to limit global warming to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels -- and to pursue efforts to peg it at 1.5C. The targets are calculated relative to the 1850-1900 average, before humanity began industrially burning coal, oil and gas, which emit carbon dioxide (CO2) -- the greenhouse gas largely responsible for climate change.
The more optimistic 1.5C target is one that growing numbers of climate scientists now consider impossible to achieve, as CO2 emissions are still increasing.
The WMO´s latest projections are compiled by Britain´s Met Office national weather service, based on forecasts from multiple global centres.

China launches space probe seeking asteroid samples,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316345-china-launches-space-probe-seeking-asteroid-samples,"BEIJING: China on Thursday launched a space probe on the country´s first mission to retrieve samples from an asteroid and bring them home for research, the Xinhua state news agency reported.
Beijing has ploughed billions of dollars into its space programme in recent years in an effort to achieve what President Xi Jinping describes as the country´s “space dream”.
It has built a space station orbiting the Earth and plans to run a crewed mission to the Moon this decade ahead of establishing a permanent base there.
A Long March-3B rocket carrying the Tianwen-2 probe blasted off from the Xichang launch site in southwestern Sichuan province “in the early hours of Thursday,” Xinhua said.
“Shan Zhongde, head of the China National Space Administration, stated that the Tianwen-2 mission represents a significant step in China´s new journey of interplanetary exploration,” the news agency reported.
Tianwen-2 is tasked with collecting samples from the near-Earth asteroid 2016HO3, and exploring the comet 311P, according to the country´s space agency.
Discovered by scientists in Hawaii in 2016, the asteroid is roughly 40 to 100 metres in diameter and orbits relatively close to Earth.
It is a “living fossil” consisting of ancient materials that can help scientists understand how the early solar system formed, Xinhua reported this week. The comet, meanwhile, orbits between Mars and Jupiter and is alluring to researchers because it exhibits some features more commonly associated with asteroids.

"France-Indonesia pact could lead to new Rafale jet orders, says Macron",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316346-france-indonesia-pact-could-lead-to-new-rafale-jet-orders-says-macron,"JAKARTA: France and Indonesia have signed a preliminary defence pact that could lead to new orders of French military equipment including Rafale fighter jets and Scorpene submarines, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday.
“I am delighted that the letter of intent signed today could open up a new perspective with new orders for Rafales, Scorpenes, light frigates,” Macron said at a joint press conference alongside Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto.
Prabowo said France was one of Indonesia’s main partners as it upgrades its military hardware and develops its defence industry through joint production and technology transfers.
Macron arrived in Jakarta from Vietnam on Tuesday night on the second leg of his Southeast Asia tour. The French president is scheduled to fly to Singapore on Thursday.
Dassault Aviation shares were up 3.4 percent in the morning session in Paris. The jets’ performance came under scrutiny last month after reports that Rafales used by the Indian air force were shot down by Pakistan’s Chinese-made jets in clashes.
Indonesia has yet to receive any of the Rafale jets from the 2022 deal. The chief of the Indonesian Air Force Mohamad Tonny Harjono said in February that six jets would arrive in early 2026, state news agency Antara reported.

EU says ‘well on track’ to reach 2030 climate targets,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316348-eu-says-well-on-track-to-reach-2030-climate-targets,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: The European Union is on track to reach its 2030 climate targets, Brussels said on Wednesday, but uncertainty remains over the bloc´s ambitions to cut greenhouse gas emissions much further by 2040.
The European Commission expects emissions to fall by 54 percent by 2030 compared to 1990, very close to its 55 percent target, it said, after analysing member states´ energy and climate plans for the coming years.
It is seeking to boost European industry confronted by fierce competition in the United States and China, ramp up its defenses faced with Russia, and tackle climate change that is wreaking havoc at an alarming pace with wildfires and floods.

Foreign students wary of US as Trump presses ‘dehumanising’ campaign,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316349-foreign-students-wary-of-us-as-trump-presses-dehumanising-campaign,"CAMBRIDGE, United States: Donald Trump´s expanding crackdown on elite universities is prompting some international students to abandon applications to campuses in the United States and spreading stress and anxiety among those already enrolled.
The president has upended the country´s reputation among foreign students, who number around one million, as he presses a campaign against US universities he sees as obstructing his “Make America Great Again” populist agenda.
He has blocked Harvard hosting international scholars in a maneuver being challenged legally, targeted non-citizen campus activists for deportation, and most recently suspended student visa processing across the board. Harvard applied mathematics and economic student Abdullah Shahid Sial, 20, said the Trump administration´s campaign against US universities that the president accused of being hotbeds of liberal bias and anti-Semitism had been “dehumanising.”
“It´s really unfortunate that this is the case for 18, 19, and 20-year-olds who came here without any family, and in most cases, haven´t been to the US before,” said Sial, who is from Pakistan and hopes to be able to return to Harvard next academic year.
Sial said he advised acquaintances to have backup plans if US colleges became inaccessible, and that a friend applied to Harvard´s law school, as well as Columbia´s, and two less reputable British institutions -- ultimately opting to go to the UK.
“He definitely liked Harvard way more (but) he doesn´t want this amount of uncertainty surrounding his education,” Sial said.
Karl Molden, a Harvard government and classics student from Austria, said Trump´s move to block the university hosting and enrolling foreign students meant he was unsure if he would be able to return after summer vacation. While that decision -- affecting some 27 percent of the overall Harvard population -- was paused by a judge pending a hearing Thursday, the move still threw student plans into chaos.

"Germany to restrict family reunions, toughen citizenship rules",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316351-germany-to-restrict-family-reunions-toughen-citizenship-rules,"BERLIN: The German government on Wednesday agreed plans to restrict family reunions for some migrants and toughen rules for obtaining citizenship.
A clampdown on immigration was a key promise of new conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the campaign for February´s general election, and his government swiftly moved to impose controls at Germany´s borders after taking office earlier this month.
Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told reporters on Wednesday that the new measures marked a “decisive day” for the reduction of irregular migration.
The suspension of family reunions will last for two years and affect people who have “subsidiary protection”, not full refugee status.
Dobrindt said the move would help “take pressure off” local councils tasked with providing for and integrating new arrivals. He recalled that a similar measure was put in place between 2016 and 2018 in the wake of the European migration crisis.
Dobrindt also announced the scrapping of a reform implemented by the previous centre-left government of chancellor Olaf Scholz under which some immigrants could apply for citizenship after three years of residency if they could prove they had had “particular success in integration”.
The minimum residency requirement will now be brought back up to five years.
According to Dobrindt, the new measures will help reduce “pull factors” for migrants who may otherwise attempt to enter Germany via irregular means.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has long railed against immigration, with leading figures in the party demanding mass deportations of foreigners.

US to ban foreign officials over ‘flagrant censorship’ on social media,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316352-us-to-ban-foreign-officials-over-flagrant-censorship-on-social-media,"WASHINGTON: The US will impose visa bans on foreign nationals it deems to be censoring Americans, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday, and he suggested the new policy could target officials regulating US tech companies.
Rubio did not name any specific instances of censorship. But US tech companies and the Trump administration have challenged US allies in Europe, alleging censorship of social media platforms, but restricting officials from visiting the U.S. appeared to be an escalation by Washington.
Rubio said in a statement that a new visa restriction policy would apply to foreign nationals responsible for censorship of protected expression in the US. He said it was unacceptable for foreign officials to issue or threaten arrest warrants for social media posts made on US soil.
“It is similarly unacceptable for foreign officials to demand that American tech platforms adopt global content moderation policies or engage in censorship activity that reaches beyond their authority and into the United States,” Rubio said.
Some foreign officials have taken “flagrant censorship actions against US tech companies and US citizens and residents when they have no authority to do so,” Rubio said.
US social media companies like Facebook and Instagram parent Meta META.O have said an EU content moderation law, the Digital Services Act, amounts to censorship of their platforms.
