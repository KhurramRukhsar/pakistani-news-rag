War only option if India blocks Pakistan’s water: Bilawal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321708-war-only-option-if-india-blocks-pakistan-s-water-bilawal,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has warned that if India attempts to block Pakistan’s water, then war would remain the only option left for the country.
“Such actions pose an existential threat to Pakistan... Water is our lifeline, and we will never relinquish our rightful share under any circumstances,” he said during an interview with a German news outlet, DW Urdu.
A high-level Pakistani Parliamentary delegation, led by Bilawal, recently wrapped up high-level peace mission to Brussels after successful visits to Washington, New York and London to debunk the Indian propaganda in the aftermath of recent conflict between the two countries.
During the interview, Bilawal termed India’s threat to stop water flow to Pakistan a clear violation of the United Nations Charter. He stressed that if India resorts to water aggression, “Pakistan will be left with no choice but war.”
He further said that India is involved in supporting terrorist activities inside Pakistan. “Despite that, we have never advocated for war as response to terrorism,” he said.
“We do not want war,” the PPP chief reiterated, emphasizing Pakistan’s preference for peace but asserting that the country’s survival and water security were non-negotiable.

Need to rid finance bill of errors,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321712-need-to-rid-finance-bill-of-errors,"ISLAMABAD: Some glaring mistakes have surfaced in the Finance Bill for 2025-26 tabled before parliament, whereby the Aviation Policy of 2015 was given as reference, but currently, the Policy of 2023 is in place.
Secondly, the FBR proposed tax exemption on import or lease of aircraft by Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL). The question arises what will happen after the possible privatisation of PIA. A question also arose why the same favour was not granted to other airlines operating in the country under the principle of equity.
There is another issue that on the lease of aircraft, there is a charge of GST on the lease amount, but it does not clarify how this issue would be settled.
Earlier, the mistake on the pension tax surfaced in the proposed Finance Bill 2025-26, which was accepted by the FBR high-ups who commented that it was unintended and would be rectified. If the Finance Bill was approved in its existing shape, it could result in bringing many pensioners into the tax net.
The Finance Bill 2025-26 gives reference to the Aviation Policy 2015. As a matter of fact, the Aviation Policy of 2019 was enacted, and in the latest revision, the Aviation Policy of 2023 was operational at the moment.
Secondly, there is no concept of registration of an airlines, but there is a requirement for a licensing and operation certificate under the ambit of the Civil Aviation Act 2023. There is an immediate need for rectification in Part VI with regard to tariffs in the Finance Bill 2025-26.
The FBR has constituted anomaly committees to rectify the Finance Bill before getting the assent of parliament to convert it into an Act of Parliament.

PTI protests outside Pakistan Embassy in Washington,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321713-pti-protests-outside-pakistan-embassy-in-washington,"KARACHI: On June 14, the American chapter of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) held a protest outside the Pakistan Embassy in Washington, DC, against what it says is authoritarian rule in Pakistan.
Initially, there was confusion around the planned protest in DC. On June 12, just a day after PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan publicly distanced the party from the protest – suggesting it was the work of individual supporters in the US – the official PTI account on X (formerly Twitter) had posted a promotional tweet endorsing the demonstration. The tweet claimed that “PTI USA, in collaboration with the Pakistani diaspora, is organizing a major demonstration in Washington, DC, to protest against the #UndeclaredMartialLaw in Pakistan.”
On June 14, the official PTI account on X posted a series of posts regarding the protest, along with videos and statements from attendees.
Not only that, PTI USA members also posted on X.
According to the PTI’s official account, “From all across North America, the Pakistani diaspora are raising their voices against dictatorship, repression, and the imposition of undeclared martial law”.
Videos online show that former SAPM during Imran Khan’s time, Dr Shahbaz Gill, was also present at the protest.

Govt in talks with ‘crypto mentor’ Michael Saylor on bitcoin reserves,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321717-govt-in-talks-with-crypto-mentor-michael-saylor-on-bitcoin-reserves,"KARACHI: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Sunday chaired a high-level meeting with Michael Saylor, executive chairperson of Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), and Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal bin Saqib to explore the use of Bitcoin as a sovereign reserve asset, according to a statement.
The meeting, held in Islamabad, focused on the role of Bitcoin in strengthening the country’s monetary resilience and accelerating its transition to a digitally enabled economy. “Pakistan aspires to lead the Global South in digital asset adoption,” said Aurangzeb.
Saylor, whose firm is the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin globally, praised Pakistan’s openness to embracing the digital asset. He called Bitcoin a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” for emerging markets to leapfrog legacy financial systems and build long-term economic sovereignty.
Bilal bin Saqib highlighted Strategy’s transformation from a mid-sized software company into a $100+ billion tech giant through disciplined Bitcoin accumulation, adding, “If private individuals can build that in the US, why can’t Pakistan, as a nation, do the same?”
The meeting comes amid growing global momentum behind Bitcoin, punctuated by the recent Bitcoin 2025 conference in the US. There, in his interview with a foreign outlet, Saylor called it the “greatest Bitcoin conference ever”, citing record institutional engagement and swelling public-sector interest. He reiterated his thesis that Bitcoin is “perfect money”, enabling individuals and states to store and transmit economic energy without interference.
Strategy recently doubled its capital plan to $84 billion in a bid to expand Bitcoin holdings and issue Bitcoin-backed financial instruments, such as yield-generating preferred stock -- bridging traditional capital markets and the digital asset economy.
That narrative is gaining traction among governments. In March, the Trump administration announced a sweeping shift in US digital asset policy at the first White House Digital Assets Summit. President Trump unveiled plans for a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, calling it a “virtual Fort Knox for digital gold”, seeded with as many as 200,000 Bitcoin already in government possession.
Trump vowed never to sell the holdings and ordered federal departments to explore cost-free acquisition strategies and inventory all crypto assets across agencies. “America will follow the rule that every Bitcoin knows very well: never sell your Bitcoin,” he said.
The move -- framed as an end to the federal “war on crypto” -- dismantled key regulatory hurdles which had allegedly pressured banks to sever ties with crypto businesses. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the executive order would “augment the assets side of the United States balance sheet”, while other top officials hailed the pivot as restoring “legal fairness” and unleashing a new era of innovation.
The policy shift and global institutional momentum add tailwinds to Pakistan’s ambitions to position itself as a Bitcoin-ready emerging market. “Bitcoin is the strongest asset for long-term national resilience,” Saylor said. “Pakistan has brilliant people and the clarity needed to lead in this space.”

"CEC, ECP members appointment: NA secretariat says procedures being followed",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321718-cec-ecp-members-appointment-na-secretariat-says-procedures-being-followed,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Secretariat on Sunday gave an explanation with regard to constitutional requirements and parliamentary procedures on the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) and two EC members.
It stated that these are being fully adhered to and in this regard, Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq has written a letter in response to the recent letter from the Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub.
According to the spokesperson for the National Assembly, the constitutional and legal procedures for the formation of parliamentary committee are being followed in letter and spirit. It was clarified that the first step in this process is mutual consultation between the prime minister and leader of the opposition.
The spokesperson further stated that the Speaker National Assembly also referred to the letter dated 16 May 2025, sent by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the opposition leader, in which the prime minister wrote for initiation of consultations regarding the nominations.
The speaker National Assembly also wrote if the prime minister and the leader of the opposition fail to reach an agreement on the names of the Chief Election Commissioner or members, then the matter will be referred to the speaker under Article 213(2A) of the Constitution, so that the process for forming the parliamentary committee can be carried forward. The spokesperson added that the prime minister will formally write to the speaker to seek nominations for committee members from all parliamentary leaders.
After this, the speaker will issue letters to all parliamentary leaders and request them to submit names.

The spokesperson further stated that the parliamentary committee can only be constituted when names of members are received from both the government and the opposition. If there is a delay or non-cooperation from either side, the formation of the committee will not be possible. The spokesperson also stated that Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan had demanded in his letter the immediate formation of a parliamentary committee for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Election Commission members.

Senate panel asks FBR to define tax fraud threshold that would lead to arrest,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321720-senate-panel-asks-fbr-to-define-tax-fraud-threshold-that-would-lead-to-arrest,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Finance has asked the FBR to define a threshold and establish slabs for allowing arrests on tax frauds and imprisonment of up to ten years under the proposed Finance Bill 2025-26.
The FBR has proposed drastic powers, including the sealing of business premises, the seizure of movable property, or the appointment of a receiver for the management of the taxable activity of persons who fail to register themselves. It also proposes to bar operations of bank accounts and transfers for immovable property owners who prefer not to get registered for the sales tax.
On the threshold of tax frauds, the FBR proposed that there should be a limit of Rs10 million maximum for allowing arrest. Without taking stern actions, FBR Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial stated that tax fraud cannot be tolerated at all. Senator Anusha Rahman stated that e-commerce was brought into the tax net and proposed that the FBR differentiate for low-income and poor segments of society.
A heated debate occurred among senators and FBR high-ups over whether the arrest in tax fraud to be allowed during the inquiry or after completion of the investigation. Senator Farooq H Naek from the PPP stated that the arrest could only be allowed by the FBR after permission from the judge.
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenues continued to scrutinise the Finance Bill 2025-26 for finalising its recommendations. After getting assent of the Upper House of Parliament, the recommendation will be forwarded to the National Assembly. It is yet to be seen how many substantial recommendations of the Senate are going to be made part of the Finance Bill to convert into an Act.
Senator Farooq H Naek argued that the NAB law was amended because earlier, the arrest was allowed during the inquiry, and now the FBR was proposing sweeping powers.
FBR Chairman Rashid Mehmood Langrial strongly defended the proposed changes in the Finance Bill and stated that if anyone stole a motorcycle, it becomes a cognizable offense, but the Parliamentary Committee was asked not to arrest anyone involved in tax fraud worth billions of rupees.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani stated that they were improving the procedures of allowing arrest in tax frauds under the proposed bill and explained that in the existing provision of Sales Tax under 37 A to prosecute and arrest whereby Assistant Commissioner IR who, based on material evidence has reason to believe that any person has committed a tax fraud or any offense warranting prosecution may cause arrest of such person, but now under the proposed bill the Assistant Commissioner would have to seek permission of Commissioner to initiate an inquiry. He was of the view that the proposed bill placed safeguards to restrict the powers of the FBR.
At one point in time, the FBR chairman stated if the parliamentary panel was not fine with the proposed safeguards, they would be fine with the existing powers.
The senators were offended because of removing the restriction of Rs1 billion for arresting in tax frauds. The committee proposed that there should be a threshold for allowing arrest. Shibli Faraz, the opposition leader of PTI in the Senate, opposed the FBR move for drastic powers.
The FBR proposed 5-year imprisonment for tax frauds up to Rs1 billion and more than Rs1 billion it should be 10 years but nothing could be finalised.

Revised PPAs with wind power plants expected in next two weeks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321722-revised-ppas-with-wind-power-plants-expected-in-next-two-weeks,"ISLAMABAD: The task force on power currently in talks with wind power plants (WPPs) is likely to come up with revised power purchase agreements (PPA) in the next two weeks as has been done with IPPs and government power plants. The government has already revised the power purchase agreements with IPPs and government power plants (GPPs).
“We are on a positive track in talks and hope to seal the deal with WPPs, though talks were tough and took time as there were some hiccups mainly because of the issues pinpointed by lenders of the projects,” a senior official of the Power Division, who is also a part of the negotiations with WPPs, told The News.
“Their debt payment tenure stands for 3-4 years and the government functionaries want lenders to enhance the debt payment tenure. We hope to get relief of Re0.13 per unit.”
The government’s task force, which is in talks with WPPs, comprises Power Minister Sardar Awais Khan Leghari, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation (formerly Special Assistant on Power) Muhammad Ali, National Coordinator Lt-Gen Zafar Iqbal, and representatives from CPPA-G, PPIB, SECP, and Nepra.
“The talks witnessed many stalemates and opposition from lenders of the projects earlier but when they were asked to face the forensic audit, they agreed to initiate talks. However, the talks are very tough but authorities want the revised contracts in the supreme interest of the country. We are heading towards an amicable solution through a transparent manner and may come up with the revised PPAs in the next two weeks.”
Pakistan has 36 operational wind power projects with a cumulative capacity of 1,845.475MW. These projects are primarily located in the Gharo-Jhimpir wind corridor in Sindh province. However, despite this installed capacity, wind power’s contribution to the national energy mix is limited due to transmission constraints and operational challenges.
Out of 36, there are five WPPs installed under CPEC umbrella.

"Children of industrial, mine workers can get admission to COMSATS: Maryam",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321724-children-of-industrial-mine-workers-can-get-admission-to-comsats-maryam,"LAHORE: Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz has announced free education in higher educational institutions for children of industrial and mine workers.
“Children of workers will be admitted to 7 campuses of COMSATS University, Punjab government will pay their fees,” said Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif while announcing the initiative of free education for the children of industrial and mine workers in a highest educational institution.
As directed by chief minister, Worker Welfare Fund has invited applications from workers in this regard.

No child in Punjab, whether he is a child of a worker, will be deprived of education now.” She noted, “We are taking such historic steps for the welfare of workers that are unprecedented in the past.”
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif said, “Children of workers in Punjab will be able to study in COMSATS University, Islamabad, sub-campuses Abbottabad, Wah, Attock, Lahore, Sahiwal and Vehari. Children of disabled and deceased workers will also be provided free education at COMSATS University.”

"Ukraine says received another 1,200 bodies from Russia",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321727-ukraine-says-received-another-1-200-bodies-from-russia,"KYIV, Ukraine: Ukraine on Sunday said it had received another transfer of 1,200 bodies from Russia as part of an exchange agreement struck in Istanbul talks earlier this month.
“Another 1,200 bodies which the Russian side claims belong to Ukrainian citizens, including military personnel, were returned to Ukraine,” Kyiv’s headquarters for the treatment of prisoners of war wrote on social media.
“In total, 4,812 bodies have been returned this week,” Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov said on Facebook. “I am grateful to everyone involved in this humanitarian mission,” he said. Ukraine has not said whether it has transferred any bodies to the Russian side.
The two sides agreed a large-scale exchange of prisoners and bodies of killed soldiers during their latest round of direct talks in Istanbul on June 2. Both Russia and Ukraine typically do not disclose their military losses.
In a rare public estimate, President Volodymyr Zelensky told US news outlet NBC earlier this year that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed and some 380,000 wounded.
Russia has not announced its military deaths since September 2022, when it said fewer than 6,000 soldiers had been killed -- a figure believed to be vastly lower than reality.
Several independent investigations using open sources, such as the publication of death announcements by local officials and family members,
have reported massive death tolls for Moscow’s army.
The Russian website Mediazona and the BBC’s Russian service said they had identified the names of some 111,000 killed Russian soldiers.

Ex-president Sarkozy stripped of France’s top honour after conviction,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321728-ex-president-sarkozy-stripped-of-france-s-top-honour-after-conviction,"PARIS: Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been stripped of his Legion of Honour -- the country’s highest distinction -- following a conviction for graft, according to a decree published Sunday.
The right-winger has been beset by legal problems since he was defeated in the 2012 presidential election after serving one five-year term.
Sarkozy, 70, had been wearing an electronic ankle tag until last month after France’s highest appeals court upheld his conviction last December of trying to illegally secure favours from a judge.
According to the code of the Legion of Honour, France’s top state award, any person definitively sentenced to a term in prison equal to or greater than one year is excluded from the order.
But French President Emmanuel Macron had argued against such a move in April, saying that scandal-plagued Sarkozy had been elected and it was “very important that former presidents are respected”.

Reuters/Ipsos poll: Americans don’t see Supreme Court as politically neutral,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321729-reuters-ipsos-poll-americans-don-t-see-supreme-court-as-politically-neutral,"WASHINGTON: Americans are divided on major issues that the US Supreme Court is due to rule on in the coming weeks, but most agree on one thing - neither Republicans nor Democrats see the nation’s top judicial body as politically neutral, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Just 20 percent of respondents to the poll agreed that the Supreme Court is politically neutral, while 58 percent disagreed and the rest either said they did not know or did not respond. Among people who described themselves as Democrats, only 10 percent agreed it was politically neutral and 74 percent disagreed, while among Republicans 29 percent agreed and 54 percent disagreed. The two-day poll, which closed on Thursday, was based on responses from 1,136 US adults. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, 44 percent of respondents expressed a favorable view of the court, including 67 percent of Republicans and 26 percent of Democrats.
The Supreme Court’s popularity has declined since its June 2022 decision to overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that had legalised abortion nationwide. Some 57 percent of respondents in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted at the end of 2021 expressed a favorable opinion of the court. By the end of June 2022, that figure had fallen to 43 percent.
The justices are expected to issue rulings in major cases in the coming weeks as they near the end of their current term that began in October. Among these cases are one on the legality of Tennessee’s Republican-backed law banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors and one involving Trump’s executive order restricting automatic birthright citizenship, part of his hardline approach to immigration.
Some 53 percent of respondents in the Reuters/Ipsos poll said they supported “laws that prevent transgender children under the age of 18 from getting medical treatment related to gender identity and gender transitioning”. Another 28 percent opposed such laws and the rest were unsure or did not answer the question.
Among Republicans, support for such laws was at 57 percent and opposition at 28 percent, while among Democrats support was at 23 percent and opposition at 54 percent.
After Trump signed his birthright citizenship directive in January, 22 states as well as immigrant rights advocates and pregnant immigrants sued, arguing that it was a violation of citizenship language in the US Constitution’s 14th Amendment.
In the Reuters/Ipsos poll, only 24 percent of all respondents supported ending birthright citizenship and 52 percent opposed it. Among Democrats, 5 percent supported ending it, with 84 percent opposed. Among Republicans, 43 percent supported ending it, with 24 percent opposed. The rest said they were unsure or did not respond to the question.
The court also by the end of this month is expected to issue a ruling on the legality of a Texas law that requires people to verify the age online before accessing pornographic websites.—Reuters

UK’s National Crime Agency asked to investigate grooming gang cases,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321730-uk-s-national-crime-agency-asked-to-investigate-grooming-gang-cases,"LONDON: The British government said on Sunday it would ask the policing agency that investigates serious and organised crime to help track down more people suspected of being involved in grooming gangs that sexually abused thousands of girls.
The scandal, in which gangs of mostly Pakistani men groomed and raped young white girls more than a decade ago, returned to the political agenda this year after U.S. billionaire Elon Musk criticised the British government.
Under pressure to act, the government said on Sunday that the National Crime Agency would be asked to find more people who have escaped prosecution, building on the work of the police who have reopened over 800 historic cases.
“The vulnerable young girls, who suffered unimaginable abuse at the hands of groups of adult men, have now grown into brave women who are rightly demanding justice,” Yvette Cooper, Britain’s interior minister, said in a statement.
“Not enough people listened to them then. That was wrong and unforgivable. We are changing that now.”
A new report by Louise Casey, a member of Britain’s upper house of parliament, into the scale and nature of the abuse is expected to be published on Monday, a government official said.

According to Sui police, the incident occurred on Sunday night when the assailants indiscriminately fired at a police vehicle. The injured were immediately shifted to Indus Hospital Sui, where the condition of both wounded police officers was reported to be critical. The three injured passersby were discharged after receiving initial medical treatment. Funeral prayers were offered for the policemen who were martyred in the firing incident in Sui, Dera Bugti. According to details, the funeral of Constable Rehm Ali was held in Sui, while the funeral of Constable Nasruddin took place in Sohbatpur. The prayers were attended by senior police officials and a large number of local residents. The policemen were laid to rest with full official honors after being presented with a guard of honor.

JI renews demand for revision of govt’s agreements with IPPs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321693-ji-renews-demand-for-revision-of-govt-s-agreements-with-ipps,"RAWALPINDI: Following premature end of last year’s sit-in in Rawalpindi, the leadership of Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) has once again come up with a demand of revision of agreements with IPPs.
“All exploitative agreements with IPPs should immediately be reviewed”, the JI Central Majlis-e-Shoora said while adopting a resolution at its meeting. It may be pointed out here that JI workers led by Central Ameer gave days long sit-in in Rawalpindi to mainly demand for reduction in electricity tariffs.
However, the sit-in was called off in a haste after just signing an agreement with the government team but before issuance of any official notification. The resolution passed by Majlis-e- Shoora demanded that capacity charges must be abolished, operational costs should be based on actual cost.
JI’s Central Majlis-e-Shoora also expressed deep concern and strong condemnation over the government’s failure to fully review the oppressive agreements with IPPs and its violation of the agreement reached between JI and the government in August 2024.
The Shoora has demanded that the benefits of any renegotiated agreements be passed on to the public, and that the per-unit electricity cost be reduced to less than Rs20 for all consumers.
The resolution was presented by Ameer Jamaat-e-Islami Islamabad Engineer Nasrullah Randhawa.
The resolution was passed during the meeting which also called for the cancellation of contracts with IPPs whose plants have become outdated.
To eliminate the circular debt, the process of recovering illegal payments made to IPPs should begin without delay.
Renewable energy sources—such as solar and wind—should be prioritized for electricity generation, and the proposed taxes on them in the upcoming budget should be immediately withdrawn.
The resolution further demanded that K-Electric’s monopoly in Karachi be ended, and that competition be introduced in the electricity transmission and distribution sectors.
The Majlis-e-Shoora affirms that expensive electricity is not merely an economic issue, but also a form of social injustice. Jamaat-e-Islami will continue to raise its voice against this injustice on all platforms and will pursue every constitutional and democratic avenue—including Parliament, courts, media, and public demonstrations—to ensure that the people receive affordable and fair electricity.
The JI’s Central Shoora noted that although the government claims to have reviewed some IPP agreements and announced a reduction of Rs7 to 8 per unit in electricity prices, this reduction is insignificant—like a drop in the ocean.
If all IPP agreements are thoroughly reviewed, electricity prices could be reduced to less than half of their current level.
Furthermore, the current government, in the 2025–26 budget, has imposed an 18% sales tax on solar panels used to generate green energy. This is despite the fact that solar energy is both environmentally friendly and imposes no financial burden on the government.
While the rest of the world is promoting it through subsidies, our shortsighted rulers, in their continued oppression, are depriving the poor even of this sustainable alternative.
The Shoora meeting reminded that JI held a historic sit-in on Murree Road, Rawalpindi, in July/August 2024 to rein in the IPPs and reduce electricity prices.
During this protest, negotiations took place between JI and the government of Pakistan regarding the revision of IPP agreements, reduction of electricity prices, and resolution of other public issues.
“These negotiations resulted in an agreement under which the government committed to forming a task force to review and scrutinize the IPP contracts”, a statement issued by JI spokesman said.
The purpose was to revise the exploitative agreements and reduce the per-unit electricity cost, aiming to provide relief to the public and ensure affordable electricity. It was agreed that this task would be carried out on an urgent basis.
However, the government has yet to fully implement the agreement.
However, later the JI leadership did not manage to get the agreement implemented by the government.
“What was purpose of staging sit-in amid humid heat and then calling it off in a haste”, a JI worker who used to reach venue of the protest in Rawalpindi from his office each day questioned.

Philosophy behind socialism with Chinese characteristics,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321694-philosophy-behind-socialism-with-chinese-characteristics,"The ideology of Socialism with Chinese characteristics continues to evolve under the leadership and guidance of Communist Party of China (CPC). The party’s successive leadership has helped refine and adapt the ideology of Socialism to meet the changing needs of Chinese society, while adhering to fundamental principles and core philosophy of Communism.
This adjustment was necessary because the Chinese revolution and the CPC have different historical contexts and structures compared to European Communist parties and revolutions. In China, Communism flourished in rural areas, with farmers acting as pioneering members and advocates.
These farmers were the torchbearers of the Communist message. Unlike European movements and revolutions, the Chinese Revolution was led and achieved by the farmers.
Following the establishment of modern China, efforts to devise Socialism with Chinese characteristics accelerated.
Chairman Mao led the effort to tailor Communism to China’s needs, laying the groundwork for Socialism with Chinese characteristics. He focused on the ideological framework and conceptualised the need for Socialism with Chinese characteristics.
The work was further strengthened with the ideological guidance and work of Comrade Deng Xiaoping. He introduced the economic reforms and revolutionised the production sector with Chinese characteristics.
He was the first to formally introduce and use the terminology of Socialism with Chinese characteristics.
President Jiang Zemin and President Hu Jintao contributed by presenting the Three Representatives and Scientific Development theories.
However, since 2012, President Xi has augmented efforts to construct Socialism with Chinese characteristics to meet China’s future needs. He has consolidated the work on Chinese Socialism by presenting President Xi’s Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics in the New Era.
The evolution and contributions of successive leadership have made Chinese Socialism a distinct model of socialism, one that is dynamic and future-oriented.
It possesses specific characteristics that distinguish it as a unique brand and practice, setting it apart from other forms of Communism and socialism. First, it practices scientific Communism with Chinese characteristics.
Scientific Communism is an old concept that has been studied within the context of Communism for a long time. It typically focuses on theoretical and philosophical work, with the practical aspect often lacking to a great extent.
However, in China, scientific Communism is not limited to study of philosophy or social changes; it equally focuses on actions.
The analysis of modern Chinese history indicates that, on one hand, China continued to study philosophy of scientific Communism, as discussed above.
Simultaneously, the CPC worked to identify societal needs by studying social behaviour and took necessary actions. The philosophy of acting, not just studying, helped China make significant strides. For example, Deng Xiaoping introduced reforms after studying ground realities and society and concluding the socialist production system was insufficient to meet ever-growing needs of the population. It is also part of Deng Xiaoping’s principal contradiction. President Jiang Zemin, Three Representatives, also highlighted the societal needs and required reforms in the structure of the CPC. He presented the idea of Socialist market economy to strengthen role of markets in the economy, but with a strong ideological component.
Moreover, the decision-making process is highly scientific, not whimsical or based on utopian ideology. For example, Deng Xiaoping said, “Seek truth from facts”.
He emphasised the importance of a data-driven decision-making process. Furthermore, the Chinese leadership has made efforts to enhance the role of science and technology in development.
For instance, PM Zhou Enlai presented the concept of Four Modernisations. President Hu Jintao coined the term “scientific outlook on development” to emphasise importance of science and innovative solutions in driving economic growth. Since 2012, President Xi has made innovation a primary instrument to address contemporary challenges and realise the dream of rejuvenation and the China Dream.
Second, philosophy and spirituality have played a prominent role in the evolution of Chinese Socialism. In my view, philosophical spiritualism embodies the essence of Chinese characteristics.
Chinese modernisation and the evolution of socialism thrived on the back of spirituality.
The ideology and philosophy of shared prosperity, harmony, societal welfare and centralised people-centric governance, as well as the virtue of the ruler, have deep roots in Chinese spirituality, as constructed by the elders.
Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism (the Three Teachings) played a defining role in shaping the ideology and civilisation.
Taoism (500 BCE) promoted the concept of harmony between humans and the natural world. It encourages following the flow of nature to create a harmonious way of living. It presents the idea of yin and yang, which represent interconnection of opposites, such as good and evil, dark and light and passive and active.
At the same time, it focuses on deity, purity and inner development. Purity of mind, soul and body is recognised as a critical element.
The practice of Taoism promotes self-awareness and emphasises importance of transcending the mortal body. It encourages cultivation of qi (inner energy), deep thinking, and spirituality. Taoist ideology has a significant impact on Chinese society through art, culture, martial arts and various other aspects. It was also practiced as a religion during the Tang Dynasty.
Confucianism is a vital aspect of Chinese civilisation. It focuses on the ideology of virtuous living and adhering to a moral code of conduct. Confucius emphasised importance of cultivating conscience and character to strengthen one’s inner self while highlighting moral development. He believed morality and inner growth nurture character development, which ultimately contributes to progress of society and the state.
His emphasis was particularly on social living and the roles individuals play within a community.
He advocated for utilising social values to create state institutions and establish order by defining individual roles.
Some scholars argue Confucius’s work aimed to emphasise unity between humanity and heaven. Confucius promoted a centralised system of governance; however, he also believed rulers must be virtuous and exemplify good character. The ideal way for a ruler to govern is by sharing prosperity with the people and other states.
The Yellow Emperor is regarded as one of the founding fathers of Chinese culture and has had a profound influence on Chinese civilisation.
He governed the country with kindness and empathy, contributing to societal development by adhering to a virtuous code of conduct. It is believed he was devoted to a deity, which helped him cultivate a righteous code of conduct characterised by kindness, empathy and integrity. Thus, it is thought he exemplified the practical application of these traits and his devotion to the deity, which remains highly relevant today. These characteristics are integral to the policies and practices of modern China.
President Xi further integrated these traits, particularly those of Taoism and Confucianism, into Chinese socialism.
He has devised policies and instruments to practice these ideologies, such as community with a shared future, ecological civilisation, etc., which promote the philosophy of harmony from Taoism and shared prosperity from Confucianism.
Moreover, he urges all CPC members to strictly observe the core Socialist values: democracy, civilised behaviour, harmony, freedom, equality, justice, rule of law, patriotism, dedication, integrity and friendship, as defined by the elders.
From the above discussion, we can infer Chinese Socialism is a blend of scientific Communism and philosophical spirituality.

Balochistan to present Rs1tr budget for FY 2025-26 tomorrow,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321695-balochistan-to-present-rs1tr-budget-for-fy-2025-26-tomorrow,"QUETTA: Balochistan’s budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26 is scheduled to be presented on June 17, Tuesday (tomorrow). The total volume of the budget is expected to exceed Rs1 trillion. Like the current fiscal year, the upcoming budget is also projected to be a surplus budget.
Under the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, Balochistan is set to receive Rs743 billion from federal revenues, which will be allocated under two categories: divisible pool taxes and direct transfers from natural resources, including gas.
According to government sources, Balochistan is expected to receive Rs70 billion more from federal revenues in the upcoming fiscal year compared to the current year. The province’s own revenue from provincial taxes and non-tax sources is estimated to exceed Rs150 billion.
Non-development expenditures for the next fiscal year are expected to surpass Rs700 billion, while over Rs240 billion may be allocated from the province’s own resources for development spending. Significant funds are expected to be allocated to key sectors such as education, law and order, health, infrastructure, agriculture, and others.
More than Rs160 billion is likely to be allocated for the education sector, over Rs100 billion for law and order, and Rs80 billion for the health sector.
Salaries of government employees in Balochistan are also expected to be increased in line with the federal government’s announcements. It is worth mentioning that provincial employees have been protesting for some time, demanding salary increases and other benefits.
The upcoming budget is expected to clarify the government’s position regarding salary and pension increases, taxation, and other employee-related incentives.

PTI blames govt for sharp decline in purchasing power of Pakistanis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321700-pti-blames-govt-for-sharp-decline-in-purchasing-power-of-pakistanis,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram on Sunday excoriated the government for alleged incompetence and poor governance, claiming it has reduced the average Pakistani’s purchasing power by 58 per cent since the PTI’s ouster.
He lamented in a statement that the economic condition of ordinary Pakistanis has never been as dismal and alarming as it has been over the past three years, and accused the government of dragging the economy from a robust growth rate of over six per cent to a negative trajectory.
Sheikh Waqas said that contrary to rulers’ claims to have saved the country from bankruptcy, they have allegedly plunged the nation into the worst debt trap.
He highlighted that an individual who was earning Rs 50,000 per month in March 2022 now has purchasing power reduced to just Rs 20,833, while someone earning Rs 100,000 then is now effectively left with Rs 41,666.
The PTI spokesman said that over 18 million Pakistanis are “officially unemployed”, with the jobless rate soaring to an unprecedented 22 per cent. Sheikh Waqas said the “PDM-I, PDM-II (caretaker setup), and PDM-III” governments collectively presided over the most catastrophic period in Pakistan’s recent history.
He warned that with oil prices rising from $64 to $75 per barrel, the current account and trade deficits would inevitably balloon. Moreover, he added that rupee would face further depreciation while interest payments would surge, rendering the budget “effectively dead on arrival”.
The PTI spokesman blasted the government for setting an “unrealistic revenue target”, stating that the new target of Rs 14,131 billion was once again unattainable and would further burden the people of Pakistan, especially at a time when the economy is contracting and showing no signs of forward momentum.
He dismissed the regime’s oft-repeated claim of pulling the country out of the IMF dependence as “false and wishful thinking”, pointing out that the IMF itself, in its May 2025 report, had categorically stated that Pakistan would need to enter another programme.
He highlighted that both the IMF and the World Bank, in their May 2025 reports, stated that Pakistan’s economy was shrinking, unemployment was rising, and there was virtually no economic growth.
He said that Pakistan’s economic survival currently depended on IMF support.
“If you withdraw IMF support, Pakistan will collapse,” Waqas added.
The PTI spokesman noted that gravity of the situation could be judged from the fact that the much-touted SIFC brought a meagre amount of one billion dollar in investment to the country so far and that too from Barrick Gold, “which speaks volume of its incompetence and ineffectiveness”.
Sheikh Waqas stated that the only way to pull the country out of the prevailing, unprecedented hardships is through the release of PTI Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan, the conduct of free and fair elections, upholding the rule of law, strengthening an independent judiciary, ensuring freedom of speech, restoring genuine democracy, and adhering to the Constitution.

UN delegation visits mango orchard in South Punjab,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321701-un-delegation-visits-mango-orchard-in-south-punjab,"KOT ADDU: A high-level United Nations (UN) delegation visited mango orchard Khar Farms in South Punjab on Sunday.
According to a statement, the delegation was warmly welcomed at the  Khar Farms, Khar Gharbi, Kot Addu, by Ms Misbah Khar, Adviser to the chairman Senate, and industrialist Ghulam M Yahya Khar.
The delegation included Muhammad Yahya, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator to Pakistan, and Ms Fernanda Thomaz, representative of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).
The visit featured a mango tree plantation ceremony, symbolising the shared commitment to environmental sustainability and agricultural development in the region.
The guests also enjoyed vibrant folk performances that reflected the rich cultural heritage of South Punjab. A traditional breakfast showcasing regional flavours was served in the honour of the visiting delegation.
A key feature of the visit was interaction between the UN officials and local mango growers as mango is the main export fruit of the region. The engagement boosted the morale of growers and created new hope for increasing mango exports through international collaboration and support.
Speaking on the occasion, Ms Thomaz emphasised IFAD’s active work in South Punjab, highlighting that 400,000 poor women had been provided with livestock, 7,300 landless women had been given homes and 30,000 households were receiving food support through 40 community food banks across 10 districts. She reaffirmed the UN’s ongoing commitment to supporting Pakistan in tackling challenges related to climate change, technology advancement and youth skill development.
Muhammad Yahya noted immense agricultural and human resource potential of South Punjab and reiterated the UN’s commitment to supporting rural uplift, sustainability and community resilience in underdeveloped regions.
Chairman Senate Yusuf Raza Gilani appreciated the UN delegation’s spirit of cooperation, particularly their visit to South Punjab and Kot Addu, to promote sustainable mango farming and community engagement. He emphasised the importance of international support in driving inclusive development and rural prosperity in the region.

"PBC raises concerns over FBR powers, says budget punishes formal sector",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321702-pbc-raises-concerns-over-fbr-powers-says-budget-punishes-formal-sector,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Business Council (PBC) has strongly criticised the government’s proposed Finance Bill 2025, warning that the new tax measures, especially the sweeping powers being granted to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), risk undermining investor confidence and punishing the formal sector already bearing the brunt of the tax burden.
In a scathing statement posted on social media on Sunday, the PBC said the formal sector played a key role in helping Pakistan secure its current IMF programme by paying a large share of taxes in the FY24/25 budget -- a move it called both strategic and a national duty..
Despite this contribution, the council noted, its call for a roadmap to gradually reduce taxes in the next fiscal year has been denied. More alarmingly, it said, the budget fails to address critical support needed for exporters amid mounting global uncertainty, particularly in light of recent US tariffs where Pakistan stands to face the reciprocal tariffs of 29 per cent.
The PBC expressed “alarm” over a series of provisions in the Finance Bill that would grant the FBR what it called “dangerous and excessive powers”. These include tax assessments based on suspicion (Section 11E), arbitrary seizure of property (Section 14AE), and up to 10-year prison sentences and Rs10 million fines for broadly defined tax fraud (Section 33), which the council fears could capture routine business errors.
A big concern for the PBC is the authority given to the FBR to arrest individuals without warrant (Section 37AA), detain them for up to 14 days (Section 37B), and override confidentiality protections between taxpayers and their advisers (Section 58C).
“These powers make no distinction between the compliant formal sector and the informal economy,” the PBC said, warning that such measures would worsen the country’s already poor investment climate. While industry accounts for only 18 per cent of GDP, it contributes 60 per cent of total taxes, with banks also playing a major role, the council added.
The PBC, which describes itself as one of the first business bodies to submit strategic proposals ahead of the budget, said it had advocated for broadening the tax base by formalising more of the economy, boosting exports, and reducing import dependency.
“Instead,” the statement concluded, “we are disappointed that the proposed FBR powers will do the exact opposite of encouraging investment.”
Last week, however, FBR Chairperson Rashid Mahmoud Langrial defended the proposed changes in the Finance Bill, arguing that tax authorities around the world -- including in India and Bangladesh -- have powers to arrest individuals for tax fraud. He highlighted that the country’s top 5.0 per cent of wealthy households evade an estimated Rs1.6 trillion in taxes. Citing workforce data, he said the country has 67 million workers, and of that, the top 1.0 per cent alone is responsible for Rs1.233 trillion in evasion, while the remaining 95 per cent account for only Rs0.14 trillion.

Iran-Israel conflict sparks fuel crisis in Balochistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321703-iran-israel-conflict-sparks-fuel-crisis-in-balochistan,"QUETTA: As the Iran-Israel conflict intensifies, its shock waves are now gripping Balochistan, where a province-wide fuel crisis is unfolding with alarming speed. From the provincial capital Quetta to Turbat, Panjgur, Gwadar, and Chagai, petrol pumps are shutting down, essential supplies are stuck, and the wheels of daily life are grinding to a halt.
In Quetta, over 70 percent of petrol stations have already closed, with long, chaotic queues forming at the few that remain operational. Panic is spreading as fuel shortages deepen, and there are fears that within the next 24 hours, all petrol pumps in the city could completely cease operations.
The crisis is not limited to Quetta. Across Makran and Chagai divisions, the situation is worsening rapidly. The Balochistan government has sealed all border crossings with Iran indefinitely, including critical trade and fuel routes in Turbat, Panjgur, Gwadar, and Chagai. The decision, taken in light of escalating regional security threats, has cut off the province’s primary supply of Iranian petrol, which meets Balochistan’s fuel demand.
In Chagai, authorities have confirmed the closure of border crossings at Mashkel, a key trade route with Iran. Similar to Makran, the border shutdown has triggered fuel shortages and disrupted the supply of essential goods in the region’s towns and villages.
Gwadar’s Deputy Commissioner confirmed the immediate suspension of travel and fuel movement across the Gabad-Kalatuk border, while Panjgur authorities have enforced a complete closure of pedestrian and fuel crossings with Iran. “Given the rising security risks and the volatile international situation, these are essential precautionary measures,” said the Panjgur administration.
The crisis has been tightening its grip for weeks. In Quetta, all mini petrol pumps selling Iranian fuel have already been shut down for the past two weeks following government crackdowns. Similar closures and supply disruptions are now being reported in Chagai’s Mashkel region, where communities long dependent on cross-border trade are facing severe transport paralysis.
However, the Balochistan government maintains that there is no province-wide fuel emergency. Government spokesperson Shahid Rind dismissed the fuel shortage as “a false narrative spread by petrol smugglers.” He said that Iranian petrol stations are safety hazards, citing 28 fuel-related accidents across Quetta in the past month, including incidents on Airport Road and in the Hazar Ganji area.
“These so-called shortages are being exaggerated by those who want to lift the ban on smuggled Iranian fuel,” Rind said, adding that strict action is being taken to ensure the supply of legal petrol through registered pumps. Petrol stations found hoarding or refusing service will face immediate legal consequences.
But on-ground reports present a drastically different reality. In cities, border towns, and remote areas across the province — including Quetta, Gwadar, Panjgur, Turbat, and Chagai — petrol pumps have gone dry, long lines persist, and fears are rising that the fuel crunch could soon bring the entire province to a standstill.
The rapidly escalating international crisis between Iran and Israel is no longer a distant geopolitical issue — its direct fallout is shutting down Balochistan’s streets, freezing its markets, and locking down its borders.
The local administrations of Gwadar, Panjgur, and Chagai have warned residents to limit unnecessary travel and fully cooperate with authorities during this critical period. Officials have stated that the cross-border restrictions will remain in place until the security situation stabilizes.
As Balochistan braces for deepening fuel shortages, tightening border controls, and spreading panic, its people now find themselves caught between strict security clampdowns, economic paralysis, and a rapidly shrinking supply of essential goods.

‘This is a culture’ — TikToker’s murder highlights unease with women online,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321705-this-is-a-culture-tiktoker-s-murder-highlights-unease-with-women-online,"ISLAMABAD: Since seeing thousands of comments justifying the recent murder of a teenage TikTok star in Pakistan, Sunaina Bukhari is considering abandoning her 88,000 followers.
“In my family, it wasn´t an accepted profession at all, but I´d managed to convince them, and even ended up setting up my own business,” she said.Then last week, Sana Yousaf was shot dead outside her house in Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.
News of the murder led to an outpouring of comments under her final post — her 17th birthday celebration where she blew out the candles on a cake.In between condolence messages, some blamed her for her own death: “You reap what you sow” or “it´s deserved, she was tarnishing Islam”.
Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media, where she shared her favourite cafes, skincare products and traditional shalwar kameez outfits.
TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.
But as TikTok´s views have surged, so have efforts to police the platform.
Pakistani telecommunications authorities have repeatedly blocked or threatened to block the app over what it calls “immoral behaviour”, amid backlash against LGBTQ and sexual content.
TikTok has pledged to better moderate content and blocked millions of videos that do not meet its community guidelines as well as at the request of Pakistan authorities.
After Yousaf´s murder, Bukhari, 28, said her family no longer backs her involvement in the industry.
“I´m the first influencer in my family, and maybe the last,” she told AFP.
Only 30 percent of women in Pakistan own a smartphone compared to twice as many men (58 percent), the largest gap in the world, according to the Mobile Gender Gap Report of 2025.
“Friends and family often discourage them from using social media for fear of being judged,” said a statement from the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF).
In Balochistan, where tribal law governs many rural areas, a man confessed to orchestrating the murder of his 14-year-old daughter earlier this year over TikTok videos that he said compromised her honour.
In October, police in Karachi, in the south, announced the arrest of a man who had killed four women relatives over “indecent” TikTok videos.
These murders each revive memories of Qandeel Baloch, dubbed Pakistan´s Kim Kardashian and one of the country´s first breakout social media stars whose videos shot her to fame.
After years in the spotlight, she was suffocated by her brother.Violence against women is pervasive in Pakistan, according to the country´s Human Rights Commission, and cases of women being attacked after rejecting men are not uncommon.
“This isn´t one crazy man, this is a culture,” said Kanwal Ahmed, who leads a closed Facebook group of 300,000 women to share advice.
“Every woman in Pakistan knows this fear. Whether she´s on TikTok or has a private Instagram with 50 followers, men show up. In her DMs. In her comments. On her street,” she wrote in a post.
In the fifth-most-populous country in the world, where 60 percent of the population is under the age of 30, the director of digital rights organisation Bolo Bhi, Usama Khilji, says “many women don´t post their profile picture, but a flower, an object, very rarely their face”.
“The misogyny and the patriarchy that is prevalent in this society is reflected on the online spaces,” he added.
A 22-year-old man was arrested over Yousaf´s murder and is due to appear in court next week.
At a vigil in the capital last week, around 80 men and women gathered, holding placards that read “no means no”.“Social media has given us a voice, but the opposing voices are louder,” said Hira, a young woman who joined the gathering.
The capital´s police chief, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, used a press conference to send a “clear message” to the public.
“If our sisters or daughters want to become influencers, professionally or as amateurs, we must encourage them,” he said.

SC orders DHA not to raise unauthorised structure in public park,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321647-sc-orders-dha-not-to-raise-unauthorised-structure-in-public-park,"The Supreme Court has directed the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) to not raise any unauthorised structre in a public park. The apex court also ordered that no common person shall be stopped from entry to the park utility subject to a nominal entrance fee meant for its maintenance.
The direction came on a petition of the Masjid-e-Saheem administration and others who had challenged the commercial use of a public park in the DHA area. A counsel for the petitioners submitted that the public park was meant for the use of common persons, but it was now being licensed to an entity for commercial gains, whereby every individual entering the park would be charged exorbitantly.
A counsel for the DHA pointed out that the entrance of the public was not restricted however it would be subject to an entrance fee for the jogging track also. He said that at this moment, they were raising a jogging track, but they had planned to construct Padel courts and other allied structure as well.
A two-member bench of the apex court comprising Justice Mohammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Salahuddin Panhwar after hearing the counsel observed that they were of the view that apart from jogging track, no structure of the nature as licensed to them or otherwise should be raised till the next date of hearing.
The SC in the meantime ordered that common persons shall not be deprived from entering the park subject to nominal entrance fee meant for its maintenance. A counsel for the respondents requested the SC to transfer the case to the principal seat in Islamabad as an injunctive order had been passed and the interest of the respondents was at stake. The SC directed the office to transfer the case to the principal seat in Islamabad for further hearing after soliciting approval of the chief justice.

"‘Over 871,000 in Pakistan died from non-communicable diseases in 2021’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321649-over-871-000-in-pakistan-died-from-non-communicable-diseases-in-2021,"Over 871,000 people died from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Pakistan in 2021, accounting for 52 per cent of the country’s 1.675 million total deaths that year, according to the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) NCD Progress Monitor 2025.
The report paints a grim picture of the country’s public health landscape, showing a growing burden of diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and chronic respiratory illnesses, with a 26 per cent probability that a Pakistani aged 30 to 70 would die prematurely from one of these largely preventable conditions.
Despite this alarming mortality burden, Pakistan’s national response to NCDs remains inadequate and fragmented. The WHO evaluated countries on 11 key progress indicators related to prevention, surveillance, policy implementation and healthcare system readiness.
Pakistan has fully achieved only three of these indicators, while four have been partially achieved and another four remain completely unachieved. This places Pakistan among the countries making slow progress on NCD control and prevention.
Pakistan has not yet set time-bound national targets for reducing NCDs based on WHO guidance, nor has it established a comprehensive and reliable system for collecting and reporting cause-specific mortality data.
There is no sustained national campaign to promote physical activity among the public, and the country lacks front-of-pack nutrition labelling, a measure considered crucial to helping consumers make healthier dietary choices.
Progress has also been rated as only partial in several other critical areas. These include surveillance of key NCD risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets and physical inactivity.  They also include implementation of a multi-sectoral national strategy to address major NCDs and their risk factors, availability of evidence-based guidelines for managing NCDs at primary healthcare level, and provision of essential medicines and diagnostic technologies for chronic respiratory diseases.
Although Pakistan has made progress in enforcing large graphic health warnings on tobacco packaging, and banning certain forms of tobacco advertising, it is yet to implement plain packaging laws, significantly increase excise taxes, or fully enforce smoke-free policies in public spaces. These gaps reduce the impact of tobacco control policies which are critical in curbing one of the most potent drivers of NCDs.
The WHO report also highlights the absence of concrete action to promote healthy diets in Pakistan. There are no policies to reformulate food products to reduce salt, sugar or trans fats, and no regulatory controls to limit the marketing of unhealthy foods to children.
Public food procurement systems do not prioritise healthy food options, and there are no meaningful national mass media campaigns to promote healthier dietary choices.  Reviewing the report, a senior health official said that the death of over 871,000 Pakistanis from diseases that are largely preventable should serve as a national emergency.
He warned that without urgent and coordinated action, Pakistan’s public health infrastructure would be overwhelmed by the growing tide of chronic illnesses, particularly among younger populations already facing increased rates of obesity, hypertension and diabetes.
Countries such as Iran and Thailand, facing similar economic constraints, have managed to significantly reduce their NCD burdens through stricter taxation, universal healthcare access and well-funded public awareness campaigns. Iran, for example, has brought down its risk of premature deaths from NCDs to 14 per cent — nearly half of Pakistan’s.
In the report’s foreword, WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasised that investments in NCD prevention are not just about saving lives but also about economic resilience.
According to the WHO, every dollar spent on preventing and controlling NCDs yields at least $7 in return through increased productivity and reduced healthcare costs.  With the Sustainable Development Goal target of reducing premature deaths from NCDs by one-third by 2030 fast approaching, the WHO has called on governments, including Pakistan’s, to act decisively.
It has urged stronger leadership, better surveillance systems, enforcement of tobacco and alcohol taxes, public education on healthy lifestyles, and expanded access to essential healthcare services. Without immediate action, warns the report, the already heavy toll of NCDs in Pakistan is likely to worsen.

Deserving families get sacrificial meat through Chhipa initiative,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321653-deserving-families-get-sacrificial-meat-through-chhipa-initiative,"Millions of deserving families across Pakistan were provided sacrificial meat during Eidul Azha through the Chhipa Collective Qurbani 2025 initiative.

Jail officials’ ordinary leave banned,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321625-jail-officials-ordinary-leave-banned,"LAHORE:The Punjab Prisons Department has imposed a ban on official leave, except in extreme emergencies, following the recent escape of 216 inmates from Malir Jail in Karachi.
According to sources, the jailbreak was partly due to the absence of warders at key posts. Punjab prisons are currently facing a severe staff shortage, including 1,040 warders, 151 head warders, and 94 chief warders. Leave will now only be granted for medical emergencies or weddings. A notification in this regard has been issued.

Pindiites seek relief from persistent utility shortages,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321635-pindiites-seek-relief-from-persistent-utility-shortages,"Rawalpindi: Residents of Rawalpindi have once again urged the government to address long-standing civic issues, particularly the shortages of water, electricity, and gas, which have worsened with seasonal changes. Speaking to The News on Sunday, citizens expressed concern over what they described as a persistent neglect of essential services.
With the arrival of summer, the city is facing an acute water shortage, leading private water tanker operators to significantly raise their prices. Tankers that previously cost less are now being sold at Rs2,400 to Rs2,600 for small loads and up to Rs5,000 for larger ones, putting additional financial pressure on households.
Similarly, residents reported prolonged electricity load-shedding during peak summer months and extremely low or no gas pressure during the winter. These issues persist despite citizens regularly paying utility bills, they said.
Many residents believe that while a considerable portion of the budget is allocated to development projects through MNAs and MPAs, essential services continue to be overlooked. “Basic necessities such as clean drinking water, affordable electricity, and consistent gas supply should be a priority,” one resident said. Citizens have also called for accountability across civic departments. They voiced concerns about mismanagement and inefficiency, stating that despite budgetary support, the delivery of public services remains inadequate. “There is a need for internal checks and better oversight to ensure public funds are utilized effectively,” another residen
While acknowledging that the government has allocated significant resources to municipal services, residents stressed the importance of improved governance and transparency in service delivery. They appealed for a review of current operations in relevant departments to restore public trust and improve living conditions in the city.

USEFP breaks new ground with first-ever headquarters in Islamabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321636-usefp-breaks-new-ground-with-first-ever-headquarters-in-islamabad,"Islamabad:After nearly 75 years of building bridges through education, the United States Educational Foundation in Pakistan (USEFP) is finally putting down roots — in concrete.  The foundation is on the brink of completing its first purpose-built headquarters, a $12 million project that will soon open its doors in the heart of Islamabad’s education corridor.
Designed by the renowned architectural firm Nayyar Ali Dada & Associates, the new facility is more than just bricks and mortar — it’s a symbol of the deep and enduring educational ties between the United States and Pakistan. With its sleek, modern design and state-of-the-art amenities, the building will house a library, auditorium and standardised testing labs, making it a one-stop hub for students, scholars and Fulbright alumni alike.
US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie A Baker toured the nearly completed structure and met with the team driving the project forward. Her visit came at the 75th anniversary of the Fulbright Programme in Pakistan, one of the largest and most prestigious Fulbright exchanges in the world.
The embassy's representatives said the building represented more than a physical space. According to them, it embodies the spirit of partnership and shared values that have defined the US-Pakistan relationship for generations and will serve as a beacon for the thousands of Pakistani students who dream of studying in the United States.
Centrally located in Islamabad’s H-8 sector — the city’s academic nucleus — the new USEFP headquarters was made possible through a land allotment by the government of Pakistan and financial support from the US government, reflecting a joint investment in what both sides see as one of the most successful areas of bilateral cooperation: education.
For decades, the USEFP has quietly played a powerful role in shaping Pakistan’s intellectual and professional landscape. Since its founding in 1950, the Foundation has sent thousands of Pakistanis to study in American universities and hosted US scholars in Pakistan, promoting mutual understanding through academic exchange.

Teachers complain about unfair honorarium distribution,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321640-teachers-complain-about-unfair-honorarium-distribution,"Islamabad: As the fiscal year draws to a close, government departments and ministries typically award honorariums to employees in recognition of their additional duties and year-long performance.
However, a growing number of teachers in federal educational institutions have raised concerns over what they called a biased and non-transparent disbursement of these rewards. An amount of Rs 11.18 million under the head of honorarium was appropriated recently.
The amount was allocated in addition to the already approved budget for honoraria, with the intent to recognise and reward educators for performing extra responsibilities beyond their teaching assignments.
However, the honorarium awards are being granted arbitrarily by college administrations, according to teachers from government colleges regulated by the Federal Directorate of Education.
They claim that the disbursement of honoraria is driven by favouritism rather than actual performance and lacks transparency and doesn't have effective oversight from the FDE.  Attiqueur Rehman, a senior faculty member, said he had performed intensive extra duties throughout the year, on top of his regular teaching assignments at Islamabad Model Postgraduate College H-8 last year.
""My service record and biometric attendance clearly show that I spent the most hours on campus compared to any other staff member, teaching or non-teaching,” he said. The educator said despite his contributions, he was not awarded the honorarium, and instead, he faced retaliation when he voiced concern. ""I was unfairly transferred to Islamabad College for Boys G-6/3,"" he said, adding that the teachers who contributed far less were rewarded.
A female teacher from Islamabad Model College for Girls F-7/4, speaking on condition of anonymity, said honoraria were meant to acknowledge extra services beyond regular duties, as outlined in the General Financial Rules by the Ministry of Finance.  She, however, said unfortunately, many principals ignored those guidelines, favouring certain individuals regardless of merit.
""The nominations are not based on merit or extra duties performed. Instead, they're made on personal preferences and affiliations within the administrative leadership who exercise absolute authority in the selection process,” she said. Teachers argue that such arbitrary and biased practices not only demoralise hardworking teachers but also erode trust in the administrative system.
They educators urge the FDE to intervene and implement a transparent, merit-based mechanism to ensure that honorarium disbursements reflect actual contributions, not personal affiliations.

Interprovincial gang of car lifters busted,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321581-interprovincial-gang-of-car-lifters-busted,"MANSEHRA: An interprovincial gang of car lifters was busted and stolen vehicles, arms, ammunition and other items were from their possession, a police official said on Sunday.
“We have arrested four car lifters wanted by police in various parts of the country,” Deputy Superintendent of Police Waheed Khan told a press conference in Oghi.Flanked by SHO Saddaqat Khan, the DSP said the gang had booked a car from Peshawar, handed over the driver to an accomplice in Oghi, and then fled the scene with the vehicle.
“Shehbaz Haider, the driver of the car booked from Peshawar, managed to escape from the outlaws’ custody and approached Oghi police,” he added.He said a police team, formed on the directives of District Police Officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur, with the assistance of Peshawar police, arrested four suspects, including the gang’s ringleader.
Those arrested were identified as Nabiur Rehman, Afaqur Rehman, and Mohammad Amir, all residents of Bannu and Waqar Khan, a resident of Peshawar.“One of the accused, Nabiur Rehman, had rented a house in Oghi where the car driver was kept while the others fled with the stolen vehicle,” the DSP said.He added that legal action would also be taken against the owner of the rented house for failing to inform the police before renting the property.

Book on rare topic published,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321582-book-on-rare-topic-published,"ABBOTTABAD: “My Last Question?”-the new book by educator, scholar, and social reformer Dr Waseem Ahmed-has been published.
The book challenges readers to look inward and ask the most essential question: “Why am I here, and what legacy will I leave for the world?”At the heart of Dr Waseem’s thesis lies a powerful critique of modern educational institutions.
He exposes how systems that neglect moral and spiritual development inadvertently produce corrupt professionals. With sharp insight, he demonstrates how the absence of ethical grounding and divine consciousness leads to a world of injustice, deception, and spiritual emptiness.
“Today’s degrees may produce technocrats and bureaucrats, but rarely do they create compassionate human beings or visionary leaders,” writes the author.Through poetic reflection, deep insight, and practical guidance, the book aims to inspire a generation to rebuild society with integrity, mercy, and purpose.
It compels educators, policymakers, parents, and youth alike to rethink what success truly means-and how to cultivate it for both this world and the next.The book is a call for soul-searching in an era of noise. It’s a must-read for those who seek to live not just successfully, but meaningfully.
In asking the last question, Dr Waseem invites every reader to embark on their first genuine journey toward truth, purpose, and destiny.

JUI-F leaders want Pakistan to support Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321584-juif-leaders-want-pakistan-to-support-iran,"CHAKDARA: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUIF) leaders on Sunday urged the government to extend support to Iran in its war against Israel.
“Israel has attacked Iran after killing thousands of innocent people in Gaza. And the government must extend support to Iran to teach a lesson to Israel,” said one of the leaders while speaking at an eid milan party at Adenzai. The JUIF office-bearers of the party, members of other political and social organisations and notable local figures attended the event.
Addressing the participants, JUIF leaders, including provincial deputy general secretary Maulana Muhammad Rahim Haqqani, district head Sirajuddin, former provincial finance Minister Muzaffar Said and others criticised the federal and provincial governments for not providing relief to people.
They labeled the recently presented budgets as “anti-people,” stating they were nothing more than a play of words and offer no real relief to the public.A joint resolution was passed during the event rejecting the imposition of sales tax in the Malakand Division, and a strong resistance movement against it was announced.
The speakers also appreciated the role of Pakistan’s armed forces for giving a “befitting response” to India and praised the military’s efforts in national defense.Dost Muhammad Lala Bazeer Khan, Vice President of the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (Lower Dir) and former candidate for the provincial assembly, along with his associates, officially joined JUIF.

Changes sought to new Customs assessment system,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321586-changes-sought-to-new-customs-assessment-system,"PESHAWAR: Frontier Customs Agents Association (FCAA) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has demanded changes to the newly introduced `Faceless Customs Assessment’, to make it convenient and practical for the business community dealing in import and export through upcountry dry ports such as Peshawar.
In a press statement issued here on Sunday, association’s president Zia-ul-Haq Sarhadi who also holds the offices of Senior Vice President Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry and is Executive Committee Member of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), said that centralization of Goods Declarations (GDs) process at the Karachi port is causing difficulties for business community of other cities due to delay in processing and clearance.
“The government must immediately engage with the business community to craft flexible and practical policies”, Zia Sarhadi emphasized. He also welcomed a recent decision by the Peshawar High Court (PHC) directing the Federal Board of Revenue to make necessary amendments to the system and bring it in conformity with the scheme governing the assessment and clearance of goods. The court issued a directive for restricting the application of Faceless Custom Assessment to the clearance of goods reached at Azakhel Dryport.
Zia Sarhadi explained that under the new system introduced by the Customs Department, all GDs are routed to the Central Assessment Unit (CAU) in Karachi, even if they are filed at local dry ports.
“This centralization has resulted in delays in clearance, as local agents cannot directly communicate with the assessing officers in Karachi in case queries or objections are raised,” he added.
Zia Sarhadi said delays have become the norm under this system. Clearance that once took days now often takes weeks as a result, shipments remain stuck at ports, attracting heavy demurrage charges, which are borne by the importer.
These demurrage fees are paid to foreign shipping lines, leading to a drain on Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves. Zia Sarhadi suggested that the Faceless Assessment System should be station-wise instead of Karachi only, Zia suggested.He said, regardless of how noble the intentions behind the new system may be, if its outcomes don’t align with ground realities, it becomes more of a hurdle than a reform.

Young polo players question selection for Shandur tourney,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321587-young-polo-players-question-selection-for-shandur-tourney,"CHITRAL: Members of civil society and young polo players from Lower Chitral on Sunday questioned the selection for the upcoming Shandur Festival Polo Tournament, terming it a blatant violation of merit.
Talking to reporters at the Chitral Press Club, players including Hayat Hussain, Muheebur Rehman, Tanveer Shehzad, Masroor Elahi, Abdul Qadir, Zafarullah Khan Jamali and others announced to stage a protest in Shandur if the team selection was not reviewed within 24 hours.
They said that several talented players who performed remarkably in the pre-Shandur polo tournament were initially included in the team through an official notification. However, due to alleged pressure from influential elements, the deputy commissioner of Lower Chitral reportedly removed Tanveer Shehzad and Masroor Elahi from the final list and issued a new one, which the speakers claimed was unjust and a violation of ethical norms.
According to the players, as per the rules of the polo association, only those players who reached at least the quarterfinals of the pre-Shandur tournament are eligible for selection. Yet, they said, the newly announced team included three players from a single family who were eliminated in the third round.
They also questioned the exclusion of Abdul Raheem, who played in the final and scored two goals, along with Islam Nabi, Tariq Hussain, and Awais Ali, players who reached the quarterfinals but were allegedly dropped due to lack of political connections.
The protesters demanded that the current flawed selection list be immediately annulled. They also called for restructuring the polo association through votes from active players and establishing a separate association for Upper Chitral.

Fritz downs Zverev in Stuttgart to secure first title of year,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321603-fritz-downs-zverev-in-stuttgart-to-secure-first-title-of-year,"Stuttgart, Germany: Taylor Fritz defeated Alexander Zverev in straight sets in a rain-hit final in Stuttgart on Sunday to win his first ATP title of the season.
The American eased to a 6-3, 7-6 (7/0) victory despite being held up by a lengthy rain delay early in the second set. Fritz has now won his last five meetings with Zverev and is set to climb to fourth in the world rankings, a place behind the German.
“It was not so great a clay season, so to come here and start the grass season off perfectly, I am super happy to get the title and to do it here,” said Fritz, who did not lose a service game in the entire tournament.
Fritz lost in the first round of the French Open last month to Daniel Altmaier, ending a clay-court season in which he won just three matches in four tournaments. Last year´s US Open runner-up bounced back, though, with his first trophy since winning in Eastbourne 12 months ago, also on grass.
Top seed Zverev is still waiting to win the first grass-court title of his career and he has never even reached the quarter-finals of Wimbledon, which gets under way on June 30. Fritz moved into a one-set lead courtesy of a break in the eighth game. He missed the only break point of the second set but raced through the tie-break, winning the last 11 points of the match.

Pakistan draw 3-3 with Malaysia in FIH Nations Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321604-pakistan-draw-3-3-with-malaysia-in-fih-nations-cup,"KARACHI: Pakistan held to a 3-3 draw in their first game of the FIH Men’s Nations Cup 2024-25 by Malaysia after a nail-biting encounter as the home side managed to strike back whenever the green shirts took the lead in Kuala Lumpur here on Sunday.
In the beginning, Pakistan came out in attacking fashion as they went two goals ahead inside ten minutes with Ahmed Nadeem and Abdul Rehman scoring for their team. However, in the second half, and the last quarter in particular, the Men in Green failed to soak the pressure of Malaysia’s counter-attack.
The green shirts started blazingly, making circle penetrations at regular intervals. In the sixth minute, Nadeem netted a fantastic field goal managing a pinpoint connection to a quick pass. Three minutes later, Rehman doubled the lead with an accurate strike through the penalty corner.
In the next quarter, Pakistan did make moves, but had lapses in terms of overall finishing, with players missing a lot of open chances. The second quarter went goal less.
It was from the third quarter where Malaysia came with well-planned moves, quick athleticism; managing to open up Pakistan’s defense. The green shirts, yet again choked in terms of handling the pressure. Several yellow and green cards halted the team flow, as players had to sit on the benches for some minutes. In the last quarter, it was all Malaysia. The one who opened things for them was Fitri Saari in the 49th minute. Three minutes later, Syed Cholan, leveled the game for the home team.
However, Pakistan got the lease of starting their campaign on a winning note after Waheed Rana put his team ahead with a brilliant strike through a penalty corner.
Unfortunately, Pakistan’s defence looked hapless in dealing with the hosts’ attack in the circle, conceding penalty corners. And in the 56th minute, Cholan yet again fired a great goal to level the game. Meanwhile, Pakistan will play their second game of the event against Japan on Monday (today).

PCB launches skills development camp at NCA,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321605-pcb-launches-skills-development-camp-at-nca,"LAHORE: The National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Lahore is set to host a comprehensive 20-day Skills Development Camp beginning Monday, June 16, with a total of 47 elite cricketers earmarked for participation in three phases.
The initiative, steered by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), aims to sharpen individual skillsets and physical conditioning ahead of a packed international schedule. The first batch of 15 players—including senior names like Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Naseem Shah, as well as promising talents like Saim Ayub, Maaz Sadaqat, and Abrar Ahmed—will undergo training from June 16 to 21.
The second and third groups, each comprising 16 players, will report on June 22 and June 30 respectively. Director High-Performance Aqib Javed underscored the strategic value of the camp: > “It provides a rare pause from match play and a platform for one-on-one coaching and targeted refinement. We’re working closely with national team coach Mike Hesson to ensure players leave with clarity, technical polish, and renewed focus.”
Training sessions will follow a structured format, featuring morning fielding and fitness drills (6:00–8:00am) and afternoon skill sessions (2:30–6:30pm) at LCCA Ground and NCA. Match simulations are scheduled for Fridays and Saturdays, simulating competitive intensity.
The camp will serve a dual purpose: providing developmental value for players while also informing selectors as they shape squads for the Pakistan men’s team and the Pakistan Shaheens, ahead of upcoming series against Bangladesh, the West Indies, and a Shaheens tour to England in July.
This initiative reflects the PCB’s evolving approach toward format-specific preparation, youth integration, and performance-based selection pipelines.

French Open champ Alcaraz ready for Queen’s after Ibiza party,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321606-french-open-champ-alcaraz-ready-for-queen-s-after-ibiza-party,"LONDON: Carlos Alcaraz will return to action at Queen´s Club next week after the world number two celebrated his epic French Open triumph by partying in Ibiza.
Alcaraz saved three match points and rallied from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner in a fifth set tie-break in the sensational Roland Garros final on June 8. Having triumphed in one of the greatest finals in tennis history, the 22-year-old jetted off to Ibiza to soak up his second successive French Open crown.
As well as partying with friends, Alcaraz used the break as a welcome opportunity to recharge his batteries after a gruelling clay-court campaign that also included titles in Monte Carlo and Rome.
“It was fun, but honestly, I was there more mentally than physically. I had fun, just three nights, three days, and I think that was more than enough,” he told reporters at Queen´s on Sunday.
“The craziest thing was probably staying out really late. I danced a bit, but nothing more than what a normal person would do. I´m getting older, my body doesn´t keep up anymore!”

Pakistan federations plan participation in Indian events despite significant bilateral confrontation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321608-pakistan-federations-plan-participation-in-indian-events-despite-significant-bilateral-confrontation,"KARACHI: Despite severe strained relations with heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India, a number of local sports federations have planned participation in international events that are to be held in India.
According to details, 14 out of 45 national sports federations submitted their annual sports calendars to Pakistan Sports Board which also included their participation in international events.
Pakistan Hockey Federation is to feature in the Junior World Cup in India from November 29 to December 10 this year while they would also participate in men’s Senior Asia Cup in India from August 25 to September 7 this year.
Similarly, Pakistan Taekwondo Federation is to participate in India Open International Taekwondo Championship from November 11-14 and also in the Commonwealth Taekwondo Championship from November 15-20 this year.
Also, Pakistan Weightlifting Federation mentioned in their calendar the participation in Commonwealth Senior, Junior and Youth Championships in India from August 24-30 this year and also in Asian Weightlifting Championships in May next year in India.
When contacted, President Pakistan Hockey Federation Mir Tariq Hussain Bugti said they are ready and don’t want to miss events in India despite the current tense situation between both the countries.
“We are ready and will apply for visas for the said events but we are not sure how Indian authorities would respond. I hope we will get visas because it’s a sport. But still we don’t know what will happen,” said Bugti.
Similarly, President Pakistan Taekwondo Federation Raja Waseem Ahmed said they are having correspondence with Commonwealth authorities in this regard and trying to get visas for the said championship.
However, Dr. Hafiz Zafar Iqbal, member of the Interim Committee on Pakistan Weightlifting Federation refused to send their teams in the events scheduled in India.
“We will not participate in both the events there under the current strained circumstances between India and Pakistan,” said Zafar while talking to ‘The News’.
It is pertinent to mention here that Indian sports authorities and players have called for having ‘no sporting ties’ with Pakistan after the Pahalgam terrorist attack which escalated to a brief war between both the countries recently.
For example, it was reported by Indian media that former International Olympic Committee member and International Hockey Federation President Narinder Batra “demanded that India severs all sporting ties with Pakistan” while he also requested the Indian companies not to have sponsorship deals with the FIH as it is being led by Pakistan’s Tayyab Ikram.
Moreover, Times of India (TOI) reported that the upcoming Asia Cup in cricket could be postponed as well due to this issue. The news report mentioned that the Asia Cup scheduled in September this year is likely to be postponed as no venue for the event has been finalized yet.
“The dates and venue for the upcoming Asia Cup is yet to be finalised, and if the tournament does get a green light, it will be played under a hybrid model. Since India are the hosts for the Asia Cup, Pakistan could play their matches in either Sri Lanka or UAE,” stated the report.

Messi denied late winner in Club World Cup opener,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321609-messi-denied-late-winner-in-club-world-cup-opener,"Miami Gardens: Lionel Messi and Inter Miami were held to a 0-0 draw by Egyptian side Al Ahly on Saturday as FIFA´s new 32-team tournament got off to a smooth start in front of 60,927 fans in Florida.
Messi was denied a storybook stoppage-time winner when he saw his curling shot from 20 yards out tipped on to the bar by Mohamed El Shenawy as Miami piled on the pressure in the final minutes of the game.
Al Ahly, who were cheered on by over 10,000 of their supporters, were left to rue a first-half penalty from Egypt international Trezeguet which was saved by Miami´s Argentine keeper Oscar Ustari.
But the Egyptians also had El Shenawy to thank for another fine save in the dying seconds to keep out a header from Maxi Falcon as Miami pushed for three points in the Group A clash. For organisers FIFA, who have faced heavy skepticism over the necessity for the tournament, the absence of a goal was the only disappointment on a night that delivered everything else that their president Gianni Infantino had hoped for from the opening night.
Fears of a low crowd for the opener eased as the seats in the 64,000 venue began to fill up with the stadium almost full at kick-off time. Thousands of fans of Al Ahly, record 12 times African Champions League winner and 45-time league champions of Egypt, arrived at Hard Rock Stadium well ahead of kick-off and made their presence felt with singing and chanting.
The stadium, home to the NFL´s Miami Dolphins, witnessed chaotic scenes last year at the final of the Copa America between Argentina and Colombia where fans broke into the ground after long delays to enter.
But there was an efficient filter system set up for ticket and security checks well away from the stadium perimeter and there were no signs of any problems. Nor was there any indication of the controversial crackdown on illegal immigrants from US President Donald Trump´s administration having any impact on the game in the heavily Hispanic South Florida community.
While there were no goals to celebrate, the game was far from boring with Al Ahly enjoying the better of the first half before Miami improved significantly after the break. Al Ahly opened up Miami´s defence with ease in the opening minutes of the game and Emam Ashour was denied by Ustari after being put through by Trezeguet.
Palestine international striker Wessam Abou Ali had an effort ruled out for offside in the 31st minute and then the Denmark-born forward had a fierce strike tipped over by Ustari. The penalty came when Telasco Segovia bundled over Zizo but Trezeguet´s spot kick was weak and parried out with the former Aston Villa forward unable to react fast enough to the rebound.
Miami were stronger after the break with Messi going close in the 64th minute with a free-kick which grazed the post before hitting the side-netting, tricking part of the crowd into thinking he had scored.
He nearly did in stoppage time, after a well-worked short-corner but the outstretched finger tip of El Shenawy was to deny him. Miami face Porto in Atlanta on Thursday before returning home to face Brazil´s Palmeiras on Monday and while those should be tougher tests, their Argentina coach Javier Mascherano was upbeat.
“The truth is we leave with the feeling that we could have won it in the second half. Going forward we have to do what we did in the second half, not have any fear, shed whatever baggage we had because when we play like that, we can play even with any team,” he said.
Al Ahly´s Spanish coach Jose Riveiro, who only took charge of the team for this tournament, said his team should have finished the game off in the first half.
“It´s a game of mistakes. We had a decent amount of chances in the first half to put the game in a different space,” he said before praising the team´s fans. “It was like we were playing in Cairo and that was a surprise for me in my first official match with Al Ahly.

US Open leader Burns eyes first major title at historic Oakmont,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321610-us-open-leader-burns-eyes-first-major-title-at-historic-oakmont,"Oakmont: On a punishing Oakmont course famed for crowning first-time major winners, Sam Burns finds himself on the brink of joining a historic list.
The 28-year-old American will carry a one-stroke lead into Sunday´s final round of the 125th US Open after firing a one-under-par 69 in Saturday´s third round to stand on four-under 206.
Burns, who leads compatriot J.J. Spaun and 2013 Masters winner Adam Scott of Australia by one stroke, is among nine first-major hopefuls in the top 10. Seven first-time major winners at Oakmont include 18-time major winner Jack Nicklaus, South African Ernie Els and Americans Johnny Miller and Dustin Johnson.
“It would be incredible,” Burns said. “As a kid growing up you dream about winning major championships and that´s why we practice so hard and work so hard. “The opportunity to win a major is special. I´m definitely really excited for tomorrow.
“The history here and all the people that have been before me and walked these grounds and played here, it´s really special.” Players with a 54-hole solo lead in a major for the first time, like Burns, have won three of the last five opportunities, including Bryson DeChambeau at last year´s US Open, fellow American Scottie Scheffler at the 2022 Masters and Japan´s Hideki Matsuyama at the 2021 Masters.
Close Burns friend Scheffler, the world number one, has taken three major titles, two at the Masters and last month´s PGA Championship. “Scottie is an incredible player,” Burns said. “We spend a lot of time together and being able to talk to him and just learn from him and ask him questions, it has been really cool.
“He´s an easy guy to root for. He happens to be also the best player in the world. But, yeah, it has been nice to pick his brain and ask him certain things.” Burns, who shares a rental house this week with Scheffler and their families, admits he would love to know some of the major-winning experiences that Scheffler has enjoyed, but not in an envious tone.
“Yeah, as a competitor, we show up to play to win,” Burns said. “Watching him do that and watching him have success, it brings me a lot of joy.” Putting has been a joyful experience this week too. Burns and Ryan Fox of New Zealand are the only players without a three-putt bogey this week.
“The course I play at at home, Squire Creek, it has big surfaces and lots of slope,” Burns said. “So I think I´m kind of used to having a 15- or 20-footer that may break five or six feet. I like that kind of artistic ability to kind of see the break.”
Burns is known for not making changes in life or golf, but a first major win is one he longs for. “My dad has always said you got to dance with who brought you,” Burns said. “My coach and I have been working together since I was 15 or 16, and it seems way more complicated to go seek advice from someone else who doesn´t know me or my golf swing.”

Bath hold off Leicester to end 29 year-wait for English title,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321611-bath-hold-off-leicester-to-end-29-year-wait-for-english-title,"LONDON: Bath became champions of England for the first time since 1996 with a dramatic 23-21 Premiership final victory over Leicester in baking conditions at Twickenham on Saturday.
Victory completed a treble for Bath after lifting the Premiership Rugby Cup and European Challenge Cup and rounded off a dominant season in which they finished runaway leaders in the Premiership table.
Tries from Thomas Du Toit and Max Ojomoh plus 13 points from the boot of Finn Russell edged Bath over the line despite a spirited fightback from the Tigers. Three years on from finishing bottom of the Premiership, Bath´s title caps a remarkable return to the top of the English game under South African coach Johaan van Graan.
After missing out in the final to Northampton in an agonising 25-21 defeat in last year´s final, nearly three decades of hurt have come to an end. “Grateful for this journey that started almost three years ago,” said Van Graan.
“A club with no hope. We started to, to work on our hope, on our joy. Day-by-day and then we moved into believe and today elation, satisfaction and more just grateful for everybody.” Leicester outscored their opponents by three tries to two but trailed 20-7 down with just over 10 minutes to go.
“I´m so proud of the players for the way they came in there and stayed in it right to the end,” said Leicester coach Michael Cheika, who was left furious at a number of decisions by the officials in his final match in charge.
Despite their 29-year wait, Bath were strong favourites after finishing 11 points clear of second-placed Leicester in the league table and winning 43-15 when the two sides met just four weeks ago.
Nerves got the better of the west country side early on and Leicester took advantage to score first. Jack van Poortvliet touched down after a driving maul carried the Tigers towards the Bath line. Russell was wayward from the tee in his last visit to Twickenham which cost Scotland the Calcutta Cup against England in the Six Nations back in February.

New-look Man City crave winning feeling at Club World Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321613-new-look-man-city-crave-winning-feeling-at-club-world-cup,"Manchester, United Kingdom: Bolstered by a Â£100 million ($135 million) spending spree ahead of the Club World Cup, Manchester City are determined to erase the memory of a disappointing season by returning to winning ways in the United States.
For the first time in eight years, City ended the domestic campaign without a major trophy as Pep Guardiola´s men surrendered the Premier League crown to Liverpool after an unprecedented four consecutive titles.
A Champions League exit before the last 16 for the first time since 2012/13 and a shock FA Cup final defeat against Crystal Palace compounded a miserable season for a club that has grown used to success since an Abu Dhabi-backed takeover 17 years ago.
At one time the month-long expanded Club World Cup, sandwiched between two gruelling seasons, was the last thing Guardiola or his players appeared to want. Ballon d´Or winner Rodri hinted back in September that a players´ strike was “close” over fixture congestion.
Defender Manuel Akanji more recently said the City squad was “not exactly overjoyed” at playing in the tournament given the limited rest time. However, City are keen to turn the page from last season and begin afresh with major changes in the squad and coaching staff.
Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Marcus Bettinelli were all signed last week to beat the deadline to feature in the Club World Cup from the start. City also spent more than Â£172 million in January on Omar Marmoush, Abdukodir Khusanov, Vitor Reis and Nico Gonzalez.
Adding Claudio Echeverri, who arrived in Manchester in January at the end of a loan spell at River Plate, nine of Guardiola´s 27-man squad for the tournament have been at City for less than six months.
Former City captain Kyle Walker and club record signing Jack Grealish have been left out of the travelling party in a changing of the guard. Meanwhile, Guardiola has also made radical changes to his staff with Pep Lijnders, Jurgen Klopp´s former assistant at Liverpool, and ex-City defender Kolo Toure joining the backroom team and three other coaches departing.

Sinner had ‘sleepless nights’ after dramatic French Open final loss,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321614-sinner-had-sleepless-nights-after-dramatic-french-open-final-loss,"Munich, Germany: Italian Jannik Sinner said on Sunday he had experienced “a few sleepless nights” since his historic French Open final loss to Carlos Alcaraz.
Sinner, 23, tasted defeat after five hours and 29 minutes in Roland Garros´ longest ever final last weekend and wasted three match points, having been two sets up. “I had already a few sleepless nights, but I think every day it gets better,” Sinner told reporters before starting his grass season in Halle, Germany next week.
“Tennis is important in my life but nevertheless family and friends more important. “Nonetheless I think often about the match,” the world number one added. Sinner failed to add to his Australian and US Open titles in the already legendary decider with Spaniard Alcaraz in Paris.
He returned home to Trentino-South Tyrol after the gruelling encounter on clay. “I was very relaxed with my family. We grilled a bit, played table tennis with my friends,” Sinner said.

‘Damage limitation’ for McLaren after qualifying woe,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321615-damage-limitation-for-mclaren-after-qualifying-woe,"Montreal: Championship leaders McLaren admitted that they are in damage limitation mode ahead of Sunday´s Canadian Grand Prix after being outpaced by Mercedes´ George Russell and Red Bull´s Max Verstappen in qualifying.
Oscar Piastri, who leads the drivers´ title race by 10 points ahead of team-mate Lando Norris, improved his form to qualify Saturday after a dismal Friday, but Norris slipped to seventh. “To be honest, after how practice went, I´m pretty happy with myself at the moment, it was a nice turnaround,” admitted Piastri. “Third is ok and I will definitely take it here.
“It was always a question for us and a difficult one to choose a medium or a soft tyre for final qualifying Q3. “We went with the soft because we were having a lot of problems and we just wanted to keep things consistent and play it safe.”
Team boss Andrea Stella admitted: “We are in damage limitation mode,” a comment that suggested he and McLaren will be satisfied to claim a podium finish.
Norris admitted he had too many mistakes. “It´s not ideal, just too many mistakes, I hit the wall in the last lap,” he said. “I´ve got confidence and the car felt good, but I just made too many mistakes.” He added that the new front wing and suspension had made no discernible difference for his performance.

Mertens wins 10th WTA Tour title in Netherlands,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321616-mertens-wins-10th-wta-tour-title-in-netherlands,"Hertogenbosch, Netherlands: Belgian Elise Mertens won the 10th WTA title of her career on Sunday with a straight-sets victory over Romania´s Elena-Gabriela Ruse in the final of the grass-court event in ´s-Hertogenbosch.
The 29-year-old, ranked 20 in the world, secured a 6-3, 7-6 (7/4) win, saving two set points in the second set before taking a tie-break.
It is Mertens´ second title of the season after victory in the Singapore Open in February. The third seed had saved 11 match points in a remarkable semi-final win over Ekaterina Alexandrova on Saturday.

"Australian PM to press Trump on tariffs, defence pact",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321658-australian-pm-to-press-trump-on-tariffs-defence-pact,"SYDNEY: Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he will meet with US President Donald Trump at next week´s G7 meeting in Canada where he plans to discuss trade tariffs and a defence pact put under review by Washington.
The G7 summit starting on Sunday in the Canadian Rockies town of Kananaskis marks the first major global gathering of Trump´s second term. “We do have a meeting scheduled,” Albanese told reporters, adding that he expected “a constructive engagement”.
“We´ll raise tariffs, we´ll raise the importance as well of AUKUS, and we will have a discussion as two friends should,” he said from Seattle, as he makes his way to the G7 summit.
The 2021 AUKUS deal joins Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States in a multi-decade effort to balance China´s growing military might. The deal aims to arm Australia with a fleet of cutting-edge, nuclear-powered submarines from the United States and provides for cooperation in developing an array of warfare technologies.
The Trump administration put the pact under review last week, but Australian officials said it was “perfectly natural for an incoming administration to do”. “The context of the AUKUS discussions will be what Australia contributes, the potential that AUKUS has to allow for a range of benefits to the United States,” he said.
Australia, a close US ally, has been slugged with a blanket 10 percent tariff on goods exported to the United States -- rising to 50 percent on steel and aluminium -- as part of Trump´s sweeping global duties .

Toddler among seven killed in India chopper crash,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321659-toddler-among-seven-killed-in-india-chopper-crash,"DEHRADUN, India: Seven people including a toddler were killed on Sunday in India when a helicopter ferrying Hindu pilgrims from a shrine crashed in the Himalayas, officials said.
The fatal accident comes as relatives mourn at least 279 people killed when a passenger plane slammed into a residential area in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday. The helicopter crash left the pilot and all six passengers dead when their chopper came down during the flight from Kedarnath temple, in Uttarakhand state, disaster response official Nandan Singh Rajwar told AFP.
It was likely caused by bad weather, according to state tourism official Rahul Chaubey. The incident prompted Indian civil aviation authorities to suspend chopper services to shrines in the Himalayas, Chaubey said.
The state´s chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, said there will be “zero tolerance for any compromise with passenger safety” in a post on X. Pilgrims flock to Kedarnath, which stands at an altitude of 3,584 metres (11,759 feet), and other revered Himalayan shrines during the summer when it is possible to access them.

"Trump administration weighs adding 36 countries to travel ban, says memo",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321660-trump-administration-weighs-adding-36-countries-to-travel-ban-says-memo,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s administration is considering significantly expanding its travel restrictions by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.
Earlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against “foreign terrorists” and other national security threats.
The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from US universities and deport others.
In an internal diplomatic cable signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.
“The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days,” the cable sent out over the weekend said.
The cable was first reported by the Washington Post. Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said. Another was “questionable security” of that country’s passport.
Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the US visas their citizens were being granted.

"Macron says Greenland is not to be sold, nor taken",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321661-macron-says-greenland-is-not-to-be-sold-nor-taken,"PARIS/COPENHAGEN: French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday pledged his support for Greenland, saying the Arctic island was not for sale, and not to be taken over amid threats from US President Donald Trump to do just that.
Macron said Greenland was threatened by “predatory ambition,” and its situation should be a wakeup call for all Europeans. Greenland is a self-governing part of Denmark with the right to declare independence.
Macron is the first foreign head of state to visit the vast territory -- at the crossroads of the Atlantic and the Arctic -- since Trump´s annexation threats.

"India a voice for Global South at G7, says foreign minister",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321662-india-a-voice-for-global-south-at-g7-says-foreign-minister,"PARIS: India, whose leader has been invited to the G7 starting on Sunday, is eager to represent the Global South on the world stage, acting as a “bridge” between different countries, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said.
India is not a member of the G7 -- which comprises Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- but the world´s most populous nation and one of its biggest economies has been invited to summits since 2019.
“We have been an outreach country in the G7 for many years, and I think it brings benefits to the G7,” he told AFP in Paris. “There are very strong feelings in the Global South about the inequities of the international order, the desire to change it, and we are very much part of that,” he added.
“It is important for us to organise ourselves and make our presence felt.” The leaders of the G7 kick off a yearly summit in the Canadian Rockies on Sunday. They have invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with the leaders of Ukraine, Mexico, South Africa and South Korea, to attend at a time of global turmoil and a radical new US approach to world affairs.
The member nations are also expected to deliberate on troubled relations with China and Russia. India is a leading member of BRICS -- a bloc of leading emerging economies that includes Russia and China, whose leaders are set to meet in early July.
BRICS has growing economic clout and is increasingly seen as a G7 rival. Jaishankar said India had “the ability to work with different countries in a way without making any relationship exclusive”.
“To the extent that that serves as a bridge, it´s frankly a help that we do to international diplomacy at a time when, mostly what you see are difficult relationships and excessive tensions,” he added.

"Netanyahu sees Gaza hostage release ‘opening’, orders talks",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321663-netanyahu-sees-gaza-hostage-release-opening-orders-talks,"OCCUPIED AL-QUDS: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he ordered negotiators to “advance” talks on releasing hostages held in Gaza, after sensing an opportunity amid Israel´s unprecedented attack on arch-foe Iran.
“I gave instructions the day before yesterday to advance negotiations, because I sense an opening... We will complete... both missions: the destruction of Hamas and the release of the hostages,” he said of talks with Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas for the release of hostages held in Gaza.
Of the 251 hostages seized during Hamas´s October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza, 52 are still held in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.
Hamas also holds the remains of an Israeli soldier killed in the 2014 war. Israel´s military on Sunday identified the hostage whose body it retrieved from Gaza last week as Aviv Atzili. Israel on Friday launched an aerial assault to destroy the Iran´s defence capabilities and cripple its nuclear programme, hitting nuclear and military facilities, and killing top commanders, atomic scientists and dozens of civilians.

Modi visits Cyprus to advance trade corridor plans,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321664-modi-visits-cyprus-to-advance-trade-corridor-plans,"NICOSIA: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Cyprus on Sunday in a visit focused on the potential role the island could play in linking India to Europe via a trade corridor, officials said.
Modi, who was on his way to a summit of the G7 group of nations in Canada, and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides were scheduled to address business leaders on Sunday and hold formal talks on Monday. India is pursuing the so-called India-Middle East-Europe Corridor (IMEC) trade link by sea and rail, but the visit is being held in the shadow of a rapidly escalating crisis in the Middle East.
“One of the objectives of our discussions is the connection of India with Europe through the region of the wider Middle East, (and) its entry into Europe through the Republic of Cyprus,” Christodoulides told journalists earlier on Sunday.
The two-day visit is part of a broader diplomatic outreach to European nations. Cyprus assumes the rotating EU presidency for six months in early 2026. The two countries have close relations through their shared membership of the Commonwealth.

Israel's strikes on Iran were years in the making: analysts,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321665-israel-s-strikes-on-iran-were-years-in-the-making-analysts,"PARIS: Israel´s unprecedented strikes on Iran, which have killed top military leaders and nuclear scientists, required years of meticulous intelligence gathering and infiltration, experts say.
Israel said it hit hundreds of targets on Friday alone, and has since continued its attacks, striking a defence facility and fuel depots on Sunday. The fiercest-ever exchange of fire between the arch foes came in the midst of ongoing talks between Tehran and Washington seeking to reach a deal on Iran´s nuclear programme.
“Israel has been following the nuclear programme for 15 years,” Israeli analyst Michael Horowitz toldAFP. “The strikes we see are the result of years of intelligence gathering and infiltration of the Islamic republic.”
Israel has previously carried out more limited attacks against Iranian military sites, including in October last year. “It seems that this week´s operation had been in preparation for months, with an acceleration after the operation last year significantly weakened Iranian air defences,” Horowitz said.
The United States and other Western countries, along with Israel, accuse Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon. Tehran denies that, but has gradually broken away from its commitments under a 2015 nuclear deal it struck with world powers, which the United States withdrew from during President Donald Trump´s first term.
The landmark accord had provided Iran sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its atomic programme. Israel is long believed to have carried out sabotage operations inside Iran through its Mossad espionage agency, but the attacks that started on Friday are by far the broadest in scope.
The campaign has shown Israel to be capable of precisely locating and taking out high-ranking Iranian officials and nuclear scientists. A European security source said the strikes showed “an impressive degree of precision and mastery”.
Israel says it has killed 20 military and security targets, including the armed forces´ chief of staff and the head of Iran´s Revolutionary Guards, as well as nine nuclear scientists.
Danny Citrinowicz, of the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies, said the ability to take out high-ranking officials showed “intelligence, but also operational superiority of Israel over Iran”.
“It´s highly connected to the ability to collect information, intelligence in Iran for years, excellent intelligence that actually allows you to detect where they´re living, the seniors, also the nuclear scientists,” he toldAFP. The latest targeted strikes come after Israel killed Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas, in a Tehran guesthouse in July last year.
Haniyeh had been in town for the inauguration of Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and was reportedly killed by an explosive device that Israeli operatives had placed in the guesthouse weeks before.
Analysts at the time saw the attack as a major intelligence failure by Iran. But “still Iran didn´t learn and didn´t have the ability to lock the holes in their system”, said Citrinowicz.
News site Axios reported that Mossad agents inside Iran helped prepare Friday´s strikes, pre-positioning weapon systems near air defence targets, including by hiding them inside vehicles, and launching them when the attack started.
An Israeli intelligence official told Axios that Mossad had “established an attack drone base inside Iran with drones that were smuggled in long before the operation”. A former Israeli intelligence official told The Atlantic that “Iranians opposed to the regime make for a ready recruiting pool”, and that “Iranians working for Israel were involved in efforts to build a drone base inside the country”.
Alain Chouet, the former number three in the French intelligence, said he was convinced Israel had “half a dozen cells capable of acting at any moment” inside Iran. Iran regularly executes people it accuses of spying for Israel.
It is unclear what role, if any, Israel´s key military and diplomatic ally the United States had in the latest strikes. Before the attack early on Friday, Trump publicly urged Israel to allow time for diplomacy, as a sixth round of US-Iranian nuclear talks were set to be held in Oman at the weekend.
The US president on Sunday said Washington “had nothing to do” with ally Israel´s campaign. But Iran´s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday said Tehran had “solid proof of the support of the American forces and American bases in the region” for the attacks. And Israel´s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday his country was acting with “the clear support of the president of the United States”.

Families hold funerals for Air India crash victims,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321666-families-hold-funerals-for-air-india-crash-victims,"AHMEDABAD, India: Mourners covered white coffins with flowers in India on Sunday as funerals were held for some of at least 279 killed in one of the world´s worst plane crashes in decades.
Health officials have begun handing over the first passenger bodies identified through DNA testing, delivering them to grieving relatives in the western city of Ahmedabad, but the wait went on for most families.
“They said it would take 48 hours. But it´s been four days and we haven´t received any response,” said Rinal Christian, 23, whose elder brother was a passenger. There was just one survivor out of 242 passengers and crew on board the Air India jet when it crashed Thursday into a residential area of Ahmedabad, killing at least 38 people on the ground.
“My brother was the sole breadwinner of the family,” Christian told AFP. “So what happens next?” At a crematorium in the city, around 20 to 30 mourners chanted prayers in a funeral ceremony for Megha Mehta, a passenger who had been working in London.
As of Sunday evening 47 crash victims have been identified, according to Rajnish Patel, a doctor at Ahmedabad´s civil hospital.
“This is a meticulous and slow process, so it has to be done meticulously only,” Patel said Saturday. One victim´s relative who did not want to be named told AFP they had been instructed not to open the coffin when they receive it.
Witnesses reported seeing badly burnt bodies and scattered remains. Workers went on clearing debris from the site on Sunday, while police inspected the area. The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner erupted into a fireball when it went down moments after takeoff, smashing into buildings used by medical staff.

Ukraine’s Sumy region on edge as Russian advance closes in,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321667-ukraine-s-sumy-region-on-edge-as-russian-advance-closes-in,"STETS’ KIVKA, Ukraine: Despite the driving rain, a few elderly residents wander into the streets of Stetskivka in northeast Ukraine to catch a yellow bus to go shopping in nearby Sumy, the regional capital.
They are worried about the Russian drones that have been striking the area with increasing regularity, more than three years into Moscow´s invasion. “I´m afraid. Nobody knows what could happen to the bus we take,” Galyna Golovko, 69, told AFP at the small shop she runs near the bus stop.
Golovko said she never goes out in the morning or evening when Russian drones criss-cross the sky. “It´s scary how many drones fly in the morning.... In the morning and in the evening it´s just hell,” she said.
The border with the neighbouring Russian region of Kursk is just 17-kms away. The Sumy region was the starting point for a Ukrainian incursion into Kursk last year. Ukraine held swathes of the territory for eight months, until a spring offensive by Russian forces supported by North Korean troops pushed them back.
Moscow has since advanced towards the city of Sumy, taking several villages along the way and forcing mandatory evacuations of civilian residents. At the Stetskivka bus stop, an elderly woman said she had packed up in case Russian troops arrive in town, where Ukrainian soldiers have replaced a pre-war population of 5,500 people. The town is just 10 kilometres from the front line, and residents said there is heavy fighting nearby.
Beyond Stetskivka, “everything has been destroyed, there is not a single village,” Golovko said. On her shop counter, there was a plastic box with a few banknotes -- donations for a local family that lost its home, destroyed by a Russian glide bomb. Ten kilometres to the south lies Sumy, a city that had 255,000 inhabitants before the war.
So far, restaurants are crowded and there seems little concern about the Russian advance. But buildings in the city bear the scars of Russian bombardments. And, when the sounds of car horns go down in the evenings, explosions can be heard in the distance.

Manhunt continues for suspect in shootings of Minnesota lawmakers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321668-manhunt-continues-for-suspect-in-shootings-of-minnesota-lawmakers,"WASHINGTON: Police and FBI agents waged a huge manhunt on Sunday for a gunman who killed a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota in what officials called a politically motivated attack.
As the search stretched into its second day, police appeared to close in on the shooter, finding a car described as related to him, but not the man himself. America reeled from its latest spasm of political violence as lawmakers called for a return to civility in political discourse that has been overheated and angry for years.
Authorities searched for a man identified as Vance Boelter, 57, who also allegedly shot and wounded another lawmaker and his wife early Saturday in the northern state bordering Canada.
Officials said Boelter impersonated a police officer as he came to the homes of these couples near Minneapolis and shot them, and that officers found a manifesto and a list of other lawmakers and potential targets in his car.
Boelter fled on foot after exchanging gunfire with officers after the second shooting. On Sunday officers located another car related to Boelter in a rural area about a 90-minute drive west of Minneapolis, the Sibley County Sheriff´s Office told AFP.
Residents were warned of the find and agents are scouring the area, the office said without explaining how the vehicle is related to the suspect.
Officials have issued security alerts in South Dakota and other states as the hunt proceeds, US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Sunday as she mourned her slain friend, Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman.

Thousands of UK students caught cheating using AI,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321669-thousands-of-uk-students-caught-cheating-using-ai,"UNITED KINGDOM: Thousands of university students in the UK have been caught misusing ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence tools in recent years, while traditional forms of plagiarism show a marked decline, a Guardian investigation can reveal.
A survey of academic integrity violations found almost 7,000 proven cases of cheating using AI tools in 2023-24, equivalent to 5.1 for every 1,000 students. That was up from 1.6 cases per 1,000 in 2022-23.
Figures up to May suggest that number will increase again this year to about 7.5 proven cases per 1,000 students – but recorded cases represent only the tip of the iceberg, according to experts.
The data highlights a rapidly evolving challenge for universities: trying to adapt assessment methods to the advent of technologies such as ChatGPT and other AI-powered writing tools.
In 2019-20, before the widespread availability of generative AI, plagiarism accounted for nearly two-thirds of all academic misconduct. During the pandemic, plagiarism intensified as many assessments moved online. But as AI tools have become more sophisticated and accessible, the nature of cheating has changed.
The survey found that confirmed cases of traditional plagiarism fell from 19 per 1,000 students to 15.2 in 2023-24 and is expected to fall again to about 8.5 per 1,000, according to early figures from this academic year.

One dead after 6.1-magnitude earthquake in Peru,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321670-one-dead-after-6-1-magnitude-earthquake-in-peru,"LIMA: A 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck Peru on Sunday, killing one person and triggering landslides, officials said.
The quake hit shortly before noon and was centered around 30-kms from Callao, a port city next to the capital Lima, the National Seismological Centre said. The US Geological Survey put the magnitude at 5.6.
Peru said the tremor had not generated a tsunami warning. A man died in Lima when a wall fell on the car he was driving, the National Police said. The TV channel Latina showed footage of landslides in several areas of the capital city.
The quake also prompted a suspension of a major football game being played in Lima. Peru lies on the so-called Ring of Fire, a stretch of intense seismic and volcanic activity around the Pacific basin.
Peru averages at least 100 detectable earthquakes every year. The last big one, in 2021 in the Amazon region, had a magnitude of 7.5, left 12 people injured and destroyed more than 70 homes. A devastating quake in 1970 in the northern Ancash region of Peru killed around 67,000 people.

Protesters against overtourism take to the streets of southern Europe,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321671-protesters-against-overtourism-take-to-the-streets-of-southern-europe,"BARCELONA/MADRID: Thousands of people took to the streets of cities in southern Europe on Sunday to demonstrate against overtourism, firing water pistols at shop windows and setting off smoke in Barcelona, where the main protest took place.
“Your holidays, my misery,” protesters chanted in the streets of Barcelona while holding up banners emblazoned with slogans such as “mass tourism kills the city” and “their greed brings us ruin”.
Under the umbrella of the SET alliance - Sud d’Europa contra la Turistització, or Catalan for “Southern Europe against Overtourism” - protesters joined forces with groups in Portugal and Italy, arguing that uncontrolled tourism was sending housing prices soaring and forcing people out of their neighbourhoods. Barcelona, a city of 1.6 million, drew 26 million tourists last year.
Authorities in the north eastern Spanish city said around 600 people joined the demonstration there, some firing water pistols or setting off coloured smoke and putting stickers saying ‘Neighbourhood self-defence, tourist go home’ on shop windows and hotels.  Outside one hotel, an agitated worker confronted the protesters saying he was “only working” and was not the venue’s owner. In Barcelona, the city government said last year it would bar apartment rentals to tourists by 2028 to make the city more liveable for residents.

Cyprus says it has been asked by Iran to convey ‘some messages’ to Israel,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321672-cyprus-says-it-has-been-asked-by-iran-to-convey-some-messages-to-israel,"NICOSIA: Iran has asked Cyprus to convey “some messages” to Israel, President Nikos Christodoulides said on Sunday, as the east Mediterranean island appealed for restraint in a rapidly escalating crisis in the Middle East.
Christodoulides spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and he has also spoken to the leaders of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Greece, his office said. Earlier, Christodoulides told journalists Iran had asked Cyprus to convey ‘some messages’ to Israel but he did not say who specifically the messages were from or what they said.
Cypriot officials offered no clarity on the nature of the messages, which came after the Cypriot foreign minister spoke to his Iranian counterpart on Friday night. Christodoulides also said he was not happy with what he said was a slow reaction by the European Union to the unfolding crisis in the Middle East.
