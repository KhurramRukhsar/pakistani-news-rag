US suggests student visa suspension to be brief,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316690-us-suggests-student-visa-suspension-to-be-brief,"WASHINGTON: The US State Department indicated Thursday that a global suspension on visa processing for international students would be brief, as it ramps up scrutiny of applicants´ social media activity.
State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce encouraged prospective students to seek visa appointments and said: “I would not be recommending that if this was going to be weeks or months.”
“I can tell you that it´s something that would happen perhaps sooner than later,” she told reporters.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Tuesday ordered embassies and consulates to pause scheduling appointments for student visas pending new guidelines on checking applicants´ social media postings.
Bruce said that prospective students should start checking online for when appointments become available.
“Right now there might be some delay, and what I´m told to encourage people to do is to regularly check to see when those spaces open,” she said.

Imran ready for ‘give and take’ for sake of Pakistan: Zafar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316691-imran-ready-for-give-and-take-for-sake-of-pakistan-zafar,"RAWALPINDI: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder chairman Imran Khan is prepared for a “give-and-take” with the establishment for the betterment of Pakistan and is ready for negotiations at any time to foster national unity, Senator Barrister Ali Zafar announced on Thursday. Zafar’s comments came after a meeting with Imran at the Adiala jail.
The statement was aimed at clarifying an earlier statement by Aleema Khan, the PTI founder’s sister, who suggested that Khan was not seeking any deal for his release.
Speaking to the media outside the Adiala jail following a hearing in the GHQ attack case, Barrister Zafar said the former prime minister emphasized that his doors were open for dialogue.
“The PTI founder said he was not asking for concessions for himself for if he had to ask for concessions, he would have done so much earlier,” Zafar explained, adding that Khan’s willingness for “give-and-take” was solely “for the sake of the country”.
Zafar also disclosed that Khan had directed the party leadership to gear up for a protest movement, with a comprehensive plan of action to be unveiled within next five to six days.
The PTI chairman reportedly issued a stern message, stating that he “will not tolerate it if anyone does not come forward now, and he will not allow anyone to play on both sides of the wicket,” underscoring a demand for clear commitment.
Reiterating Khan’s position, Senator Zafar said the PTI founder’s primary demand was for “justice and for the cases to be heard soon.”
Mumtaz Alvi adds: Meanwhile, Aleema Khan said Imran Khan ‘disclosed’ to her on Thursday that he was asked two years back to remain silent for three years and let the ‘mandate thief’ government run.
Talking to the media outside the Adiala jail along with her two sisters and party lawyers and workers, she said Imran emphasized that he would not bow down for even three minutes.
According to Aleema Khan, the party founder was asked to apologize for the May 9 violence but he replied that those who committed the violence should apologize.
About her recent statement that what the founder should give up for his release, she said her brother was being asked to back down from taking position for the rule of law.
She said Imran maintained that the 26th Amendment was made to cover up rigging in the February 8 elections.
Aleema said the party founder had a message for the leaders and workers that now was the time to stand strong and that those who could not bear the pressure should separate; there is no problem, new people should come forward who can tolerate the burden.
She said jail authorities were not taking the court orders into account and that they were not allowed to meet. She pointed out that the party lawyer Naeem Panjhotha went inside and brought the details.
She said when people asked them as to when Imran Khan would be released, she said when the judges took up cases against him and gave judgments independently, he would be released.
Aleema feared that the PMLN and PPP might get the reserved seats for which both were making efforts.

Nepra defends KE tariff ruling after minister’s criticism,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316692-nepra-defends-ke-tariff-ruling-after-minister-s-criticism,"ISLAMABAD: Nepra Chairman Waseem Mukhtar on Thursday responded to Power Minister Awais Leghari’s criticism of K-Electric’s tariff determination, saying during a public hearing, “We’ve given our decision, now it’s up to the minister to respond.” The remarks came during the monthly fuel charges adjustment (FCA) hearing, where the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) sought to increase April’s power tariff by Rs1.27 per unit.
The minister had expressed reservations about Nepra’s decision on K-Electric’s multi-year tariff and recently said that the utility’s tariff should be determined based on “efficiency, not charity.”
Awais Leghari had also announced that the Power Division will approach Nepra to seek a review of this decision. The Nepra chairman, responding to a question during the hearing, reiterated the regulator’s stance: “We’ve given our decision, now it’s up to the minister.”
If the regulator approved the CPPA-G’s request, it would translate into Rs12.93 billion additional burden on consumers for April, citing a steep drop in hydropower generation due to reduced water availability.
Officials from the National Power Control Centre revealed that hydropower output fell by nearly one billion units in April. “The decline in hydro generation is the primary driver behind the proposed fuel adjustment,” an NPCC official explained.
Consumers voiced frustration at the growing electricity costs, questioning the government’s commitment to affordability. “Under the prime minister’s plan, electricity was supposed to get cheaper, not more expensive,” one consumer argued during the hearing.
Arif Balwani demanded transparency on the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project, which he said had consumed Rs500 billion. “Should we now offer fateha for Neelum-Jhelum?” he asked pointedly, pressing Nepra on the status of an earlier directive to compile a report on water availability. Nepra officials said only Wapda could provide accurate details on the project.
Despite the requested Rs1.27 hike, CPPA-G official noted the FCA adjustment will apply only for April and will not impact lifeline users, prepaid customers, EV charging stations, or K-Electric consumers.
Responding to a question on the impact of hydropower project shutdowns, CPPA-G’s CEO noted had the Kalabagh Dam been built, Pakistan wouldn’t be facing today’s electricity shortages. “The best-case scenario would have been a functioning Kalabagh Dam,” he said.
Nepra concluded the hearing stating that it had heard all the stakeholders and would issue a final determination after further analysis of the submitted data.

"Modi links Operation Sindoor to cultural symbolism, faces backlash",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316693-modi-links-operation-sindoor-to-cultural-symbolism-faces-backlash,"KARACHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared that Operation Sindoor is “not yet over”, sparking renewed political controversy at home and sharpening rhetoric across the region.
Speaking at a rally in West Bengal on Thursday, the Indian prime minister addressed Pakistan and said the country “should understand that we have entered your house and killed you three times” -- referring to past military operations widely interpreted as the 2016 Uri surgical strikes, the 2019 Balakot airstrikes, and the most recent Operation Sindoor launched on May 7.
Portraying Operation Sindoor as a national mission backed by “140 crore Indians”, he claimed Indian forces destroyed terror infrastructure across the Line of Control in an operation that “Pakistan never thought of.”
“Now that I am standing on the sacred land of ‘Sindoor Khela’, it is only right that we speak about a new resolve against terrorism Operation Sindoor…. Terrorists had dared to wipe out sindoor of our sisters, but our forces made them realise the strength of sindoor. From this land of Bengal, I declare on behalf of 140 crore Indians that Operation Sindoor is not yet over”, Modi told the crowd, linking the military campaign with Bengal’s cultural traditions.
Critics within India, including West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, have condemned Modi for exploiting military operations for political gain. In a sharp rebuttal, Banerjee accused the Indian PM of playing “political holi” with a military operation’s branding and using religious symbolism to stoke nationalist fervour.
“Operation Sindoor [as a] name was given with a political goal. But I won’t say anything about this. When all opposition leaders are shouting hoarse for the country abroad, at that time the prime minister has come to play political holi – this does not behove the prime minister”, Banerjee said at a press conference.
She also criticised Modi’s use of gendered religious imagery. “You are spreading garbage of lies… PM Modi is not the husband of anybody; why aren’t you giving sindoor to your Mrs first?” she said, attacking the symbolic invocation of sindoor as a tool of state propaganda. She added, “Sindoor cannot be sold like this. Sindoor is a matter of self-respect”.
Modi’s rally speech also targeted the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government in West Bengal, accusing it of “violence, corruption and lawlessness”, and citing recent communal clashes in Murshidabad and Malda, along with a multi-crore teacher recruitment scam.
Banerjee has defended her administration and accused Modi of divisive politics. “He wants to divide and rule. He does divisive politics”, she said, adding that while opposition leaders are representing India abroad and “defending the country like anything”, the prime minister is “criticising the government… and politicising things like the leader of the BJP Jumla Party.”
She further challenged Modi to an early election in the state, saying, “I challenge them. If they have guts, go into elections tomorrow, we are ready and Bengal is ready to accept your challenge.”
On the question of accountability for the recent terror attack in Pahalgam, which left 26 civilians dead, Banerjee asked: “Has anyone seen the terrorists who snatched the sindoor of the women who were victims in Pahalgam? Has he caught them?”
She also accused Modi of avoiding tough international questions, particularly referring to US President Donald Trump’s claims of mediating the May 10 ceasefire between India and Pakistan: “On hearing the word America, he becomes silent.”
Banerjee also challenged Modi to a face-to-face televised debate. “If you are so brave, then come for a press conference on television. We will have a direct fight on any subject you want. You can bring your teleprompters too if you want”, she said, taking a dig at Modi’s reluctance to engage in unscripted public exchanges.

7 terrorists killed in two KP operations,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316694-7-terrorists-killed-in-two-kp-operations,"ISLAMABAD: Seven Khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
According to ISPR, on the night of 28-29 May, Indian sponsored Khwarij attempted to attack a security forces check-post in general area Shawal, North Waziristan district.
The attempt was effectively thwarted by own troops and in ensuing fire exchange, six Indian-sponsored Khwarij were killed.
However, during an intense fire exchange, Lieutenant Daniyal Ismail (age: 24 years, resident of District Mardan), a brave young officer who was leading his troops from the front, fought gallantly and embraced Shahadat along with his three men.
Lieutenant Daniyal Ismail Shaheed joined the Pakistan Army 7 months ago. His father is a civilian driver in the Pakistan Air Force. Daniyal left behind his father and brother.
The three soldiers who paid the ultimate sacrifice include Naib Subedar Kashif Raza (age: 42 years, resident of District Chakwal, performed the sacred duty of defending the homeland for 21 years), Lance Naik Fiaqat Ali (age: 35 years, resident of District Haripur, left behind wife, 1 daughter and 3 sons) and Sepoy Muhammad Hameed (age: 26 years, resident of District Abbottabad, served in the defence forces for 6 years fulfilling duty for the country).
In another encounter that took place in Chitral District, security forces successfully neutralised one Indian-sponsored Kharji.
Sensitization operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored Kharji found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country. Such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve.

"Fuel smuggling causing over Rs500bn loss to state kitty, NA panel told",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316695-fuel-smuggling-causing-over-rs500bn-loss-to-state-kitty-na-panel-told,"ISLAMABAD: Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan, Thursday raised the issue of smuggling of petroleum products from Iran in the meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance.
The PTI leader said the smuggling of petroleum products was causing a revenue loss of Rs500 to Rs550 billion to the national exchequer. He said the smuggling could not occur without the nexus of intelligence agencies and customs intelligence and proposed that drone technology be utilized to ensure surveillance on known routes at the porous borders.
Representatives of the refineries briefed the committee that their input was taxed, but on output, there was no GST, causing problems over the last several years. Without resolving this issue, they would not be able to invest $6 billion.
Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Rashid Mahmoud Langrial said the refineries business came out of the ambit of Value Added Tax (VAT) when there was no tax on their output. He said proposals were under consideration to slap GST on their output or provide them with some kind of other permanent solutions.
The beverage industry informed the committee that their volume and tax contribution had reduced with increased taxation. Ms Atika Mir, representing the juice and beverages industry, proposed reduction in the FED rate from 20 to 15 percent. Langrial said if the industry could give a post-dated bank cheque for increased tax collection from their sector, then the FBR might consider a reduction in the tax rates.
The parliamentarians inquired whether the government was going to impose tax on the imported solar panels, the FBR chairman replied that the government was reviewing to withdraw tax exemptions on different products in the upcoming budget.
Meanwhile, the government Thursday announced that there was no change in the schedule of the upcoming budget, and it will be announced on June 10.
After the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance proceedings were over, journalists asked Federal Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal about further extension in the budget presentation from June 10 to 12, he firmly stated that the budget would be announced on June 10.
When asked about the holding of the National Economic Council (NEC) for approving the macroeconomic framework and development outlay as well as unveiling the Economic Survey for 2024-25 on the same date of June 9, 2025, he replied that the NEC might be rescheduled, but he could not say it with authority. However, the budget will be announced on June 10.
To another query about the postponement of ADB’s Board from May 28 to June 3, he said it would be held on June 3 to consider the approval of guarantees and loans.
Later, Finance Minister’s Advisor Khurram Shahzad in his X post stated that as communicated earlier, the upcoming federal budget is on schedule to be announced on June 10, 2025. Similarly, the upcoming Pakistan Economic Survey FY25 is scheduled to be announced on June 9.
Meanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Thursday approved the Income Tax (Second Amendment) Bill 2025.
The committee focused on the withdrawal of tax exemptions for salaried individuals, particularly teachers whose salaries faced significant deductions. Senator Mohsin Aziz suggested expediting the refund or adjustment process. Mandviwalla directed the FBR to submit a detailed report identifying the affected teachers and the status of their refunds, emphasizing that failure to return deducted amounts undermined the law.
The FBR chairman assured compliance and supported the committee’s recommendations. The committee also reviewed budgetary allocations and utilization under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for FY2024 25.
While the Planning Commission raised concerns over the lapsed project budgets, the finance ministry officials clarified that no funds had lapsed and over 50 percent of authorized funds had already been disbursed.
During discussions on the proposed barter trade mechanism between Pakistan and Iran, Senator Mandviwalla inquired about the absence of a formal net-off settlement mechanism and urged the departments concerned to develop a clear procedure. The committee emphasized relaxing existing restrictions and expanding the list of tradable items. Mandviwalla asked the stakeholders to submit proposals for new items and directed the authorities to resolve operational issues such as limited customs hours and storage space at NLC terminals in Quetta. He also recommended forming a local committee in Quetta to address traders concerns on the ground.

"Reserved seats case: Can judges rewrite Constitution for democracy, asks Justice Mazhar",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316696-reserved-seats-case-can-judges-rewrite-constitution-for-democracy-asks-justice-mazhar,"ISLAMABAD: During a live-streamed hearing of the review petitions against the Supreme Court’s July 12, 2024, judgment on reserved seats for women and minorities, critical constitutional questions dominated proceedings in the apex court on Thursday.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar posed a pivotal question to the counsel during the hearing: “Even if for public aspirations and democracy, can judges rewrite the Constitution?”
This question set the tone for the session, as the 11-member constitutional bench, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard review petitions filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN), and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP).
Representing the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), Advocate Faisal Siddiqi responded that the Constitution had not been rewritten in any manner. However, Justice Musarrat Hilali disagreed, asserting that constitutional boundaries were crossed in the original judgment. “The three-day deadline for joining a political party was extended to 15 days. That is akin to rewriting the Constitution,” Justice Hilali observed. She further questioned the recognition of parliamentary parties, pointing out that Hamid Raza, associated with SIC, had contested elections as an independent despite SIC’s existence since 2013. “He did not contest under his party, so how was a parliamentary party formed?” she asked. “Only those parties that contest elections can become parliamentary parties.”
Justice Hilali also challenged a broader principle in the judgment under review, stating: “The verdict had declared voting a fundamental right of citizens. But voting, as per constitutional jurisprudence, is not a fundamental right.”
Meanwhile, Faisal Siddiqi reiterated that the court’s earlier decision had already accepted independent candidates as PTI members. “All eleven judges of the 13-member bench had accepted independents as PTI members,” he submitted. At this, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail reminded the court that both he and Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa had agreed with the majority of judges in recognising 39 PTI-backed candidates. “Even Justice Yahya Afridi, in his note, acknowledged PTI as a political party and said it deserved reserved seats,” he added.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar also noted that even minority opinions had aligned with the majority in recognising PTI’s status.
Faisal Siddiqi criticised the review petitioners for inconsistencies: “They are now relying on the minority opinions that supported PTI, while simultaneously arguing that PTI deserves no relief. How can that be a valid basis for review?” Justice Salahuddin Panhwar remarked pointedly: “The judgment being reviewed hasn’t even been read before this bench.”
Earlier, during questioning of PMLN counsel Haris Azmat, Justice Mandokhail asked whether the written submissions explained how party-affiliated candidates were declared independent. Azmat replied that he had tried to address the issue.
Faisal Siddiqi also raised procedural concerns, stating that some review petitions had failed to follow the Supreme Court’s rules and should therefore be dismissed. On the matter of election symbols, Siddiqi stated that SIC’s symbol is a horse, but Hamid Raza contested independently.
Justice Mandokhail remarked that the court is not concerned with how a candidate contested, while Justice Hilali insisted the issue was relevant and remained unanswered. Advocate Faisal Siddiqi told the court that the majority of judges in the original judgment had held that the reserved seats rightfully belonged to PTI. However, Justice Aminuddin Khan remarked that Siddiqi was “creating problems” for himself. “It makes no difference to us whether PTI gets the seats or another party does,” Siddiqi replied, prompting Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail to quip, “Then your film will flop.” Siddiqi responded with a smile: “It’ll flop only if you want it to. We will accept your verdict.”
At the outset, Siddiqi referred to portions of the detailed verdict and emphasized that true democracy requires equal rights for all political actors, arguing that PTI candidates were deliberately denied such rights. Justice Mandokhail, however, challenged this framing: “Isn’t it democracy when candidates make their own decisions? No one can be forced to join a party.”
Siddiqi pointed to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s role, which had declared PTI-backed candidates as independents, but Justice Aminuddin Khan noted that Siddiqi was repeating points already addressed in the original hearing. Siddiqi stressed the uniqueness of the case: “This is the first time a review is being heard on a decision of a 13-member bench, and that verdict hasn’t even been read before the court.” Justice Mandokhail retorted: “Who’s stopping you from reading it?”
Justice Musarrat Hilali strongly questioned the SIC’s standing in the matter: “The SIC didn’t even contest elections. Why didn’t you tell PTI this? As party chairman, you should’ve disclosed that you were running as an independent. How can a party that didn’t contest claim reserved seats through independents?” Siddiqi maintained that his arguments had national importance and said he wished to read from the minority decision, adding: “Though I disagree with Justice Aminuddin’s opinion, I still found it powerful.”
The court adjourned the hearing until June 16, with Faisal Siddiqi scheduled to continue his arguments on behalf of the SIC.

"Judges transfer case: Info kept secret, only revealed during process, SC told",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316697-judges-transfer-case-info-kept-secret-only-revealed-during-process-sc-told,"ISLAMABAD: The counsel for five Islamabad High Court (IHC) judges informed the Supreme Court on Thursday that information was concealed and was provided only during the process of transferring judges from various high courts to the IHC.
A five-member Constitutional Bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, heard identical petitions filed by the IHC judges challenging the transfer of judges to the IHC as well as the seniority issue of judges.
On Thursday, Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, representing the IHC judges, argued in his rebuttal that meaningful consultation is essential for transferring a judge to another high court, adding that without it, the process is merely symbolic.
He also alleged that information was concealed and was provided during the transfer process.
Justice Mazhar observed that the matter involves constitutional and legal interpretation, noting that the chief justices of three high courts were involved in the transfer process and not everything was in the hands of the executive.
The judge also pointed out that consent is typically sought from judges being transferred.
Barrister Salahuddin highlighted that the summary claimed only one judge from Punjab was appointed to the IHC, whereas there are currently three judges from Punjab serving there, suggesting possible bad faith in the process.
He submitted that all principles related to judges’ seniority in Pakistan are derived from court decisions, adding that while there are three judicial precedents available—though none are actual case laws—they emphasise past practices, guidance from civil service rules, and transparency.
Salahuddin argued that civil service rules state if two judges are appointed on the same day, seniority is determined by age. Justice Mazhar noted that this principle also applies to the judiciary.
Barrister Salahuddin agreed but pointed out that such principles are not explicitly stated in the law or Constitution, only in court decisions. Justice Mazhar questioned whether a judge brings his service book upon transfer and whether the transfer is temporary or permanent. Salahuddin replied that while a judge brings his service record for benefits or pension purposes, a new oath is taken upon transfer, which determines seniority. The counsel contended that transferring a judge to another high court does not render the original seat vacant and that a permanent transfer would nullify Article 175A of the Constitution. He argued that historically, there is no precedent for the permanent transfer of a judge from one high court to another.
Justice Mazhar acknowledged that the case is the first of its kind.
Salahuddin added that under Article 200, only a temporary transfer is permitted, while a permanent appointment must be made by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan.
Justice Mazhar responded that while Article 175A allows new appointments, appointments and transfers are distinct concepts.
The court adjourned further hearings until June 16, when Barrister Salahuddin will continue his rebuttal arguments. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar remarked that if the hearing concludes on June 16, a short order will be issued after consultation with the judges.

KE asks NA speaker to probe ‘threats’ during NA committee meeting,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316698-ke-asks-na-speaker-to-probe-threats-during-na-committee-meeting,"ISLAMABAD: K-Electric has formally requested the National Assembly Speaker to look into what it describes as an “unfortunate incident” during a parliamentary committee meeting this week, where its CEO was allegedly threatened by an MNA after refusing to withdraw a pending court case.
Sources told The News that the company has written a letter addressed to Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq. Imran Qureshi, Chief Regulatory Affairs Officer of K-Electric, detailed a tense exchange that took place during the May 27 meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Industries and Production.
It was noted that while responding to questions regarding a 2021 government-announced industrial electricity package — currently under litigation — K-Electric’s CEO was pressed by committee members to withdraw the case from the Islamabad High Court. The utility maintained that the matter was sub judice and could not be unilaterally withdrawn.
It highlights that during this discussion, MNA Syed Ali Raza Gilani allegedly interrupted the CEO and, “threatened him with dire consequences” for not complying with the committee’s demand. The CEO, he added, was instructed by the committee chair to leave the meeting to de-escalate tensions, while KE’s senior officials stayed behind to support the committee’s work.
K-Electric’s CEO appeared in person with his senior team to respond to the committee questions but requested the option to attend future meetings online, noting that other participants were allowed to join virtually. Responding to criticism that KE was not giving due importance to the session, the CEO said he had skipped a concurrent board meeting to prioritise the committee hearing.
It is unfortunate that a private company’s chief, who came to cooperate with a parliamentary body, was subjected to aggression and threats. Qureshi urged and requested the Speaker to take notice of the incident. He also attached minutes of a previous mediation committee to reinforce that no agreement had been made to withdraw the litigation.

Federal appeals court temporarily reinstates most of Trump’s sweeping tariffs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316699-federal-appeals-court-temporarily-reinstates-most-of-trump-s-sweeping-tariffs,"WASHINGTON: A federal appeals court on Thursday reinstated the most sweeping of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, a day after a trade court had ruled Trump had exceeded his authority in imposing the duties and had ordered an immediate block on them.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington’s order provided no opinion or reasoning but directed the plaintiffs in the case to respond by June 5 and the administration by June 9.
Wednesday’s surprise ruling by the US Court of International Trade had threatened to kill or at least delay the imposition of Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs on most US trading partners, as well as import levies on goods from Canada, Mexico and China related to his accusation that the three countries were facilitating the flow of fentanyl into the US.

"No change, or nominal cut in POL prices likely from June 1",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316701-no-change-or-nominal-cut-in-pol-prices-likely-from-june-1,"ISLAMABAD: The price of petrol is likely to go down by Rs0.60 per litre and high speed diesel (HSD) by Rs0.28 per litre, industrial and official sources told The News on Thursday.
However, chances are bright for keeping the POL [petrol, oil, lubricant] prices unchanged from June 1, 2025. This will be decided with input of the finance ministry.
Nevertheless, the kerosene oil price may increase by Rs0.30 per litre to Rs164.96 from the existing Rs164.64 per litre. The price of light diesel oil (LDO) is also likely to increase by Rs1.30 per litre. In the international market, Brent crude oil price ranged between $64.02-64.60 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate fell more than 1.5 per cent to trade below $61 a barrel after Interfax cited Kazakhstan as saying that OPEC+ is set to hike output at a meeting on Saturday, with the size of the increase still to be decided. Broader markets eased off of earlier highs on data showing the US economy shrank at the start of the year, further pressuring the commodity. Crude had earlier rallied as much as 2pc after a trade court blocked a vast range of President Donald Trump’s trade levies, including elevated rates on China — the world’s top importer of crude.

Yale hosts first Pakistan conference,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316702-yale-hosts-first-pakistan-conference,"WASHINGTON: The inaugural Ivy Future of Pakistan Conference at Yale University brought together students from Ivy League institutions, including Harvard, Cornell, and Princeton, with academics, policymakers and diplomats to showcase Pakistan’s pivotal role in global diplomacy and the Pakistani diaspora’s contributions to US society.
The event featured addresses by prominent speakers, including former Pakistan Ambassador Ali Jehangir Siddiqui, alongside a panel of foreign policy experts exploring international partnerships. In the context of Pakistan, Siddiqui stressed that the country must frame its diplomatic engagement around tangible contributions, including supply-chain partnerships and continued cooperation in counterterrorism, which remain essential to the broader bilateral equation. He stated that Pakistan has to strengthen its global standing by forging mutually beneficial ties with major powers, reinforcing its position as a key player in diplomacy.
Addressing the audience, Ambassador Siddiqui called for greater representation of Pakistani Americans in US public institutions.
He acknowledged significant progress, citing the election of Pakistani Americans as mayors and state senators in recent years, but stressed that sustained engagement is critical. “It’s about American citizens of Pakistani heritage securing a voice in the decisions that shape their lives,” Siddiqui said.
The conference served as a platform to advance dialogue on governance and diplomacy, strengthening US-Pakistan ties through collaboration and the diaspora’s shared contributions.

China lauds Pakistan’s ‘responsible conduct’ during standoff with India,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316703-china-lauds-pakistan-s-responsible-conduct-during-standoff-with-india,"ISLAMABAD: China — Pakistan’s all-weather strategic partner — on Thursday lauded Islamabad’s responsible conduct during the recent standoff with India.
Speaking at a luncheon hosted by Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Ahsan Iqbal, Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong appreciated the recent return of peace and stability in the region and hoped that peace will bring dividends for Pakistan.
During the meeting at the luncheon, the planning minister extended gratitude to the Chinese ambassador and Beijing for extending unwavering support during times of crisis. “At every critical juncture in our history, China has stood by Pakistan as a rock-solid partner. Our friendship is not seasonal—it is a bond forged in trust, mutual respect and shared dreams for the future,” the minister added.
The meeting underscored the shared resolve to fast-track ongoing and future initiatives under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The planning minister briefed the Chinese ambassador that Gwadar Port has now been fully connected to the national power grid, with tangible progress toward full operationalisation. “Connecting Gwadar to the national grid marks a turning point for making it a true gateway to prosperity, not just for Pakistan but for the entire region. CPEC is the engine that will power Pakistan’s economic transformation and regional integration,” said Iqbal.
Chinese Ambassador Jiang echoed the sentiment, stating that Gwadar’s strategic relevance is gaining global recognition, and reaffirmed China’s steadfast commitment to supporting its development. He also commended Minister Iqbal’s long-standing leadership and dedication to making CPEC a flagship of regional cooperation.
Discussions also focused on preparations for the 14th Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting, scheduled for July 2025. Ambassador Jiang reiterated China’s full support for Pakistan’s development under the “Uraan Pakistan” vision.
Ahsan highlighted the potential of linking Gwadar with Central Asia and Afghanistan, enabling regional access to global markets through Pakistan.
On agricultural cooperation, Iqbal shared that the first batch of Chinese-sponsored agriculture graduates is currently undergoing specialised training in Pakistan. “These young minds, selected through a competitive process, will become catalysts in modernising Pakistan’s agri-economy. With Chinese support, we are sowing the seeds of a food-secure and prosperous Pakistan,” he stated.
He emphasized the urgency of launching the Karakoram Highway (KKH) Phase-II upgrade and the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway project, calling them strategic arteries of Pakistan’s economic future.
He also proposed academic linkages, suggesting partnerships between top Chinese universities and Pakistan’s Danish University, as well as between Chinese medical institutions and Jinnah Medical Complex and Research Centre.

‘Maharaja of Kashmir’ claims immunity in Pakistan High Commission attack case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316668-maharaja-of-kashmir-claims-immunity-in-pakistan-high-commission-attack-case,"LONDON: The Indian origin man who attacked Pakistan High Commission London during the recent conflict between India and Pakistan had asserted before the Southwark Crown Court that he is the sovereign Maharaja of the State of Jammu and Kashmir and must be given immunity from prosecution prior in December 2022.
Ankit Love appeared before the Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Thursday where he asserted again that he (Ankit Love) was (the) His Highness Maharaja of Kashmir and under British legislation and is “therefore entitled to immunity under section 20 of the State Immunity Act 1978 (“the 1978 Act”‘)”.
The Court heard that in 2022, judge Griffith at the Southwark Crown Court had demanded by formal court order against the Secretary of State to provide a Certificate with in seven days under Section 21 of the 1978 Act to address whether Jammu and Kashmir is recognised as a State for the purposes of Part 1 of the 1978 Act; and if the State is so recognised, whether Ankit Love is regarded as the Head of that State.
In his defense, Kashmiri origin Love has claimed he possesses a certificate under the State Immunity Act 1978. The certificate that Ankit Love produced before the court, dated 13 December 2022 states: “Under the authority of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs conferred on me and in accordance with section 21(a) of the State Immunity Act 1978 (“the Act”), I Jeremy Pilmore-Bedford, Deputy Director of Protocol at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (“FCDO”) hereby certify that: 1. His Majesty’s Government does accord recognition to Jammu and Kashmir as a State for the purposes of Part I of the Act; and 2. The FCDO has a record of Mr Ankit Love (born in August 1983) as a sovereign head of State on which immunities and privileges are conferred by Part I of the Act.” The judge adjourned the case for two weeks till 10 June, for the Crown Prosecution Service to consider the certificate presented before the court today. Outside the court, Ankit Love told Geo News he was emotionally distressed when he attacked the Pakistan High Commission soon after the Pahalgam attack. “My mother Jay Mala passed away two years ago exactly around the same time on 26 April. This was on her anniversary, very emotional night for me given the fact that she died in mysterious circumstances and I am still in a legal battle with the Home Ministry of India to have the results of my mother’s post-mortem revealed to me.  My father Prof. Bhim Singh, founder of the Jammu and Kashmir National Panthers Party died in a similar situation on 31 May 2022. I have no doubt that the BJP’s Indian state agents are behind the mysterious deaths of my parents. I went outside the Pakistan High Commission in protest, not to break the law. We as Kashmiris have suffered and at least three major regional players have played games with us.”
Not many know that Ankit Love previously attacked the Indian High Commission and caused damage to it but got away with it. “The prosecution says I have caused damage of under £5000 to the Pakistan High Commission. I caused damage of over £10,000 to the Indian High Commission a few years back. That was a rightful protest. I was protesting outside the Indian High Commission against the illegality of the undemocratic attempted annexation by the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act 2019, and the 1991 Kunan Poshpora incident where all women in an entire village were gang raped by security forces, and no court marshal till date has happed.”
Ankit Love said he loved Lahore, as his ancestoral kinsman Raja Dhian Singh Dogra lived there in the 19th century who was the longest serving prime minister of the Lahore State, and wished to visit the city one day. “Its my dream to visit Lahore one day but I’m not sure if I will get the visa after what happened. Banned by India and now probably the same from Pakistan.”
Last month, British-Kashmiri Ankit Love was formally charged with criminal damage following an incident at the Pakistani High Commission in London, the Metropolitan Police confirmed. According to spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police, Love, 41, with no fixed address, was formally charged on Sunday, April 27. “He was remanded in custody to appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on Monday, 28 April,” the spokesperson said in a statement.

NEOC warns of severe weather as five systems hit country,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316669-neoc-warns-of-severe-weather-as-five-systems-hit-country,"ISLAMABAD: The National Emergencies Operations Centre (NEOC) has warned that five separate weather systems are expected to trigger thunderstorms, strong winds, hailstorms, and heavy downpours across various parts of the country, with Islamabad and Rawalpindi likely to face particularly severe conditions.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has urged all provincial and district authorities to ensure emergency preparedness, remain alert, and coordinate with local response units for timely action.
The Authority will continue to monitor the evolving situation and issue regular updates.
A public advisory has also been issued, urging citizens to exercise caution amid the ongoing severe weather. People are advised to avoid unnecessary travel, particularly in hilly or flood-prone areas, secure vulnerable structures, trees, power lines, and solar panels, and park vehicles in safe, sheltered locations.
Farmers are advised to take measures to protect standing crops from potential hail and strong winds. Travellers and tourists should remain vigilant during outdoor activities and mountain excursions.
According to the NEOC, two major weather systems are merging over the twin cities, with wind gusts and heavy rainfall expected between 6 pm and 11 pm today.
Scattered hailstorms, windstorms, and intense showers are also forecast in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), North Punjab, and south-eastern Punjab.
In Southern Punjab, a slow-moving system is currently active over the Rohi region of Rahim Yar Khan. It is gradually expanding towards Rahim Yar Khan city, Sadiqabad, and Minthar, bringing light to moderate rain.
In KP, an active system stretches from Peshawar to Parachinar, with thunderstorms, gusty winds, and heavy rainfall expected to affect Peshawar, Darra Adam Khel, and neighbouring areas.
Azad Jammu and Kashmir is also under the influence of a strong weather system, extending from Muzaffarabad into the Neelum Valley, which is likely to bring further rainfall and potential storm activity.

Eligibility question clouds PRA IT director’s job,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316672-eligibility-question-clouds-pra-it-director-s-job,"ISLAMABAD: The potential extension and regularisation of Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) Information Technology Director Salman Zafar has drawn attention following questions about his qualifications and appointment history.
Official documents reveal that the PRA was established in 2012, and the post of Director IT was advertised in 2015, requiring a degree in IT or Computer Sciences. However, Salman Zafar, who holds a BSc in Electrical Engineering, was appointed in 2016 and has since secured repeated extensions. Notably, the qualification criteria were later amended to include Electrical Engineering for the position. A Finance Department inquiry observed that Zafar’s initial contract-based appointment as Director IT needed scrutiny. Records indicate his hiring was linked to the proposed establishment of Punjab Government Revenue Automation Pvt Limited (PGRAL), which never materialised. The inquiry report further notes that the position was initially created for the “Restaurant Invoice Monitoring System (RIMS)”, a project long discontinued, raising questions about the continued necessity of his role. Crucially, the original 2015 advertisement mandated a Master’s degree in Computer Science or IT-related disciplines, whereas Zafar possessed only a BSc in Electrical Engineering, making his recruitment “allegedly doubtful and illegal.” The hiring process was solely interview-based, bypassing competitive examinations. The case was referred to the Services & General Administration Department (S&GAD), which highlighted that most officers, including Zafar, did not meet the age criteria (below 35 years) for regularization. Out of 20 cases reviewed, only seven officers qualified. Deputy Secretary (Regulations) S&GAD and Deputy Secretary (SR) Finance Department emphasised that Rule 19 lacks age relaxation provisions, making regularisation legally untenable for most candidates. The committee recommended amending the rules to address this gap.  Member (Support Services) PRA pointed out that while PRA rules mandate initial appointments through the Punjab Public Service Commission (PPSC), Rule 19 is silent on regularisation procedures for contract hires, creating transparency concerns.
When approached for comments, the PRA spokesperson said the Director (IT) post was created in 2014 via a Summary of New Expenditure (SNE), approved by the chief minister, and was not project-based. The position was advertised in 2015, and a transparent selection committee-comprising PRA chairperson, members, S&GAD, Finance Department, Lums, and PITB representatives-selected Zafar after rigorous scrutiny. The spokesperson asserted that the matter had been reviewed by multiple forums, including the PRA Board, SDAC and Finance Department, and was “settled at each forum.” The HR and Admin wings, which do not report to Zafar, operate under the Additional Commissioner Headquarters (ADC HQ). Despite these claims, concerns persist over qualification discrepancies, project relevance, and regulatory loopholes, casting a shadow over the push for Zafar’s regularisation.

Phase-I of K-IV project to complete in June 2026: Wapda chairman,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316673-phase-i-of-k-iv-project-to-complete-in-june-2026-wapda-chairman,"LAHORE: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) has succeeded in achieving a number of key targets on Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme (K-IV project).
WAPDA Chairman Engr. Lt-Gen (retd) Sajjad Ghani said on Thursday concerted efforts were being made to complete phase-I of the project in June 2026.
However, prompt availability of the required funds is the key for completion of the project as per the schedule, he said during his visit to the project site.
He had a detailed visit of various work fronts to review construction progress. The work fronts included intake and pumping stations at Keenjhar Lake and water conveyance system comprising pressurised pipelines being laid from Keenjhar Lake to Karachi.
The project team, along with consultants and contractors, briefed the chairman about progress on all eight contracts including intake, pumping stations, pipelines, water reservoirs and filtration facilities.
Two critical activities i.e. inserting two water carrier pipelines in sleeve pipes at main railways crossing and hydrostatic testing on the first 15-km of the pipeline have recently been completed, while the second hydrostatic testing for another 25-km single pipeline would be carried out in June. Timelines for the remaining works and plans to achieve the targets as well as financial progress and requirement of funds were also discussed during the briefing.
Cumulative physical progress on the project is 63 per cent. Rs75.21 billion have so far been spent on the project, while PC-I of the project’s phase-I amounts to Rs126.4 billion. Underlining the importance of K-IV project for Karachi, the chairman directed the project team to speed up construction activities to meet the timelines. He also directed them to maintain close liaison with other stakeholders for timely arrangement of power supply by the Sindh government and augmentation of the water distribution system by Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC).
The K-IV project envisages to provide 650 million gallon per day (MGD) water to Karachi from Keenjhar Lake. The project is planned to be completed in two phases. At present, Wapda is constructing phase-I to supply 260 MGD water to Karachi. Phase-II, when implemented, will also augment another 390 MGD water to the system for Karachi.

Speaking exclusively to Geo News, lead actors Sonia Hussyn, Faisal Qureshi, and veteran artist Samina Peerzada described Deemak as a unique cinematic experience that blends modern technology, suspenseful storytelling, and full-fledged entertainment.
“The film is truly ‘paisa wasool’ for audiences of all ages,” they shared.

Opposition walks out of Balochistan PA over Centre’s decision to abolish Levies force in province,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316677-opposition-walks-out-of-balochistan-pa-over-centre-s-decision-to-abolish-levies-force-in-province,"QUETTA: The opposition staged a walkout from the Balochistan Assembly on Thursday in protest against the federal government’s decision to abolish the Levies force in the province, based on a letter from a former MNA from ex-Fata.
The session, chaired by Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola, began after a delay of one hour and fifteen minutes.
Opposition Leader Younis Aziz Zehri raised the issue on a point of order, expressing serious concern that a former MNA from Fata had written to the prime minister, who then reportedly directed the Chief Secretary to disband the Levies force. “Our resolutions and letters are ignored, yet a letter from Fata gets immediate action,” Zehri said.
National Party MPA Rehmat Saleh Baloch questioned the federal government’s interference, asking who the former Fata MNA was to decide the fate of Balochistan’s Levies force.
Jamaat-e-Islami’s Maulana Hidayat ur Rehman Baloch said decisions about Balochistan’s future were being made by individuals from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and urged all provincial lawmakers to register their protest with the prime minister.
JUI-F’s Zabid Ali Reki also criticised the federal government, asking what the federation had ever given to Balochistan.
Following these remarks, opposition members walked out of the session.
Provincial Minister for Public Health Engineering, Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran, responded by saying that the provincial government was making its own decisions. He stated that letters are commonly received and merely noted with remarks. He clarified that the decision to convert the Levies into police in three districts was made by the Chief Minister of Balochistan.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti commented that with the arrival of June, the opposition often resorts to walkouts.
In the absence of the opposition, Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola postponed several motions and notices. These included a resolution by JUI-F’s Fazal Qadir Mandokhail to upgrade the RHC in Qamar Din Karez to a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital; a proposal by National Party’s Rehmat Saleh Baloch to create new teaching posts for mother tongue education in schools; a resolution by Jamaat-e-Islami’s Hidayat ur Rehman Baloch seeking equal job opportunities for madrassa students; and various notices regarding land allotments and the stalled extension work from Sabzal Road to Airport Road via Killi Gul Muhammad. The session was adjourned until 10am on May 31.

Child dies as thunderstorm wreaks havoc,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316678-child-dies-as-thunderstorm-wreaks-havoc,"LAHORE: A powerful storm accompanied by torrential rains and lightning wreaked havoc across parts of Punjab on Thursday, leaving one child dead and eight others injured in multiple incidents.
In Bahadur village, Attock, a child lost life after a lightning bolt struck the area. The same strike also left five other children with burn injuries. Locals reported that the children were playing outdoors when lightning struck. Emergency responders rushed to the scene and shifted the injured to hospital.
Elsewhere in Attock, a girl sustained injuries when a wall collapsed in village Jasian, bringing more focus to the vulnerability of rural infrastructure during extreme weather events.
In Rawalpindi, panic gripped residents of Faisal Town Phase 2 as lightning struck the area, sending two people into shock. Both were promptly attended to by medical teams and transported to hospital. Rescue 1122 teams responded swiftly to all affected areas, ensuring that the injured receive immediate care. Officials have urged citizens to remain indoors during storms and avoid open fields or under-construction structures.

"Senate panel reviews Internet voting, electoral reforms",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316683-senate-panel-reviews-internet-voting-electoral-reforms,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs held a substantive session at the Parliament House on Thursday, focusing on key electoral reforms including the feasibility of internet voting and expanding voting rights for overseas Pakistanis.
Members underscored the importance of maintaining accessibility, security, and electoral integrity in any new voting mechanisms.
Chaired by Senator Dr Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, the meeting brought together lawmakers to deliberate on advancing transparency and inclusivity in Pakistan’s electoral system.
The committee had initially scheduled a briefing from the Pattan Development Organisation, a civil society group known for its work on electoral issues. However, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs informed the committee at the last minute that Pattan’s registration had been cancelled, thereby preventing an official invitation.
Despite the absence of the scheduled presentation, the committee proceeded with a productive internal discussion. Lawmakers debated the strengths and limitations of the current first-past-the-post (FPTP) electoral system, and explored a potential shift to proportional representation as a more equitable alternative.
A major point of discussion was the introduction of internet voting for overseas Pakistanis. Members considered both the opportunities and risks, particularly focusing on ensuring data security, accessibility for remote voters, and the credibility of the voting process.
The session was attended by Senators Mohsin Aziz, Khalil Tahir, Khalida Ateeb, Pervaiz Rasheed, and Kamran Murtaza. Senior officials from the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs were also present to provide input and facilitate the committee’s deliberations.
The committee is expected to continue its review of electoral reforms in upcoming sessions, potentially inviting expert input from civil society organisations and technology stakeholders once regulatory clarifications are addressed.

27th anniversary of Pakistan’s sixth nuclear test in Kharan today,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316687-27th-anniversary-of-pakistan-s-sixth-nuclear-test-in-kharan-today,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan commemorates the 27th anniversary of its sixth nuclear test, conducted in 1998 in the remote desert of Kharan. This test, carried out just two days after the five nuclear detonations in Chagai on May 28, was a strategic move to match and exceed India’s nuclear posturing and firmly establish Pakistan as the first nuclear power in the Muslim world.
According to global seismic monitoring centers, the Kharan detonation registered as the equivalent of two powerful nuclear explosions. In an exclusive discussion with Jang Group, Dr Samar Mubarakmand, head of the team behind the tests, revealed key insights into the planning, execution, and impact of this historic event.
The sixth nuclear test was more than just a continuation—it marked a turning point. The compact nuclear device tested in Kharan, now the warhead for Pakistan’s Shaheen-I missile, generated shockwaves felt in the Karakoram mountains within milliseconds. Some international analysts initially interpreted the seismic data as two simultaneous explosions.
Pakistan’s nuclear display was a monumental feat of scientific precision, ethics, and national discipline. Unlike India’s questionable and exaggerated Pokhran tests, Pakistan demonstrated credible and verifiable capability under the leadership of scientists like Dr. Samar Mubarakmand. Despite speculation about a second seismic wave at Kharan, Dr. Mubarakmand clarified it was a natural result of the shockwave from a single successful detonation.
With the successful completion of the sixth test, Pakistan emerged not just as a peer, but a superior nuclear power relative to India. The test altered the strategic landscape of South Asia and continues to influence the balance of power in the region.
In a detailed interview, senior journalist Hanif Khalid and Dr Mubarakmand delved into the legacy of the nuclear program—from its inception after the 1971 debacle to the triumphant tests of May 1998, and its critical role in the 2025 Indo-Pak war. The atomic energy program was launched with the intent of making Pakistan’s defense impregnable, leading to a decades-long journey of research and development.
Dr Mubarakmand recounted that on May 14, 1998, under the leadership of then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, the Defense Committee of the Cabinet approved a series of six nuclear tests in response to India’s five tests on May 11 and 13. While Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan’s team at Kahuta provided the enriched uranium, the technical leadership and test site preparation were overseen by Dr. Mubarakmand, who at the time served as Technical Member of PAEC and DG of the National Development Complex.
The discussion also addressed the events of the *May 2025 conflict*, in which India launched an aerial strike on Pakistan on the night of May 6–7, citing a terror incident at a tourist site in Kashmir. Pakistan responded with fewer than 40 fighter jets against India’s 77, downing six Indian aircraft including Rafales, Su-30s, MiG-29s, and Mirage 2000s. Advanced electronic jamming, missile systems, and airborne radars played a decisive role.
On May 8, India attempted an attack using Israeli drones, but Pakistan’s ground-based electronic defense systems neutralized 95% of them. On May 10, India targeted three Pakistani air bases with BrahMos cruise missiles and other guided weapons. In retaliation, Pakistan launched a massive counterstrike using Fatah-I and Fatah-II missiles right after Fajr prayers, destroying 26 Indian military targets including airbases, installations, terror training camps, and command centers.
In just two hours, Pakistan Air Force dropped more ordnance on India than in the entire 17-day 1965 war. Even India’s S-400 defense systems were overwhelmed. The severity of Pakistan’s response brought the region to the brink of nuclear war. Global observers warned India that Pakistan’s tactical nuclear missile force could deliver an immediate and devastating counterattack. Consequently, India sought U.S. mediation to broker a ceasefire, and the war ended swiftly on the morning of May 10.
Dr Mubarakmand concluded by emphasizing that since 1998, nuclear parity between Pakistan and India has served as a powerful deterrent against full-scale war. He warned that India must accept Pakistan’s reality as a nuclear power with advanced conventional capabilities. Should India engage in future misadventures or violate the Indus Waters Treaty, Pakistan is capable not only of reclaiming occupied Kashmir but also asserting control over the region’s water resources.

Man acquitted in blasphemy case due to ‘doubtful’ testimony,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316638-man-acquitted-in-blasphemy-case-due-to-doubtful-testimony,"A sessions court has acquitted a man in a blasphemy case, citing ""doubtful"" testimony of the complainant who accused him of making blasphemous remarks last year.
The accused had been arrested by the Ferozabad police on February 6, 2024 for allegedly uttering blasphemous words. Additional Sessions Judge (East) Naseer Noor Khan observed that the prosecution failed to establish its case against the accused beyond the shadow of reasonable doubt.
""It is admitted fact that the derogatory/ blasphemous remarks are neither mentioned in the FIR nor in the challan nor in the evidence of the complainant recorded by this court and complainant himself has frankly admitted that he cannot repeat such derogatory remarks even in evidence,"" he added.
""Here it will not be out [of] place to mention that admittedly except complainant and his wife, none else heard accused allegedly uttering blasphemous remarks."" The judge pointed out that the prosecution also did not produce the complainant's wife to testify against the accused ""for the reasons best known to the prosecution.""
""So in my humble opinion, prosecution has failed to prove the charge against the accused as the complainant did not mention the blasphemous remarks in his FIR nor in his evidence which has created reasonable doubts,"" he added. The judge said a private witness also frankly admitted that he had not heard the exact words uttered by the accused with his own ears.
He highlighted that as per the investigation officer, the investigation into the case was not conducted by a superintendent of police (SP). As per Section 156-A of the Criminal Procedure Code, an offence punishable under Section 295-C (use of derogatory remarks, etc., in respect of the Holy Prophet) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) must be investigated by a police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police, he said.
""Since, in this case, investigation is admittedly not conducted by the Superintendent of Police, as admitted by the IO police inspector Ghulam Murtaza Abbasi, therefore, the case of prosecution is legally not free from reasonable doubt which may arise in a prudent mind.""
The court ordered jail authorities to release the accused forthwith if he was not required in any case. In his statement, the accused, who was represented by Advocate S. M. Zulkufil Haider,  claimed that the complainant gave false testimony against him.
He said the incident began when the complainant, while turning his car, splashed sewage water onto his clothes. When he questioned the complainant about it, the complainant became annoyed, threatened to teach him a lesson, and later at the next roundabout, grabbed him, made false allegations, and had him arrested, he alleged.

"Four kidnappers arrested, victim rescued in North Nazimabad",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316642-four-kidnappers-arrested-victim-rescued-in-north-nazimabad,"Four suspected kidnappers were arrested on the night between Wednesday and Thursday following an exchange of fire with police.

"Sindh, federal govts to jointly tackle Karachi’s maritime challenges",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316643-sindh-federal-govts-to-jointly-tackle-karachi-s-maritime-challenges,"In a move to address Karachi’s pressing maritime and environmental challenges, the Sindh government and the Federal Ministry of Maritime Affairs have pledged to work together on a series of ambitious projects, ranging from sewage treatment to coastal development.
Moreover, the projects include proposed sewage treatment facilities to be upgraded to enhance capacity, KCCDZ to be developed by CRBD for Business Bay, a high-tech park and a new industry city, a cruise terminal, a desalination plant.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar met at the CM House on Thursday, signalling a new era of cooperation aimed at transforming the city’s infrastructure and protecting its coastal resources.
The meeting included provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon and Nasir Shah. On the federal side, Parliamentary Secretary for Maritime Affairs Dr Darshan, Director General Ports & Shipping Alia Shahid, Secretary Board of Investment Dr Arif Iqbal, Chairman Port Qasim Rear Admiral (retd) Moazzam Ilyas, General Manager Karachi Port Trust Atiq Rahman, and other officials were present.
At the outset, CM Shah affirmed Sindh’s commitment to collaborate with the Maritime Ministry on all upcoming projects, emphasising the need for joint efforts to drive the province’s development.
Recognising the dire need to prevent untreated wastewater from polluting the sea, he underscored the importance of rapidly installing sewage treatment plants throughout Karachi. Murad extended a standing offer to collaborate on every project with the federal ministry, ensuring synergy and maximising benefits for the people of Sindh.
Federal Minister Junaid Anwar expressed his confidence that projects undertaken in partnership with the Sindh government would deliver substantial benefits to the province and its residents. Both the federal and provincial governments concurred on the critical importance of working together to promote sustainable coastal development in Karachi.
The CM was briefed on the Karachi Coastal Development Zone and The China Road and Bridge Corporation. The ambitious KCCDZ project is a joint initiative with the federal government through an existing MoU. This project, estimated at $3.1 billion, aims to reclaim land near Machhar Colony for developments, including a Business Bay, a High-Tech Knowledge Park, a New Industry City, a Cruise Terminal, and a Desalination Plant.
The CM said that the proposed project would not affect any human settlement in the area. It is expected to generate significant employment opportunities, with the feasibility study already complete and implementation planned in three phases across 687 acres.
A committee, including provincial minister Syed Nasir Shah, Mayor Murtaza Wahab, and Commissioner Karachi Hasan Naqvi, will address land-related issues between the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and the Sindh government. The Federal Maritime Ministry will soon appoint its representatives to the committee.
CM Shah said the Sindh government is actively installing Treatment Plant-3 (TP-3) in collaboration with the CRBC, alongside plans to establish a desalination plant with a capacity of 50,000 gallons of water daily. The broader Greater Karachi Sewerage Plan (STP-III) is being expedited to tackle the issue of untreated sewage flowing into the sea via the Lyari and Malir rivers.
Upgrades to Treatment Plants TP-1 and TP-2 will increase their capacity to 100MGD and 180MGD, respectively, while a new Treatment Plant (TP-4) with a 180MGD capacity will be constructed in Korangi, specifically treating water from the Malir river basin. An eco-tourism project was also discussed to launch, offering boat tours through Karachi’s mangrove areas.
Relocating the truck stand from the city has been assigned to the committee of the advocate general of Sindh and the commissioner of Karachi. KPT representatives would also be in the committee, and they jointly propose the location for shifting the truck stand and then get approval from the chief minister.

"CCTV cameras, walkthrough gates not functioning in district courts, police inform SHC",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316644-cctv-cameras-walkthrough-gates-not-functioning-in-district-courts-police-inform-shc,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has taken exception to lack of proper infrastructure in district courts and directed its registrar to submit a progress report with regard to infrastructure of district and sessions courts in Karachi.
The observation came during the hearing of a petition seeking a central judicial system in the city and proper infrastructure of the district courts equipped with modern facilities. A division bench of the high court headed by Justice Agha Faisal observed that the City SSP had also filed a report expressing concern over non-functioning CCTV cameras and walkthrough gates in the district courts and proposed steps to resolve these issues.
The police also said that their suggestions should be implemented in the best interest of the lawyers and litigants keeping in view threats after the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.
The SHC observed that focal persons had filed their respective reports with regard to the encroachments in the City Courts, presence of touts and beggars, and parking issues, which should be resolved on a priority basis.
The high court observed that a report with regard to infrastructure facilities in the districts courts in Karachi had not been placed by the registrar office, which had been noted with regret. The bench directed the office to ensure that same be placed prior to the next hearing.
The SHC observed that it needed to examine the reports that had been filed before it issued an appropriate order. The petitioner, Zia Awan, had submitted that issues of non-operational security apparatus and lack of proper infrastructure in the City Courts was alarming and needed to be resolved immediately.
He had submitted in the petition that there were several critical issues within Karachi’s judicial infrastructure, including poorly distributed courts, rampant corruption, slow and ineffective bailiff system, ineffective security systems, lack of fire safety equipment, insufficient restroom facilities and inadequate provisions for differently-abled individuals.
He had requested the high court to direct the authorities concerned to remove encroachments from the court premises, improve sanitation and ensure proper parking arrangements until the central judicial complex was constructed. He had stressed the importance of creating a safe environment for female lawyers and litigants and suggested providing green spaces and facilities to reduce stress and promote mental well-being of the judicial staff.
The petitioner had also pointed out an urgent need for installing modern fire safety systems, including fire extinguishers, alarms and emergency exits, to safeguard lives and minimise potential damage in case of fires.
The petitioner had submitted that unless these issues were resolved on a war footing basis, the dispensation of justice shall be prejudiced as the City Courts were the courts of first instance and primary recourse of the litigants.

"Tobacco use killing 164,000 Pakistanis annually: PIMA",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316645-tobacco-use-killing-164-000-pakistanis-annually-pima,"As Pakistan observes World No Tobacco Day 2025, the Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) and leading health experts have urged the government to strictly enforce anti-tobacco laws, impose higher taxes on tobacco products, and closely regulate the growing use of emerging nicotine products to protect public health and save lives.
In a joint statement issued on Friday, PIMA President Prof Atif Hafeez Siddiqui, Prof Sohail Akhtar and Dr Ahmar Hamid warned that Pakistan is facing a public health emergency due to rising tobacco consumption and weak regulatory enforcement.
Citing World Health Organisation (WHO) figures, they noted that tobacco use claims nearly 164,000 lives annually in the country and results in an economic loss exceeding Rs700 billion.
""The growing burden of non-communicable diseases, including heart disease, cancer, and chronic lung conditions, is directly linked to tobacco use,"" Prof Siddiqui said. ""Unfortunately, poor awareness and weak implementation of tobacco control laws are allowing the industry to thrive.""
The experts emphasized that global evidence supports taxation as the most effective tool to curb tobacco use. They pointed to Pakistan’s own experience, where a hike in cigarette taxes in 2023 led to a 19.2% decline in tobacco use, and 26.3% of smokers reduced consumption. Simultaneously, the government’s revenue from the Federal Excise Duty (FED) on cigarettes rose by 66%, from Rs142 billion to Rs237 billion in just one year.
Beyond conventional tobacco products, PIMA voiced concern over the rising popularity and aggressive marketing of e-cigarettes, nicotine pouches, and heated tobacco products, especially among young people. “It is alarming that 68% of students using nicotine products are now engaged with e-cigarettes,” said Dr Ahmar Hamid, urging immediate regulatory action to halt the trend.
The health professionals called for using tobacco tax revenues to fund sustained public awareness campaigns in local languages. “These campaigns must target youth, parents, and educators, and must be tailored to cultural contexts,” said Prof Sohail Akhtar.
They also demanded that provincial governments establish smoking cessation clinics in all teaching hospitals to help individuals quit tobacco. “We need a structured support system that makes quitting easier and more accessible for the public,” they emphasized.
The experts maintained that without firm and immediate action—including legislative enforcement, taxation, and youth education—the country will continue to suffer the health and economic consequences of unchecked tobacco use.

Fuuast sign MoU to empower students,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316647-fuuast-sign-mou-to-empower-students,"The Skills360 Pakistan, an education and development venture under the umbrella of The Coach360, co-founded by Burhan Mirza, has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology (Fuuast) to strengthen student access to industry-aligned education.
The agreement, signed in the presence of Skills360 Executive Director Kashif Hussain Shah and Director ORIC at Fuuast Dr Hina Akram Mudassir, marks a significant step toward bridging academic learning and professional skills development.
As part of this initiative, Skills360 will reserve 25 seats across multiple courses exclusively for Fuuast students. This is part of a broader effort to make industry-relevant education more accessible to university students. Furthermore, building on its commitment to inclusivity and merit, Skills360 will also provide a 50% scholarship on all its courses for students nominated by the university’s management.
In a promising academic integration, Fuuast may choose to recognize completed Skills360 courses as elective components within its own academic programme. This will be subject to internal academic review and curriculum alignment, reinforcing the university’s commitment to progressive education.
One of the standout aspects of the partnership is the career support integration in the programme. Top performers will have access to internship opportunities through Skills360’s vast network of affiliated industry partners, offering real-world work experience that can significantly enhance post-graduation job prospects.

The event showcased powerful artwork by students from various schools, creatively expressing the theme of a drug-free society.

“This competition not only highlights their artistic abilities but also spreads a vital message — drugs destroy individuals and eventually the fabric of society.” He emphasised the effective role of art in promoting social change and called for recognition of such initiatives across the globe.
“These thought-provoking pieces should be promoted on international platforms. The message of a drug-free and healthy society must reach the masses globally,” he added. Brig Farooq announced that all the participating students would receive certificates of appreciation from the ANF in acknowledgement of their contribution to spreading awareness about narcotics.
He also encouraged teachers and students to participate in the upcoming activities for International Day Against Drug Abuse. “Our youth are the future of Pakistan. I am heartened to see that they are aware, responsible, and ready to play their part in building a drug-free society,” he said.

Governor condemns ‘violence’ against PPP workers in KP,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316569-governor-condemns-violence-against-ppp-workers-in-kp,"LAHORE:Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan strongly condemned the violence against PPP workers during a peaceful protest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He said the provincial government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will pay dearly for its strategy of direct confrontation with the people.
He said that Modi’s historic humiliation and disgrace at international levels will never be forgotten. Everyone, including all political parties of the country, showed full solidarity with the Pakistan Army against India. He expressed these views during a meeting with a delegation from Wah Cantt at the Governor’s House on Thursday.
Punjab governor said that the success of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos against India is the guarantor of a safe Pakistan. He said that India's threat to weaponise water is utterly deplorable and poses a significant threat to regional stability. He said that India will think a hundred times before committing any aggression and provocation against Pakistan again. The governor said that for the integrity and sovereignty of the country all the political parties showed full solidarity with the Pakistan Army.
The governor further said that PPP is gaining popularity not only in Punjab but also across the country. He said that PPP will give a tough time to the rival parties in the upcoming general elections. He said that Bilawal Zardari will become the next Prime Minister of the country with the public mandate.
The delegation included former Vice Chairman Cantonment Board Wah Cantt Ch Arif Mahmood, former President POF Employees Cooperative House Building Wah Cantt Gulzar Ahmed, former Treasurer POF Employees Cooperative House Building Society Wah Cantt Malik Rehmatullah, Site-in-Charge POF Society Wah Cantt Malik Naveed Hassan.

Country’s future linked to family planning,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316570-country-s-future-linked-to-family-planning,"LAHORE:The demographic experts and media professionals demanded the government prioritise the protection and preservation of country’s future potential through child-focused interventions.
These include improving child survival, enhancing cognitive development through nutritional support, ensuring equal educational opportunities, and promoting child-responsive budgeting. ‘A key strategy for achieving these outcomes is enabling parents to plan their families in line with their resources and aspirations—avoiding unwanted, mistimed, and closely spaced pregnancies through enhanced access to family planning services,’ say the participants of a media coalition meeting organised by the Population Council in collaboration with UNFPA.
In his welcome remarks, Dr Ali Mir, Senior Director, Population Council, emphasised the media's indispensable role as shapers of public narrative and combatants of misinformation, stating, ‘Media professionals are today’s frontline defenders in the battle for sustainable development.’
Highlighting the transformative potential of strategic investment, Dr Mir stated, ‘Population planning is fundamentally about ensuring that every child not only survives but thrives. Our planning must begin with child survival and extend to equity, dignity, and opportunity for all,’ adding that ‘Accurate data and strategic investment in people, particularly women and children, are our strongest tools.’ He stated that the moot on Population and Development (ICPD) in 1994, and its reaffirmation at ICPD+25, emphasised the importance of reproductive health through a life-cycle approach that prioritises individual well-being from womb to tomb. Child survival is a critical component of reproductive health.
The meeting discussed Pakistan's severe human capital crisis with data and evidence, presented by Ikram ul Ahad, Deputy Manager, Population Council. The data showed how Pakistan’s future was being compromised through high child mortality and low investment in education. He said according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), approximately 1,350 newborns die every day, which is equivalent to crashing of nearly two passenger planes, but the former rarely makes a news as opposed to the latter. Around 26 million children out of school; chronic malnutrition plagues the young, with 40% of children under five stunted, severely limiting their cognitive potential – Pakistani children achieve only 41% of their potential compared to 78% in the UK. Stark regional disparities compound the crisis: Sindh suffers a 50% stunting rate, Balochistan sees only 22% primary school attendance, and Punjab's under-five mortality reaches 80 per 1,000 live births.
This crisis is fueled by chronic underfunding. Pakistan’s budget allocations for health and education are far below global benchmarks of 6% and 7%, respectively, and lag behind regional neighbours like India and Iran. The participants unequivocally stressed that family planning is a catalyst for progress across all development indicators.

Kazakhstan eager to improve academic ties with Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316571-kazakhstan-eager-to-improve-academic-ties-with-pakistan,"LAHORE:The Ambassador of Kazakhstan to Pakistan, Mr Yerzhan Kistafin, visited the University of Health Sciences (UHS) here on Thursday, accompanied by Dr Anar Turmukhambetova, Board Chairman and Rector of Astana Medical University, along with embassy officials Daniyar Altayev and Rana Irfan Haider.
During the visit, the Kazakh delegation met with UHS Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Ahsan Waheed Rathore, Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Nadia Naseem, Registrar Ms Kiran Fatima and senior faculty heads to discuss possibilities of academic cooperation between medical universities of both nations.
Ambassador Kistafin highlighted that over 1,000 Pakistani students are currently enrolled in universities across Kazakhstan, a majority of whom are studying medicine. ‘Kazakhstan is eager to deepen its academic ties with Pakistan in the field of medical sciences,’ he stated, proposing the establishment of a Kazakhstan-Pakistan Joint Medical Centre as a landmark initiative. He emphasised the importance of further strengthening bilateral relations, expressing optimism that several collaborative agreements will be signed during the upcoming visit of the President of Kazakhstan to Pakistan later this year. Dr Anar Turmukhambetova commended the intellect and dedication of Pakistani students studying in Kazakhstan. ‘Our medical education system closely aligns with Pakistan’s, which opens up vast opportunities for academic exchange and joint research,’ she noted. She proposed launching joint degree programmes in medicine and applied sciences and suggested the formation of a joint working group to facilitate structured cooperation.
Dr Turmukhambetova also shared that Astana Medical University has recently introduced a military medicine programme, marking a new frontier in teaching and research. Welcoming the delegation, Prof Dr Ahsan Waheed Rathore assured that Pakistani institutions are open to hosting Kazakh faculty and students. ‘International collaboration not only enhances academic quality but also provides our students and faculty with opportunities for advanced training and research improving overall ranking of our institutions,’ he said.
Meanwhile, the delegation from Kazakhstan visited Punjab University and called on VC Prof Dr M Ali on Thursday. The Kazakh team was led by its Ambassador in Pakistan Yerzhan Kistafin. Chairperson of Board/Rector of Astana Medical University, Kazakhstan Anar Akylbekovna also accompanied the delegation.
During the visit, the both sides discussed potential collaborations in student and faculty exchange programmes and explored collaborative research opportunities. Mrs Anar proposed to establish joint collaborations with leading universities in Kazakhstan in all fields, especially in the field of health sciences.

Anti-polio drive enters final phase in Punjab,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316572-anti-polio-drive-enters-final-phase-in-punjab,"LAHORE: The third national polio immunisation campaign of the year, deemed critical for interrupting the ongoing poliovirus transmission, has entered its final phase in Punjab.
As of Thursday, polio teams visited house-to-house during the designated catch-up days to reach children who were missed in earlier days of vaccination. In major urban centres and high-risk districts classified as ‘mega districts,’ the campaign will continue for a full seven days, concluding on Sunday.
In other districts across the province, the drive will run for five days and end today (Friday). This campaign is especially significant given the onset of the high poliovirus transmission season, which typically lasts from May through September, coinciding with hot and humid conditions that are conducive to virus survival and spread.
The timing of the campaign is also strategic, preceding the Eid holidays—a period marked by extensive human mobility. This increased movement raises the risk of virus transmission from one region to another, particularly affecting unvaccinated or immunocompromised children. These children are at heightened risk of contracting and spreading the virus, potentially undermining the gains made in previous immunisation rounds.
In the first three days alone, frontline polio workers successfully vaccinated over 15 million children under the age of five. The Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Coordinator, Adeel Tasawar, urged teams to intensify efforts during the catch-up days, emphasising the importance of revisiting homes where children were missed. ‘Achieving high coverage is key to boosting herd immunity,’ he stated, ‘ensuring the poliovirus has no sanctuary in our communities.’ EOC Coordinator called on caregivers and parents to cooperate with polio teams and report any missed children or related issues by contacting the national helpline at 1166. He praised polio workers as national heroes, recognising their tireless efforts to go door-to-door with the sole mission of eradicating polio from Pakistan.
‘They deserve respect, support, and a glass of water if needed,’ he added, encouraging the public to honour their dedication. He also lauded the vital role of civil society, which has provided extensive moral support to polio workers, particularly in areas with difficult terrain or security challenges. He reaffirmed the government’s unwavering commitment to achieving a polio-free Pakistan.

Speaker praises Pak media for showing responsibility during war days,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316576-speaker-praises-pak-media-for-showing-responsibility-during-war-days,"LAHORE:Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Ahmad Khan said that Pakistan Army gave a strong response to Indian aggression and that Pakistani media showed exceptional responsibility during the war-like situation. During those critical days, the entire nation was united. Even those political parties that previously avoided dialogue stood behind the government and military when the country’s survival was at stake.
He expressed these views while addressing a ceremony held at the Lahore Press Club on Thursday on the theme of ‘Defence of the Nation and the Role of Media,’ organised by the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), the Lahore Press Club, and the Punjab Assembly Press Gallery Committee.
While addressing the ceremony, PA Speaker stated that the entire nation paid tribute to the scientists, the armed forces, and former PM Nawaz Sharif on the occasion of Youm-e-Takbeer. He also mentioned that the Punjab Assembly unanimously passed a resolution to grant the title of Field Marshal to Army Chief General Asim Munir.
He said incident of May 9 was not merely protests but direct attacks on national institutions. Twenty-nine military cantonments were targeted, and even my own residence was set on fire. Such actions are intolerable, and no compromise will be made on the sanctity of national institutions. He emphasised that economic stability is not possible without political stability.
In conclusion, Malik Ahmad Khan reiterated that when it came to revealing the truth, the role played by Pakistani media will always be remembered in history. The event was attended by President of the Lahore Press Club Arshad Ansari, President of PFUJ Naeem Hanif, President of the Punjab Assembly Press Gallery Khawaja Nasir, General Secretary of PFUJ Qamar ur Zaman Bhatti and other senior journalists.

"UK, Punjab to jointly work on climate change, farmers’ support",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316577-uk-punjab-to-jointly-work-on-climate-change-farmers-support,"LAHORE:Punjab Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Syed Ashiq Hussain Kirmani met with the Mr Ben Warrington, the Head of Lahore Office, British High Commission.
In the meeting, it was agreed to work bilaterally on farmer's support model, challenges of climate change, university linkages, breed improvement and FMD control programmes in the Agriculture and Livestock sectors. Secretary Agriculture Punjab Iftikhar Ali Sahoo was also present on the occasion.
The minister stated that Punjab values the financial assistance and support of the UK in the agriculture sector and we want to benefit from the experiences of the UK in the livestock sector.
He emphasised that the Transforming Punjab Agriculture Programme was being implemented with a huge amount of Rs400 billion. The government is working on mechanisation, high efficiency irrigation system, provision of quality seeds and establishment of research centres in the agricultural sector on a priority basis so that the production cost of crops can be reduced and the production per acre can be increased. To effectively control the issue of smog, the government has provided 5,000 super seeders to farmers on subsidy. The government is establishing four agriculture malls in Punjab to provide rental services of modern agricultural machinery, where all the machinery will be available on rent at subsidised rates. A loan programme is being launched for high-tech mechanisation for farmers and service providers.
According to the vision of the CM, the Punjab government is going to launch the Breed Improvement (Milk-Breed, Meat-Breed) programme in the livestock sector for the first time in 10 districts of the province. Semens of high-quality animals will also be provided in the market at discounted rates. He endorsed that for effective control of FMD, two zones and five compartments were going to be established in the budget of the next financial year, which will completely change the status of FMD.
Mr Ben Warrington appreciated the progress made in the agriculture sector under the reform agenda in Punjab. We are well aware of the problems of Punjab farmers and are serious about solving them, he explained.

FAPUASA condemns abolition of allowances in Balochistan Varsity,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316585-fapuasa-condemns-abolition-of-allowances-in-balochistan-varsity,"Islamabad:FAPUASA has strongly condemned the notification issued by the Government of Balochistan last week through Colleges, Higher & Technical Education Department abolishing numerous critical allowances for employees of all public sector universities in the province and introducing a new, insufficient “Public Sector Undertaking (PSU) Allowance.”
It said the notification is not only a severe blow to the financial rights of university employees but also undermines the stability and quality of higher education in Balochistan. The withdrawal of allowances such as Utility, House Requisition, Hardship, Orderly, Special, and Technical Subject Allowance has pushed employees, particularly those in junior position, to financial distress.
The newly introduced PSU allowance poses several concerns as it is limited to only 25% of the basic salary in Quetta and 35% in other cities, significantly less than the combined previous allowances. It excludes contractual and ad-hoc staff, exacerbating financial inequality. It will not be part of pension or gratuity calculations, endangering post-retirement financial security.
Furthermore, the directive for universities to generate their own finances with reduced reliance on government grants is unrealistic and detrimental, especially given the already fragile financial condition of universities in Balochistan. FAPUASA has demanded an immediate withdrawal of this notification and urged all faculty members, employees, unions and staff associations to stand united and engage in dialogue with the government.

"Pakistan, ADB eye carbon markets as next frontier for green growth",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316588-pakistan-adb-eye-carbon-markets-as-next-frontier-for-green-growth,"Islamabad: Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Dr Musadik Malik met with a high-level delegation of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-led by Senior Director of Climate Change and Sustainable Development Toru Kubo to explore collaborative opportunities in carbon markets and forge the path for a new climate strategy grounded in economic and environmental synergy.
The meeting marked a significant step forward in aligning Pakistan’s national climate strategy with international best practices and market-driven climate finance solutions. Both sides agreed to formulate a comprehensive, mutually aligned climate change strategy, with a specific focus on carbon credit mobilisation, climate innovation, and outcomes-based project implementation.

NCSW affirms support for ICT Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316590-ncsw-affirms-support-for-ict-child-marriage-restraint-amendment-act,"Islamabad:The National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) has taken note of the recent remarks made by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) regarding the passage of the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), which establishes the minimum legal age of marriage for both boys and girls at 18 years. The Commission has also affirmed its support for this legislative reform as a crucial step toward upholding the rights of children, particularly girls, and aligning national laws with constitutional mandates and international human rights commitments.
The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) has declared the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s ‘Prohibition of Child Marriage Bill 2025’ and the National Assembly’s ‘Prohibition of Child Marriage Bill’ as un-Islamic. The council stated that setting an age limit, declaring marriage below 18 as rape, and imposing penalties on it, do not conform with Islamic rulings. However, the council emphasized discouraging child marriages and rejected the bill.
In a statement issued by NCSW on Thursday, the Commission stated that the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act is based not only on extensive consultations with legal experts, civil society organizations, healthcare professionals, youth, religious scholars, and members of the CII, but also on the broader legal principle that marriage, being a legally binding contract, must adhere to the same foundational requirements as other civil contracts in Pakistan.
It mentions that under existing Pakistani law, individuals must be at least 18 years of age to obtain a Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC), vote in national and provincial elections, and acquire a driving license, “Each of these rights and responsibilities is conferred at 18 in recognition of an individual’s legal and mental capacity to make informed decisions. If the law deems a person under 18 incapable of voting and driving due to presumed legal and developmental immaturity, it follows logically and legally that such individuals should not be permitted to enter a far more consequential contract — marriage — which carries lifelong implications for personal, social, and reproductive health,” says the statement.
It further says that the recent judgment of the Lahore High Court titled Azka Wahid Versus Province of Punjab & others 2024 LHC 1392, which upheld the age of 18 years as the minimum age of marriage for both boys and girls under the Child Marriage Restraint Act, further reinforces the legal and constitutional standing of this amendment. “The Commission has been working diligently, in consultation with a broad spectrum of stakeholders, toward the standardization of the marriageable age across Pakistan — a commitment grounded in constitutional protections, international obligations, and evidence-based concerns around the health, well-being, and empowerment of girls. In pursuit of this objective, the NCSW organized countrywide consultations with legal experts, civil society organizations, health professionals, youth representatives, religious scholars, and members of the CII itself. These discussions involved informed, respectful dialogue on the far-reaching implications of child marriage, particularly the severe health risks and complications faced by young girls as a result of early pregnancies. In several such engagements, members of religious institutions and clerics extended their understanding and support for the proposed legal reforms.”
NCSW emphasized that the amendment is consistent with both Islamic teachings that prioritize protection, dignity, and maturity in contractual obligations, and with Pakistan’s constitutional duties under Article 25 (equality before law) and Article 35 (protection of the family, mother, and child). The Commission’s statement said that this reform is neither in conflict with Islamic principles nor a foreign imposition.
Rather, it is a measure grounded in Pakistan’s own constitutional commitments to safeguard the rights of children, uphold gender equality, and protect public health. In light of these considerations, the Commission urged all stakeholders, including religious and legal institutions, to support efforts aimed at ensuring a safe, healthy, and empowered future for all children in Pakistan.

Meeting shapes plan for Pakistan’s food security,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316593-meeting-shapes-plan-for-pakistan-s-food-security,"Islamabad: A high-level national consultative session on 'Priorities and Pathways: Developing a National Food Security and Nutrition Research Agenda for Pakistan' concluded at the UAF with leading academic, government, and development voices co-creating a research agenda based on equity, resilience, and evidence, says a press release.
The two-day event, co-convened by the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), the National Institute of Food Science and Technology (NIFSAT), and the Pak-Korea Nutrition Centre (PKNC), gave rise to a powerful conversation on the food future of Pakistan.
The consultative session was inaugurated with enthusiasm by Professor Dr. Imran Pasha, Director General of NIFSAT, who welcomed the stakeholders and emphasised the great need for academic research in the challenges faced by food systems.
Farrah Naz, country director, GAIN said, ""This dialogue is not about isolated initiatives. It's about shaping a collective response to dietary inequity, malnutrition, and food safety. The time to move from pilots to policy is now.""
Beginning his address, Faiz Rasool, Head of Policy & Advocacy at GAIN, emphasised, ""We're not starting from scratch-we're starting from strength. But we must now align our strengths into a coherent, actionable research agenda. This is not just a technical document, it's a social contract with every citizen of Pakistan who deserves safe, nutritious, and affordable food.""
The participants appraised thematic discussions in-depth across six thematic areas: non-communicable diseases, diets and food environments, food safety, post-harvest losses, climate resilience, and governance, with each group producing actionable priorities ranging from taxing unhealthy food products and introducing AI tools for nutrition surveillance to strengthening food safety legislation and encouraging climate-resilient agriculture.
Offering his reflections on the state of food systems, Prof. Dr. Zulfiqar Ali, Vice Chancellor of University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) and distinguished wheat breeder, publicly emphasised the evolution following World War II: ""We overcame famine but at the cost of food quality. The hidden costs of our food systems now exceed 13 trillion dollars globally. Food systems transformation is no longer optional-it's urgent. And this agenda belongs not just to agriculture, but to all of government and society.""

Experts call for increase in tobacco taxation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316594-experts-call-for-increase-in-tobacco-taxation,"Islamabad:Public health experts, parliamentarians, and civil society leaders have called for urgent and substantial increases in tobacco taxation and stricter enforcement of tobacco control laws to address the alarming rise in nicotine consumption, especially among Pakistan’s youth. The appeal came during a high-level policy dialogue on tobacco control held on Thursday.
Presenting compelling data, Asif Iqbal, Managing Director of the Social Policy and Development Centre (SPDC), underscored that the freeze on Federal Excise Duty (FED) since February 2023, coupled with relatively low inflation, has made cigarettes increasingly affordable. He warned that if corrective tax measures are not implemented in the upcoming fiscal year, over 490,000 young people are likely to initiate smoking. “A significant tax hike would not only curb tobacco consumption but also generate much-needed revenue for public health,” Iqbal stressed.
Zaheer Qureshi, Director of the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) Track and Trace System, provided insights into FBR’s efforts to combat illicit trade through digital monitoring. He noted that products like tobacco, sugar, and cement are now tracked electronically across the supply chain to enhance transparency and revenue collection.
Dr. Arsalan Haider, Director of the Tobacco Control Cell at the Ministry of National Health Services, shared the mandate of TCC terming it as a comprehensive, self-guiding framework aimed at supporting Pakistan’s commitments under the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC).
Speaking on this occasion, MNA Saher Kamran highlighted the critical role of educational institutions in safeguarding youth. From the provincial legislature, Punjab MPA Tahira Mushtaq spoke about her successful resolution in the Punjab Assembly, advocating for a provincial tobacco levy and legal measures to regulate emerging products like vapes and e-cigarettes.
Echoing similar concerns, MNA Sabeen Ghauri emphasized the need to plug legislative gaps and modernize Pakistan’s tobacco control laws. “Despite having two federal laws, we face serious enforcement challenges. We are committed to amending existing laws and introducing new ones to cover all nicotine products including vapes and nicotine gums,” she affirmed. Ghauri also expressed optimism about increased tobacco taxes in the upcoming federal budget. MNA Dr. Shazia Sobia and MNA Naeema Kishwar Khan also supported tax increase on tabacco.

"‘Climate change is not tomorrow’s threat, it is today’s crisis’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316595-climate-change-is-not-tomorrow-s-threat-it-is-today-s-crisis,"Islamabad:Dr Nadeem Javaid, Vice-Chancellor, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), has said that climate change is not tomorrow’s threat — it is today’s crisis.
Dr Javaid was giving remarks at the unveiling ceremony here of Asian Infrastructure Finance 2025 Report under the theme “Infrastructure for Planetary Health” by Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
Dr Javaid said the 2022 floods were a national catastrophe with $32 billion losses, two decades of development washed away and over six million pushed into poverty. He emphasised that environmental degradation, inadequate water storage, and climate-vulnerable agriculture are compounding risks that must be addressed through collective action and long-term planning.
Federal Minister for Planning, Development & Special Initiatives, Ahsan Iqbal, said that we must build infrastructure that does not just deliver growth but ensures survival. He outlined the government’s bold steps under the 5Es framework, including the deployment of zero-emission electric buses, restoration of flood-prone riverbanks and climate-proofing healthcare facilities.
Calling for a paradigm shift, he underscored that at Planning Commission no project is now cleared unless it fully incorporates climate resilience, environmental sustainability, and updated building codes. This is our new standard,” he stated. The cost of inaction whether through lives lost, health crises or economic setbacks is far greater than the investment required for green, future-proof solutions.
To close the climate finance gap, Mr Iqbal advocated the use of green bonds, resilience bonds, and public-private partnerships, stressing the importance of mobilising both domestic and international capital.

Skills varsity sets up endowment fund,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316598-skills-varsity-sets-up-endowment-fund,"Islamabad:The public sector National Skills University (NSU), set up to focus solely on technical and vocational training, has established the Skills Fellow Endowment Fund.
Launched with seed money from a government organisation donation, the fund is not merely a financial mechanism; it is a statement of intent, a promise to Pakistan’s youth that no talent will be left behind due to economic hardship or physical limitations.
The most recent contribution of Rs100,000, donated by Dr. Kamran Jahangir, Managing Director of the National Book Foundation, reminds us how institutions can come together in meaningful solidarity. His support is more than just money; it brings hope, visibility, and validation to a fund that aims to transform lives.
Officials said what makes this initiative deeply impactful is its inclusiveness. According to them, the Skills Fellow Endowment Fund specifically prioritises deserving students, especially those physically challenged and differently abled, offering them scholarships, fellowships, and financial assistance for skill-based short courses. This model doesn’t simply provide aid; it offers opportunities.
""The NBF and other donations towards the Skills Fellow Endowment Fund are particularly significant because this initiative is specifically designed to uplift underprivileged and differently abled students through merit-cum-need based scholarships and fellowships. Often left on the margins of mainstream academic systems, these students now have a bridge to dignity, independence, and productivity,"" an official said.

ANP leader slams bid to politicise land dispute,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316615-anp-leader-slams-bid-to-politicise-land-dispute,"CHARSADDA: The local leadership of the Awami National Party (ANP) on Thursday said the land dispute over which two persons were killed in the Janabad area of Charsadda must not be politicized.
“ANP President Aimal Wali Khan had made sincere efforts over the past three months to resolve the issue through traditional jirga mediation. His statement is on record that this is a personal land dispute between two parties and should not be given political colour,” ANP district president and former MPA Shakeel Khan Umarzai told a press conference here.
Shakeel Bashir revealed that their family had legally purchased 80 kanals of land from Nadia Gulzar, sister of PTI MNA Shandana Gulzar. The land had originally been given to Nadia as mehr by her former husband, Adam Khan.
He further alleged that despite the purchase, Adam Khan refused to hand over possession of the land. “When we went to claim our rightful property, Adam Khan and his associates opened fire, killing two of our close men,” Shakeel Bashir stated.
Responding to accusations made earlier by Adam Khan, who claimed that Aimal Wali Khan was politically interfering in the matter, Shakeel Bashir strongly refuted the allegations, calling them false and baseless. He emphasised that Aimal Wali had remained neutral and tried to mediate peace.
Shakeel Bashir also accused local PTI MNA Fazal Muhammad Khan and Commissioner Peshawar Division Riaz Mehsud of influencing the administration unfairly. “Despite being the victims, an FIR was registered against us before we could even file a complaint,” he claimed.Afzal Bashir added that a settlement had nearly been reached through jirga negotiations, but Adam Khan’s side later backed out of the agreement.

PPP leader blasts KP govt for alleged corruption,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316618-ppp-leader-blasts-kp-govt-for-alleged-corruption,"PARACHINAR:  Former federal minister and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) provincial vice-president Sajid Hussain Turi has criticised the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government for widespread corruption and negligence toward the merged tribal districts.
Addressing a press conference at the press club here alongside PPP workers, Sajid Turi said that development projects were virtually non-existent in tribal areas and accused the rulers of depriving underprivileged communities of their share in NFC funds and other developmental schemes.
He pointed to several major scams, including the Kohistan and the solarization scandals, as examples of deep-rooted corruption that has left ordinary citizens suffering in difficult conditions.
About the  dire security situation in District Kurram, he said that the area has remained under siege for the past eight months due to unrest. He noted that although both parties involved in the conflict had demolished bunkers following the Chief Minister’s orders and voluntarily surrendered their weapons, roads remained blocked, and residents were still living in fear and uncertainty.
“People are stranded for hours and days due to closed routes. This is a mental torture for the residents of Kurram,” he added.He also criticised the blocking of passports of people seeking employment abroad, calling it a blow to already high unemployment rates in the region. Turi expressed concern that those who returned to Pakistan temporarily were now unable to go back to their workplaces abroad due to passport restrictions.Turi demanded the reopening of main highways in the region for regular public movement instead of limited convoys.

"Saif links national development with reproductive health, population quality",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316619-saif-links-national-development-with-reproductive-health-population-quality,"PESHAWAR: Advisor to Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said on Thursday that reproductive health was not merely a health issue but a cornerstone of sustainable national development.
“The quality of a population rather than its size alone determines the trajectory of a nation’s progress,” he remarked while addressing a workshop on Peshawar media coalition on reproductive health.
The CM aide said that under Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had launched key maternal health initiatives, including nutrition support for expectant mothers, the ‘Nourish Maa’ campaign to improve maternal nutrition, and extensive training programmes for healthcare providers.
The integrated health project, he said, had unified various health services for better delivery, adding that the efforts were aimed at reducing maternal mortality and improving healthcare access across the province.
He revealed that during his tenure as prime minister, PTI founder Imran Khan had launched major initiatives to improve maternal health in Pakistan. The Sehat Sahulat Programme provided free health insurance covering maternity care for millions. He initiated the construction of mother and child hospitals, a 200-bed facility in Attock.
Through the Ehsaas Programme, he said maternal nutrition was prioritised with supplements and awareness drives. Additionally, micro health insurance under Kamyab Pakistan offered free services to millions, including maternal care. These efforts, he added, had significantly enhanced access to quality maternal health services nationwide.
“Reproductive health and family planning are fundamental elements in shaping a productive and healthy society. A well-facilitated and health-conscious population is a prerequisite for national development,” Barrister Saif remarked.
He pointed out that the persistent gap between policy and its implementation is one of Pakistan’s critical challenges. While acknowledging the existence of policy frameworks at national level, Dr. Saif noted that real progress requires reducing the gap between policy formulation and its implementation.
Barrister Saif urged the media to play its role as a responsible partner in development, using its platforms to raise awareness, counter misinformation and advocate for evidence-based health initiatives.
“The pen in your hands can shape the discourse, dispel myths and push the state toward meaningful reform,” he said.“A developed nation is not one that merely drafts sound policies, but one that ensures their timely and equitable execution. We must shift from reactive to proactive governance if we are to truly address our social challenges,” he asserted.
Highlighting the cultural and social dimensions of reproductive health, Barrister Saif clarified that past efforts relied too heavily on top-down, externally driven approaches without adequately engaging local communities, religious scholars and relevant stakeholders. He stressed that sociocultural dynamics must be respected and integrated into public health strategies.
“There is a critical difference between religion and religiosity,” he said. “The failure has often been in confronting religious apprehensions instead of constructively engaging religious scholars, community elders and opinion leaders. Without this engagement, even the most well-funded programmes will fail to reach hearts and minds.”
He also underscored the need for building “acceptable social awareness” around reproductive health. He said that campaigns must be designed in ways that align with local customs, values and religious sensitivities.

Power woes hit Cantt,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316628-power-woes-hit-cantt,"PESHAWAR: Residents of Peshawar Cantonment - once considered the city’s most load-shedding-free area - have been enduring daily power outages lasting five to six hours for the fourth consecutive day, raising concerns about the worsening electricity situation even in high-priority localities.
Locals expressed frustration over the prolonged and unpredictable outages, noting that if such severe load-shedding is occurring in Cantt, conditions in other parts of the city are likely far worse.
“If this is the condition in Cantt, what hope do people in other areas have?” said Naeem Khan, a resident.Residents also noted that electricity often disappears the moment clouds gather.
“When the sky turns cloudy, the power goes out. If it rains or the wind picks up, you can’t expect electricity to return for hours,” another resident complained.The outages have severely disrupted daily life, especially as temperatures continue to rise.
Several households with elderly or sick family members reported facing extreme difficulty, struggling without fans or cooling systems during peak heat hours.“In this hot weather, it becomes unbearable, especially when you have unwell people at home,” a local added.
Zeeshan Khan, Sub-Divisional Officer of Peshawar Cantt, attributed the extended outages to major damage to the area’s power cables. He assured that repair work was underway and that efforts were being made to restore an uninterrupted power supply as soon as possible.

Govt urged to grant industry status to tourism sector,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316629-govt-urged-to-grant-industry-status-to-tourism-sector,"MINGORA: The Swat Hotel Association has called on the federal government to formally recognise the tourism sector in Swat as an industry.
Speaking at a press conference held at the Swat Press Club, the association president, Zahid Khan and other office-bearers, including Javed Ali Shah, Sarwar Khan and Taj Khan, emphasized the urgent need for institutional support to strengthen tourism and the local economy.
“Swat is one of the most beautiful tourist destinations in the country, which attracts millions of local and international visitors each year,” said Zahid Khan. “Despite this, the hospitality sector is facing serious challenges due to the government’s lack of attention,” he added.The association demanded that hotel businesses be granted the status of industry to ensure they receive necessary financial, administrative, and legal support.
The office-bearers of  the association also highlighted the poor condition of the main road from Landaki to Kalam, which, they said, created difficulties for both tourists and residents. They urged authorities to begin immediate repair and reconstruction of this critical route.
The speakers also expressed concern over the lack of internet connectivity in Kalam. “The absence of internet services creates major problems for tourists and hotel operators alike,” said Zahid Khan.
Criticizing the role of the Swat Development Authority (SDA), the association alleged that the organisation was involved in unlawful practices and harassment under the guise of anti-encroachment drives. “Local hotel owners are being unfairly targeted with notices accusing them of polluting the Swat River, which is far from the truth,” Zahid Khan stated.

Night travel to GB via Kaghan valley banned,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316630-night-travel-to-gb-via-kaghan-valley-banned,"MANSEHRA: The district administration and police department on Thursday imposed a ban on night travel from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Gilgit-Baltistan via the Kaghan valley.
“We have deployed police on our side, and Chilas (Gilgit-Baltistan) police on their side, to restrict travel between Naran and Babusar Top from 6pm to 6am,” District Police Officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur told reporters.
He added that police personnel had been deployed to enforce the night travel restriction from Naran, the commercial hub of Kaghan valley, to Babusar Top, the highest point of the route.“We are hopeful that passengers and tourists will comply with the travel restrictions, which have been put in place for their safety due to several reasons, including recent snowfall at Babusar Top,” Gandapur said.
A joint circular issued by the district administration and the police department restricted all types of travel between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as within the Kaghan valley, for the safety of passengers and motorists.
“Traffic on the Naran to Babusar Top section of the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad road will remain suspended throughout the night until further notice,” the circular stated.It further mentioned that the night travel ban in the Kaghan valley was jointly enforced by the district administration and the police department to ensure the safety and security of tourists, motorists, and passengers travelling on buses and coaches between KP and GB.
The circular advised tourists, bus drivers, and other motorists to plan their journeys between Babusar Top and Naran in accordance with the night travel restrictions.Traffic between KP and GB resumed last week after the National Highway Authority cleared the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road, which had been blocked by heavy snowfall in the Kaghan valley since November last year.

SBP forex reserves rise by $70m to $11.52bn,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316515-sbp-forex-reserves-rise-by-70m-to-11-52bn,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $70 million to $11.516 billion in the week ending May 23, the central bank said on Thursday.
However, the total liquid foreign reserves held by the country dropped by $12 million to $16.637 billion. Similarly, the reserves of commercial banks fell by $81 million to $5.12 billion.
The SBP managed to increase its reserves despite external debt repayments, thanks to a current account surplus. Additionally, inflows from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and rollovers from friendly nations played a crucial role in bolstering forex reserves. The SBP received the second tranche of $1.023 billion from the IMF under a $7 billion loan programme on May 13.
The SBP purchased $5.9 billion from the interbank market between June 2024 and February 2025 to boost its reserves and meet external debt repayments. In February, the SBP bought $223 million worth of foreign currency from the market, up from $154 million in the previous month.
In April, the current account surplus dropped to $12 million, a staggering 99 per cent decrease from the month before. The surplus fell by 96 per cent year on year. The surplus during the first 10 months of fiscal year 2025 was $1.88 billion, which is a substantial improvement over the $1.33 billion deficit for the same period the previous year.

Govt mulls sales tax exemption on refinery equipment imports,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316516-govt-mulls-sales-tax-exemption-on-refinery-equipment-imports,"KARACHI: The government is considering granting a sales tax exemption on the import of equipment and machinery required for the upgradation of refineries under the Brownfield Refinery Policy.
Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik, who held meetings with various stakeholders in the oil sector, has indicated that such an exemption may be on the cards, noting that imposing a sales tax on petroleum products would be difficult due to its inflationary impact. “As the IMF demands a uniform sales tax regime, it would be challenging for the government to comply without raising domestic petroleum prices,” a meeting participant quoted the minister as saying.
The minister reportedly assured stakeholders that while the exemption on petroleum products may be withdrawn in the upcoming budget, it is highly unlikely that any new sales tax will be levied on petroleum products sold in the domestic market.
According to a press release from Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Malik visited the PSO House on Thursday as part of a strategic outreach to key players in the petroleum sector. During the visit, he met with the chairperson of PSO’s Board of Management Asif Baigmohamed and discussed areas of mutual business interest.
The minister also held a series of high-level meetings focused on strengthening coordination and ensuring operational excellence across the sector. He reviewed PSO’s performance, supply chain resilience and automation initiatives and lauded the company’s role in maintaining a steady fuel supply nationwide. He also appreciated PSO’s modernisation efforts and its shift towards renewable energy and emerging segments of the energy market.
Listening attentively to the challenges faced by PSO, the minister assured the company of the government’s full support. He reiterated the government’s commitment to ensuring reliable, sustainable and affordable energy for consumers.
In a separate engagement, Malik met with representatives of the Oil Companies Advisory Committee (OCAC), including Secretary General Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi, Wafi Energy Pakistan CEO Zubair Shaikh, Managing Director of Pakistan Refinery Limited Zahid Mir, and PSO Chief Supply Chain Officer Abdus Sami. Discussions revolved around industry-wide challenges, regulatory changes and the need for greater policy alignment to ensure a stable and efficient energy supply chain.
The minister also held a session with a delegation from the Petroleum Dealers Association, led by Chairperson Abdul Sami Khan. Operational challenges and concerns over dealer profit margins were raised during the meeting.
Malik assured dealers that their legitimate concerns would be addressed through dialogue. He said: “The government is fully committed to steering [the] energy sector towards greater resilience, sustainability and innovation. Our priorities include streamlining operations, addressing systemic challenges and creating a balanced ecosystem that serves consumers and supports economic stability.” He added: “Enhancing fuel quality, reducing emissions, and advancing the transition to clean energy are central to this vision. In the best interests of the country, all stakeholders must work together with a shared commitment to progress. Together, we can build a modern energy sector that meets the evolving needs of our nation.”

"OCAC rejects OMAP’s allegations as misleading, baseless",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316517-ocac-rejects-omap-s-allegations-as-misleading-baseless,"KARACHI: The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) has rejected a recent statement by the Oil Marketing Association of Pakistan (OMAP), calling it “misleading and factually incorrect”. OMAP had accused the OCAC of “illegitimate and exclusionary conduct”.
In a letter addressed to the chairperson of the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the secretary of the Petroleum Division, referring to OMAP’s communication, the OCAC said that it is a long-established and respected organisation, representing over 95 per cent of the market share of oil marketing companies (OMCs) in Pakistan, as well as the entire market share in the refinery and oil pipeline sectors.
The OCAC, which has been active since the mid-1960s, serves as the representative body of the oil industry before various governmental and non-governmental forums, advocating for the industry’s interests.
Dismissing OMAP’s claims, the OCAC said it had initiated its registration process in full compliance with legal procedures and had obtained a favourable order dated October 5, 2022 from the Committee of the Federal Cabinet.
“This order overturned an earlier decision by the Regulator (DGTO) dated September 24, 2021. The appellate forum explicitly acknowledged that ‘the scope of the oil industry is much broader than just oil marketing’,” the OCAC said.
The OCAC said this reinforced the legitimacy of its position and its diverse industry representation.Despite this clear legal standing, OMAP challenged the appellate order in the Lahore High Court and obtained an ex-parte interim order without fully assisting the court. “It is important to note that the matter remains sub judice,” the OCAC added, noting it reserves the right to pursue legal recourse.
The OCAC emphasised its critical role in supporting Pakistan’s oil industry and highlighted its collaboration with Ogra by providing comprehensive industry data, technical input, and analysis.
As a representative body comprising OMCs, refineries, and oil pipeline operators, the OCAC said it offers a unique, integrated perspective on the sector’s midstream and downstream operations.

SCAP demands relief in FY26 budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316518-scap-demands-relief-in-fy26-budget,"KARACHI: The Salaried Class Alliance of Pakistan (SCAP) has called on the government to provide immediate relief to the salaried segment in the upcoming Finance Budget 2025-2026, citing disproportionately high tax burdens, rising inflation and worsening economic conditions, according to a statement released on Thursday.
According to the Alliance, salaried individuals, comprising government and private employees as well as professionals in the media, banking, education and corporate sectors, are the only segment paying their due share of income tax without any adjustment. Despite this, they have borne the brunt of recent fiscal policies, including increased slab rates and a 10 per cent surcharge on higher incomes, introduced in the last budget. “The middle class has been crushed. While inflation has doubled in the past three years, the minimum taxable income threshold remains stuck at Rs50,000 per month,” the SCAP stated.
The SCAP urges the government to raise the minimum taxable income threshold to Rs100,000 per month and restore tax rates to FY2022 levels. The government should reduce its expenditures to provide relief for taxpayers with higher tax rates and eliminate the 10 per cent surcharge. This surcharge acts as a penalty for timely tax payments and is unfair to compliant taxpayers. The salaried class demands immediate reinstatement of tax credits.
The Alliance warned that continued neglect of this segment is contributing to the country’s worsening brain drain. Emigration of skilled and educated professionals reportedly surged by 119 per cent over the past year, with heavy taxation cited as a key factor. Moreover, the SCAP pointed to structural tax inequalities. In FY2025, salaried individuals are estimated to contribute more than Rs550 billion in taxes, compared to only Rs100 billion collectively paid by exporters and retailers.
The agriculture sector, contributing nearly 20 per cent of GDP, contributes less than 1.0 per cent in tax revenue. Some landlords and privileged groups enjoy vast exemptions, while wage earners face tax rates as high as 35 per cent with an additional surcharge of 10 per cent.
The Alliance also expressed concern over growing informality in the economy, where businesses opt to pay salaries in cash to avoid high tax deductions, undermining documentation and long-term development.
The Alliance emphasised that fair taxation is essential not only for economic justice but also for preventing further erosion of the country’s skilled workforce and promoting sustainable economic development.

Muhammad Hasan Ather, an analyst at JS Global, said investor sentiment strengthened amid expectations of fiscal discipline and IMF loan inflows. Optimism was fuelled by signals of upcoming tax relief for the salaried class and alignment of the upcoming budget with IMF guidelines.

He said that expectations over US tariffs and trade incentives supporting exports, falling fiscal deficit and surging global crude oil prices played a catalytic role in the bullish close at the PSX.WorldCall Telecom remained the volume leader with 137.517 million shares, which closed higher by 13 paisas to Rs1.43 per share.

Rupee ends higher against dollar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316520-rupee-ends-higher-against-dollar,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee ended slightly stronger against the US dollar in the interbank market on Thursday.The rupee closed at 282.07 per dollar, up 0.04 per cent from the previous close.
In the open market, the rupee inched up, trading at 284.39 versus the dollar. It had settled at 284.4 in the previous session.Dealers said the local currency gained ground following a drop during the previous two sessions, attributed to heightened demand for dollars for imports and other payments. Furthermore, limited supply due to exporters' hesitance to sell large amounts of dollars exerted pressure on the rupee.
The financial markets were closed on Wednesday for the Youm-e-Takbeer holiday.According to dealers, Eid-related remittance inflows appear to have gained pace, supporting the local currency.
Dealers expect the local unit to trade range-bound against the dollar until the budget is unveiled. The evolving news flow surrounding the budget will determine the rupee’s future direction. Pakistan is set to present its fiscal year 2025-26 budget on June 10.

Chinese savers decry falling deposit rates but still won’t spend more,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316521-chinese-savers-decry-falling-deposit-rates-but-still-won-t-spend-more,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE: After Chinese banks reduced deposit rates last week, Miro Chen launched a social media poll: “When interest rates fall, do you save or spend?”
More than 80 per cent of some 5,000 responses chose saving, underlining the challenge for policymakers seeking to shore up demand and economic growth.“The result is one-sided, indicating people are very worried,” said the 37-year-old, who works for an internet company in southern China. “I am not sure how long my company can survive,” he added, explaining why he also saves.
China’s central bank eased monetary policy last week to limit damage from the trade war with Washington. On Friday, it lowered the ceiling for deposit rates to offset margin pressure on banks and prompt savers to spend or invest more.
But successive cuts to deposit rates in recent years have failed to curb explosive growth in Chinese household savings, intensifying concerns over the side-effects that lower returns have on the country's consumers, who tend to build their own safety net.
At the end of March, total household deposits surpassed 160 trillion yuan ($22.3 trillion), up 10.3 per cent from a year before, and equivalent to 118 per cent of last year's gross domestic product (GDP), official data show. Retail sales, by comparison, rose 4.6 per cent year-on-year in the first quarter.
Minxiong Liao, senior economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard APAC, says lower interest rates “likely reduce income growth” for China’s population.“People, especially those born in the 1980s, may need to save more rather than spend in the coming decade to secure retirement cashflow, as low interest rates are likely to persist.”Chinese households have been saving more due to worries over job security in a stuttering economy facing deflationary pressures, as well as wealth concerns caused by a prolonged property crisis.
Liao and other economists say the best policies to increase consumption in China would be bolstering its pension system and other social benefits to curb households’ savings needs.Since losing his marketing job a year ago, 30-year-old Lawrence Pan, now a freelancer, no longer pays his social insurance contributions, although he could if he chose to.
He prefers to save money on his own as he doesn’t trust the state system, which the Chinese Academy of Sciences sees running out of money by 2035.Pan saves about two-thirds of his income into his current account. He says fixed-term savings offer too little interest for him to bother with deposits.
“I feel my savings and spending habits would be more balanced if deposit rates were higher. A higher interest rate signals that the economy is getting better,” said Pan. “In such a scenario, I would spend more.”
‘PAINKILLERS’
China has repeatedly pledged to make household consumption -- which is about 20 percentage points of GDP below the global average -- a more important driver of economic growth.
The world’s second-largest economy relied heavily on exports last year to hit its roughly 5.0 per cent expansion target and analysts say higher US tariffs call for greater urgency on measures that rebalance the economy towards domestic demand. But lower interest rates may work against that aim.
Michael Pettis, senior fellow at Carnegie China, says they facilitate a transfer of resources from the net savers in the economy -- mainly households in China’s case -- to the net borrowers, which are the business and government sectors.
“In a financial system like that of China today, and also of Japan in the 1990s, lower real interest rates don’t seem to boost consumption,” Pettis said.Also like in Japan, which has grappled with decades of economic stagnation, the side effects on borrowers are growing as well.
Elisabeth Werenskiold, senior economist at Fathom Consulting, says monetary policy easing in China makes many businesses dependent on low borrowing costs in the long run, leading to the “zombification” of entire industries.
She says cash flow in sectors such as construction, airlines, travel and computer services covers less than five months of interest expenses, describing anything below five as the “danger zone”. “It’s a bit like painkillers,” Werenskiold said. “You can treat the pain, but unless you treat the source you’ll have to keep taking the painkillers, increasing the risk of negative side effects.”
Thrifty households can also force cost-cutting measures throughout the economy, risking a deflationary spiral.Book editor Erin Yao, 32, moved last year from Beijing to cheaper Wuhan in central China to save more of her income. Her company’s strategy shift to lower-cost books makes her worry about the economy, so she plans to put money aside for rainy days even if deposit rates drop to zero.
“My first reaction to the deposit rate cut was: has the economy entered a downturn?” Yao said.“I won’t spend all my money to enjoy life now. I will keep something aside in case my parents or I become ill,” she said.

Pakistan targets Gulf market with fodder export push to Qatar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316522-pakistan-targets-gulf-market-with-fodder-export-push-to-qatar,"KARACHI: A Pakistani trade delegation comprising six leading animal fodder exporters concluded a three-day visit to Qatar from May 25 to 27, as part of a broader push to strengthen bilateral trade ties and tap into the Gulf country’s growing demand for high-quality forage.
The delegation, organised by the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) in partnership with the Pakistani Embassy in Doha, met with senior representatives from leading Qatari buyers including Hassad Food, Widam Food, Alanaam Factory, Mazzraty, Green Forages Trading and Baladna.
The three-day visit included site tours of Qatari production and logistics facilities, and discussions on product specifications, certification protocols and future supply agreements. The initiative follows a year-long effort by TDAP involving producer outreach, market research, and capacity-building seminars aimed at improving Pakistan’s export readiness in fodder crops, particularly alfalfa and Rhodes grass.
“Pakistan’s proximity to Qatar gives it a natural freight advantage,” said a TDAP official, citing the 1,100km shipping route compared with over 12,000km from traditional exporters like the US. Pakistani fodder, primarily alfalfa, currently averages around $330 per tonne in export value.
Pakistan’s annual fodder output stands at 55.47 million tonnes, with alfalfa accounting for 5.32 million tonnes, according to Dr Qamar Shakil of the Fodder Research Sub-Station, AARI. In 2023-24, Pakistan exported $10.8 million worth of Rhodes grass, with Qatar among its top markets.
The global alfalfa trade, valued at $21.6 billion in 2023, is forecast to rise to $35.2 billion by 2028. Demand for fodder hay across the Gulf region is projected to exceed $9 billion, offering Pakistani exporters a promising commercial opportunity.
Further strengthening its export capacity, TDAP held regional seminars in Multan and Rahim Yar Khan in late 2024, focusing on improving production practices and meeting international standards. A follow-up training session is planned for June 2025.
With 0.47 million hectares of potential fodder cultivation area in Punjab and a dairy sector ranked fourth globally by the FAO -- producing 67.8 million tonnes of milk annually -- Pakistan is positioning itself as a competitive supplier for Gulf states facing arid growing conditions and import dependence.

"APTMA, Uzbek textile bodies agree to boost bilateral trade",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316523-aptma-uzbek-textile-bodies-agree-to-boost-bilateral-trade,"LAHORE: The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) and textile associations of Uzbekistan have agreed to significantly enhance bilateral trade, which currently stands at $114 million.
The understanding was reached during a meeting between an Uzbek textile delegation and APTMA members and office-bearers, held at the APTMA House in Lahore on May 29, 2025.
The delegation, led by Tokhtaev Akobirjon Khakimovich, invited an APTMA delegation to visit Uzbekistan and urged them to participate in the Investment Expo scheduled to take place there next month.
The visiting delegates highlighted several agreements already signed between the two countries, including the Income Tax Convention and its Final Protocol. An agreement is also being finalised between the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and an Uzbek bank to enhance cooperation in the banking sector.
They noted the commencement of direct flights from Lahore to Tashkent, with a travel time of only two hours, and mentioned that additional routes from Islamabad and Karachi are being operationalised to further ease travel between the two nations.
The Uzbek side also discussed progress on finalising a transit trade agreement between Uzbekistan and Pakistan via Afghanistan. They emphasised that the distance from Torkham to Uzbekistan is only 600km, with a secure road corridor, and added that the process for issuing drivers’ visas is being expedited to facilitate the swift movement of goods and people.
Speaking on the occasion, APTMA Chairperson Kamran Arshad outlined challenges hindering bilateral trade, including logistical constraints and difficulties related to the use of letters of credit (LCs) in trade transactions.

Officials back plan for Karachi Port-Shahrah-e-Bhutto connector,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316524-officials-back-plan-for-karachi-port-shahrah-e-bhutto-connector,"KARACHI: A key meeting was held on Thursday at the Sindh Investment Department office to discuss a proposed infrastructure project aimed at connecting Karachi Port to Shahrah-e-Bhutto (Malir Expressway) via the Qayyumabad Interchange.
The meeting was attended by Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Special Assistant to the Chief Minister Sindh on Investment and Public Private Partnership Syed Qasim Naveed Qamar.
Officials highlighted that the distance from the Karachi Port to the Qayyumabad Interchange is approximately 12 kilometres.

Stocks climb after US court blocks Trump tariffs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316525-stocks-climb-after-us-court-blocks-trump-tariffs,"LONDON: Global stocks and the dollar largely firmed on Thursday after a US court blocked most of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs from taking effect. Equities across Europe and Asia climbed on hopes that Trump’s April 2 ‘Liberation Day’ tariffs may not be imposed, easing concerns that had roiled global markets and sparked recession fears. US futures markets rallied almost 2.0 per cent, signalling at least solid gains when Wall Street reopens on Thursday. Tech stocks led the way after US computer chip giant Nvidia beat first-quarter earnings estimates, posting $18.1 billion in profit on revenues of $44.1 billion.
Despite warning that export controls could cost billions, Nvidia forecast strong second-quarter sales on still-booming demand for chips to power artificial intelligence. In foreign exchange, the dollar strengthened against the euro and the yen, while safe haven gold retreated. Oil prices built on Wednesday’s rally that came against a backdrop of rising tensions over Russia and Iran, and OPEC meetings this week.

Kvaratskhelia eyes double success at Inter’s expense in CL final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316545-kvaratskhelia-eyes-double-success-at-inter-s-expense-in-cl-final,"PARIS: Khvicha Kvaratskhelia has already played a part in denying Inter Milan the Serie A title this season, and the Georgian is now hoping to get the better of them again with Paris Saint-Germain in Saturday´s Champions League final.
The 24-year-old Kvaratskhelia moved to Paris in January from Napoli for a reported 70 million euros ($79.2m) plus bonuses. He is set to have a key role to play for Luis Enrique´s side against Inter in Munich, despite missing last weekend´s French Cup final victory over Reims as a precaution due to a minor fitness issue.
Perhaps he had been up late the previous night celebrating his former club´s Serie A triumph, as Napoli pipped Inter to the Scudetto in their final game of the season. Napoli´s second Italian league championship in three campaigns was claimed despite ´Kvara´, one of the stars of their title in 2023, leaving the team in the middle of the season.
Instrumental two years ago when he earned the nickname ´Kvaradona´ at the club where Diego Maradona is an icon, he played a pivotal part in the early weeks of this season under Antonio Conte, scoring five goals in the first 10 Serie A games -- only four Napoli players finished the campaign with more goals, including Scott McTominay.
Kvaratskhelia can therefore claim an Italian league winner´s medal for this season as well as one for Ligue 1 for his contribution towards PSG´s cruise to the domestic title. However, his transfer to PSG has really aided the French side in Europe, where the extra competition for places in attack has helped bring the best out of fellow forwards Ousmane Dembele, Bradley Barcola and Desire Doue.
The left-winger who loves to play with his socks rolled down around his ankles also fits perfectly into coach Luis Enrique´s system, which demands that the attackers do their bit to help the team defensively.
“He is perfectly adaptable to our way of playing. He is versatile. He can go past players and he can also defend which is essential because we need to be able to defend as 11 players and attack as 11 players,” Luis Enrique said in January.
Kvaratskhelia has so far contributed six goals and six assists in 24 appearances for PSG, including one magnificent strike against Aston Villa in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final and the pass to set up Dembele´s winning goal away to Arsenal in the semis.

Amorim tells Man Utd players they cannot ‘hide’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316546-amorim-tells-man-utd-players-they-cannot-hide,"Hong Kong: Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim said Thursday that his players cannot “hide” after a dismal season hit a fresh low when they were booed off following a friendly defeat in Malaysia.
United finished 15th in the Premier League and failed to win a trophy, then immediately jetted out Sunday for lucrative friendlies in Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. But if his squad were hoping for some respite in Asia, they did not get it, suffering a 1-0 defeat to a Southeast Asian XI in the Malaysian capital on Wednesday.
United´s players trudged off with boos ringing in their ears and footage later emerged of winger Amad Diallo making an obscene gesture to fans outside the team hotel. “I have respect for people but not for the one who insults my mom,” the 22-year-old winger wrote on social media.
“I shouldn´t have reacted like that but I don´t regret what I did.” It was another unwanted distraction for Amorim and United, who face Hong Kong´s representative team in another friendly on Friday.
Speaking to media in the southern Chinese city, Amorim was asked if an overseas tour to Asia was what the team needed at the end of a long and dispiriting campaign. “We´ve had the season that we had and it´s not easy to face the fans around the world, so it´s a moment that is hard for us and we want to finish the season,” he said.
“But at the same time we want to give something to the fans. We are travelling, we don´t have time to adapt, we don´t have so much time to have contact with the fans and give everything they deserve.
“But it´s clear that we cannot hide... if there is one thing that is really important in this club, it´s that we need to face our fans in this moment and give something to our fans around the world.” Amorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag during the season but failed to spark an improvement, said his side of first-teamers and youngsters was “not really focused” in Wednesday´s loss.
“Everybody can feel it. But I understand the fans (booing), I understand the players and you also understand that we want to give something to the fans, but it´s hard in this moment,” he said.

Messi and Suarez each score twice as Miami rips Montreal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316547-messi-and-suarez-each-score-twice-as-miami-rips-montreal,"MIAMI: Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez each scored two goals to spark Inter Miami to a 4-2 Major League Soccer victory over visiting Montreal on Wednesday.
Argentine superstar Messi opened the scoring in the 27th minute and assisted on Suarez´s first goal in the 68th minute for a 2-0 edge. Uruguayan star Suarez scored again in the 71st minute before Montreal´s Dante Sealy answered in the 74th minute.
Messi struck again in the 87th minute before Victor Loturi pulled one back from the Canadian club two minutes into stoppage time. Miami jumped to sixth in the Eastern Conference with seven wins and five drawn from 15 matches while East doormat Montreal slid to 1-10 with five drawn. Miami had lost twice and drawn twice in the past four matches.
“We had to take responsibility for the poor results. It´s a matter of correcting to regain confidence,” said Suarez, who added the victory “means a lot ... We have to continue to gain confidence in this kind of game.” Inter coach Javier Mascherano was concerned about injuries to defenders Gonzalo Lujan, Tomas Aviles and Jordi Alba. “We needed to cut the negative dynamic. I´m happy,” he said.
“Unfortunately (the victory) is tarnished by the departure of Gonzalo, Jordi and Toto. “In the case of Gonzalo and Jordi it was something muscular, which tomorrow we will see how far it is. In the case of ´Toto´ it was the ankle that swelled in a stomp. Maybe he could continue. He wanted to continue.”
Overall league leader Philadelphia won 2-1 at Toronto as the Union rallied late after Norway´s Ola Brynhildsen scored in the 75th minute. Nathan Harriel netted the equalizer for the Union in the 86th minute and Germany´s Kai Wagner scored the game winner two minutes into stoppage time.
The Union improved to 10-3-3 for a league-high 33 points while none of the three clubs just behind them on the table could manage full points, second-place Cincinnati drawing 3-3 with visiting Dallas and third-place Nashville drawing 2-2 at fourth-place Columbus.

Pakistan hockey captain for relocation of Asia Cup from India,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316548-pakistan-hockey-captain-for-relocation-of-asia-cup-from-india,"LAHORE:  Pakistan men’s hockey team captain Imad Shakeel Butt has urged the Asian Hockey Federation (AHF) to reconsider India as the host nation for the 2025 Men’s Hockey Asia Cup, citing rising political tensions between the two nations that could jeopardise Pakistan’s participation.
Speaking to media, Butt emphasised the importance of the Asia Cup, as it serves as a World Cup qualifying event.  “Given the current political situation between Pakistan and India, we believe the venue should be reconsidered,” Butt stated.
The tournament, scheduled to take place in Rajgir, India, from August 27 to September 7, 2025, now faces uncertainty regarding Pakistan’s attendance. Reports indicate that visa denials for Pakistani players—allegedly linked to the Pahalgam incident—could prevent the team from competing.
Neither the Indian government nor the AHF has issued an official statement on the matter, further fueling concerns over Pakistan’s ability to participate. Meanwhile, the Pakistan hockey team has shifted its focus to preparations for the FIH Nations Cup, where a strong performance could secure promotion to the Pro League.

"In Luis Enrique’s new-look PSG, the coach is the superstar",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316549-in-luis-enrique-s-new-look-psg-the-coach-is-the-superstar,"PARIS: In the new-look Paris Saint-Germain side which has made it to this weekend´s Champions League final, the superstar is no longer on the pitch but instead in the dugout.
In transforming a team not always taken seriously by their rivals into arguably the most feared side on the continent, PSG coach Luis Enrique has also revived his own reputation after being sacked from his previous job.
Now 55, Luis Enrique was appointed in July 2023, just after Lionel Messi left the French side following an underwhelming two-year spell. Neymar then departed later that summer. The former Barcelona boss was dismissed by Spain six months earlier after their disappointing exit from the 2022 World Cup to Morocco in the last 16.
The PSG job appeared something of a poisoned chalice, with his predecessors unable to deliver the success in the Champions League that the club´s Qatari owners desired. The team was handicapped by the presence of Neymar, Messi and Kylian Mbappe all together, three great forwards who naturally did not much care for defending. With the first two gone and Mbappe´s eventual departure inevitable, Luis Enrique understood he would be allowed time to mould a team in his shape.
“We are in the middle of building a new identity, our own style and way of playing, and a new culture,” PSG president Nasser al-Khelaifi said early last season, adding that winning the Champions League was no longer “something we are obsessed with”.
Last year they still reached the semi-finals in Europe before losing to Borussia Dortmund -- with a domestic league and cup double also in the bag, it was a promising start for the new coach.
The problem was that Mbappe, with his contract expiring, was on the way out. Yet the manager kept insisting PSG would be better without their all-time top scorer. “If everything goes well I´m convinced we´ll have a much better team than this year,” Luis Enrique said in February 2024.
It was hard to believe at the time, even less so after PSG opted last summer not to sign a new striker. Luis Enrique insists on playing a style of football characterised by dominating possession as well as high-octane pressing.
But his critics have accused him of being stubborn and rigidly sticking to one way of playing, even when it is not working. “Luis Enrique had a very clear game plan, and when plan A didn´t work, there was no plan B,” Spain´s Iago Aspas said of his former coach.
Earlier this season PSG were dominating games but not scoring, and Luis Enrique´s refusal to play with a traditional centre-forward appeared mistaken. When one interviewer questioned his tactics following a defeat to Arsenal, the coach´s response seemed arrogant and unpleasant.
“I have no intention of explaining my tactics to you. You wouldn´t understand,” he said. A defeat against Bayern Munich in November left PSG in danger of going out of the Champions League early, but the turnaround since has been remarkable.
His energetic young side suffocated Manchester City before they saw off Liverpool, Aston Villa and Arsenal in a triumphant tour of England. The decision to play without a recognised number nine? No problem. Instead he turned winger Ousmane Dembele into a lethal finisher with 33 goals this season.
PSG really are better without Mbappe, and Luis Enrique deserves huge credit for that. Now he is one game away from joining an elite group of coaches to have won the Champions League twice. His last success was in 2015 when he led a Barcelona side spearheaded by Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez to the title.

Pakistan eye T20I series win against Bangladesh,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316552-pakistan-eye-t20i-series-win-against-bangladesh,"LAHORE:  After a dominant display in the opening game, host Pakistan aim to seal the T20I series when they face Bangladesh in the second match at Lahore’s historic Gaddafi Stadium on Friday (today).
With a clinical 37-run win in the first T20I, Pakistan carries both momentum and confidence into the second encounter of the three-match series, while Bangladesh will look to regroup and keep their hopes alive.
In the series opener, Pakistan delivered a commanding all-round performance, setting the tone for the series with both bat and ball. Opting to bat first, the home side piled up an imposing total of 201 for 7, courtesy of standout contributions from Salman Ali Agha, young sensation Hasan Nawaz, and the experienced Shadab Khan.
Heading into Friday’s clash, Pakistan are expected to stick with the same XI that brought them success. Bangladesh, on the other hand, may consider tactical tweaks but are likely to retain their core unit.
The surface at Gaddafi Stadium is again expected to be batting-friendly, offering minimal help for bowlers. Teams winning the toss will likely prefer to bat first and aim for a total in excess of 200. The weather forecast looks ideal for cricket, with clear skies and a gentle breeze expected throughout the evening.
With a 1-0 lead in hand, Pakistan has the chance to wrap up the series and continue their impressive T20I record at home. The team has now won their last three home T20I series and will be eager to make it four in a row. For Bangladesh, this is a do-or-die encounter.
A loss here will not only hand Pakistan the series but also extend the visitors’ woes on foreign soil. With form, home advantage, and squad depth on their side, Pakistan are strong favorites to win the second T20I and clinch the series 2-0.

"Sinner thrashes retiring Gasquet at French Open, Zverev, Andreeva through",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316553-sinner-thrashes-retiring-gasquet-at-french-open-zverev-andreeva-through,"PARIS: Jannik Sinner ended the retiring Richard Gasquet´s career with a one-sided victory at the French Open on Thursday, while Novak Djokovic looks to sharpen his game in the second round in his pursuit of a 25th Grand Slam title.
Women´s second seed and former Roland Garros finalist Coco Gauff also targets a place in the last 32, after 18-year-old contender Mirra Andreeva cruised through.
World number one Sinner had no trouble in seeing off the 38-year-old Gasquet, playing at the tournament for the 22nd and final time, 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 in under two hours. Sinner made his comeback from a three-month doping ban at the Italian Open earlier in May, reaching the final before losing in straight sets to reigning Roland Garros champion Carlos Alcaraz.
He was in fine form against Gasquet, saving three break points to serve out the first set before dominating the rest of the match on Court Philippe Chatrier. “I´m very happy to be in the third round,” Sinner told the crowd after setting up a third-round meeting with Czech Jiri Lehecka.
“Thank you for being very fair with me today, I know what was at stake... It´s your (Gasquet´s) moment. Congrats on an amazing career.” Djokovic, fresh off his 100th ATP title last weekend, got his tilt at a fourth French Open crown off to a solid start on Tuesday.
The Serbian sixth seed will need to be on his guard against crafty Frenchman Corentin Moutet. “I don´t know how many more Grand Slams I´ve got left in my body,” Djokovic said after the opening round.
Third seed Alexander Zverev bounced back from losing the first set in a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 win over Dutchman Jesper de Jong. The German, who lost last year´s final to Alcaraz, will next face the winner of an all-Italian clash between Flavio Cobolli and Matteo Arnaldi on Saturday for a last-16 berth. Australian ninth seed Alex de Minaur´s run of reaching four consecutive Grand Slam quarter-finals was ended as he blew a two-set lead to lose 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 to Alexander Bublik.
Czech teenager Jakub Mensik, the Miami Open champion, also suffered a collapse from two sets up in a 2-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 defeat by Grand Slam debutant Henrique Rocha of Portugal. Home hope Arthur Fils narrowly avoided suffering a similar fate though.
The 14th seed fought back from a break down in the deciding set to grab a dramatic 7-6 (7/3), 7-6 (7/4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 victory over Spaniard Juame Munar on a raucous Court Suzanne Lenglen.
Later, Gael Monfils looks to pull off an upset over British fifth seed Jack Draper in the night session after fighting back from two sets down under the lights on Court Philippe Chatrier in his opener.

‘Enough time before National Games to build new swimming pool’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316554-enough-time-before-national-games-to-build-new-swimming-pool,"KARACHI: Seasoned water sports organiser Engineer Syed Mahfooz ul Haq has said that with the extension of the 35th National Games, there is now enough time to either build a new international standard swimming pool or renovate the existing one at the KMC Sports Complex.
The games have been delayed by more than six months due to the ongoing heatwave in Karachi. Originally scheduled for May, the National Games will now take place from December 6 to 13.
There was concern where the swimming competitions would be held, as Karachi currently lacks a high-standard swimming facility.  Speaking to The News on Tuesday, Mahfooz, who is experienced in organising water sports, urged the Sindh government, and the Sindh Olympic Association (SOA) to address this issue. It has to be mentioned that under the earlier plan, swimming events were to be held in Lahore.
But with the extended timeline, there is now enough opportunity to host these events in Karachi. Sources confirmed that the SOA is eager to hold the swimming competitions in Karachi.
Mahfooz proposed two options: either renovate the existing KMC swimming pool off Kashmir Road or construct a new facility at the National Coaching Center or Expo Center, both of which have sufficient land.
He praised the Sindh government for its efforts in developing sports infrastructure across the province, including laying several astro turfs for hockey, tartan tracks for athletics, new sports complexes, football grounds, and floodlit cricket stadiums.
“There’s no doubt that a strong sports infrastructure network now exists across Sindh,” he said. “But it’s surprising that Karachi still lacks an international-standard swimming pool. This issue must be resolved once and for all—not only for hosting events but also to provide daily training and facilities for swimmers.” He emphasised that Karachi, being the country’s largest city, should have facilities for Olympic sports so that major national events can be held here without difficulty.

De Minaur blames ‘too much tennis’ after French Open letdown,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316555-de-minaur-blames-too-much-tennis-after-french-open-letdown,"PARIS: Alex de Minaur took aim at the “never-ending” tennis schedule on Thursday after blowing a two-set lead in his second-round loss to Alexander Bublik at the French Open.
The Australian ninth seed had reached the quarter-finals at each of the past four Grand Slams but he ran out of steam against Bublik, who rallied to win 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. “Obviously not a good day at the office,” lamented De Minaur.
“One of those matches that kind of just slipped away without a whole lot of meaning.” De Minaur fell victim to the mercurial Kazakh´s exceptional shotmaking as his clay-court season ended in disappointment and with the 26-year-old needing to recharge.
“Look, I´m just tired. I´m tired mentally. I´m a little bit burnt out, if anything. A lot of tennis being played,” he said. “I think I lost that one. Looking back at my Grand Slam career, I can´t think of another match where I felt this way and I ended up losing a match that I probably by all means shouldn´t have.
“Look, not to take credit away from Bublik, he´s extremely dangerous, but saying that, I was also two sets to love up. This is a match that, yeah, I win 99.9% of the time.” De Minaur echoed the view of Casper Ruud, the two-time French Open runner-up who blasted the ATP´s ranking system after he lost in the second round on Wednesday.
World number eight Ruud compared it to “a rat race” which forces players to compete with injuries, as he was hindered by a knee issue in his to loss Nuno Borges. De Minaur missed three Masters 1000 events in the second half of last year due to injury and took just two days off after the Davis
Cup in November before starting preparations for the new season. “It´s just never ending,” he said of the schedule. “No one´s got a solution. But the solution is simple: you shorten the schedule, right?

Kundi wants hockey team to bring Nations Cup gold home,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316556-kundi-wants-hockey-team-to-bring-nations-cup-gold-home,"ISLAMABAD: As the national team’s probables were involved in an exhibition hockey match to pay tribute to the Armed Forces on their historic achievement against India, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi hoped to see Pakistan winning gold in the Nations Cup and make it to the Pro League next season.
“We are proud of our forces for dismantling India. Their achievement is a historic one. The whole nation celebrated the victory throughout the country. Forces are our pride.” Pakistan Greens beat Whites 3-2 in an exhibition match meant to celebrate the achievement.
Later, talking to the media, Faisal said he was excited to see the teams’ performance during the match. “I hope they will go on to win gold by playing outstanding hockey in the Nations Cup.”
He urged the KP government to work for the uplift of hockey in the province. “Once considered the hub of hockey activities in the country, the game has seen no patronage from the KP government in recent times. KP Government must come out of the corruption net and fund hockey and other sports in the province.”
The KP Governor hailed KP sportsmen for the talent they possess. “More than half of the national cricket team members are from KP. Even hockey players are there in the national team but there is a need to support hockey and other games so that the talent can reach international level. There is too much talent for sports in the province.”

Over 200 entries received for Emerging Pakistan Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316558-over-200-entries-received-for-emerging-pakistan-cup,"ISLAMABAD: More than 200 entries in seven different categories were received in the Emerging Pakistan Cup (Balochistan Open) that got underway here at the PTF Complex Thursday.
The event is being contested in men’s singles, men’s doubles, ladies singles, boys 18 & under, boys 14 & under, and boys 12 & under. Top players including Aqeel Khan, Shahzad Khan, Yousaf Khalil, Muzammil Murtaza, Barkatullah, Abdullah Adnan, Ahmad Nael Qureshi, Abubakar Talha, Asad Zaman, Salar Khan, Abdul Basit, Yahya Ikram, Haziq Asim, Zohaib Afzal Malik, Junaid Khan, Razik Sultan, Ushan Suhail, Meheq Khokhar, Zunaisha Noor, Lalrukha Sajid, and Mahrukh Sajid, will also be seen in action.
The event is proudly sponsored by Emerging Pakistan and State Life Insurance Corporation; the championships aim to promote tennis excellence in the country. The championships were initially planned to be held in Quetta, Balochistan, as the Balochistan Open National Ranking Tennis Tournaments but due to the non-availability of proper infrastructure to hold such a mega event, Honorable Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan was gracious enough to agree to the PTF’s proposal to shift the venue from Quetta to Islamabad.

"Hameed slams PTF for imposing fine, ban on Shoaib",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316559-hameed-slams-ptf-for-imposing-fine-ban-on-shoaib,"KARACHI: Former Davis Cup captain Hameed ul Haq showed deep concern and disappointment over the Pakistan Tennis Federation’s recent decision to impose a six-month ban and a hefty fine on the country’s number one player M Shoaib.
“The tournament organisers had already taken disciplinary action at the time of the incident, and the matter was considered resolved. Reopening the case and imposing a second, harsher punishment is not only unprecedented but also a clear violation of basic principles of justice,” said Hameed.
He added that under national sports policy and general legal standards no individual should be penalized twice for the same incident.  “Furthermore, PTF’s Disciplinary Committee failed to give Shoaib a fair hearing, depriving him of the opportunity to present his side of the story. This unilateral action, taken without concrete evidence and due process, raises serious ethical concerns and puts the professional future of a talented, hard-working tennis player in jeopardy,” said Hameed.
Additionally, he added, Muhammad Shoaib is currently Pakistan’s top-ranked player and a member of the official Davis Cup team when he was taken to Kazakhstan for representing Pakistan but wasn’t allowed to play any match abroad.
“This decision sent a highly demotivating message to the country’s top-performing and emerging talent, including the local tennis fraternity.
“The consequences of the PTF’s mismanagement are becoming increasingly evident. Pakistan’s women’s team has been relegated from Group 2 to Group 3 in the Billie Jean King Cup (Fed Cup) for the first time in history, while the men’s team continues to suffer defeat after defeat in the Davis Cup, barely clinging to Group 2 and knocking at the doors of Group 3, following closely in the very footsteps of the Pakistan women’s team. In the Boys U-14 Asia Oceania Qualifying held in Malaysia in April 2025, Pakistan finished 14th out of 16 teams.
“Similarly, in the recently held Junior Davis Cup Asia/Oceania qualifying event, the Pakistan team lost the last round to India 2-0 and ended up in 12th position out of 16 teams. These results underline the alarming decline of grassroots development and international competitiveness under the current administration,” said Hameed.
In addition, he added, senior and experienced tennis coaches are being let go in favor of blue-eyed, low-performing staffers who lack the qualifications and expertise needed to contribute meaningfully to the sport.
“Such appointments are emblematic of a broader culture of favoritism and mismanagement that continues to weaken the foundations of tennis in Pakistan. “These situations are obvious examples of the ongoing mishandling of tennis affairs by the current PTF regime. The current management lacks both the will and the competence to put the game back on track. They have damaged tennis to a degree that any recovery will take decades,” said Hameed.
He added that the founding spirit of any national sports body should be: “Of the players, by the players, and for the players.” “Unfortunately, the current administration has consistently failed to uphold this principle through mismanaging conflicts, alienating top talent, and turning every challenge into a crisis.
“It is time to reform the governance of tennis in Pakistan, restore transparency, and put the players first. The future of tennis in our country depends on fair play, both on and off the court,” reasoned Hameed.

"UN may cut staff by 20%, internal memo",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316658-un-may-cut-staff-by-20pc-internal-memo,"WASHINGTON: The United Nations Secretariat is preparing to cut its $3.7 billion budget by 20% and slash about 6,900 jobs, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.
The directive, which asks staff to detail cuts by June 13, comes amid a financial crisis triggered in part by the United States, which annually funds nearly a quarter of the world body. In addition to U.S. foreign aid cuts under President Donald Trump that have gutted U.N. humanitarian agencies, the U.S. owes - for arrears and the current fiscal year - nearly $1.5 billion.
The memo’s author, U.N. Controller Chandramouli Ramanathan, did not cite the U.S. failure to pay. He noted that the cuts are part of a review launched in March dubbed “UN80.” “It is an ambitious effort to ensure that the United Nations is fit for purpose to support 21st-century multilateralism, reduce human suffering and build better lives and futures for all,” Ramanathan said. “I count on your cooperation for this collective effort whose aggressive timelines are recognized.”
The cuts would take effect January 1, the start of the next budget cycle. In public briefings to U.N. diplomats this month, Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he is considering a massive overhaul that would merge major departments and shift resources across the globe. He said the U.N. may consolidate some agencies, trim others, move staff to cheaper cities, cut duplication and eliminate redundant bureaucracy.
“These are times of peril, but they are also times of profound opportunity and obligation,” Guterres said on May 12. “Make no mistake: uncomfortable and difficult decisions lie ahead. It may be easier and even tempting to ignore them or kick the can down the roads. But that road is a dead end.”
The U.S. failure to pay its assessments has also created a liquidity crisis for the U.N., a problem exacerbated by China’s repeated late payments. Together, the two nations account for more than 40% of U.N. funding.
In addition, the Trump administration has withdrawn hundreds of millions of dollars in discretionary funds, forcing the abrupt halt of dozens of humanitarian programmes that U.N. officials have said will cost lives. The proposed U.S. budget for the coming year, which must be approved by Congress, has eliminated or drastically reduced funding for several U.N. programmes, including peacekeeping.
In April, Tom Fletcher, who leads the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, told employees that U.S. funding cuts would force the agency to trim 20% of its staff to address a shortfall of $58 million.
Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, said it was unclear if the cuts will affect the Trump administration position. “Diplomats think that Guterres hopes that if he shows he will make these cuts, then the administration will ease off on their threats to zero out funding for the UN,” Gowan said. “That’s possible. It’s also possible that the administration will just pocket the cuts and not make any concessions.”

Russia says no response from Ukraine on Istanbul talks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1316659-russia-says-no-response-from-ukraine-on-istanbul-talks,"MOSCOW:Russia on Thursday said it was still waiting for Ukraine to agree to attend talks in Istanbul on Monday, after Kyiv demanded Moscow send its peace terms before pledging to attend the meeting.
Diplomatic efforts to end the three-year conflict have gained pace in recent months, but Moscow has shown no signs of easing its bombardment of Ukraine and has repeatedly rebuffed calls for an immediate ceasefire.
Moscow has offered to hold a second round of direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2, where it wants to present a so-called “memorandum” outlining its conditions for a long-term peace settlement. But Ukraine said the meeting would not yield results unless it saw a copy of the memorandum in advance, a proposal that the Kremlin dismissed.
“As far as I know, no response has been received yet... we need to wait for a response from the Ukrainian side,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, calling Kyiv’s demand that Russia provide peace conditions up front “non-constructive”.
Ukraine said it had already submitted its own vision of a peace settlement to Russia and demanded Moscow do the same. “We continue to urge (Russia) to share this document,” foreign ministry spokesman Georgiy Tykhy said. “If it’s ready ... we will examine and will be ready to hold a real meaningful meeting that can bring results, that can be effective, that can be a meeting not just for the sake of a meeting,” he added. Moscow’s refusal to send the document “suggests that it is likely filled with unrealistic ultimatums,” he said.
Turkey’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on Russia and Ukraine not to “shut the door” on dialogue ahead of the anticipated second round of talks in Istanbul. Negotiations on May 16 -- the first direct talks on ending the conflict in more than three years -- yielded only a 1,000-for-1,000 prisoner exchange and promises to stay in touch.
Kyiv accused Moscow of outlining unrealistic demands, including calls to cede territory it still controls. Moscow’s offensive, launched in February 2022, has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and the destruction of large parts of eastern and southern Ukraine.
The Kremlin has been grinding forward on the battlefield while pushing its demands for peace, which include Ukraine abandoning its NATO ambitions and giving up around a fifth of its land. The Russian army said Thursday it captured three villages in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Kharkiv regions in its latest advance.
Erdogan’s foreign minister, Hakan Fidan was expected to travel to Kyiv on Thursday to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, after meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow on Monday.
US President Donald Trump, who has been pushing for a peace deal, has become increasingly frustrated with Moscow’s apparent stalling and warned Wednesday he would determine within “about two weeks” whether Putin was serious about ending the fighting.
