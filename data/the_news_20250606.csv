Pakistan has very strong leadership: Trump,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319015-pakistan-has-very-strong-leadership-trump,"WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump has claimed he played a key role in de-escalating tensions between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan during his time in office, asserting that his diplomatic efforts helped avert a potentially catastrophic conflict. He described Pakistan’s leadership as very strong, acknowledging that some might disagree, but affirmed, “that’s just the reality”.
Speaking at a White House event alongside the German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump recounted how India and Pakistan tensions were “getting close to being out of hand,” and said he intervened by speaking directly to leaders on both sides. “I spoke to talented people on both sides. Very good people on both sides,” Trump said. “I told them we’re not going to deal with you if you go shooting each other and whipping out nuclear weapons.”
Trump claimed he used the leverage of trade negotiations to pressure both countries into stepping back from the brink. “If you’re not going to do that, we’re not doing trade deals,” he said, adding, “I got that war stopped.”
The president praised the Indian and Pakistani leadership, noting that both sides were “well represented” in talks. “The leader of India, a big guy, was here a few weeks ago and we had great talks — and Pakistan, likewise,” President Trump said. “They have very strong leadership. Some people may not like me saying that, but it is what it is. And they stopped the war. Now will they give me credit? They won’t give me credit for anything. But nobody else could have stopped it. I was proud of that.”

BUDGET FY26: A transformative path for FY26,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319016-budget-fy26-a-transformative-path-for-fy26,"As FY25 closes and the nation awaits the Federal Budget FY26, a profound anticipation hangs in the air. The weight of expectation rests heavily on authorities, for this budget can be more than mere numbers – it can be a bold, transformative blueprint, seizing the opportunity to reshape our macro-fiscal framework.
Federal Budget FY26 must design Pakistan’s fiscal framework based on a trio of foundational pillars: Good for Growth Reforms, Comprehensive Expenditure Reforms and Equitable Domestic Resource Mobilization (DRM) Reforms. This integrated approach can create a fertile ground for private sector investment, as the state’s footprint recedes, planting seeds of sustainable growth and widespread prosperity. This blueprint should guide the nation toward a future where DRM is a shared journey, fostering a fairer, simpler and more business-friendly Pakistan.
Good for Growth Reforms: In the context of Federal Budget FY26, Good for Growth Reforms must focus on measures that stimulate economic activity, attract investment (both domestic and foreign), enhance productivity, improve competitiveness, and promote sustainable development, while addressing underlying structural imbalances.
Formalising Pakistan’s economy is crucial, yet progress has been limited as a large cash economy, estimated at nearly Rs9,400 billion, continues to thrive. Pakistan must shift from punitive measures to a strong, incentive-based approach to change this. A key step is promoting digital government payments, such as poverty alleviation funds, through RAAST/(Inter-Bank Fund Transfer) and digital wallets in FY26, which can significantly enhance financial inclusion. To further embed this shift, authorities should aim for a large number of active RAAST QR codes, debit and credit cards, supported by a preferential GST rate of 10 per cent for digital transactions versus 18 per cent for cash. This clear choice will actively guide the economy towards formal participation.
National Tariff Reform, a critical lever for Pakistan’s economic competitiveness, can systematically dismantle the intricate web of Additional Customs Duties and Regulatory Duties and reduce the myriad of customs duty slabs. This strategic recalibration will lower input costs, help industrial growth, curb the scourge of smuggling, and cultivate a transparent and fairer trade landscape.
To boost formal business compliance, Budget FY26 should boldly incentivise registered sales tax filers and companies to also file income tax returns, fostering a culture of comprehensive tax compliance. Simultaneously, it must bring large sectors like wholesale, retail, real estate and services into the tax net by eliminating the non-filer category to ensure a broader and fairer revenue base. Prioritising economic documentation and digitisation, the budget should leverage data analytics and a robust track-and-trace system to expose hidden economic activity and clamp down on illegal trade, strengthening fiscal transparency and revenue mobilisation. Embracing the ‘Keep It Simple and Straightforward’ principle, Budget FY26 should eliminate distortions, simplify tax procedures and digitise business licensing and registrations. Through these integrated reforms, the budget will foster predictability and transparency, transforming the tax and trade system from a source of friction into a catalyst for economic growth, unlocking untapped investment potential and formalisation across all sectors. The climate and clean energy nudge must also come from a good incentive-based strategy.
Comprehensive Expenditure Reforms: Recognising that expenditure reform is often seen as austerity, Budget FY26 must present a clear vision focused on two goals: radically transforming current and development spending for efficiency and optimising resources; and elevating social welfare from handouts to transformative initiatives that promote distributive justice, job creation and lasting impact.
Expenditure reforms should systematically reduce unnecessary federal government expenditure on devolved subjects, streamlining responsibilities and empowering provinces. A key element involves sharing the projected Rs715 billion poverty alleviation expenditure with provincial governments, ensuring more localised and effective outreach. Direct subsidy management should also undergo a fundamental overhaul, transitioning from an inefficient electricity utilisation-based system to a truly equitable income-based subsidy regime, ensuring support reaches those who need it most, without distorting market signals.
Crucially, substantial savings in markup spending will accrue through a reduced policy rate, which can be complemented by debt reprofiling efforts, yielding hundreds of billions of rupees. A comprehensive approach further entails a swift move to a Treasury Single Account for optimising cash flows, completing a contributory pension system and monetising perks associated with housing and cars for government officials -- steps vital for modernising public finance. Finally, the budget must prudently accommodate necessary upward revisions in defence spending, balancing fiscal discipline with national imperatives. Equitable DRM Reforms: Let equity, both vertical and horizontal, be the unwavering compass guiding our DRM, a hallmark etched into the very soul of our tax policy. Our vision must be one of expansive embrace, broadening the tax base not through coercion, but by cultivating a culture of shared responsibility and voluntary compliance.
We must dare to lower the burden of tax rates, recognizing that a lighter load encourages greater participation. Thoughtful withdrawal of the often cumbersome web of major withholding provisions will pave the way for fairer and more direct revenue collection at both federal and provincial levels. A key element is the gradual reduction of the corporate tax rate to a regionally competitive level over five years and eliminating the super tax within three, fostering long-term business investment and igniting growth.
Budget FY26 should reform the Personal Income Tax to ease inflationary pressures, particularly for the middle class. Avenues include increasing the taxable income threshold to Rs1.0 million for all individuals, appropriate slab reductions for higher incomes, and abolishing the 10 per cent salary surcharge within two years -- enhancing disposable income and demand.
In indirect taxation, a phased reduction of sales tax on goods to 12-15 per cent will align with regional averages, enhance competitiveness and curb inflation. The budget must include concrete steps for expediting the harmonisation of federal and provincial sales tax rates, eliminating distortions and complexities for easier compliance and more effective DRM.
Authorities should signal intent to move beyond a reliance on regressive transactional taxes -- levied on economic activities like sales, imports or services -- to a more equitable system that taxes actual income and newly created wealth.
Finally, Budget FY26 must provide the right impetus to include capital gains tax, inheritance tax, and the burgeoning e-commerce sector, all of which currently remain largely outside mainstream taxation, ensuring a more comprehensive and equitable revenue framework.
The substantial imprint of provincial development budgets of Rs2,800 billion underscores the imperative for a restricted and software-focused federal Public Sector Development Program, compelling the federal government to concentrate exclusively on areas strictly within its domain. As provinces assume greater responsibility for key social sector efforts and their associated funds, they are no longer peripheral actors but pivotal agents of change, promising a brighter tomorrow. The success of our growth, expenditure and DRM reforms hinges on their ability to mobilise vital revenues -- particularly from agriculture and property -- manage these resources efficiently, and deliver services that directly uplift citizens’ lives.

Xi tells Trump they need to ‘correct course’ of US-China ties: state media,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319017-xi-tells-trump-they-need-to-correct-course-of-us-china-ties-state-media,"BEIJING: Chinese President Xi Jinping told his US counterpart Donald Trump that the two should “correct the course” of bilateral relations, in a Thursday phone call reported by state media.
The talks took place at Trump´s request, the Xinhua news agency said without elaborating, and come as Washington and Beijing clash over areas such as trade and student visas.
Xi told Trump that “to correct the course of the big ship of China-US ties, it is necessary for both sides to set the right direction, and eliminate all kinds of disruptions, even sabotage, which is especially important”, according to Xinhua.
The call follows officials from the world’s two biggest economies accusing each other of jeopardising a trade war truce agreed last month in Geneva.
“The US side should take a realistic view of the progress made and withdraw its negative initiatives against China,” Xi told Trump according to a readout from state broadcaster CCTV. He said the Geneva talks showed that “dialogue and cooperation are the only right choice”, and insisted China had abided by the agreements made in Switzerland. But the Chinese president warned Trump that Washington should tread carefully over the issue of self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.
“Xi emphasised that the United States should handle the Taiwan issue carefully to avoid a small number of ´Taiwan independence´ separatists dragging China and the United States into a dangerous situation of conflict and confrontation,” CCTV said.

"No final decision on changes to net metering policy, clarifies Power Division",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319019-no-final-decision-on-changes-to-net-metering-policy-clarifies-power-division,"LAHORE: The Power Division said on Thursday that no final decision has been made regarding changes to Pakistan’s net metering policy, stating that the consultation process is still ongoing and various proposals remain under consideration.
The Power Division spokesperson said it was premature to form an opinion regarding reports that buyback rate for net metering consumers may be reduced to Rs10 per unit, adding that the matter still needs to go before the prime minister and no final outcome has been reached. Sources in the Ministry of Energy said that a principled decision had been taken to revise the net metering policy. A summary on the matter has been prepared and will be presented to the federal cabinet for approval after the budget. Among the proposals under review is a suggestion to reduce the per-unit cash payment to solar consumers from the existing Rs27 to Rs10, according to sources.

"Nepra clears Rs50bn KE write-off, approves Rs2.99 per unit fuel relief",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319020-nepra-clears-rs50bn-ke-write-off-approves-rs2-99-unit-fuel-relief,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has approved a Rs50.01 billion write-off for K-Electric (KE) as ‘full and final settlement’ of uncollected billing claims related to its multi-year tariff (MYT) from 2017 to 2023. This approved amount is over two-thirds of KE’s original claim of Rs76.03 billion.
While approving the amount, Nepra noted that independent auditors confirmed KE had exhausted all possible recovery efforts. However, the regulator directed KE to continue pursuing recoveries and to pass any amount recovered from these write-offs directly to consumers through future quarterly tariff adjustments. Additionally, KE must submit annual certificates from its auditors disclosing any such recoveries.
Meanwhile, the Karachi-based utility said in a statement that KE Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Moonis Alvi welcomed the decision, stating, “With this decision, majority of items pending to the previous control period have come to a close. KE looks forward to the MYT for the control period spanning FY24 to FY30, committed to meeting its serviced territory’s energy needs.”
The decision was issued after public hearings and detailed deliberations, where stakeholders raised concerns that were addressed by KE management. Nepra reviewed the claims through internal scrutiny and third-party validation by accredited audit firms.
“These costs were part of the Multi-Year Tariff awarded to the utility for the period 2017–2023, and have been approved after stringent benchmarks, audits and fulfilment of conditions laid down by Nepra in its tariff determination,” it said.

Asif warns of ‘pre-Simla’ reversion if India undermines IWT,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319022-asif-warns-of-pre-simla-reversion-if-india-undermines-iwt,"KARACHI: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has clarified that his remarks about the Simla Agreement having lost relevance were made in a specific context, and not as an official policy stance. Speaking to Shahzeb Khanzada on Geo News on Thursday night, Asif explained: “I said this in the context of the IWT — that if the IWT is held in abeyance, then the same will apply to the Simla Agreement.”
He added that if India continues to unilaterally alter the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), then Pakistan could also reconsider its commitment to the Simla Agreement and revert to its pre-Simla position. According to Asif, such a development would have tangible consequences and would clarify Pakistan’s stance on the Kashmir issue.
Delving deeper into his personal view, Asif remarked that the Simla Agreement had, in his reading, introduced ambiguity into the Kashmir dispute. He termed the agreement “an attempt at deleting history through the agreement”, and said India had signed it from a “position of advantage”. However, he stressed that his observations were his own as a student of history and politics, and not representative of the state’s position. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs had nothing to do with my personal opinion at all”, he noted.
Earlier in the day, the minister had made headlines when he told Geo News that the 1972 Simla Agreement had lost its “sanctity” in light of India’s unilateral actions, particularly the suspension of the IWT. “The [Simla] agreement was bilateral […] as no third party or the World Bank was involved”, he had said, warning that without the bilateral treaty, the Line of Control (LoC) would effectively revert to a ceasefire line.
Asif also reiterated that India could not unilaterally withdraw from the IWT, nor could it control water flow at will, rejecting Indian claims of termination as legally untenable. However, official sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were quick to counter any perception of a policy shift. According to these sources, the Simla Agreement remains intact and no decision has been made to annul it. “No such decision exists in written form so far”, said one official. A senior official from the Interior Ministry also confirmed to Geo News on Thursday that there has been no formal move to terminate any bilateral agreements with India. This clarification had followed Khawaja Asif’s remarks, which had sparked speculation over a possible shift in Pakistan’s long-standing policy on its treaties with India.

Pakistan not among 12 nations hit by Trump travel ban,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319023-pakistan-not-among-12-nations-hit-by-trump-travel-ban,"WASHINGTON: In a move aimed at protecting the United States from “foreign terrorists” and other security threats, President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States. Contrary to earlier fears raised in March, Pakistan is not among the countries affected by the new travel restrictions.
The directive is part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students and deport others.
The countries affected by the latest travel ban are Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
The entry of people from seven other countries—Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela—will be partially restricted.
“We will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm,” Trump said in a video posted on X. He said the list could be revised and new countries could be added.
The proclamation is effective on June 9, 2025 at 12:01 a.m. EDT (0401 GMT). Visas issued before that date will not be revoked, the order said.
The African Union’s Commission expressed concern on Thursday about the potential negative impact of the new travel ban on educational exchanges, commercial engagement and broader diplomatic relations.
“The African Union Commission respectfully calls upon the US administration to consider adopting a more consultative approach and to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned,” it said in a statement.
During his first, 2017-21 term in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.
Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat who succeeded Trump, repealed that ban on nationals from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen in 2021, calling it “a stain on our national conscience”.
Trump said the countries subject to the most severe restrictions were determined to harbour a “large-scale presence of terrorists,” fail to cooperate on visa security, have an inability to verify travelers’ identities as well as inadequate record-keeping of criminal histories and high rates of visa overstays in the United States.
“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,” Trump said.
He cited Sunday’s incident in Boulder, Colorado in which a man tossed a gasoline bomb into a crowd of pro-Israel demonstrators as an example of why the new curbs are needed. An Egyptian national, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, has been charged in the attack. Federal officials said Soliman had overstayed his tourist visa and had an expired work permit—although Egypt is not on the list of countries facing travel limits.
Exceptions to the travel ban include:  Any lawful permanent resident of the United States; dual nationals; diplomats traveling on valid non-immigrant visas; athletes or members of an athletic team and immediate relatives, traveling for the World Cup, Olympics, or other major sporting event; immediate family immigrant visas; adoptions; Afghan Special Immigrant Visas; Special Immigrant Visas for United States government employees; Immigrant visas for ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran. Reuters reported in March that the Trump administration had a list of 41 countries that it was considering for travel restrictions. Seventeen of the countries targeted by Trump on Wednesday were on the list in March—Burundi and Togo were not. Countries on the March list that were not targeted on Wednesday include Pakistan.

Govt approves construction of Danish varsity with £190m received from UK,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319024-govt-approves-construction-of-danish-varsity-with-190m-received-from-uk,"ISLAMABAD: The Shehbaz Sharif-led government has approved the construction of a Danish University with the help of 190 million pounds received from the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) during the tenure of former premier Imran Khan.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also constituted a high-powered committee under Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar. It comprises National Security Adviser Lt-Gen Asim Malik, who is the DG ISI, and others to evolve a consensus among the Centre and provinces for setting aside financial resources for the construction of water storages/dams in the aftermath of water aggression from India. The committee is mandated to devise a strategy within 72 hours and implement its decision to divert resources for combating Indian water aggression. This was disclosed by Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday on the occasion of the launch of 13th Five Year Plan and Monthly Development Update at a news conference along with Chief Economist Dr Imtiaz Ahmed.
It envisages ambitious targets on infrastructure and environment in five years, including raising Electric Vehicle share to 25 per cent, nearly doubling water storage capacity, GHG emissions cut by 50 per cent, renewable energy capacity increase by 60 per cent, expansion of national road and rail networks by 35 per cent and urban green spaces’ increase by 20 per cent.
The Five-Year Plan envisages that the real GDP growth would be increased from 2.68 percent in the outgoing fiscal to 6 percent by 2028-29. The GDP growth has been envisaged at 4.2 percent in FY2025-26, 5.1 percent in 2026-27, 5.7 percent in 2027-28 and in the fifth year 6 percent in 2028-29. The growth in agriculture sector has been envisaged slow and steady in the coming five years projected to touch from 0.6 percent in the outgoing fiscal to 5.1 percent by 2028-29. The industrial growth will go up to 6.9 percent by 2028-29 while services sector is expected to increase up to 6.2 percent by 2028-29. The exports target has been set at $63 billion in five years, inflation to be reduced to 6.2 percent, foreign direct investment to rise by 30 per cent, unemployment rate to be under 5 per cent and increase in industrial production by 40 per cent. For the social sector, the 13th Five Year Plan envisages doubling of education spending to 4 percent, halving poverty to 12 percent population living below the poverty line, reducing infant mortality to 40 per 1,000, and universal access to primary healthcare, increasing literacy rate to 85 per cent and gender parity in education enrollment.
On the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the next budget, he said that the SDGs Achievement Programme funding was increased from Rs50 to Rs70 billion as recommended by a committee constituted by the PM and the HEC budget was reduced because the provinces possessed surpluses in revenues compared to the Centre.
The minister said that the size of Pakistan’s economy was projected to touch $600 billion in five years period and by 2035 they were eyeing economy to the tune of $1 trillion. He said remittances went up by $10 billion in the last one decade increasing from $27 billion to $37 billion despite the fact that one political party had asked overseas Pakistanis to stop sending money to the country.

Discos get nod for Rs0.93 per unit recovery,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319026-discos-get-nod-for-rs0-93-unit-recovery,"ISLAMABAD: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday approved an additional charge of Rs0.9306 per unit for electricity consumers in June bills, ending a nine-month streak of monthly refunds under the fuel cost adjustment (FCA) mechanism for April 2025.
This marks the first time since July 2024 that state-run distribution companies (Discos) have been permitted to recover costs, after consistent FCA refunds ranging from Rs0.288 to Rs2.124 per unit between July 2024 and March 2025.

Setback to PTI hopes for Imran’s release as £190m case adjourned till 11th,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319027-setback-to-pti-hopes-for-imran-s-release-as-190m-case-adjourned-till-11th,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday ordered the authorities to appoint NAB’s special prosecutor in a week’s time during the hearing of petitions for suspension of sentence of the founder of PTI and Bushra Bibi in the £190 million pounds case.
The court adjourned the hearing of the case until June 11. A division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Sarfaraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif heard the appeals. Barrister Salman Safdar argued that the petitions for suspension of the sentence were heard, after several prayers and supplications, and that today’s date was not given easily. He said that more than 300 cases have been filed against the founder of PTI and the trial court has sentenced him. Latif Khosa said Imran Khan was in jail without any evidence, but he will cut no deal to go abroad.
Special Prosecutor NAB Rafay Maqsood requested that the federal government had appointed a special prosecutor in this case but the special prosecutor general has not been appointed as yet. He prayed the court to grant four weeks’ time stating that they only received the notice of hearing yesterday. The acting Chief Justice allowed him more time and directed them to notify the appointment of NAB special prosecutor by June 11 and adjourned the hearing.

PM’s aide shares Pakistan’s crypto vision with US lawmakers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319028-pm-s-aide-shares-pakistan-s-crypto-vision-with-us-lawmakers,"KARACHI: Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib has said the country is not aiming to “catch up” but to lead on digital assets and innovation.
“We came to learn, to listen and to contribute,” Saqib said following meetings with US senators and White House officials in Washington, United States, said a statement on Thursday. “Pakistan is actively studying how global leaders are approaching regulation, innovation, and financial inclusion — not to copy, but to adapt the best ideas for our own unique landscape,” he added
The minister’s visit included discussions with Senator Cynthia Lummis, co-author of major crypto legislation in the US, as well as Senators Bill Hagerty, Rick Scott, Tim Sheehy and Jim Justice -- several of whom support designating Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset. Meetings were also held with Representatives Troy Downing, Ryan Zinke, Rick McCormick and Derrick Van Orden, all involved in shaping digital asset policy. Saqib highlighted Pakistan’s recent steps to establish a strategic Bitcoin reserve, its developing regulatory framework for virtual assets, and proposals to use stablecoins to improve remittances and financial inclusion.
“To sit at the table with those writing the future of finance is a responsibility and a signal: Pakistan is not waiting to catch up -- we are here to lead,” he said. “From Capitol Hill to the White House, I shared a new face of Pakistan -- one driven by its youth, powered by innovation, and ready to build global alliances for digital progress.”As Saqib engaged with the movers and shakers of the crypto ecosystem, Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) officials back home held a high-level meeting to review progress on the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets in Pakistan on Thursday. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired the meeting.
The session, held at the Finance Division, was attended by key stakeholders including the governor of the State Bank, heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), and secretaries from the law and IT ministries. Saqib, who is also the CEO of PCC, joined the meeting virtually.
The Ministry of Law and Justice presented a draft bill aimed at regulating digital and virtual assets. Developed in coordination with the PCC and technical experts, the proposed legislation sets out governance standards, licensing requirements, and investor protection protocols. The framework aligns with international best practices to ensure Pakistan remains competitive in the evolving global digital asset space.
Aurangzeb welcomed the collaborative progress and emphasised the need to expedite final approvals to provide regulatory clarity and unlock blockchain’s economic potential.
Participants agreed to fast-track in-principle approval of the draft to enable timely implementation of the legal framework.
Last month, Pakistan announced its first-ever government-supported Bitcoin reserve at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, US. The move created confusion among policymakers who raised concerns over the legal status of cryptocurrencies. The SBP then clarified that it had advised its regulated entities to refrain from engaging in virtual assets (VAs) owing to the lack of a legal and regulatory framework for such assets, not because they were illegal.
While there is scepticism over the government’s crypto goals among certain quarters, tech experts are of the opinion that establishing a national Bitcoin reserve could serve as a strategic signal of Pakistan’s alignment with global digital finance trends, particularly among Western tech and financial circles.

WB’s new poverty threshold pushes Pakistan’s poverty rate to 44.7%,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319029-wb-s-new-poverty-threshold-pushes-pakistan-s-poverty-rate-to-44-7pc,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bank (WB) has increased poverty thresholds for lower-middle-income countries from $3.65 to $4.20 per day per person, resulting in poverty levels of 44.7 per cent in the population living below the poverty line in Pakistan.
With this change in threshold but without altering methodology, the level of poverty in Pakistan has gone up from 39.8pc to 44.7pc population on the basis of official data for fiscal year 2018-19.
Because of a change in the threshold going up to $4.20 per day on the basis of Power Purchase Parity (PPP), the poverty level has gone up in Pakistan. However, the WB used the population figure of 2018-19 on the basis of the 2017 census, not on the basis of the latest population census held in Pakistan in 2023.
If the previous population census of 2017 is taken into account, when headcount stood at over 206 million, the absolute number of people living below the poverty line increased from 82.38 million to 92.5 million people in the trap of poverty in $4.20 per day per person.
Although the WB has updated its international poverty line, no latest official poverty figure is available in Pakistan. In the upcoming Economic Survey for 2024-25, scheduled to be unveiled on June 9, 2025, just one day ahead of the next budget announcement, there will be no official poverty figure incorporated in it. There will be no latest unemployment figure in the coming Economic Survey. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) has neither completed the Household Income Expenditure Survey (HIES) to estimate the latest official poverty figure nor undertook the Labour Force Survey (LFS) to calculate the unemployment figure.
To a question, Tobias Haque, the WB’s Lead Economist on Pakistan, said that the government of Pakistan did not approach the WB for budgetary support although the WB was happy on the direction of reform process in Pakistan.
WB Senior Economist on Poverty and Equity Christina Wieser stated at the launch of the updated poverty line that the World Bank was updating its global poverty lines to reflect changes in the cost of living and consumption habits of people around the world, based on newly available data. The new poverty lines are $3 per person per day for low income countries, $4.20 for lower-middle-income countries, and $8.30 for upper-middle-income countries. These lines are based on 2021 purchasing power parity rates, as well as updated national poverty lines.
For Pakistan, 16.5pc of the population lived below the $3.00 international poverty rate in 2018-19 (latest available survey year) and 44.7pc below the more relevant lower-middle-income line of $4.20. Pakistan is among the countries experiencing the largest changes in poverty when transitioning to the 2021 PPPs based on the low-income international poverty line.
For Pakistan, the poverty rate based on the new $3 International Poverty Line (IPL-2021 PPP) is 16.5pc, compared to 4.9pc under the previous $2.15 line (2017 PPP). About 82pc of this increase is due to the higher value of the new IPL reflecting increases in the national poverty lines of comparator countries, with the rest explained by price increases in Pakistan between 2017 and 2021 reflected in the updated PPPs.
The poverty rate under the $4.20 IPL line rose from 39.8 to 44.7pc. The new IPL only affects the level of poverty, trends in poverty remain unchanged. Pakistan is among the countries experiencing the largest changes in poverty when transitioning to the 2021 PPPs based on the low-income international poverty line. This significant shift in poverty rates under the LIC line, compared to the LMIC and upper-middle-income country (UMIC) lines, is due to a concentration of households with welfare levels between $PPP2.15 and $PPP3.00, which is near the international poverty line.
These updates to the international poverty lines are based on 2021 purchasing power parity (PPP) data from the International Comparison Programme (ICP) and ensure that poverty estimates remain accurate and comparable across countries. The methodology remains consistent with past updates, continuing a practice that began with the introduction of dollar-a-day line in 1990.
“The revisions help position Pakistan’s poverty levels in a global context and underscore the importance of continued efforts to reduce vulnerability and improve resilience,” said Najy Benhassine, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan. “The new figures reflect updated international thresholds and improved data from other countries, not a deterioration in living standards.”
For domestic policy and program targeting, the national poverty line remains unchanged and continues to serve as the primary benchmark for assessing poverty within Pakistan. The underlying Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) 2018/19 data used for both national and international estimates also remain the same. While international poverty lines are essential for tracking global progress and comparisons, national lines remain more appropriate for informing country-specific policy decisions.

"14% MNAs attend all sittings, 9% none during 16th NA session: Fafen­",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319005-14pc-mnas-attend-all-sittings-9pc-none-during-16th-na-session-fafen,"ISLAMABAD: As many as 45 (14 percent) Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) attended all sittings, whereas 27 (nine percent) did not attend any sitting during the 16th session of the National Assembly that spanned over 13 sittings between May 5 and 22, 2025.
According to Fafen’s National Assembly Attendance Report Card — 16th Session, consistent with the previous sessions, female attendance was generally higher than that of their male counterparts during the reporting session.
The highest attendance was recorded during the first sitting, with 237 members (76 percent of the current membership) present. According to Fafen’s National Assembly Attendance Report Card – 16th Session, The Prime Minister attended one sitting while the Leader of the Opposition attended two (15 percent) sittings.
During this sitting, the House suspended its regular agenda by adopting a motion to this effect under Rule 288 to discuss the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
The lowest attendance was observed during the last sitting, with only 174 members (55 percent) present. This sitting was initially adjourned after just 13 minutes when a lawmaker from the Sunni Ittehad Council pointed out the lack of quorum. This prompted the Speaker to suspend the proceedings for 15 minutes.
The House later reconvened and, during the resumed session, passed The Off the Grid (Captive Power Plants) Levy Bill, 2025. The bill was not included on the regular Orders of the Day while the lawmakers raised concerns on the passage of bill by disregarding the complete legislative procedure. Minor discrepancies between the daily bulletin and official attendance records were noted in at least two sittings.
During the 5th sitting, the daily bulletin reported 175 members present, whereas the official attendance showed 174. Similarly, for the 13th sitting, the bulletin indicated 170 members in attendance, while the official record listed 171.
An analysis of the attendance and the leaves applications read during the proceedings shows that 268 members — 86 percent of the current strength — missed at least one sitting during the current session. However, only 118 (44 percent of these 268) submitted an application seeking leave from the House for their absence.
Amongst these 118, 25 (21 percent of applicants) applied for leave in advance while 37 (31 percent of applicants) applied ex-post facto after returning from their leaves. The leave applications of the remaining 56 (47 percent) applicants were read on a day falling in the middle of their period of absence.

Movement for Imran’s release after Eid: Asad Qaiser,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319006-movement-for-imran-s-release-after-eid-asad-qaiser,"PESHAWAR: PTI leader MNA Asad Qaiser on Thursday said that his party would launch a decisive movement for the rule of law and release of PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan after Eidul Azha.
Talking to reporters after appearing in the Peshawar High Court, her said that politically motivated cases were being filed against him and other PTI leaders.
“A person with 17 seats has been made prime minister, while those who won 70 percent of the seats are in jail,” he remarked. He also criticized the judiciary’s current situation, alleging that the outcome of the Supreme Court’s case on reserved seats was already known. Asad Qaiser claimed that the government was mulling the 27th Constitutional Amendment to bring the judiciary under the executive.
“We demand fair treatment for the PTI founder under the law. We stand with him and will take our case to the public,” he vowed, announcing plans for a post-Eid campaign for constitutional supremacy in collaboration with allied parties. Earlier, the PHC extended the protective bail of Asad Qaiser and directed authorities concerned to refrain from arresting him.

"To avert dangers: Continuous monitoring needed for Pakistan’s 2,772 supra-glacial lakes, warn Italian experts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319007-to-avert-dangers-continuous-monitoring-needed-for-pakistan-s-2-772-supra-glacial-lakes-warn-italian-experts,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is now home to 2,772 supra-glacial lakes—seasonal water bodies forming on melting glaciers, which pose both a growing threat and a scientific opportunity, Italian experts said on Thursday, urging continuous monitoring to prevent future disasters linked to climate change.
The figure was revealed during a media briefing by EvK2CNR, an Italian-Pakistani research initiative supported by the Italian Government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). This marks the first comprehensive inventory of supraglacial lakes in Pakistan and highlights the urgency of enhancing the country’s climate resilience.
Dr Titi Melis, a glacier and climate change expert from the University of Milan Bicocca, said these lakes are highly sensitive to rising temperatures and can trigger deadly glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) if not regularly observed.
“We are building predictive models to assess how climate change is impacting glaciers and these lakes in Pakistan,” she said. “Continuous monitoring is essential to develop early warning systems that can save lives.”
Dr Melis also discussed the “Karakoram Anomaly”—a region-specific phenomenon where glaciers appear stable or advancing, in contrast to global glacial retreat. She stressed the need for localised studies rather than reliance on global patterns. “Understanding what’s happening in Karakoram is vital for climate science and for informed policymaking,” she added.
The inventory of supra-glacial lakes complements a previous milestone by EvK2CNR: the documentation of 13,032 glaciers in Pakistan. This body of research underscores the critical importance of Gilgit-Baltistan as the “Third Pole”, a vast freshwater reserve feeding rivers that sustain millions across Pakistan.
Speaking at the briefing, EvK2CNR President Agostino Da Polenza—renowned for being the only person to spend a night atop K2 and awarded the Tamgha-e-Pakistan—called mountains “early warning systems” for climate change. “What happens in the high mountains today affects the plains tomorrow,” he warned.
Arif Hussain, Technical Representative of EvK2CNR, said they are installing automatic weather and hydrometric stations at high altitudes and establishing state-of-the-art research laboratories—including a Glaciology Lab, Water Quality Lab, Zoology Lab, and Plant Pathology Lab—at Karakoram International University and the University of Baltistan.
“Our goal is to build Pakistan’s local research capacity in glacier science and environmental monitoring,” he said.
EvK2CNR is also operating the Spantik Open Laboratory in Arandu Valley, Baltistan, near Chogo Lungma Glacier and Spantik Peak. The facility facilitates real-time glaciological studies and provides critical data on glacier stability and melt trends.
Beyond research, the organisation has developed management and operational plans for Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) and Deosai National Park (DNP), promoting sustainable park governance, biodiversity conservation, and eco-tourism.
With Pakistan among the top 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change, experts emphasised the importance of scientific data, early warnings, and community engagement. “This work is not just about academic interest,” Dr Melis said. “It’s about safeguarding communities and ensuring water security for future generations.”

Review plea filed against SC judgment on civilians’ military trial,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319010-review-plea-filed-against-sc-judgment-on-civilians-military-trial,"ISLAMABAD: A review petition was Thursday filed with the Supreme Court against its judgment upholding the civilians’ military trial under certain clauses of the Army Act.
Junaid Razzaq filed the petition through lawyer Salman Akram Raja contending that the May 7 decision violated the fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
It claims that allowing military trials of civilians goes against Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees a fair trial.
It further contended that the constitutional bench based its decision on the past court rulings in a flawed manner. The verdict noted that the incidents of May 9 were not denied by the parties, yet the involvement of the accused in those events had not been proven.
The petitioner insisted that each accused should be tried by an independent court based on evidence.
He requested the court that the paragraph related to the May 9 events be removed from the judgment and that the May 7, 2025, verdict be reviewed and declared null and void.

"ATC judge sees ‘ambiguity’ in Malir jailbreak case, rejects police plea for 115 suspects’ remand",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319011-atc-judge-sees-ambiguity-in-malir-jailbreak-case-rejects-police-plea-for-115-suspects-remand,"Karachi: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Thursday turned down the police's request for physical remand of 115 suspects who were allegedly recaptured after escaping from District Prison Malir.
Investigating Officer Suleman Abbasi produced 115 suspects before the ATC-XVII's presiding officer, who is also the administrative judge of the ATCs, and sought their physical remand for interrogation. The IO stated that the suspects are required to be interrogated about the remaining absconding inmates.
After hearing the IO, the judge said he did not find any reason to hand over the custody of the suspects/ recaptured prisoners to the IO on police remand because firstly they were already under-trial prisoners (UTPs) in other cases, secondly no specific or individualized role had been attributed to each of them, and thirdly, no fresh recoveries or evidence was shown to be dependent upon their custodial interrogation.
""It is further noticed as it seems that IO has brought this matter so haphazardly as nor he brought proper jail record duly signed by the concerned jail authorities showing all UTPs as listed in this FIR and surprisingly he initially submitted the record of one hundred eighteen (118) arrested UTPs but then altered with his own pen the number as one hundred fifteen (115) UTPs, whereas memo of arrest showing one hundred eighteen (118) arrested UTPs and IO also altered too one hundred fifteen (115) UTPs,"" he noted.
The judge said that the IO failed to produce the case diaries, witnesses, recovered case property and injured police official's medical record. ""It is also found not convincing that as per IO this huge number of UTPs got arrested from outside the jail after the jailbreak,"" he added.
When the suspects were questioned how they were arrested, the judge noted, ""all of them replied that they have not broken the jail as due to earthquake when one roof of the jail fell down and it broke one wall partially, they sought help from jail police who were themselves trying to reach at secure and safe place [be]cause of earthquake results"".
""They further added that we all got outside and then we all get back to the jail when condition came to normal and now jail police shown us being arrested and this brings certain ambiguity as to the crime as to be happened and is shown as alleged.""
The judge observed that it showed weak administration on the part of jail authorities too. He, therefore, remanded the suspects in judicial custody in the interest of justice and directed the IO to produce the final investigation report before July 1.
He further directed the IO to bring all relevant record and proper list of arrested UTPs by the jail authorities on next hearing.
An FIR has been lodged at the Shah Latif Town police station under sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 324 (attempted murder), 395 (punishment for dacoity), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) , 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension), and 34 (common intention) read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997.

MQM-P worker shot at Liaquatabad teashop dies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319012-mqm-p-worker-shot-at-liaquatabad-teashop-dies,"Karachi: A Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) member who was wounded in a firing incident at a teashop near Al-Karam Square in Liaquatabad on Wednesday night succumbed to his injuries at a hospital on Thursday.

Fugitive from Malir Jail commits suicide after releasing video statement,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1319013-fugitive-from-malir-jail-commits-suicide-after-releasing-video-statement,"Karachi: A 25-year-old fugitive prisoner from District Jail Malir, who recently escaped custody, was found dead after he allegedly committed suicide on Thursday at his sister's home in Madni Colony within the jurisdiction of the Mauripur police station.
According to police, the deceased youth, identified as Raza, son of Parvez, used a rope to hang himself from a ceiling fan. Rescue workers from the Edhi Foundation and local police reached the property and transferred the body to the Civil Hospital Karachi for medico-legal formalities. Raza had been on the run since June 3 when he escaped the Malir Jail during the breakout involving several inmates.
He was previously arrested in a narcotics case registered at the Eidgah police station on March 30, 2022. Instead of returning to his home in Ranchor Line after the jailbreak, Raza took shelter at his sister’s house, fearing police raids.
A video message recorded by Raza before his suicide has surfaced on social media. In the emotional clip, Raza pleaded for justice and claimed that he was innocent. “I request to be released. I am not guilty. I escaped with the others because everyone was climbing over each other. There was gunfire in the jail. It felt like an earthquake. We ran to save our lives,” he said. He described his escape, stating that he was injured during the chaos and had to walk for a long time before finally reaching his sister’s house. Following standard procedure, the police handed over the body to the family after completing legal formalities. Investigations are under way to verify the circumstances surrounding his escape and subsequent death.

Gift from AKU’s first MBBS batch continues to boost health care,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318969-gift-from-aku-s-first-mbbs-batch-continues-to-boost-health-care,"In a powerful example of how alumni could give back and make a real difference, the first-ever graduating MBBS class of the Aga Khan University (AKU), the Class of 1988, has shown how one generous act can help strengthen health care across Pakistan. In 2013, this pioneering group of doctors came together to donate $500,000 to AKU — a gesture that continues to bear fruit more than 10 years later.
The recently released impact report for 2022 to 2024 reveals how this endowment has supported high-quality training for over 1,000 healthcare workers, boosted student research, and contributed to better healthcare delivery in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Hyderabad and Sukkur.
Thanks to this fund, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and public health workers — many of whom are currently serving in government or low-resource hospitals — were able to participate in hands-on training sessions in several crucial areas such as newborn nutrition, stroke care, breast cancer screening techniques, and emergency airway management. To make the training more realistic, high-tech simulation tools were used, including a 3D-printed model of the throat and windpipe — a first-of-its-kind initiative in Pakistan — to teach how to handle life-threatening breathing emergencies when normal breathing tubes could not be inserted.
The fund also enabled two batches of participants to attend a special short course on occupational health and climate change held in Karachi in 2023 and 2024. Participants, such as factory health officers and workplace safety experts, learned how to better protect workers from job-related illnesses.
On the academic front, the Class of 1988’s contribution gave a major push to the AKU’s Student and Trainee Initiated Research (STIR) programme. Of the 100 project proposals submitted by young researchers and students, 50 were selected for funding — several of which have already been completed. These included studies on the genetic connection between schizophrenia and metabolic disorders in families, mosquito-borne viruses in Karachi and new ways to diagnose bone tumours in children. Another study tested a faster lab test method (chemiluminescence immunoassay) to help diagnose a rare hormonal disorder in babies called congenital adrenal hyperplasia. The findings have already been accepted for publication.
“This gift is more than a financial contribution—it is a legacy of leadership,” said Dr. Adil H Haider, dean of the medical college at the AKU. “The Class of 1988 has not only paved the way as our first MBBS graduates but also set a benchmark in how alumni can give back and shape the future of health care.”
Dr Farah Naz Qamar, associate dean for research, said the support had helped bring world-class training and practical research opportunities to doctors and students, especially in areas where such opportunities were rare.
The AKU has a strong culture of alumni philanthropy. According to the University Advancement Office of the AKU, more than 80 per cent of its alumni in recent years have contributed towards scholarships, research and training projects.
The inaugural MBBS batch of the AKU included just 50 students, handpicked from a highly competitive pool of over 5,000 applicants. This landmark gift was spearheaded by two of the class’s most distinguished alumni, Dr Saad Shafqat and Dr Anita Zaidi, and presented during their 25th graduation anniversary. Dr Shafqat now serves as a professor of neurology at the AKU, while Dr Zaidi, formerly head of the university’s paediatrics department, currently holds a global leadership role as President for Gender Equality at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The two are also life partners.

In a statement issued on Thursday, he stated that today, only one name was resonating in India, which was that of Bilawal.

He added that the PPP chairman had emerged as a beacon of hope not only for Pakistan but for the entire region.
He stated that Bilawal delivered a clear message to the international community that Pakistan sought peace but would not compromise on its sovereignty and security.  Memon went on to add that Pakistan needed leadership capable of confidently and convincingly presenting the national narrative on the global stage, and Bilawal had proved himself in this regard.
He stated that Bilawal effectively raised the voice of the Kashmiri people at the United Nations and provided a strong diplomatic response to the Indian aggression. He stated that the PPP chairman reminded the world that Kashmir was not merely a border dispute but a matter of self-determination and fundamental human rights of millions of people.
The information minister stated that the PPP chairman had demonstrated through his leadership, vision and democratic values that he was the true heir to the legacy of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto.

Adiala prisoner enjoys meat every day: Azma,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318955-adiala-prisoner-enjoys-meat-every-day-azma,"LAHORE:Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari has said that while the poor can only afford to eat meat during Eid, ""the Adiala prisoner enjoys it every day.""
Referring to former prime minister Imran Khan, she remarked that he and his family ""watch dream-like films all night and wake up in a different world each morning."" She criticised political opponents further by saying, “Aleema claims everyone is standing firm, but in truth, they are all actors in the same play.”
She made these remarks during a press conference at the Directorate General Public Relations (DGPR), alongside Punjab Minister for Local Government Zeeshan Rafiq and Chief Minister’s Special Assistant for Price Control Salma Butt.
She extended congratulations on behalf of Punjab’s Chief Minister to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar for being elected Vice Presidents of the United Nations Security Council, calling it an unprecedented diplomatic achievement for Pakistan.
Touching on governance, Bokhari emphasized that this year’s Eid sanitation efforts will surpass previous benchmarks, crediting Zeeshan Rafiq for setting new standards in cleanliness that have compelled other provinces to follow suit.
She highlighted the government’s focus on controlling Eid-related costs, particularly food prices. “Punjab is the only province where food-related planning is being done effectively,” she claimed.
Regarding electricity prices, Bokhari announced that the Punjab government has reduced the profit margins of power-generating companies to ensure cheaper electricity is added to the national grid—aimed at easing the burden on consumers.
In response to a journalist’s question, she reiterated her criticism of political theatrics: “The one eating meat daily in Adiala, watching films at night, and staging a show every morning—this is nothing but theatre being played out for the public.”
Discussing Eid preparations, Bokhari acknowledged the difficulty in regulating butchers, most of whom are private workers. She appealed to the public, saying, “Don’t cut people—just sacrifice goats, and offer services at reasonable prices.”

Nadeem Chan’s two different stances in 10 years,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318958-nadeem-chan-s-two-different-stances-in-10-years,"LAHORE:Pakistan Peoples Party Secretary Information Nadeem Afzal Chan's recent statement in which he said PPP's defeat in Sambrial by-poll is a result of its alignment with PMLN has come in stark contrast with his stance 10 years ago.
In the year 2015, Nadeem Afzal Chan had linked PPP's defeat in Senate elections from Punjab to secret alliance between PMLN and PTI and now in 2025 by-poll held in PP 52, Nadeem Afzal is linking PPP's defeat to PPP's alignment or support to the PMLN government. In the year 2015, Nadeem Afzal Chan, a former PPP MNA of 2008 from Sargodha, was fielded as PPP candidate for Senate from Punjab while PPP had only 7 MPAs in the House. PTI, with around 30 MPAs then had staged boycott of the Senate polls and PPP, with a very thin representation in the House had to go extra mile to win the elections.
Due to the lobbying of PPP leadership, particularly Asif Ali Zardari and Nadeem Chan's own political connections in Punjab, he surprised everyone while bagging 27 votes, whereas PPP had only 10 MPAs in the Punjab Assembly.
Had Nadeem Chan got the PTI support in the secret ballot, Chan would have easily become the member of Senate for next six years. However, PTI had boycotted the election that benefitted PMLN indirectly and it won all the Senate seats from Punjab and PPP could not win the only seat it was contesting.
Soon after the results, while talking to media outside Punjab Assembly, Nadeem Chan had criticized the PTI leadership for benefitting PMLN and stated it seemed the alliance existed between these two parties. A couple of years later, by 2017, Nadeem Afzal Chan himself became the part of PTI and also contested on the symbol of bat from the National Assembly seat he had won in 2008 on PPP ticket but lost to PMLN's Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath.
His brother Gulrez Afzal became MPA of PTI and other brother, former PPP MPA of 2008 Waseem Afzal could not win.  During the PTI’ government led by Imran Khan, Nadeem Chan also served as spokesperson to the Prime Minister but later on, he returned to PPP.
This is quite surprising that 10 years ago, Nadeem Afzal Chan was displeased with the alleged alignment between PTI and PMLN and again, after the defeat of PPP candidate in Sambrial, he is displeased with own party's support to PMLN and declares it a reason behind PPP's defeat in by elections.

Expedite house purchasing for families of martyred cops: minister,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318963-expedite-house-purchasing-for-families-of-martyred-cops-minister,"LAHORE:Provincial Minister for Law Malik Sohaib Ahmad Bharth issued directions to expedite the process of house purchases for the families of martyrs. He said that under the Shuhada Package, a significant increase of Rs5.4 million per head has been made for the purchase of houses.
The provincial minister issued these directions during his visit to the Central Police Office where he also attended the ceremony held in honour of the families of police martyrs as the chief guest on Thursday.

"Mir Khalil-ur-Rehman Memorial Society seminar: Stalled solar project leaves farmers, contractors in crisis",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318964-mir-khalil-ur-rehman-memorial-society-seminar-stalled-solar-project-leaves-farmers-contractors-in-crisis,"LAHORE:Amid mounting economic and environmental challenges, the Punjab government’s solar tube well project, once heralded as a flagship green initiative,  is now at risk of collapse due to policy inconsistency, administrative inertia, and delays in implementation. Stakeholders warn that the impasse has not only eroded trust in government commitments but also pushed farmers and contractors into a deepening financial crisis, raising broader concerns over the province’s approach to climate adaptation and energy sustainability.
These concerns were echoed during a special seminar organised by the Mir Khalil-ur-Rahman Memorial Society (MKRMS) of the Jang Group, titled “Solar Systems for Farmers in Punjab: Why Policy Continuity is Crucial?”. Attended by senior government officials, industry representatives, engineers, and academics, the session painted a sobering picture of stalled progress, unfulfilled promises, and the cascading effects of administrative delays.
Punjab’s Agriculture Secretary, Iftikhar Ahmad Sahoo, while speaking at the seminar, acknowledged that the province faces an unsustainable division in its irrigation system, with nearly half the agricultural output relying on tube wells. With the cost of diesel and electricity steadily rising, the solarisation of tube wells was envisioned as a cost-effective and climate-aligned alternative. According to Sahoo, 8,000 farmers were shortlisted through a government-run draw, with the added flexibility of choosing solar vendors of their own. However, implementation has been marred by lack of subsidies, poor coordination, and bureaucratic delays. He added that a parallel federal programme is under discussion, potentially offering soft-term agricultural loans for solarisation over a five-year period.
President of the Pakistan Solar Association, WaqasMosa, strongly criticised the delay in completing the CM’s Solarisation Programme, stating that Punjab’s small-scale farmers — who form the backbone of wheat production — remain especially vulnerable to climate-induced shocks. He argued that government indecision and new taxation proposals have not only increased costs by nearly 30 percent but have also encouraged avoidance behaviour, undermining transparency efforts. “Tax relief for farmers would immediately reduce system costs and encourage widespread adoption,” he said, adding that overregulation in the name of revenue collection is pushing farmers towards informal systems and unregulated vendors.
Mosa pointed to Punjab’s status as the country's food basket, which now faces recurrent climate stressors — heatwaves, drought, and flooding — with minimal structural resilience. For many smallholder farmers, the financial threshold for transitioning to solar remains prohibitive in the absence of reliable subsidies. The association has repeatedly urged the government to prioritise the continuity and credibility of the programme rather than treating it as an ad hoc political promise.
According to project data shared during the session, the provincial government has reportedly installed 47,000 solar systems thus far. However, approximately 3,000 of the 4,000 selected farmers in the current phase have already submitted their upfront contributions — collectively exceeding Rs1.5 billion — without receiving installations. This has led to growing protests and legal threats from affected stakeholders. Meanwhile, project contractors, having imported high-grade solar PV modules, VFDs, and equipment worth over Rs1 billion (some even by mortgaging private property), now face insolvency due to halted installations.
Dr. Abdul RehmanKashif, from the Department of Electrical Engineering at UET Lahore, stressed that international market volatility, fluctuating exchange rates, and unpredictable import duties have worsened the financial exposure of contractors.
""Rising inflation, coupled with the absence of price escalation clauses in project models, has led to severe cost mismatches. Contractors are now unable to meet overheads including warehousing, payroll, and logistics, with many heading toward bankruptcy,” he noted.
Ehsan Bhutta, Member P&D Board, underscored that infrastructure bottlenecks and land misallocation further hinder solarisation efforts. He pointed out that while over 170 land acquisitions have been recorded in solar project zones, only seven industrial units have materialised, highlighting the speculative nature of such investments in the absence of governance oversight. He also cited the need for improved coordination among provincial and federal entities.
Industry voices further argued that while the economic rationale for solarisation remains robust — with daily savings of over Rs10,000 per tube well and monthly energy cost reductions of up to Rs350,000 — these benefits are currently out of reach due to stalled execution. Afaq Ali Khan, Vice President of the Solar Association, remarked that the programme’s online portal was designed to ensure transparency, but without timely disbursement of funds or active oversight, its utility is severely diminished. He warned that delayed execution is sowing distrust among farmers and opening the door for substandard solar solutions. From a commercial standpoint, stakeholders urged that instead of importing $2.1 billion worth of panels annually, Pakistan should explore localised solar cell manufacturing to reduce import dependency. Mr. Amir Ali from the Lahore Chamber of Commerce suggested that a single solar cell factory would require roughly $200 million in capital investment, a cost easily recoverable through forward-looking public-private partnerships. He advocated for structural reforms that could make local production viable, reduce forex outflow, and bring long-term stability to the sector.
As the project teeters between potential and paralysis, the urgency for the Punjab government to reaffirm its commitment has never been greater.

People are talking about —,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318932-people-are-talking-about,"-- the suicide of a private security guard in Karachi that was conveniently labelled a case of family dispute though the truth is that anyone made to stand for 12 hours a day monthly and paid Rs25,000, is vulnerable. Often camouflaged as suicides, these deaths are the result of extreme cruelty, exploitation and criminality by the elite class, as guards are employed at less than the legal minimum wage and deprived of four mandatory holidays per month, EOBI and social security.
-- how electricity bills are a significant concern for many due to their financial constraints since extra added unit costs have steadily increased over the years, making it difficult to balance the monthly budget. People say a significant portion of generated electricity is lost due to theft and inefficiencies in the distribution system and reduced subsidies on electricity to meet IMF conditions, lead to higher costs for consumers, while slow implementation of energy sector reforms is also delaying potential relief for consumers.
-- the three major recreational projects: a theme park, a Ferris wheel and a cable car system being considered by the CDA to ‘improve Islamabad’s tourism landscape.’  People say these are so unnecessary and a waste of resources when the infrastructure needs support; education needs an upgrade with the addition of skill centres, especially for those who cannot afford fancy ones; free health facilities in well-equipped hospitals are firmly established to cater to the health issues of the less privileged.
-- how call centres are like spider webs, luring unemployed individuals, keeping them trapped and torturing them relentlessly with sales targets, so with time, this affects their mental health and students who join them to become independent, end up wasting their potential. People say the environment in these ‘offices’ pushes workers towards harmful habits simply as a coping mechanism. Moreover, constant pressure from managers, extreme workload and wearing a headset for many hours a day may result in hearing problems and stress related illnesses.
-- the surge in the number of its citizens emigrating abroad, raising concerns about the country’s ability to retain its workforce and skilled professionals. Economic challenges remain the chief drivers behind this migration and scarce job opportunities compel many, especially the younger generation, to look for improved prospects beyond their homeland. While remittances sent home by them significantly contribute to the national economy, relying solely on this cannot replace the value of having a skilled and motivated workforce within the country.
-- the report that a team will go abroad to counter Indian propaganda. People say the composition of the delegation for a critical diplomatic engagement could have been better as it is vital for advancing Pakistan’s foreign policy objectives, yet the selection seems to have been influenced by political imperatives. The size and political orientation of the delegation also raises concerns about the use of public funds -- taxpayer money should be invested in delegations that optimise diplomatic returns through expertise and professionalism.
-- the fact that currently prisons house over 100,000 prisoners, leading to severe overcrowding. Contributing to this situation is the delay in the judicial process, since prisoners remain in custody for ages while awaiting trial, placing a financial burden on the government and leading to a loss of human potential, as many of these individuals are the breadwinners for their families. Reforming the justice system to deliver swift and fair outcomes; streamlining legal procedures and expediting court decisions, will reduce this problem. – I.H.

"BISP, WB discuss data sensitisation, social protection reforms",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318933-bisp-wb-discuss-data-sensitisation-social-protection-reforms,"Islamabad:Chairperson of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid, held a meeting with Melis U. Guven, Lead Economist and Global Lead for Social Protection Delivery Systems World Bank, at BISP Headquarters here on Thursday.
The meeting focused on strengthening collaboration in the areas of data sharing, cybersecurity, and reforms in social protection delivery systems.
During the meeting, Senator Rubina Khalid emphasized the importance of organizing a national-level workshop involving stakeholders from all provinces to raise awareness on the sensitization of data sharing, the risks and challenges associated with cybersecurity, and the need to build trust among partners.
“After NADRA, BISP holds the second-largest household data repository in the country through the National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER),” said Senator Rubina Khalid. “We share this data responsibly and strictly in accordance with all safety protocols to support various social welfare initiatives. However, it is now critical that NSER data be centralized—similar to NADRA—so it can be effectively leveraged for development planning.”
Senator Rubina Khalid further stated that data sharing must follow the standards set by cybersecurity frameworks, especially considering the sensitivity of personal household information.
“We must ensure that all stakeholders understand the gravity of secure data handling. A workshop is essential to address concerns, streamline processes, and collectively commit to responsible data use,” she added. The meeting also covered several operational aspects including a review of the survey questionnaire, redefinition of household structures, training of enumerators, and the introduction of regular third-party spot checks to improve transparency and data reliability.
Melis U. Guven appreciated BISP’s ongoing efforts in strengthening social protection systems and reaffirmed the World Bank’s full support, expressing a commitment to hold regular follow-up meetings and provide continued technical assistance.

QAU pays partial salary due to financial cauldron,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318934-qau-pays-partial-salary-due-to-financial-cauldron,"Islamabad:Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU), one of Pakistan’s premier institutions of higher learning, is currently facing an acute financial crisis that has severely impacted its operations.
This month, in a deeply concerning development, the university was only able to disburse partial salaries to its employees ahead of Eidul Azha, while pensions for retired faculty and staff remain unpaid.
According to a statement issued by Academic Staff Association, QAU, this marks the second such incident in the current fiscal year. Earlier in January, salary disbursement was also delayed, compelling the university to secure a loan of Rs270 million from a private bank, out of which Rs270m still remains unsettled.
The financial strain further crippled the university’s ability to meet essential obligations. Since Fall Semester 2023, QAU was unable to pay medical reimbursements, compensation for extra courses, internal and external reviewers/examiners bills, visiting faculty payment and research grants. The institution is currently operating under a budget deficit exceeding Rs1 billion.
Despite repeated appeals and formal communications to the Higher Education Commission (HEC), Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training, Ministry of Finance, the Prime Minister, and the President of Pakistan throughout the past year by ASA, no substantial action was taken to address the financial crisis.
The teachers elected body fears that if immediate and comprehensive financial support/bailout package is not extended, the university “risks defaulting entirely threatening its academic programmes, research initiatives and international standing.”
The QAU ASA made an urgent appeal to the President of Pakistan, who is the Chancellor of QAU, to take swift and decisive action. The integrity, reputation and future of this prestigious institution depend on timely intervention and sustained financial support, it concluded.

Significant increase in diarrhoea cases,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318937-significant-increase-in-diarrhoea-cases,"Rawalpindi:Professor Dr. Rai Muhammad Asghar, Dean of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University, has stated that with the onset of summer, there has been a substantial increase in diarrhoea cases among children.
Diarrhoea causes vomiting and loose motions, leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance in the body, making children lethargic and weak.Due to severe dehydration, children may become unconscious, and in extreme cases, it can be life-threatening. Therefore, it is essential to start Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) as soon as diarrhoea begins. ORS should be given with a spoon and cup, one spoonful every minute.
Once the diarrhoea subsides, ORS can be discontinued. Antibiotics should never be given in diarrhoea cases, as they are ineffective against rotavirus or E. coli, which are common causes of diarrhoea in children. Diarrhoea usually resolves on its own within two to three days.
Prevention is key is boil water before giving it to children, ensure handwashing with soap before meals and after using the toilet, avoid street food and drinks, and complete the vaccination course to protect against diarrhoea.

"Gilani, British High Commissioner discuss bilateral ties",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318938-gilani-british-high-commissioner-discuss-bilateral-ties,"Islamabad:Chairman Senate Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani and British High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott on Thursday discussed bilateral parliamentary and diplomatic relations, as well as regional and global developments and matters of mutual interest.
Chairman Senate during a meeting said that Pakistan greatly values its long-standing, close, and enduring relationship with the United Kingdom, built on shared history, values, and traditions.
Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani noted that bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and the UK continues to strengthen across multiple sectors, and Pakistan remains committed to further expanding these ties.
He emphasised the vital role of the British Pakistani community-over 1.7 million strong-in promoting robust social, cultural, and economic linkages.He added that Pakistan aspires to elevate its comprehensive partnership with the UK to an Enhanced Strategic Partnership.
Gilani underscored the importance of regional peace and stability.He appreciated the UK’s constructive efforts in promoting peace in South Asia, especially its role in easing tensions between Pakistan and India.
“I am a man of peace and strongly believe that prosperity cannot be achieved without peace,” he said. He noted that both Pakistan and the UK are committed to combating terrorism, extremism, and organised crime.
Highlighting Pakistan’s concerns over cross-border terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, he urged the UK to support regional security cooperation and counter-terrorism measures to address these threats effectively.
Gilani reiterated Pakistan’s desire for peace in the region and emphasised the need for the peaceful resolution of long-standing disputes, particularly the Jammu and Kashmir issue, in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions.
He also called for measures to address cross-border infiltration from Afghanistan and affirmed Pakistan’s willingness to collaborate with the UK on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), safeguarding international law, and enhancing regional stability.
He further highlighted Pakistan’s longstanding humanitarian contribution in hosting over 3 million Afghan refugees for decades, adding that thousands still reside in the country.He urged the global community to step forward and play a meaningful role in resolving the Afghan refugee crisis.
Chairman Senate noted that Pakistan is among the countries most severely impacted by climate change and emphasised the need for global cooperation to address this urgent challenge.

SBP decision to cancel exchange company’s license nullified,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318979-sbp-decision-to-cancel-exchange-company-s-license-nullified,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Thursday annulled the State Bank of Pakistan’s decision to cancel the license of a private exchange company and directed the bank to begin processing the company’s application for a No Objection Certificate (NOC) within a month.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah issued the ruling in a case where the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank and the Director of the Exchange Policy Department were also made parties.
Orient Exchange Company’s counsels Barrister Qasim Wadood and Babar Khan Yousafzai argued that their client’s company was the only Category B exchange company operating in the province and engaged in the money exchange business.
The company, they said, had applied for a Category A license but the SBP cancelled their existing license without providing any justification. The lawyers contended that this action violated the principles of natural justice as the company was not given a chance to be heard prior to the cancellation.
They pleaded that the company had fulfilled all the eligibility criteria outlined in the Exchange Companies Manual, yet the SBP took an illegal and harsh step not supported by law. They further argued that letters issued on December 27, 2023, and on other occasions effectively shut down the company’s operations and requested that these actions be declared void.
The petitioner also sought directions for the issuance of an NOC to allow the company to operate as a full-fledged exchange company.
In response, the SBP and other respondents submitted comments and said that the company had failed to meet the necessary requirements for upgradation from Category B to Category A and was not integrated into the new exchange company system that justified the license cancellation.
After hearing arguments, the court issued a detailed 11-page judgment authored by Justice Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah. The judgment noted that while the SBP was authorised to regulate foreign exchange activities and enforce rules on exchange companies, it could not provide sufficient justification for such a severe punitive action against the petitioner.
The court held that simply failing to meet the “fit and proper” test criteria does not justify such an extreme decision, especially when the company was not given the constitutionally mandated right to a fair hearing under Article 10A.
Citing relevant Supreme Court precedents, the bench ruled that the respondents violated the mandate of Section 24A and thus declared the SBP’s action null and void.

Delay in release of funds for Chitral projects slammed,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318980-delay-in-release-of-funds-for-chitral-projects-slammed,"CHITRAL Chitral Development Movement (CDM) former president and social activist Waqas Ahmed advocate on Thursday expressed serious concern over the federal government’s decision to delay funding for several key road infrastructure projects in the district during the upcoming fiscal year.
Talking to reporters here, he stated that the move had caused frustration and disappointment among the people of Chitral.Waqas Ahmed cited reliable sources claiming that the recent National Economic Council (NEC) meeting did not allocate any funds for the construction of the Lowari Tunnel approach roads and the Booni-Bozund Road in Upper Chitral. Moreover, he said, a meager sum of only Rs150 million has been earmarked for the Chitral-Shandur Road.
He went on to add that no construction work would be carried out this year on the Garam Chashma and Bamboret roads, both vital for promotion of tourism.“The people of Chitral had pinned their hopes on the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government, expecting substantial funding for ongoing infrastructure projects,” he said. “Unfortunately, these hopes have been shattered.”
Waqas Ahmed urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal and other officials concerned to understand the unique geographical and developmental challenges faced by Chitral.

Rehabilitation plan launched for chronic psychotic patients,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318982-rehabilitation-plan-launched-for-chronic-psychotic-patients,"PESHAWAR: A mental health organization, Horizon, has launched a programme to rehabilitate patients with chronic psychosis by partnering with a Lahore-based organization.
“We have launched the programme for chronic psychotic patients-a term used for the severely ill-to rehabilitate them, which is, no doubt, a challenging task. Horizon has joined hands with Fountain House in Lahore for this purpose,” said Prof Dr Khalid Mufti, Chief Executive Officer of Horizon, a non-profit organization, while speaking at its management board meeting.
The meeting participants reviewed the organization’s activities, achievements, and plans.Dr Khalid Mufti acknowledged that rehabilitating chronic psychotic patients, often diagnosed with schizophrenia, was a major challenge. However, the organization had embraced this task.
“Mumlikat Zahir, a CBT [Cognitive Behaviour Therapy] specialist at Horizon, received a three-day training at the Fountain House in Lahore, one of the top mental health facilities in Asia. The training focused on low-intensity CBT,” he explained.
Following the training, Mumlikat began working with patients alongside other staff members at Horizon, applying the techniques learned at Fountain House.Dr Khalid Mufti said that the main intervention was to activate patients through structured daily activities, using a chart system.
“This approach proved effective, as the patients showed improvement within days. Key family members accompanying them were also educated, enabling them to care for the patients at home, with a strong follow-up mechanism,” he noted.
The board was informed that the programme was initially launched at the Fountain House but was later extended to Horizon in Peshawar. It also included income-generating activities for rehabilitated patients, supported by the Akhuwat organization.
“Akhuwat, known for its well-structured philanthropic work, will provide seed money to rehabilitated individuals to start small businesses and will monitor their progress. The loans are to be repaid once the recipients begin earning. Akhuwat ran a similar programme previously, achieving a debt recovery rate of nearly 99 per cent,” Dr Khalid Mufti recalled.
Regarding other achievements, he told the board that 1,000 patients from Khost, Afghanistan, had been treated through the Tele-Psychiatry Clinic for Afghan patients.“We are going to publish two reports-one on this remote psychiatry facility and another on the psychiatric issues faced by Afghan refugees. Horizon has been serving this population for over 40 years,” he added.
Dr Khalid Mufti also highlighted climate change as a growing global concern, noting its impact on mental health.“We must be cautious with water usage, especially in light of the recent armed conflict with India, when the Indian government threatened to revoke the Indus Waters Treaty. This is just one of many potential climate-related challenges,” he warned.
The board decided to form a team comprising Aslam Meer and Dr Khadim Ibrahim to launch an awareness campaign targeting schools, colleges, and universities to promote responsible water use.
Some members proposed training teachers under the organization’s “Geo-psychiatry and Climate Change Programme” and suggested involving religious scholars to raise awareness during Friday sermons, particularly on topics like water conservation.
The board was also informed that internship opportunities for postgraduate psychology students had been expanded at Horizon. These now include six-month and one-year programmes to equip interns with practical psychological techniques before they enter the workforce in clinics, universities, and NGOs.It was noted that Horizon was making significant contributions to digital mental health and education.
Prof Dr Ali Mufti, the organization’s Executive Director, has created educational videos on mental health that are posted online regularly. Small digital toolkits are also becoming increasingly popular among viewers.
Dr Khalid Mufti said the organization was strengthening its collaboration with community-based groups. “One such partner is Dosti, funded by a US-based Pakistani, Dr Munir Ahmad. It is doing commendable work, including setting up one-room schools in KP and other provinces, which have proven successful,” he said, adding that a paper had been published on the initiative and was worth reading.

Woman among adventurers summit highest peak in Siran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318989-woman-among-adventurers-summit-highest-peak-in-siran,"MANSEHRA: A group of adventurers, including a woman from parts of the country, have summited the Churku Peak, the highest mountain in the scenic Siran valley here.
“This peak, still snow-covered in June, has rarely been explored due to its rugged and challenging terrain,” Dr Naeem Awan, a member of the trekkers’ team, told reporters here on Thursday.
The group began their expedition from Islamabad and reached Mansehra and then travelled through Shinkiari and Jabori before reaching the base of Churku Peak, which stands at an elevation of 4,300 metres above sea level.
The couple was also among the climbers who accomplished the expedition.Stealing the nomenclature from the Siran River, the Siran valley remains as cold in June as it is during the peak winter months of December and January.

PHC nullifies SBP’s cancellation of exchange company licence,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318884-phc-nullifies-sbp-s-cancellation-of-exchange-company-licence,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Thursday annulled the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) decision to cancel the licence of a private exchange company and directed the central bank to process the firm’s application for a no objection certificate (NOC) within one month.
A two-member bench, comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah, issued the ruling in a case involving the Ministry of Finance, the State Bank, and the Director of the Exchange Policy Department as respondents.
Counsels for the company, Barrister Qasim Wadood and Babar Khan Yousafzai, told the court that their client was the only Category B exchange company operating in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP). The company, which was engaged in the money exchange business, had applied for a Category A licence. However, the SBP cancelled its existing licence without offering any justification.
The lawyers argued that the move violated the principles of natural justice, as the company had not been granted the opportunity to be heard prior to the cancellation. They maintained that the company had met all the eligibility criteria set out in the Exchange Companies Manual and claimed the SBP’s actions were both unlawful and excessively harsh.
They also challenged the legality of letters issued on December 27, 2023 and other occasions that effectively shuttered the company’s operations, urging the court to declare them void. The petitioner also requested directions for the issuance of an NOC to allow the company to operate as a full-fledged exchange company.
In response, the SBP and other respondents contended that the company had failed to meet the necessary conditions for upgradation to Category A and was not integrated into the revised exchange company framework -- grounds which, they argued, justified the licence cancellation.
After hearing both sides, the bench issued an 11-page judgment authored by Justice Qazi Jawad Ehsanullah. While acknowledging the SBP’s mandate to regulate foreign exchange and enforce rules for exchange companies, the court found the central bank’s explanation for the punitive action lacking in merit.
The court ruled that failure to meet the “fit and proper” test criteria alone did not warrant such a drastic measure -- particularly when the company had not been afforded its constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair hearing under Article 10A.
Citing relevant Supreme Court precedents, the PHC concluded that the respondents had acted in violation of Section 24A, and declared the SBP’s decision null and void.The court directed the SBP to assess the company’s NOC application within one month, clearly identify any deficiencies, communicate them to the applicant, and allow an appropriate response. It further emphasised that the SBP must fully comply with the court’s instructions and begin processing the application without delay.

"TDAP, GCCI boost collaboration to drive export growth",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318885-tdap-gcci-boost-collaboration-to-drive-export-growth,"KARACHI: The Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) strengthened its collaboration with the Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce & Industry (GCCI) in a strategic session aimed at enhancing the export potential of the region’s engineering and manufacturing sectors.
The meeting, held at the GCCI’s premises, brought together senior officials from TDAP’s Engineering Division II and members of the GCCI executive committee. It focused on reviving momentum on joint initiatives previously agreed under TDAP and the Export Development Fund (EDF), with the aim of improving the region’s global competitiveness through technical and marketing support.
Key attendees from TDAP Punjab-II included Director EDF Ameera Pervaiz; Director Engineering-II Nadia Farooqi; Director Engineering & New Initiatives Ali Tamkin Butt; Deputy Director EDF Dr Zain ul Abidin; and Deputy Manager Faisal Zaman.
The session reviewed progress on earlier collaborations and introduced a sectoral development plan targeting structural bottlenecks in Gujranwala’s industrial landscape. The city’s engineering sector was singled out for its export potential, especially in markets across Africa, the Middle East, and Central Asia. Officials proposed a series of sector-specific studies to map constraints and promote innovation in product design.
Special focus was also placed on Gujranwala’s metal and plastic kitchenware industry, which largely operates within the informal economy. TDAP recommended modernising supply chains and pursuing food-grade certifications to meet international standards. As part of this push, the formation of a tripartite committee comprising TDAP, GCCI, and the National Certification Council (NCC) was proposed to facilitate certification processes. GCCI was asked to submit a list of priority certifications to guide support efforts.

PCDMA seeks relief from FBR over confusion surrounding new sales tax requirement,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318886-pcdma-seeks-relief-from-fbr-over-confusion-surrounding-new-sales-tax-requirement,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Chemical and Dyes Merchants Association (PCDMA) has expressed serious concern over the difficulties traders are facing in filing their sales tax returns, following a new requirement introduced by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Under SRO 55(I)/2025, the FBR has made it mandatory for all registered commercial importers, distributors, and wholesalers to declare their stock position in Annexure H1 with each monthly sales tax return.
However, PCDMA Chairperson Salim Valimuhammad said that the absence of clear guidance from the FBR has led to unnecessary confusion and hardship. He explained that many traders submitted their March 2025 returns without Annexure H1 simply because they did not understand the process. As a result, they were unable to declare their opening stock for April, and the issue remains unresolved even in June.
“PCDMA has received numerous complaints from members who are still unable to file their April 2025 returns due to this confusion,” Valimuhammad said. He added that many traders were forced to approach the FBR repeatedly for clarification. Eventually, the FBR allowed revised returns to be filed without amending Annexures A or C or requiring commissioner approval -- but by that time, it was too late for many.
To resolve the matter, PCDMA is urging the FBR to grant traders a 60- to 90-day grace period for submitting Annexure H1 after filing their returns. This would mirror the 120-day window already available to manufacturer-exporters.
“PCDMA believes that such decisions should be taken in consultation with trade bodies,” Valimuhammad said. He stressed that timely and clear communication is essential to ensure compliance and prevent similar issues in the future.

Central bank forex reserves fall by $7m to $11.51bn,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318887-central-bank-forex-reserves-fall-by-7m-to-11-51bn,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange reserves decreased by $7 million to $11.509 billion in the week ending May 30, the State Bank of Pakistan said on Thursday.
The total liquid foreign reserves held by the country also reduced by $39 million to $16.598 billion. Similarly, the reserves of commercial banks fell by $32 million to $5.089 billion.The SBP’s reserves experienced a slight weekly decline; nonetheless, they remain steady overall due to a current account surplus, despite external debt repayments. Additionally, inflows from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), rollovers from friendly nations, and the SBP’s dollar buying from the market played a crucial role in bolstering forex reserves.
The SBP received the second tranche of $1.023 billion from the IMF on May 13 under the $7 billion loan programme.The SBP purchased $5.9 billion from the interbank market between June 2024 and February 2025 to boost its reserves and meet external debt repayments. In February, the SBP bought $223 million worth of foreign currency from the market, up from $154 million in the previous month. However, to meet the revised $14 billion FX reserves target by the end of the current fiscal year, the central bank needs to generate an additional $2.5 billion. Pakistan expects to receive $1.4 billion in climate funding already approved by the IMF under its Resilience and Sustainability Facility.

Call for public consultation on draft prudential regulations for SME financing,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318888-call-for-public-consultation-on-draft-prudential-regulations-for-sme-financing,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has made a comprehensive review of the prudential regulations (PRs) for SME financing to promote sustainable, responsible and inclusive SME finance, a statement said on Thursday.
In addition to the introduction of some new regulations, several existing PRs have also been revised to make the PRs principles based, remove structural barriers in SME finance, encourage banks to leverage technology, and foster partnerships with fintech companies and other non-financial service providers to better serve the financing needs of the SMEs.
The consultation period will be open for two weeks from June 5-20. “The feedback so received will help us to further align the prudential regulations for SME finance with the SMEs’ market dynamics,” the SBP said. “The SBP encourages all the stakeholders including the banks, business analysts, trade bodies and public at large to share their valuable feedback on the draft PRs,” it added.

Rupee gains against dollar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318890-rupee-gains-against-dollar,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee closed higher against the dollar in the interbank market on Thursday.
The rupee ended at 282.17 per dollar, compared with Wednesday’s close of 282.22.In the open market, the rupee fell slightly, trading at 284.4 against the dollar, down from 284.38 in the previous session.
Dealers said that the local currency gained ground as dollar selling by exporters and remittances surpassed demand for the US currency by importers.“The rupee, rather than gaining with only two days remaining before Eidul Azha, when remittances from expatriate Pakistanis typically increase, is experiencing downward pressure caused by payment obligations,” a currency dealer said.
Dealers said that the pressure on the currency eased as remittance inflows rose ahead of Eidul Azha this weekend.  The financial markets will be closed from June 6-9 for the Eidul Azha holidays.Market participants are closely watching budget-related news to get insight into the future direction of the rupee. The annual budget for the fiscal year 2026 is set to be unveiled on Tuesday (June 10).

Report analyses impact of solar imports on Pakistan’s power sector,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318891-report-analyses-impact-of-solar-imports-on-pakistan-s-power-sector,"KARACHI: Renewables First, a think tank on energy and environment, has launched a new report titled ‘Leader of One or Leader of None - China’s Choice for Clean over Coal in Pakistan’, which examines China’s growing paradox in the Global South: acting as both a clean energy powerhouse and a financier of fossil fuels, with Pakistan serving as a pivotal case study.
America’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement threw international climate action into uncertainty, raising questions over who, if anyone, might assume global leadership in the fight against climate change. Several de facto contenders have since emerged -- though not formal leaders, they are influential players shaping the global energy transition. Paradoxically, the world’s largest carbon emitter -- China -- has emerged as a dominant force in clean energy manufacturing. It is now supplying much of the world with renewable energy technologies that are essential to combating climate change.
These very technologies have recently triggered a major energy shift in Pakistan, referred to in the report as the ‘solar rush’. Unlike transitions led by government proclamations or boardroom strategies, this shift is happening on rooftops, farms and factory sheds across the country. In just five years, over 39 GW of solar panels -- almost all sourced from China -- have entered Pakistan, a volume surpassing three-quarters of the country’s installed generation capacity. Yet this remarkable transformation has gone largely unnoticed globally, and its implications for climate leadership remain underappreciated.
The report explores this transformation in depth, underscoring China’s dual role in the Global South as both a key fossil fuel investor and a leading supplier of solar and wind technologies. It unpacks the dynamics of the Solar Rush, revealing how one of the world’s fastest-growing, people-led solar markets emerged -- not through grand strategies -- but through open trade, competitive pricing and an influx of affordable technology.
Between 2020 and early 2025, China exported more solar panels to Pakistan than to many G20 countries -- over 16 GW in 2024 alone -- with momentum continuing to build. However, as solar adoption surged, Chinese-backed coal power plants in Pakistan began to look increasingly like stranded assets. Once considered critical to energy security, these coal plants are now facing drastically reduced utilisation -- as low as 4.0 per cent in some cases by 2024. Meanwhile, capacity payments have soared, and grid electricity has become more expensive for remaining consumers.
“China’s solar panels are outcompeting China’s power plants,” said Muhammad Basit Ghauri, lead author of the report. “What we are seeing is an unintentional but profound strategic contradiction. And Pakistan is ground zero for this global experiment in energy disruption.”
At the heart of the report lies a pressing question: Will China embrace its role as the world’s clean energy leader, or will it default to a status quo that leaves its investments at risk and its global leadership unfulfilled?
The report emphasises that while the opportunity for leadership remains, it is quickly diminishing. With decentralised solar now displacing centralised power generation, Pakistan’s needs have evolved. It now requires not only panels but also storage solutions, grid upgrades, local manufacturing, financial instruments, and a roadmap to transition away from stranded coal assets.
Pakistan may be the first country to witness such a large-scale clash between legacy coal and decentralised solar, but it will not be the last. If China navigates this challenge successfully, it could not only lead Pakistan’s energy transition but also cement its role as architect of a new energy paradigm for the Global South -- one that is rapid, equitable and truly transformative.

"EU has existing tools to reduce pain of steel tariffs, says Thyssenkrupp executive",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318892-eu-has-existing-tools-to-reduce-pain-of-steel-tariffs-thyssenkrupp-executive-says,"BRUSSELS: Europe already has tools to reduce the impact of Trump tariffs and Chinese over-capacity on the EU steel industry, such as stopping Russian imports of the metal, a Thyssenkrupp executive board member said on Thursday.
The EU banned steel imports from Russia after its invasion of Ukraine, with its shipments to be phased out incrementally.Stopping those completely is among the tools the bloc can use to help its steel industry weather Trump tariffs and a Chinese supply glut, Thyssenkrupp board member Ilse Henne said during a conference with EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic.
“There is still Russian steel coming into Europe. How much? Three to four million (tonnes a year),” Henne said. “And it is very easy to stop that.”
“Security starts in making sure that industries survive today. And for the steel industry, that means simply applying a number of defence instruments that we already have.”The EU is also currently negotiating a trade agreement with India, with talks due to conclude by the end of this year. India’s federal trade minister Piyush Goyal said in April India was trying to secure greater access for its steel exports to various markets, including the EU.
Henne said Europe was “at the edge” in its negotiations with India. “There is a solution, or a high risk that Indians dump following the Chinese deals on the market,” she said.The EU already fears much of China’s steel and aluminium production will be rerouted from the US to flood Europe, as Chinese state aid has created a supply glut.
The commission already tightened existing steel import quotas by 15 per cent in April and is working on replacing those safeguards with a tighter system ahead of their expiry next year.It is also examining how to set aluminium safeguards, as well as possible export duties on metal scrap.

ECB cuts rates again but pause seen ahead,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318893-ecb-cuts-rates-again-but-pause-seen-ahead,"FRANKFURT: President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Christine Lagarde said the ECB was in a “good place” to deal with global uncertainty as it cut interest rates again on Thursday, fuelling expectations it might soon hit pause after a lengthy easing cycle.
The ECB cut its key deposit rate a quarter point to 2.0 per cent, as widely expected, its seventh consecutive reduction and eighth since June last year when it began lowering borrowing costs.
It also lowered its inflation forecast, with the indicator now expected to hit the central bank´s two-percent target this year, as US President Donald Trump’s tariff blitz exerts downward pressure on prices.
As inflation has stabilised following a post-pandemic surge, the ECB has shifted its focus to dialling back borrowing costs to relieve pressure on the 20 countries that use the euro.Trump’s tariffs have added to the uncertain outlook, with Europe firmly in his crosshairs, fuelling fears about a heavy hit to the continent’s exporters.
But Lagarde struck a measured tone. While the US trade war was causing problems, she noted signs of growing strength in the eurozone economy as well as a potential future boost from plans for greater infrastructure and defence spending.
She refused to comment directly about whether the ECB would pause its cuts at its next meeting in July, as some expect, but she stressed repeatedly that the central bank was in a “good place”.
“We are in a good position to navigate the uncertain conditions that will be coming up,” she said.“I think we are getting to the end of a monetary policy cycle,” she added.
The ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9 per cent, and also noted inflation was now around its two-percent target -- dropping previous language that it was “on track”. Eurozone inflation came in at 1.9 per cent in May.
‘Summer pause’
ING bank analyst Carsten Brzeski said Lagarde’s comments signalled a “summer pause” to its rate cuts.“It will take a bit longer to understand whether the current disinflationary risks are merely one-offs or whether they signal a broader trend,” he said.
But he added he expected one more cut from the central bank this year, likely in September.The ECB’s series of cuts stands in contrast to the US Federal Reserve, which has kept rates on hold recently amid fears that Trump’s levies could stoke inflation in the world’s top economy.
Lagarde also knocked back suggestions she could cut her term short following reports she had discussed taking the helm of the World Economic Forum.“I have always been and I’m fully determined to deliver on my mission and I’m determined to complete my term,” she said.
Trump tariffs blitz
Trump, who argues his tariffs will bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, has already hit the EU with multiple waves of levies.
The bloc currently faces a 10-per cent “baseline” tariff as well as higher duties on specific sectors.He has paused even higher rates on the EU and other trading partners to allow for talks, but he continues to launch fresh salvos that are keeping the world on edge.
This week he doubled tariffs on aluminium and steel from 25 to 50 per cent and last month threatened the EU with an escalation if it did not negotiate a swift deal.Trump’s tariffs are expected to exert downward pressure on eurozone consumer prices, and Lagarde conceded the inflation outlook was “more uncertain than usual”.
This is due to factors including tariff-hit China redirecting inexpensive manufactured goods to Europe, recent strengthening of the euro and potentially lower energy prices.Lower inflation and still tepid growth should push the ECB to make further rate cuts.
There are some factors that make this uncertain though.These include signs of resilience in the eurozone economy at the start of the year and a potentially inflationary spending blitz planned by the new German government.

Next budget may blend support measures with fiscal tightening,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318894-next-budget-may-blend-support-measures-with-fiscal-tightening,"LAHORE: The Pakistan government is expected to adopt a mix of public appeasement measures and revenue-boosting reforms -- particularly under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As these two goals often conflict, the impact on ordinary citizens will depend on how effectively the government balances them.
Should the government seek to appease people while aggressively raising revenues to satisfy IMF conditions, it is likely to resort to indirect taxation alongside selective relief schemes. This approach is considered regressive: it shields only the very poor while placing a heavier burden on the rest of the population.
Potential public appeasement measures may include increased social protection spending, such as the expansion of stipends or coverage under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP). One-off cash payments to the poorest families, similar to those announced in 2020 and 2023, could also be introduced. These would aim to soften the political impact of austerity. Other likely measures include subsidised utility support programmes for low-income households. While these would provide some relief, the benefits would be limited -- especially if inflation rises and real incomes decline.
Public sector employees may receive a 10-15 percent increase in salaries and pensions. This would offer some support to the middle class employed in government, but it could also add to inflationary pressures -- particularly if not accompanied by new revenue sources or spending cuts elsewhere. It would also increase the fiscal deficit unless offset by additional taxation.
The upcoming budget is expected to continue or even expand utility subsidies. Lifeline electricity units (50-100 units per month) are likely to remain subsidised, and new gas subsidies for tandoors and low-usage households may be introduced. These measures would ease the energy burden on low-income groups but could deepen the fiscal deficit or necessitate cross-subsidisation, pushing higher costs onto industry and middle-income consumers.
Development spending in politically important constituencies may also be used as a tool for electoral gain. Targeted schemes such as roads, water supply and school infrastructure in Punjab, Sindh, or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa may be announced. While these projects could create short-term employment and modest local improvements, their long-term impact on poverty would be limited unless supported by maintenance plans and local procurement strategies.
To meet IMF revenue targets -- estimated to require an additional 1.5-2 per cent of GDP -- the government may roll back several tax exemptions. Zero-rating or reduced GST on sectors such as fertilisers, pharmaceuticals, textiles, or essential food items could be curtailed. Exemptions for retailers and specific sectors may also be withdrawn. These moves would likely push up prices, hurting both the middle class and the poor unless compensated through targeted subsidies.
Efforts to broaden the tax net may include stricter enforcement against retailers, real estate dealers, and agricultural income earners. Enhanced compliance through track-and-trace systems, digital invoicing, and point-of-sale (POS) integrations is expected. If implemented fairly, these reforms could reduce the tax burden on salaried workers over the long term. In the short run, however, they may provoke pushback from vested interests and contribute to price hikes.
There is also speculation that the government may raise the general sales tax (GST) or the petroleum levy. GST could be harmonised at a standard 18 per cent rate, while petroleum levies might be increased. These steps would be highly inflationary, disproportionately affecting transport and food costs -- burdening lower-income households the most.
Fuel price adjustments and electricity tariff hikes have already been signalled and would further tighten household budgets by reducing disposable income.
The overall impact of the forthcoming budget on ordinary citizens will vary across socio-economic groups. The poorest 20 per cent may receive targeted relief through BISP and energy subsidies, but these gains risk being eroded by inflation caused by indirect taxation and higher utility costs.
The lower-middle class is likely to suffer the most, as they typically do not qualify for direct subsidies yet bear the brunt of inflation and increased taxation. Salaried middle-income earners may benefit from pay raises, but will likely see a net loss in purchasing power due to higher indirect taxes.
Small businesses will face increased tax scrutiny, rising input costs, and shrinking consumer demand amid inflation. Meanwhile, the agricultural and informal sectors may be drawn into the tax net -- a politically sensitive but economically necessary step -- which would raise their input costs as well.

Tesla shares down as Trump fires back at ally Musk,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318895-tesla-shares-down-as-trump-fires-back-at-ally-musk,"Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and self-proclaimed ‘First Buddy’ of US President Donald Trump, has stepped up criticism of the president's massive tax legislation in recent days. Investors are starting to notice.
Tesla shares dropped more than 5.0 per cent on Thursday on a day otherwise devoid of news for the electric vehicle maker, leading traders to speculate that Musk’s increasingly pointed rhetoric suggests strain in the relationship that has benefited his sprawling empire of businesses.
President Trump said on Thursday that Musk was upset because the bill took the EV mandate away.“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” the president said.
“He said the most beautiful things about me. And he hasn’t said bad about me personally. That’ll be next. But I'm very disappointed.” Trump's comments extended a decline in Tesla shares.

SBP issues nationwide licence to Halan Microfinance Bank,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318896-sbp-issues-nationwide-licence-to-halan-microfinance-bank,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Thursday it had issued a nationwide microfinance banking licence to Halan Microfinance Bank Limited, the latest effort by the central bank to increase financial inclusion and promote digital payments in the country.
MNT-Halan, Egypt’s top fintech, acquired Advans Pakistan Microfinance Bank last year and subsequently rebranded it as Halan Microfinance Bank.
“The [SBP] has granted a nationwide microfinance banking licence to Halan Microfinance Bank Limited with effect from June 3, 2025,” it said in a statement. “ MFB has recently been acquired by MNT-Halan, which has a global presence, offering business and consumer lending, digital payments and e-commerce solutions to the underserved and unbanked,” it added.
The SBP aims to enhance the level of financial inclusion in the country to 75 per cent and reduce the gender gap to 25 per cent by 2028. The National Financial Inclusion Strategy for 2024-2028 reports that financial inclusion, measured by the percentage of the adult population with a bank account, has risen from 16 per cent in 2015 to 64 per cent in 2023. There is a significant opportunity in Pakistan’s fintech sector, driven by a large unbanked population, high mobile phone penetration and increasing digital adoption, along with regulatory support for fintech innovation.
The national licence will enable Halan Microfinance Bank to expand beyond Sindh to the rest of the country, the bank said in a statement. “The national licence permits the bank to launch and manage financial services, including branchless banking, cards, mobile banking, retailer-based transactions and wallet services. These services will complement the bank’s current product suite, which includes microfinance, salary advances, pensions, current accounts and savings accounts,” it said.
The bank targets the financially underserved by offering unsecured and low-ticket funding with minimal documentation, fast processing and competitive monthly instalments. The bank offers funding specifically for women, agricultural workers and commercial vehicles. This inclusive model enables microentrepreneurs, small traders and low-income segments to achieve financial independence, often without collateral.

inDrive launches new business mode in Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318897-indrive-launches-new-business-mode-in-pakistan,"KARACHI: Ride-hailing platform inDrive has introduced a new business mode for its delivery services in Pakistan, specifically tailored for entrepreneurs and small businesses. According to a press release issued on Thursday, the feature set was developed in response to a 36 per cent surge in business-to-business activity over the past six months.
The new mode offers a range of benefits for regular business delivery users, including in-app package insurance, priority support and advanced delivery options. In Pakistan, small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly turning to courier apps to achieve greater speed, flexibility and control in their delivery services.
According to a study by inDrive, the main reasons business users prefer the app include the ability to book multiple couriers at once (63 per cent), faster delivery times (57 per cent), and real-time tracking and control (48 per cent). While 58 per cent of businesses still primarily operate offline, many are now adopting digital tools to meet rising customer expectations.
The Business Mode is specifically designed to support the transition from traditional delivery methods to digital solutions. It includes insurance coverage of up to Rs10,000 in case of package loss or theft.
Per inDrive’s Country Lead Muhammad Owais Saeed, “Pakistani entrepreneurs are pragmatic, determined and increasingly moving towards digital channels. Business Mode has been developed keeping these evolving needs in mind.”

Kohli ‘lost for words’ after 11 die celebrating Bengaluru IPL win,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318916-kohli-lost-for-words-after-11-die-celebrating-bengaluru-ipl-win,"BENGALURU: Virat Kohli said he was lost for words after celebrations of a dream IPL title turned to tragedy when 11 mainly young cricket fans were crushed to death in Bengaluru.
Hundreds of thousands had packed the streets Wednesday to welcome home their hero Kohli and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) after they had beaten Punjab Kings a day earlier in a thrilling Indian Premier League final.  But the euphoria of the vast crowds in the southern tech city of Bengaluru ended in disaster, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling it “absolutely heartrending”.
Karnataka state Chief Minister Siddaramaiah said most of the 11 dead were young people and there were 47 others injured in the crush after a stampede near the city´s M. Chinnaswamy cricket stadium, where the players were parading the trophy for fans.
Kohli, who top scored in the final, said earlier it had been “as much for the fans” after the 36-year-old finally celebrated winning the IPL at his 18th attempt.  Later, Kohli wrote on social media: “At a loss for words. “Absolutely gutted,” he added, alongside a statement from the RCB team saying they were “deeply anguished” at what had unfolded.
One of the people injured described to AFP how a “huge crowd” had crushed her. “They stamped on me,” said the woman, who did not give her name, from a wheelchair.  “I was not able to breathe. I fell unconscious.” Most of the dead were young fans who had gone out just to catch a glimpse of their sporting heroes.
Street food vendor Manoj Kumar mourned the death of his 18-year-old son, killed in the stampede, who he said he had stopped from working on his stall so he could study.  “I wanted him to go to college,” Kumar told the Indian Express newspaper. But organisers pressed ahead with the welcome ceremony and celebrations inside the stadium.

China suffer more World Cup heartbreak after Indonesia loss,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318917-china-suffer-more-world-cup-heartbreak-after-indonesia-loss,"Jakarta: China´s hopes of reaching only a second World Cup in their history were ended on Thursday after a 1-0 defeat to Patrick Kluivert´s Indonesia in Jakarta.
Ole Romeny scored the only goal, his controversial penalty just before half time following a VAR check leaving China rooted to the bottom of Asian qualifying Group C with one game remaining.
President Xi Jinping once said he wanted China to win the World Cup, but this defeat means they have still only been to the tournament once, in 2002. “As a coach of course I have the responsibility for the result,” said manager Branko Ivankovic, who will likely face calls to quit.
The Croat said the future was bright for Chinese football despite the latest heartbreak. They have won just two of their nine games in this round of Asian qualifying, losing seven. “We brought the new generations and players into team China. I think we brought the motivation as well, I think this is where the future will be,” said Ivankovic.
The scrappy win leaves Indonesia in fourth spot to remain alive in qualifying for next year´s tournament in North America. A sell-out crowd of 76,000 at the Gelora Bung Karno stadium was sent into raptures after the Oxford United striker Romeny tucked away his spot-kick.
The 45th-minute goal proved to be the winner after a VAR review when Ricky Kambuaya went down under minimal contact. It came at the perfect time for the hosts, just before the break, following a drab first half. Indonesia have 12 points with one game remaining, with teams finishing third and fourth going into a further round of qualifying for 2026.

Deschamps banking on France depth against ‘best in the world’ Spain,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318918-deschamps-banking-on-france-depth-against-best-in-the-world-spain,"Stuttgart, Germany: France coach Didier Deschamps said his injury-hit side had the quality to trouble defending Nations League champions Spain in Thursday´s semi-final, with Germany or Portugal awaiting the winner in the title match on Sunday.
France will face the Euro 2024 winners Spain in Stuttgart missing first-choice defenders William Saliba, Dayot Upamecano and Jules Kounde who have 100 international caps between them.
But Deschamps has a history of pragmatism in such matters, leading France to triumph at the 2018 World Cup, and to the final in 2022, after campaigns that were also hit by selection worries.
Speaking to reporters in Stuttgart on Wednesday, the 56-year-old said he remained confident. “When it comes to a match against Spain, with their attacking potential, it´s not ideal but I wouldn´t say we are weakened,” he said.
“I´m counting on the guys who play on Thursday.” In attack France will be looking to Kylian Mbappe and freshly-minted Champions League winners Desire Doue and Ousmane Dembele of Paris Saint-Germain.
Deschamps praised Dembele, saying the forward “deserves the Ballon d´Or” for his dazzling season with PSG. “Over an entire season, and with the one Ousmane is having, he deserves it and that´s all I wish him.”
The coach said Dembele was ahead of Spain´s teenage talent Lamine Yamal, but the pair will share the spotlight on Thursday. “The Nations League can provide some answers, as can the Club World Cup,” said Deschamps.
After Saturday´s Champions League final, PSG coach Luis Enrique also backed Dembele for Ballon d´Or honours. Defender Ibrahima Konate joined the chorus on Wednesday. “What Ousmane has done this season is simply incredible,” said Konate. “Ousmane deserves the Ballon d´Or, period.” The wave of injuries leaves Liverpool centre-back Konate as the likely leader of France´s defence.

Former Sri Lanka spinner prosecuted for match-fixing,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318919-former-sri-lanka-spinner-prosecuted-for-match-fixing,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka´s former spin bowler Sachithra Senanayake on Thursday became the first to be prosecuted under a new law aimed at stamping out corruption in sport on the island.
The 40-year-old was indicted before the High Court in the southern city of Hambantota on match-fixing charges relating to a local tournament in 2020. He is currently on bail after being arrested in September 2023. He denies the charges.
Senanayake last played for Sri Lanka in 2016 and made 74 international appearances. He is accused of influencing two Lanka Premier League players to fix matches in 2020. Police said Senanayake is the first player to fall foul of a 2019 law that makes match-fixing a criminal offence.
A conviction could result in a maximum of 10 years in jail, a fine of up to 100 million rupees ($333,000) or both. Former sports minister Harin Fernando introduced the tough new law after saying the International Cricket Council (ICC) considered Sri Lanka one of the most corrupt cricketing nations.
Another former sports minister, Mahindananda Aluthgamage, told parliament in 2021 that match-fixing was rife in the country. Aluthgamage was jailed for 20 years in an unrelated corruption case.
Sri Lanka´s 1996 World Cup-winning skipper Arjuna Ranatunga in 2012 urged fans to boycott matches in protest against what he called “mismanagement, corruption and indiscipline” in the national team.

"Overton, Bethell back in England Test squad for first India Test",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318920-overton-bethell-back-in-england-test-squad-for-first-india-test,"LONDON: Jamie Overton was on Thursday handed a surprise recall to the England squad for the first Test against India while Jacob Bethell´s return creates a top-order selection headache.
Overton has been a regular in England´s white-ball set-up but won his solitary Test cap against New Zealand in 2022, taking two wickets and hitting an unexpected 97 with the bat. It is unclear whether the all-rounder will be fully fit to take the field at Headingley on June 20, having broken a finger during the recent one-day internationals against the West Indies. The England and Wales Cricket Board said the 31-year-old will be “assessed and reviewed daily” by its medical team.
Overton´s Surrey teammate Gus Atkinson is not fit after injuring his hamstring in England´s Test win against Zimbabwe last month. England have brought back pacemen Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse, both of whom missed the early part of the season with injury problems.
Woakes could edge out Sam Cook, who retains his place in the squad after a quiet debut against Zimbabwe. Rising star Bethell is back from Indian Premier League duty after winning the tournament with Royal Challengers Bengaluru. The 21-year-old impressed during his debut Test series in New Zealand in November and December, scoring three half-centuries at number three, and averages 52.
Vice-captain Ollie Pope and Zak Crawley were thought to be under pressure from Bethell´s reintroduction but the pair both scored hundreds against Zimbabwe. The Test at Headingley is the first in a five-match series.

Pakistan head coach aims to build sustainable cricket legacy,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318921-pakistan-head-coach-aims-to-build-sustainable-cricket-legacy,"LAHORE: Newly appointed Pakistan men’s white-ball head coach Mike Hesson has offered an in-depth look into his coaching philosophy, ambitions, and the challenges ahead.
In an interview, Hesson, known for transforming New Zealand into a competitive white-ball side, shared a blueprint for how he plans to elevate Pakistan cricket to global prominence. “Coaching is different from playing — it’s about maximizing talent and helping individuals grow.”
Drawing on years of experience coaching elite players globally, Hesson emphasized the importance of earning players’ trust through communication, empathy, and a clear sense of purpose.
A recurring theme in the conversation was Hesson’s holistic and individualized coaching style. “You can only coach a player once you understand the path they’ve been through,” he explained. “My approach is not to dictate how they must play, but to work around who they are and where they’re headed. It’s about seeing the person behind the cricketer.”
The 49-year-old New Zealander, who previously worked with Islamabad United in the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL), credits that experience for helping him familiarize himself with the local player pool.
“My PSL stint gave me a window into Pakistan cricket’s culture, talent, and work ethic,” he said, adding that his deeper immersion into the domestic circuit will now be part of his responsibilities as head coach. Discussing the balance between tactics, team culture, and technical guidance in white-ball cricket, Hesson underlined the significance of establishing expectations through pre-match preparation.
“It’s essential for players to know what’s expected of them. Culture evolves through communication. From a technical point of view, I observe before I intervene,” he noted. His methodology aims to combine careful analysis with timely support, allowing players the space to grow while still maintaining a structured, performance-driven environment.
On match days, Hesson adopts a supportive but non-intrusive role, reinforcing the captain’s authority on the field. Speaking about current white-ball skipper Salman Ali Agha, he said, “We do most of the planning before the game. Once we’re at the ground, it’s Salman’s time. I trust him to lead. I’ll offer options if needed, but I won’t interfere unless absolutely necessary.”
Looking ahead, Hesson is also eyeing long-term player development, and sees scouting as a crucial component of his role. “Pakistan is a vast country with immense talent. While I can’t be everywhere, I’ll definitely focus on identifying groups of emerging players,” he said.
He stressed the importance of establishing a clear pathway for domestic cricketers to graduate to the national team, ensuring that selections are based on performance and potential. “We’re looking for players who are multi-skilled, highly fit, exceptional in the field, and who understand the demands of their roles,” he added.
When asked what legacy he hopes to leave behind, Hesson was clear and heartfelt. “I want the public to be proud of this team — to say this is a side that gives everything, that plays tough, and earns respect. Win or lose, they’ll make life tough for the opposition. And if I walk away and everything collapses, then I haven’t done my job. Sustainability and succession planning are just as important as results.”

"Training concludes, Pakistan hockey team to leave for Malaysia tomorrow",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318922-training-concludes-pakistan-hockey-team-to-leave-for-malaysia-tomorrow,"KARACHI: The Pakistan hockey team has completed its third and final training session and will depart for Malaysia on Saturday (tomorrow) to participate in the FIH Hockey Men’s Nations Cup, scheduled to be held in Kuala Lumpur from June 15 to 21.
Sources in the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) revealed that in addition to the 18-member squad, two extra players will also travel with the team. As per FIH rules, teams can take two additional players on foreign tours. These players will not be part of the main squad unless an injury occurs.
Head coach Tahir Zaman told The News that the Green Shirts have completed their final phase of preparation for the Nations Cup. He said the tournament is crucial for Pakistan, as winning it would secure qualification for the FIH Pro League — one of the top international hockey competitions.
“Winning this event is our main target, as it will open the door to the Pro League, which is essential for the growth and strength of our team,” Zaman said. He added that the final training phase focused on tactical improvement and finishing. “We worked on decision-making, technical skills, and goal-scoring efficiency,” he explained.
Zaman said the team’s fitness levels have improved, and drills for drag flicks and penalty shootouts have shown promising results. “Our drag flickers and shootout players have improved their success rate,” he said, naming Sufiyan, Abdul Rehman, and Ammad Butt as the key drag flickers for the event.
He acknowledged that most teams in the tournament, except for Japan and Wales, are ranked higher than Pakistan, but expressed confidence in his players. “Our morale is high, and we believe we can beat any team,” he said.
Zaman explained that the team’s goal-scoring strategy is based on both field goals and penalty corners. “We aim to score 1–2 goals from open play and 1–2 from penalty corners in each match,” he said.
The coaching staff has also analyzed the playing styles, strengths, and weaknesses of rival teams using video footage. Before the tournament, Pakistan will play three practice matches in Malaysia. Zaman said this will help finalize their game plan. He said arriving a week early will help the players adapt to the weather and gain valuable international match experience during the three practice matches.

Ronaldo breaks Germany jinx as Portugal reach Nations League final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318923-ronaldo-breaks-germany-jinx-as-portugal-reach-nations-league-final,"Munich: Cristiano Ronaldo scored the winner in a 2-1 victory over Germany in Munich on Wednesday, sending Portugal through to the Nations League final and breaking his run of bad fortune against the Germans.
Ronaldo´s 68th-minute tap in, a record-extending 137th international goal, sealed a first win over Germany after five losses, the 40-year-old´s longest streak against any national side without tasting victory.
After a stuttering first half, Florian Wirtz produced a moment of magic to give Germany the lead three minutes after halftime, starting and finishing a clever burst through the middle and heading in the opener.
Portugal´s Francisco Conceicao ran 35 metres to score a brilliant solo goal, levelling things up with half an hour remaining. Conceicao´s goal was a fitting tribute to his father Sergio, who scored a hat-trick the last time Portugal beat Germany in a 3-0 win in 2000.
The stage was then set for Ronaldo, who had missed two solid chances earlier, to land the telling blow, turning in a Nuno Mendes pass from close range. Portugal, winners of the inaugural Nations League in 2019, will now face either European champions Spain or France in Sunday´s final at the same venue.
Portugal midfielder Bernardo Silva celebrated Ronaldo´s relentless desire to play and win. “It´s never easy -- I don´t know how old he is, I think he´s like 40 -- to still be hungry to go on every day,” said Silva. “We´re very happy to have him with us.”
The loss is a setback for Julian Nagelsmann´s Germany, who had lost just one of their previous 17 games. “It was a deserved defeat,” Nagelsmann told DAZN. “We gave the game away in the first half. Defensively we lacked the ruthlessness that we´ve had in recent games.”
Portugal had four players backing up from winning Saturday´s Champions League final -- and the ensuing celebrations -- but it was Germany who struggled to find rhythm early. The match started 10 minutes late due to a violent storm which left hailstones scattered across the turf.
Aleksandar Pavlovic mislaid several passes while Portugal´s approach of pressing Jonathan Tah almost paid dividends, with the defender insecure in possession. Ronaldo, greeted by Portuguese cheers and German boos every time he came near the ball, almost scored the opener six minutes in, but his shot was claimed by old La Liga sparring partner Marc-Andre ter Stegen, playing his first match for Germany since September 2024.

New Rangers boss Martin aims to win over fans as he targets Celtic crown,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318924-new-rangers-boss-martin-aims-to-win-over-fans-as-he-targets-celtic-crown,"LONDON: Rangers head coach Russell Martin said Thursday his “whole career has been based on proving people wrong” after he was unveiled as the new man in the Ibrox hot seat.
The 39-year-old former Southampton manager, who has signed a three-year contract with Rangers, has the daunting task of toppling champions Celtic, who have a stranglehold on the Scottish game.
Martin guided Saints to promotion to the Premier League last year but was sacked in December following one win from their first 16 games. The club were subsequently relegated. Rangers finished last season second in the Scottish Premiership under the caretaker management of former captain Barry Ferguson, having dismissed Philippe Clement in February.
Ex-Scotland defender Martin, who had a short loan spell as a player at Rangers in 2018 and has also managed MK Dons and Swansea, was asked at a press conference about negative reaction from fans to his appointment.
“To the fans, I have to win. I don´t think I´ve been the number one choice at any club I´ve been at,” he said. “By the time we´ve left every team I´ve been at, we´ve formed a real connection with the supporters. I hope this will be the same.
“My whole playing career was based on hard work and resilience. It was not done on talent.” Martin said success at Ibrox would be measured in trophies, admitting he had “a lot to prove”. Celtic have an iron grip on Scottish football, recently wrapping up a 13th title in 14 seasons. But Martin is confident he can eventually knock Rangers´ bitter Glasgow rivals from their perch.
“My whole career has been based on proving people wrong,” he said. “I got to the Premier League as a player, played international football. It´s the same as a manager. “I feel after five and a half years of being a coach and a leader, I love doing it. I will be all-in here with my energy and my love for it. Hopefully it will reflect on the pitch.”

‘Italian genius’ Inzaghi to coach Saudi Arabia’s Al Hilal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318925-italian-genius-inzaghi-to-coach-saudi-arabia-s-al-hilal,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia: Former Inter boss Simone Inzaghi was revealed as the new coach of Saudi Arabia´s Al Hilal on Thursday, days before they take part in the new-look Club World Cup.
The Italian, who led Inter to a heavy defeat in Saturday´s Champions League final, had earlier played down rumours of a two-year deal worth 50 million euros. “I am Simone Inzaghi and today begins my story with Al Hilal,” he said in a slickly produced video posted on X, in which he sips Arabian coffee and pins an Al Hilal lapel badge on his suit.
Inzaghi, 49, becomes just the latest high-profile footballing acquisition for oil-rich Saudi Arabia, which will host the World Cup in 2034. “The Italian genius is here,” Al Hilal posted. “Welcome, Simone Inzaghi.”
Inzaghi joins the likes of Ruben Neves and Aleksandar Mitrovic at Al Hilal, which let injury-hit Neymar go in January after just seven appearances since his arrival in August 2023. A source with knowledge of the negotiations last week told AFP that the “first option” for Cristiano Ronaldo, who has signalled he is leaving rival club Al Nassr, could be a move to Al Hilal.
Manchester United´s Bruno Fernandes this week said he rejected Al Hilal´s reported $135 million offer because he wanted to “continue to play at the highest level”. Inzaghi´s Inter slumped 5-0 to Qatar-funded Paris Saint-Germain in Saturday´s Champions League final. His departure was confirmed on Tuesday.
The former forward guided Inter to one Serie A title and two Italian Cups since joining in 2021. He took them to two Champions League finals in three seasons but lost both. On track to repeat the treble heroics of 2010 just a few weeks ago, Inter ended the season trophyless after falling away in each competition. Inter, PSG, Real Madrid and Manchester City are also among the 32 teams at the expanded Club World Cup, which starts on June 15.

‘Floating village’ to house thousands of Asian Games athletes,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318926-floating-village-to-house-thousands-of-asian-games-athletes,"Tokyo: Athletes at next year´s Asian Games in Japan will stay on a “floating village” cruise ship and in converted shipping containers, an organising official told AFP, defending the cost-cutting move.
The plan will see 4,600 athletes and officials housed on the ship for the duration of the Games, which are being held in Nagoya and the wider Aichi area from September 19 to October 4, 2026.
Organisers will lease a luxury cruise liner that will be docked at Nagoya´s port. A further 2,400 people will stay in temporary shelters made from shipping containers a short bus ride away, with the two locations accommodating about half of the 15,000 athletes and officials expected at the Games.
The rest will be in other accommodation, including in Tokyo where the swimming competition will take place. Local organisers were keen to avoid the cost of building a traditional athletes´ village, but Asian Olympic chiefs warned that any alternative must make sure athletes can meet and mingle together.
Kazuhiro Yagi, vice-secretary general of the Aichi-Nagoya Games organising committee, told AFP that they had listened to athletes´ opinions and wanted to “provide a service that satisfies them”.
“The cruise ship and container houses are in different locations, but they are only about 10 minutes apart by shuttle bus,” he said. “I don´t think it will be a problem at all with regards to being able to interact with other athletes.
“There is an aquarium and various other entertainment facilities in the area. I think they´ll be able to take a break, relax and come together.” The 2023 Games in China´s Hangzhou had about 12,000 athletes, making it the biggest Asian Games in history, with more competitors than the Olympics.
The Asian Games are back in Japan for the first time since Hiroshima in 1994. The country has held several major sports events since then including the pandemic-delayed Olympics in 2021, football´s World Cup in 2002 and the Rugby World Cup in 2019.
Yagi admits that there “still isn´t enough awareness” that the Aichi-Nagoya Games are happening, and says more needs to be done to spread the word. “I don´t think there is anyone in Japan who hasn´t heard of the Olympics or Paralympics, but my personal feeling is that maybe only half the population knows the Asian Games,” he said.
“Young people weren´t born when it was last held here 32 years ago, so I´d like them to find out that it´s a great event.” The Asian Games feature an eclectic mix of events, with bridge, kabaddi and dragon boat racing rubbing shoulders with traditional Olympic sports such as athletics, swimming, gymnastics and football.
The Aichi-Nagoya Games has added mixed martial arts to the programme and Yagi hopes its debut will showcase Asia´s diverse martial arts traditions and attract new fans. “We want to appeal to the needs of young people, so including new events is essential,” he said.
“We want to include mixed martial arts so that we can get the younger generation interested in sport.” Esports proved a huge hit on its full Asian Games debut in Hangzhou, with fans packing into the futuristic 4,500-seat arena to watch star gamers like South Korea´s Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok.
Aichi-Nagoya will be the first time Japan has hosted an eSports competition on such a large scale, and Yagi thinks its benefits will be felt by more than just young people. “Esports can help elderly people who don´t get a chance to exercise much,” he said.
“You use your fingers and make detailed movements, which I have heard is good for combating dementia. “I think this is a good chance for people of a wide range of ages to find out more about eSports.”

No England crisis ahead of Euros despite absence of star trio: Wiegman,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318927-no-england-crisis-ahead-of-euros-despite-absence-of-star-trio-wiegman,"LONDON: Sarina Wiegman insists holders England will not head to Euro 2025 in “crisis” despite the high-profile absences of Mary Earps, Fran Kirby and Millie Bright.
It has been a tumultuous period for Wiegman after Earps and Kirby announced shock retirements from international football and Chelsea captain Bright made herself unavailable for the Euros.
The trio started every game when England´s women secured their first major silverware at the 2022 Euros. Speaking after naming her squad for the title defence in Switzerland, Wiegman was adamant the Lionesses will rise to the challenge of replacing such accomplished players.
“They´ve done so much for us, so much for England. They´ve been playing the tournaments since I´ve been here, so it´s hard to replace them,” Wiegman told reporters on Thursday. “But there are also other players who have done really well and now those players get the opportunity to step up. So you have to move on.
“My experience before tournaments is that there is always noise. We expect noise until we go into the tournament. It doesn´t feel like a crisis at all.” Bright, who captained England to the World Cup final two years ago, said she felt unable “to give 100 percent mentally or physically” and needed a break from the international stage.
“In the last couple of days I found out. It´s sad, it´s disappointing. It´s not nice and I hope she feels well very soon,” Wiegman said. Amid claims that Wiegman´s managerial style had irked some of England´s stars, the Dutch coach hit back at the critics.
“It is not an unhappy group. You see parts of it. You are not in our environment all the time,” she said. “I can assure you the training sessions were very good last week. I have seen what has happened on pitch and off the pitch with the team. I´m really happy with where we are now.”
Earps reportedly stepped down after being told she was no longer guaranteed to be the first-choice keeper. Defending her approach to the delicate situation, Wiegman said: “For me, it´s really important that I am honest and treat people in the right way. Sometimes you have good news and sometimes you have bad news.
“I don´t beat around the bush. I can´t always control how people respond to that but afterwards we can just offer them support.” Wiegman received a boost as Chelsea forward Lauren James was declared fit to feature at the Euros.
The 23-year-old has not played since she suffered a hamstring injury during England´s Nations League win over Belgium in April. James was a key figure when the Lionesses finished as World Cup runners-up to Spain in 2023.
“It´s not a risk. She´s training really well at her club and she´s at the point we hoped she would be at this stage. She keeps progressing,” Wiegman said. Arsenal´s Michelle Agyemang, a 19-year-old forward who scored just 41 seconds into her England debut in April, also made the squad despite playing only 10 minutes of international football.
“She brings something different. I hope she can show it in the summer. We all remember her goal against Belgium,” Wiegman said. Agyemang is one of seven players making their major tournament debuts, while Chelsea defender Lucy Bronze is set for her seventh, including four consecutive Euros. England start their Euro campaign against France on July 5 before also facing the Netherlands and Wales in the group stage.

"Kean to miss Italy qualifers against Norway, Moldova",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318929-kean-to-miss-italy-qualifers-against-norway-moldova,"ROME: Italy will be without Fiorentina striker Moise Kean for their two opening World Cup qualifying matches, away against Norway on Friday and at home against Moldova on Monday, the Italian football federation said.
Kean sustained a muscle strain in his right thigh during training on Wednesday, the federation said, adding that he had returned to his club for recovery. The 25-year-old enjoyed the best season of his career in 2024-25 with Fiorentina, a club he joined last summer from Juventus, scoring 19 goals to finish second in the Serie A goal scorers´ standings.
Italy coach Luciano Spalletti will also be without a pair of defenders, Alessandro Buongiorno missing the Norway match through injury while Francesco Acerbi, who was in the Inter Milan side that lost the Champions League final, declined a call-up.

Japanese startup attempts Moon landing,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318994-japanese-startup-attempts-moon-landing,"TOKYO: A Japanese startup will attempt a tricky lunar touchdown on Friday with an unmanned lander named Resilience, two years after its first try which crashed onto the Moon´s surface.
If successful, it will be only the third private mission to the Earth´s rocky natural satellite ever completed, and the first by a company based outside the United States. The startup, ispace, says touchdown is expected at 4:17 am Japan time on Friday (1917 GMT Thursday) with the potentially nail-biting attempt streamed on its website. Resilience is “ready to attempt a historic landing on the Moon” and “we are confident in our preparations for success”, ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada said last week.

West plans nuclear resolution against Iran: diplomats,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318996-west-plans-nuclear-resolution-against-iran-diplomats,"VIENNA: Western allies are planning to file a resolution to the world nuclear watchdog condemning Iran for “non-compliance” over its nuclear programme, diplomatic sources told AFP on Thursday.
It is the latest move in years-long efforts to restrict Iran´s nuclear activities over fears that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons, which it denies. The United States and European countries will submit the resolution to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) board next week, with the threat of referring the issue to the United Nations, the sources said.
After a recent IAEA report showed “a general lack of cooperation” by Tehran, the United States, Britain, France and Germany “are tabling a resolution that will find Iran in non-compliance” with its nuclear obligations, a senior diplomatic source said.
Recent rounds of talks between the United States and Iran, mediated by Oman, have aimed to secure an agreement on limiting enrichment in exchange for sanctions relief. Two other diplomats confirmed the resolution initiative in comments to AFP, saying it would “increase pressure” on Iran, with a vote scheduled at the IAEA board in Vienna on June 11.
Iran rejected last week´s IAEA report, calling it a “political” manoeuvre, and accused Israel of contributing “unreliable and misleading information” to it. The moves come with high tensions in the Middle East over Israel´s military offensive in Gaza.
Iran has denied seeking nuclear arms and says it needs the uranium for civilian power production. Diplomatic sources said the threat of action at the UN Security Council (UNSC), which can draw up sanctions, aimed to give Tehran “a last chance” to comply with western demands. One source said the allies would refer Iran to the UNSC in the coming months if Iran “does not show goodwill” but that Tehran would be given “a window to finally comply”.
