No possibility of Imran’s release before Eid,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317379-no-possibility-of-imran-s-release-before-eid,"ISLAMABAD: Rumours regarding possible release of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder chairman Imran Khan before Eid have been firmly rejected by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and government sources. Even the PTI doesn’t expect it to happen.
These denials come amid speculations in the media and political circles about a potential deal or legal development leading to Khan’s early release.
According to NAB officials, there is currently no case before any court that is ripe for Imran Khan’s release. “No notice has been issued to NAB in any matter that could result in his bail or release before Eid,” a source in NAB confirmed. They added that as per legal norms, the prosecution must be heard before any relief is granted to a convicted individual, which has not happened so far.
Government sources have also dismissed the speculation, categorically stating that no deal has been offered to Imran Khan, and there is no behind-the-scenes arrangement underway to facilitate his release. “There is no understanding, no negotiation, and no offer on the table,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. Imran Khan’s legal counsel, Naeem Haider Panjotha, also told reporters outside the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi on Saturday that the reports of Khan’s imminent release were false. “There is neither any deal nor any leniency being offered. The rumours are baseless,” Panjotha said following a hearing related to the May-9 violence cases. Despite these clarifications, some PTI leaders and media analysts speculated that Khan would secure bail before Eid. Their hopes are pinned on the upcoming June-5 hearing in the Islamabad High Court (IHC), where Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi have filed applications seeking suspension of their conviction in the Toshakhana case. However, NAB sources maintain that no notice has been issued in that matter yet. Legal experts also caution that such applications typically involve procedural delays and multiple hearings before any substantive relief is granted. Meanwhile, the broader legal landscape does not favour any near-term reprieve for the former prime minister. The IHC recently made it clear that Imran Khan’s appeal against a 14-year sentence in the £190 million Al-Qadir Trust case is unlikely to be heard in 2025. A report submitted by the IHC registrar’s office to a division bench stated that the appeal, filed in January 2025, remains at the motion stage and is subject to a case fixation policy that prioritises older cases. The report highlighted that 279 convict appeals are currently pending before the IHC, including 63 involving death sentences and 73 with life imprisonment. Given this backlog and the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee’s (NJPMC) directive to prioritise older cases, Khan’s appeal is not scheduled for a regular hearing in the current calendar year.

Gen Sahir urges inclusive stability mechanisms,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317380-gen-sahir-urges-inclusive-stability-mechanisms,"KARACHI: Chairman of Pakistan’s Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, delivered a wide-ranging and sobering address at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore, warning of the growing risks of conflict in South Asia and emphasising the urgent need for inclusive, institutionalised crisis management frameworks across the Asia-Pacific and beyond.
In a strongly worded speech, Gen Mirza emphasised that strategic stability must be built on trust, restraint and mutual recognition of red lines, rather than dominance or exclusion. “Mechanisms cannot function in a vacuum of trust or amid systemic asymmetries”, he said, stressing that “inclusion is not optional” when it comes to regional security architectures.
Gen Mirza’s remarks came during the prestigious annual security summit, which brings together defence ministers, military leaders and security experts from across the world. Representing Pakistan, Gen Mirza made it clear that both the Asia-Pacific and South Asia face escalating security threats -- driven by power rivalries, lack of dialogue and the failure to resolve long-standing disputes.
Focusing on South Asia, Gen Mirza pointed to the region’s “looming threat of a global scale”, referencing the unresolved Kashmir dispute, worsening India-Pakistan-China dynamics, and Afghanistan’s persistent instability. He warned that nuclearisation has increased the risk of strategic miscalculation, and that functional communication channels are essential in the face of rising tensions.
He criticised India’s growing militarisation and its perceived emboldenment by Western support, stating that “India’s ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options.”
Referring to the recent Pakistan-India crisis, Gen Mirza warned that the threshold for war between India and Pakistan has dangerously lowered, posing grave risks to the region’s 1.5 billion people. He also raised alarm over India’s actions targeting civilian areas and its threats to abrogate the Indus Waters Treaty, calling such moves “existential threats” to Pakistan and potentially “acts of war”.
“Pakistan has always preferred negotiated and diplomatic solutions”, he said, while reaffirming Islamabad’s position that peace with India must be based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and dignity.
On the broader Asia-Pacific region, Gen Mirza described a trend of rising militarisation and great power contestation. He noted that regional security continues to be shaped by extra-regional powers, with few organic structures in place to manage crises or mediate disputes.
He warned that without local ownership, external security frameworks would lack credibility. “Mechanisms transplanted into this region from outside will not have local respect and recognition”, he said.
Yet, he expressed cautious optimism, acknowledging efforts underway in the Asia-Pacific to improve cooperation and communication. He urged regional states to “move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution” and to revitalise existing bilateral, regional and multilateral structures, rather than invent new ones.
Gen Mirza offered a pointed critique of the global security environment, noting how “power and interests, not morality or principles, now reign supreme.” He cited the erosion of values such as state sovereignty and international law, and warned that multilateralism is being replaced by “myopic mini-lateralism.”
Amid this backdrop, he stressed the need for institutionalised crisis protocols, pre-agreed deconfliction procedures and joint exercises to avoid miscalculation. The spread of emerging technologies such as AI and cyber tools, he said, is further shrinking the decision-making window and complicating deterrence dynamics.
“Strategic communication matters”, Gen Mirza stressed, adding that “misconception, narrative warfare and information distortion are the oxygen for escalation.”
Gen Mirza reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position on Kashmir, calling for a resolution in line with United Nations Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people. He called it essential for ensuring lasting peace in South Asia.

Imran vows to lead anti-govt movement from jail,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317381-imran-vows-to-lead-anti-govt-movement-from-jail,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder chairman Imran Khan Saturday announced a country-wide protest movement against the government.
Talking to the media after meeting the party supremo in Adiala jail, Barrister Ali Zafar said the PTI founder had announced a protest movement against the government. However, Barrister Zafar, who is the party’s parliamentary leader in Senate, explained that the centre of the movement would not be Islamabad, but the entire country.
“The party founder has given me the responsibility to make a plan for the protest movement. I will present the plan for the protest movement in the next meeting with the party founder very soon. We will plan after consulting lawyers and party leadership,” he said.
He quoted the party founder as telling him that “we have been put against the wall; we have no option but to take to the streets. We will protest across the country, which I will lead from jail”. The PTI founder, he pointed out, expressed the resolve to give all instructions related to the protest movement from jail.
Senator Ali Zafar said the upcoming movement would be unlike any seen before. He emphasised that this time, the movement must succeed, acknowledging that while obstacles were inevitable, solutions must be found to overcome them. The PTI leader said the strategy of the protest movement would be ready in a few days, after the next meeting and that the party founder himself would assign responsibilities with regards to the proposed drive.
He quoted Imran having told him that they were not getting any relief from judiciary and the executive. “Whether there will be a hearing on June 5 (in the Islamabad High Court) or not is a question mark but we hope that we will get relief,” the party founder said.
Separately, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Secretary General Salman Akram Raja Saturday alleged that certain decision-makers were selectively allowing individuals to meet party founder chairman Imran Khan in an attempt to influence him into making decisions of their choice. “Let me be clear — this is impossible,” Raja told reporters outside Adiala jail. “Imran Khan fully understands what is happening, and who is being allowed to meet him and why.” He said the PTI founder was well aware of the loyalty and association of each party member and insisted that both the party and its narrative remained deeply rooted among the masses.
Raja expressed regret over being denied access to Adiala jail, despite being part of the legal team representing Imran Khan in a case being heard that day.
Regarding the expected nationwide protest movement, Raja said he was confident of support from the opposition alliance, Tehreek Tahaffuz Aayn-e-Pakistan.

Pakistan expresses concern over rise in Islamophobic incidents across India,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317382-pakistan-expresses-concern-over-rise-in-islamophobic-incidents-across-india,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has expressed grave concern over the alarming rise in Islamophobic incidents across India, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said on Saturday.
“Pakistan calls upon the Government of India to uphold the rights and safety of all its citizens, regardless of faith,” the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) spokesperson said in response to media queries about an increase in Islamophobic incidents across India.
“The targeting of Muslims through hate speech, discriminatory actions, and state complicity is a matter of serious concern for the international community,” the spokesperson said.
Since the April 22 Pahalgam attack, at least 184 anti-Muslim hate incidents have been recorded countrywide in India, as per Association for Protection of Civil Rights, a New-Delhi-based organisation.
Highlighting the hate speech and discriminatory actions against Muslims, spokesperson Khan said at a time when restraint and reconciliation are most needed, the deliberate incitement of religious hatred for political or ideological purposes violates international human rights obligations and vitiates the prospects for communal harmony, and regional stability.

"Two brothers killed, nine others injured in Quetta blast",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317383-two-brothers-killed-nine-others-injured-in-quetta-blast,"QUETTA: A powerful explosion rocked the outskirts of Quetta on Saturday evening, killing two brothers and injuring at least nine others. The blast occurred in the Killi Mangla area near Srah Khula, within the jurisdiction of Hanna Police Station in Quetta.
According to police, the explosion was caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted in the area. The device detonated with a loud blast, killing two sons of a man named Abdullah — identified as Abdul Salam and Abdul Nafi — on the spot. The explosion left nine others seriously injured, including Janan, Saifur Rehman, Samiullah, Zabihullah, Muhammad Asif, Naseebullah, and Jameel Ahmed.
The sound of the explosion was heard from a considerable distance, creating panic and fear in the surrounding areas. Emergency response teams, including police, local administration, and the bomb disposal squad, quickly reached the site. The area was cordoned off, and the bodies and injured were shifted to a hospital.

Afghanistan elevates Islamabad diplomatic mission to ambassadorial status,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317384-afghanistan-elevates-islamabad-diplomatic-mission-to-ambassadorial-status,"ISLAMABAD: A day after Pakistan upgraded its diplomatic ties with Afghanistan, Kabul also announced elevating its diplomatic post in Islamabad to full ambassadorial status, the Afghan foreign minister said.
“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan welcomes the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its diplomatic mission in Kabul to that of an ambassador,” the ministry wrote on X.
“In reciprocity, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan will elevate the status of its mission in Islamabad from chargé d’affaires to ambassador,” it said. The Afghan foreign ministry added that this elevation in diplomatic representation between Afghanistan and Pakistan paves the way for enhanced bilateral cooperation in multiple domains.

"IMF, Pakistan near consensus on cut in tax rates for salaried class",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317385-imf-pakistan-near-consensus-on-cut-in-tax-rates-for-salaried-class,"ISLAMABAD: The IMF and Pakistan are heading towards evolving consensus on proposed reduction in tax rates for the salaried class in the budget for 2025-26, it has been learnt.
However, it will be a challenge for the budget makers to achieve Rs14.2 trillion target in the next budget, as the basis for next fiscal year’s target has seen a widening tax shortfall in meeting downward-revised tax collection target of Rs12.33 trillion.
The IMF and FBR held hectic parleys on Friday night, and the Fund staff, in principle, granted broader permission to reduce tax rates in different slabs of the salaried class. The IMF has estimated this reduction will provide a relief of Rs56-60 billion in the coming fiscal year. The FBR will have to propose taxation measures in the income tax to bridge this gap.
“We have proposed certain taxation measures to satisfy the IMF for providing relief to salaried class in the coming budget,” a top official of the negotiating team confirmed to The News on Saturday.
The official said reduction in the proposed slabs of salaried class had not yet been worked out fully. The FBR proposed just one percent tax on the first slab, ranging from Rs0.6 million to Rs1.2 million earners per year, compared to the existing rate of 5pc.
The existing tax rate of 5pc for the first slab turns into Rs30,000 tax, and if proposed rate of 1pc is agreed, this tax paid amount will be reduced from Rs30,000 to Rs6,000 for earnings up to Rs100,000.
The IMF is insisting on collecting a 1.5pc tax rate from the first slab, so if a 1.5pc tax is imposed, then they will have to pay Rs9,000 tax.
For the remaining slabs, there is a proposed reduction of 2.5pc in each income slab of salaried class, and the maximum slab rate will be reduced from 35 to 32.5pc. However, exact calculation of the whole cost has not yet been ascertained and reconciled between the IMF and FBR high-ups.
When asked about the fate of surcharge of 10pc and imposition of Super Tax, the sources said surcharge and Super Tax would also be rationalised gradually, and a reduction in tax rates will kick-start from the next budget.
Top official sources confirmed the budget makers were worried about the proposed tariff rationalisation plan on imports because if the plan envisaged by the Commerce Ministry and National Tariff Commission was implemented, it would cost revenues to the tune of Rs200 billion.
It has been argued tariff reduction will kick-start sluggish economic activities, boosting revenue collection. If this argument is accepted, the revenue loss will stand at Rs150 billion in the coming budget.
The FBR high-ups were also perturbed with tariff rationalisation plan. They argue when tariffs on plenty of imported items were going to be reduced, how Customs officials would curb misdeclarations. There are growing apprehensions the higher tariff goods might be declared and cleared in lower tariff categories.
There is another apprehension the FBR target was going to be fixed on wrong assumptions, as in the first 11 months, shortfall in revenues widened to more than Rs1 trillion in comparison to original target of Rs12,970 billion for the current fiscal year. Although, the target was revised downward to Rs12,332 billion with the consent of IMF, achieving this target seems impossible by June 30, 2025.
In such circumstances, if the next year target of Rs14.2 billion was envisaged on the basis of a wrong assumption of Rs12,332 billion for the outgoing fiscal year, the next FBR target will be based on unrealistic numbers.
The IMF also raised objections over allocation of 2,000MW of electricity for mining of cryptocurrency without seeking prior approval from the Energy Ministry and its Regulator, Nepra.

Chenab water flow fluctuations very serious: IRSA,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317386-chenab-water-flow-fluctuations-very-serious-irsa,"ISLAMABAD: Following unilateral suspension of Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) 1960, manipulation by India in water flows has touched a new high, as Pakistan first received water deluge of 110,000 cusecs in Chenab at Marala on May 29 at 10-11am and then braved a massive dip of 105,200 cusecs to 4,800 cusecs on May 30 at 1am.
Pakistan Commission of Indus Waters (PCIW) is on alert and is monitoring the real-time data about water flows in Chenab River. The water flows fluctuations are away from normal discourse, a senior official of the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) told The News.
He said, “Now water flows in Chenab have returned to normal, as these have increased to 27,000 cusecs from 4,800. These days, Chenab usually receives normal flows in the range of 27,000-30,000 cusecs”.
The official said under paragraph 15 of the Treaty, when a deluge comes in Chenab, India can hold 50 percent water in pondages of its hydropower projects, and if flood situation worsens, India can release water of 130,000 cusecs. However, India has increased water flows up to 110,l00 cusecs. “PCIW is examining the erratic water flows and is in contact with top authorities of the country”, he said.
However, Punjab Irrigation Department said Central Punjab is being exposed to abnormal variations in water flows, which are adversely impacting the rice zone. “The erratic situation in Chenab flows has prompted Punjab government to request Indus IRSA to increase water flows from Mangla reservoir up to 25,000 from 10,000 cusecs which will impact Mangla filling.”
When contacted, IRSA spokesman Khalid Idrees Rana said PCIW gets the data on hourly basis, but Authority receives the mean (average) data of water flows. He said Chenab received the mean water flows of 69,100 cusecs on May 29 and 78,000 cusecs on May 30, which drastically declined to 22,700 cusecs on May 31.
Rana said fluctuations in water flows in Chenab are very serious. IRSA has increased the water flows from Mangla reservoir from 10,000 to 25,000 cusecs to cater to water needs of the rice zone in Central Punjab, he said. If this situation continues, water filling in Mangla Dam will be adversely impacted, he said, adding IRSA was storing water in Mangla Dam as per the hydrology in Jhelum River. Mangla Dam must be filled up to 80 percent till June 30 this month.
“The manipulation in water flows in Chenab by India has not only endangered the rice zone in Central Punjab but will also impact the Mangla filling,” he noted.

Arshad wins gold at Asian Athletics,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317387-arshad-wins-gold-at-asian-athletics,"ISLAMABAD: Olympic record holder, Arshad Nadeem, once again proved his mettle on the international stage, clinching the gold medal in javelin throw at the Asian Athletics Championship 2025 in Gumi, South Korea. His winning throw of 86.40 meters not only secured top honors but also reignited the nation’s sporting spirit, marking the end of a 51-year gold medal drought at the Asian meet.
Though not matching his personal and national best of 92.97m, achieved at the 2024 Paris Olympics, Arshad’s final throw was more than enough to outclass a strong field of competitors. He surpassed India’s Sachin Yadav, who took silver with a throw of 85.16m, and Japan’s Ryohei Sakiyama, who earned bronze with 83.75m.
Pakistan’s second entrant, Mohammad Yasir, finished in 8th place, managing a best effort of 75.39m.
Speaking moments after his golden throw — just before heading for a routine doping test — Arshad dedicated his victory to the people of Pakistan.
“I am thankful to the entire nation for its prayers, love, and continuous support. I am glad I could live up to the expectations and bring glory home,” he said with his signature humility. In an exclusive conversation with The News, Salman Butt, Arshad’s coach and mentor, revealed the hidden challenges the champion faced during the competition. “Arshad was physically drained following Friday’s intense qualifying round. For elite athletes like him, proper rest and recovery between rounds are critical. Competing on back-to-back days took a toll on his energy levels, and that reflected in his performance,” he explained.
Despite the fatigue, Arshad’s resilience and experience shone through. “He still managed to clear 86 meters on two separate throws within two days — an impressive feat by any standard,” said Salman.

Pakistani officials coming to US next week for trade talks: Trump,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317388-pakistani-officials-coming-to-us-next-week-for-trade-talks-trump,"WASHINGTON:  U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday representatives from Pakistan are coming to the United States next week as the South Asian country seeks to make a deal on tariffs.
Pakistan faces a potential 29% tariff on its exports to the United States due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.
Trump said he would have no interest in making a deal with the South Asian country or its neighbor, India, if they were to engage in war with each other.  “As you know, we’re very close making a deal with India,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One. Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.

"Joblessness crisis in KP: 866,000 applicants compete for 16,454 teaching posts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317390-joblessness-crisis-in-kp-866-000-applicants-compete-for-16-454-teaching-posts,"PESHAWAR: The growing unemployment crisis in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been starkly highlighted by the recently held teacher recruitment tests, where a staggering 866,000 candidates competed for just 16,454 vacancies across the province. The KP Education Evaluation and Testing Authority conducted the recruitment written tests for eight different teaching cadres, which include Primary School Teacher (PST), Certified Teacher (CT), Physical Education Teacher (PET), Theology Teacher (TT), Arabic Teacher (AT), Drawing Master (DM), Qari, Quran Teacher (QQT), and Computer and IT Teacher (CT-IT).
The test was held in 25 centres across various districts of KP under strict supervision, yet the overwhelming number of applicants reflects a deeper and more troubling reality — a massive shortage of employment opportunities.
On average, there is competition between more than 52 candidates for each seat, the figures are not only alarming but also symbolic of a system under immense pressure from educated yet jobless youth in KP.
On the other hand, over 6,000 candidates are awaiting interviews at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Service Commission, which is currently facing a shortage of members.
Education expert Professor Gulzar Jalal told this correspondent that many candidates hold master’s degrees, while some possess even higher qualifications, yet they are unable to secure teaching jobs at the primary or secondary level — a reflection of the shrinking public sector and stagnation in the private sector. The professor warns that if immediate measures are not taken to expand public sector jobs, investment in skills training and to create new employment avenues, the crisis may spiral further, leading to greater discontent among the population. Gulzar Jalal said the pronounced disparity between KP’s unemployment rate and the national average underscores the province’s unique economic challenges. Factors contributing to this situation may include limited industrial development, security concerns and infrastructural constraints.
“This is the need of the hour that our leadership introduce opportunities for the educated talent. The vitality of the educated class cannot be ignored,” he said
However, one hopeful applicant from Peshawar said this test is our last chance for a secure future, while another expressed frustration at the lack of options for qualified youth.
As of the most recent available data, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) had experienced a significant rise in unemployment. According to the 2020-21 labour force survey, the unemployment rate in KP surged to 8.8% from 8.6. This marks one of the highest unemployment rates among the provinces.
As many as 4.5 million individuals are unemployed in the country, with the youth aged 15-24 having the highest unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent, according to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2023-24.

"AQ Khan was betrayed after confession, says widow",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317391-aq-khan-was-betrayed-after-confession-says-widow,"KARACHI: Nearly four years after his death, the widow of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan says the personal cost of Pakistan’s nuclear programme remains unresolved -- and marked by betrayal.
Hendrina Khan says her husband accepted becoming the “scapegoat” for the country’s proliferation scandal on assurances from then-President Pervez Musharraf, but those promises were quickly broken.
“He accepted the role of scapegoat,” Hendrina said in an interview given to her granddaughter and posted on the latter’s YouTube channel, revealing that her late husband was given verbal assurances by the then president, including a full pardon and limited house arrest. “But within days, the terms changed. That betrayal hurt him deeply.”
Discussions on the importance of Dr AQ Khan’s role in making Pakistan a nuclear force reemerged following the recently celebrated Youm-e-Taqbeer event on May 28 at state level.
In a separate interview, responding to a question about Dr AQ Khan being overlooked during the celebrations, PM’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah said that while Dr AQ Khan is respected for his scientific contributions, he should not be considered a national hero.
Sanaullah asserted that the real credit for making Pakistan a nuclear power belongs to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who made the critical decision to conduct nuclear tests in 1998. He also acknowledged the late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for initiating the nuclear programme but maintained that Sharif’s leadership marked the defining moment.
As Pakistan reassesses its national security posture amid changing geopolitical dynamics, especially in the wake of the Pakistan-India standoff in early May, the story of Abdul Qadeer Khan remains a significant chapter in the nation’s modern history -- marked by scientific achievement, complex politics and lingering debate.
At home, Khan became a symbol of national pride. Abroad, he became a subject of scrutiny. In 2004, amid mounting pressure from the US and international watchdogs, Khan publicly accepted responsibility for proliferation-related activities -- a confession broadcast nationwide.
According to Hendrina, that statement came under duress. “He was assured protection and rehabilitation,” she said. “But within three days, Musharraf backtracked.”
The period that followed, she recalled, was marked by isolation and emotional strain. “It was not just about him -- the entire team faced humiliation. It was deeply painful.”
Despite the turmoil, Hendrina described her late husband as unwavering in his patriotism and sense of mission. “He always said he would only return to Pakistan if he could do something meaningful. That belief sustained him -- even during house arrest.”
She also reflected on the toll the project took on their family. Having moved from Europe to Pakistan in the mid-1970s, the couple and their young daughters faced stark living conditions, with little infrastructure or support. “Those first years were very hard,” she said.
Khan died in October 2021. While the state held an official funeral, Hendrina believes his contributions remain underappreciated. “His legacy has been obscured by politics,” she said. “But history will remember the difference he made.”

Rescue operations underway after Nigeria flooding kills at least 150,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317393-rescue-operations-underway-after-nigeria-flooding-kills-at-least-150,"ABUJA: Flash flooding earlier this week in central Nigeria killed more than 150 people, a local disaster response spokesman told AFP on Saturday, while displacing 3,000, levelling more than 250 homes and washing away two bridges.
The sharp jump from the previous death toll of 115 came as bodies were recovered nearly 10 kilometres (6 miles) away from the town of Mokwa, the epicentre of the floods, Ibrahim Audu Husseini, a spokesman for the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, told AFP.
As Husseini warned that the toll could still rise -- with bodies being swept away down the powerful Niger River -- President Bola Tinubu said that search-and-rescue operations were underway, with the disaster response being aided by security forces.
Tinubu, in an overnight post on social media, added that “relief materials and temporary shelter assistance are being deployed without delay” in Mokwa, which was hit by torrential rains late on Wednesday through to early on Thursday.
Buildings collapsed and roads were inundated in the town, which is located more than 350 kilometres (215 miles) by road from the capital Abuja, an AFP journalist in Mokwa observed on Friday.
Emergency services and residents searched through the rubble as floodwaters flowed alongside.
“Some bodies were recovered from the debris of collapsed homes,” Husseini said, adding that his teams would need excavators to retrieve corpses.
He said many were still missing, citing a family of 12 where only four members had been accounted for as of Friday.
Mohammed Tanko, 29, a civil servant, pointed to a house he grew up in, telling reporters: “We lost at least 15 from this house. The property (is) gone. We lost everything.”
The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said that the Nigerian Red Cross, local volunteers, the military and police were all helping in the response.
According to the figures shared by Husseini, 151 people were killed, 3,018 were displaced, 265 houses were “completely destroyed” and two bridges were washed away in the busy, rural market town.
The Nigerian Meteorological Agency had warned of possible flash floods in 15 of Nigeria’s 36 states, including Niger state, between Wednesday and Friday.
In 2024, more than 1,200 people were killed and 1.2 million displaced in at least 31 out of Nigeria’s 36 states, making it one of the country’s worst flood seasons in decades, according to NEMA.
Displaced children played in the flood waters on Friday, heightening the possibility of exposure to water-borne diseases, with at least two bodies lying nearby covered in banana leaves and printed ankara cloth.
Describing how she escaped the raging waters, Sabuwar Bala, a 50-year-old yam vendor, told reporters: “I was only wearing my underwear, someone loaned me all I’m wearing now. I couldn’t even save my flip-flops.” “I can’t locate where my home stood because of the destruction,” she said.

No visa restriction for India’s Sikhs: Foreign Office,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317394-no-visa-restriction-for-india-s-sikhs-foreign-office,"ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office has said that despite the visa restriction for Indian nationals as a reciprocal step by Islamabad, India’s Sikh community can get Pakistan’s visa in any number and any time so that they could visit their holy shrines.
To a query, acting spokesman for the Foreign Office and Additional Foreign Secretary Nabeel Munir explained Pakistan’s position in this regard. He told The News on Saturday that Pakistan has not closed down Kartarpur corridor for a single moment since India clamped restriction on the movement between the two countries.
“It is India that has blocked the entry for Kartarpur Sahib and incidentally no visa is required by Indian Sikhs from Pakistan for that,” the acting spokesman said.
He made it clear that India has closed all entry points with Pakistan border, however, Sikhs could come to Pakistan via Dubai or any other hub.
Meanwhile, sources told this scribe that Sikhs have started to come to Lahore in large numbers to attend the anniversary of martyrdom of the fifth Guru, Guru Arjan.
The Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi has been asked to issue visas for Sikhs liberally for the occasion so that they could come here to attend the anniversary’s rites. The Sikhs coming for Guru Arjan’s martyrdom anniversary would be allowed to visit Kartarpur Sahib in Narowal, Punja Sahib Hasan Abdal, Sachha Soda in Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib which is the birthplace of Baba Guru Nanak Sahib, without taking any further permission. The Punjab government has already issued directions that district administrations should provide all facilities to Sikhs keeping in view the harsh weather.

JUIF to launch drive against corruption in KP,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317375-juif-to-launch-drive-against-corruption-in-kp,"PESHAWAR: Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUIF) has announced a province-wide protest campaign against the widespread corruption, mismanagement and controversial legislation by the provincial government.
The decision was taken during a joint meeting of the party’s provincial executive council, members of the central executive body and the parliamentary party held at the Mufti Mahmood Centre in Peshawar.
The meeting was attended by JUIF chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, who was given a detailed briefing on various issues concerning the province. Party leaders presented complaints regarding corruption in public projects, including the alleged Rs 40 billion scandal in Kohistan, misuse of funds in solar energy schemes, the wheat procurement scandal and concerns over the Agricultural Tax and Mines and Minerals Bill.
After reviewing the issues, the leadership announced the launch of a public awareness and protest campaign, which will begin after Eidul Azha. The first protest rally will be held in Battagram on June 29, led by Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
The meeting also rejected the underage marriage bill and declared it contrary to Islamic values. Party leaders said they would challenge the bill in the Federal Shariat Court and begin a public campaign against it.
JUIF also criticised the provincial government’s decision to approve Rs80 million from the national treasury for the Lahore High Court Bar Association, calling it unfair to the people of KP. The Mines and Minerals Bill was similarly condemned as unconstitutional and against provincial interests.
The meeting was chaired by provincial JUIF chief Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman and attended by several senior leaders and members of the KP Assembly, including Maulana Ataul Haq Dervish, Maulana Lutfur Rehman, Adnan Wazir, Ijaz Khan Dawar and others.
Party leaders called for investigations into major corruption scandals, including the BRT project, Malam Jabba land case and the Billion Tree Tsunami project and demanded that those responsible be held accountable.

ADC laid to rest with full honours,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317376-adc-laid-to-rest-with-full-honours,"QUETTA: The funeral of Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Hidayatullah Buledi, who was martyred in a terrorist attack in Surab, was held with full state honours in his native town of Bhag in kachi district on Saturday.
His body was flown in by helicopter, and as the casket arrived, a wave of grief swept over the town, with mourners in tears and sorrow hanging heavy in the air.
A large number of people from all walks of life gathered to pay their final respects. The funeral prayer was attended by Additional Chief Secretary for Home Zahid Saleem, Commissioner Naseerabad Division Moeen ur Rehman Khan, Commissioner Kalat Division Shahzeb Kakar, Deputy Commissioner Kachhi Jehanzeb Baloch, Deputy Commissioner Surab Habib Nasir, senior officers of the divisional and district administration, Frontier Corps officials, tribal elders, political figures, and local citizens.
After the funeral prayer, a smartly turned-out contingent of Levies and police presented a salute to the fallen officer. His coffin, draped in the national flag, was laid to rest with honour. The martyrdom of ADC Hidayatullah has plunged the region into mourning, with political and social circles offering prayers for his elevated rank in the hereafter and patience for his grieving family.
Meanwhile, senior PPP leader and former Balochistan Chief Minister Nawab Sanaullah Zehri strongly condemned the attack. In a statement, Zehri said, 	Those who storm homes in the presence of women and children and commit such brutal acts have no right to call themselves Baloch.	 He described the assassination as a cowardly and shameful act, stating that action against the anti-peace elements behind the Surab attack is now inevitable.
Zehri emphasized that the terrorists targeting innocent civilians do not deserve any leniency. 	This attack was not just an act of terror, but a vile attempt to plunge Balochistan	s peaceful future into darkness,	 he said. He further criticized the attackers, claiming they were serving foreign interests while falsely claiming to represent Baloch identity. Zehri extended his condolences to the bereaved family and called on the government and security forces to take immediate and decisive action against those responsible.
ADC Hidayatullah Baloch was martyred in a terrorist ambush on Friday in the Surab area of Balochistan.

"Bystander killed, two others injured in firing over personal dispute",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317344-bystander-killed-two-others-injured-in-firing-over-personal-dispute,"A man was killed and two others wounded in a firing incident in the North Nazimabad area on Saturday.
The incident took place in North Nazimabad Block B near the Bismillah Masjid in Khandu Goth. As a result of the firing, one person was killed and two others, including a minor boy, were injured.
The victims were bystanders caught in the firing over a personal dispute.
According to police, 23-year-old Osama, son of Nasir, succumbed to his injuries while being shifted to the hospital. The injured persons included Jamil, 37, son of Mian Jan, and eight-year-old Shayan Ahmad, son of Azam.
The altercation reportedly stemmed from a property dispute between two brothers, Zafar and Asim. During the heated argument, Zafar opened fire discharging at least six rounds.
None of the parties involved in the dispute were injured; however, three innocent bystanders were hit.
Zafar, who is said to be a drug addict, fled the scene after the shooting. Police have launched a search and are conducting raids to apprehend him.
The body and the injured were taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. Further investigations are under way.

SHC recalls its stay order against transfer of NCCIA official,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317345-shc-recalls-its-stay-order-against-transfer-of-nccia-official,"The Sindh High Court has recalled its interim stay order in respect of appointment of a National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) official but observed that the impugned office order and any further steps shall be subject to the outcome of the petition.
The direction came on a petition of Sindh NCCIA director Shahzad Haider against his transfer and the posting of a junior officer as director.
The petitioner’s counsel, Zamir Ghumro, submitted that the impugned office order of the NCCIA was a violation of the earlier order of the court.
He submitted that the petitioner could not be transferred to the Federal Investigation Agency as he is now part of the NCCIA. He submitted that the respondent officer is a grade 19 officer and he cannot hold the look-after charge of the post of the director, which is a grade 20 post.
He further stated that under the amended Peca, the cyber wing of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had been abolished and all the staff sent to the NCCIA. The counsel submitted that sending the present director of the Sindh NCCIA, who was an employee of the NCCIA, to the FIA was a violation of Section 29 of Peca, which bars such transfers as the FIA has now no concern with cybercrime.
The deputy attorney general opposed the petition and submitted that being a civil servant, the petition is barred under Article 212 of the Constitution.
A high court division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Faisal Kamal Alam, after hearing the arguments of the counsel, observed that the office order was only with regard to the transfer and posting of officials and it is not prejudicial to the petitioner; therefore, the court recalled its earlier interim stay order in respect of the transfer of the petitioner.
The court however put the FIA and NCCIA on notice that the impugned office order and any further steps shall be subject to the outcome of the petition.
The NCCIA had earlier submitted that the agency’s impugned office order was a lawful administrative decision issued under Section 29(2) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) and it did not violate the petitioner’s fundamental rights.
The NCCIA submitted that the assignment of look-after charge given to another NCCIA officer was a temporary administrative measure justified by the operational needs and did not contravene the Rule 8(B)(1) of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Promotion and Transfer) Rules 1973 or any other judicial precedents.
The NCCIA additional director law submitted that the petitioner’s allegation of failure to fill the post of director through promotion was misconceived. He said the NCCIA was in the process of convening its central selection board to fill the post on a regular basis.
The law director said that giving the temporary assignment of look-after charge to another officer instead of the petitioner was lawful and did not infringe upon the petitioner’s right as seniority was not the sole criterion for such an assignment.

The meeting underscored the government’s commitment to inclusive development, poverty alleviation and sustainable progress in line with directives of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Opening the session, the CM remarked, “I want to engage all cabinet members thoroughly in shaping the next budget to ensure it addresses the real needs of our people.”
He added that under Bilawal’s leadership, the government had collected proposals from every district to make the budget representative and impactful.
Murad outlined the core focus areas of the new budget that are water supply and drainage, solar energy expansion, education, healthcare, agriculture and industrial growth.
“This year, we have not introduced any new schemes under the priority to complete ongoing projects,” he said. He added that for the upcoming budget, Bilawal had issued instructions for launching new initiatives that would bring tangible benefits to the people.
Key highlights from the meeting included continued rehabilitation efforts for flood-affected communities, repair of schools and hospitals, launch of new mega projects through public-private partnerships to boost infrastructure and services, strengthening social protection programmes aimed at eradicating poverty, and increasing budget allocations for repair and maintenance, as well as upgrading hospital equipment and completion of transport projects in Karachi to improve urban mobility.
Proposals presented by the cabinet members included reducing non-development expenditures and empowering local governments to help them become financially self-sustaining, introducing digital cash transfers with incentives to enhance social welfare delivery, expanding solid waste management and solar energy systems across the province, and constructing new bus stands in multiple districts to improve public transportation.
The CM highlighted the importance of coordination between the federal and provincial government. He stated that Sindh would finalise the coming budget based on the federal government’s funding commitments and its revenue targets to ensure fiscal responsibility and effectiveness.
“After Eidul Azha, we will hold further meetings to finalise and approve the budget proposals. Our goal is to present a budget that is transparent, development-oriented, and focused on improving the lives of every Sindh resident,” the CM concluded.

IO granted time to submit charge sheet against Armaghan in illegal call centre case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317348-io-granted-time-to-submit-charge-sheet-against-armaghan-in-illegal-call-centre-case,"A judicial magistrate has given more time to the investigation officer to submit a charge-sheet against Armaghan, the main suspect in Mustafa Amir murder case, in another case pertaining to running an illegal call centre.
Armaghan has been booked for his alleged involvement in harassment, cheating, spoofing, phishing and extortion through an illegal call centre in Defence Housing Authority.
The investigation officer (IO), Ameer Ali Khoso, appeared before the judicial magistrate (South) as the case came up for hearing.
The IO stated that he needed more time to submit the charge-sheet as required under the Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). He said he was yet to get the relevant record, due to which he could not submit the charge-sheet.
Allowing his request, the magistrate ordered the IO to submit the charge-sheet on the next date of hearing without fail.
Earlier, the IO had informed the court that Armaghan operated an illegal call centre under various dummy names since 2018, using fake personas and scripted communication to impersonate officials of credible foreign agencies to hoodwink victims into disclosing sensitive personal as well as debit/credit card data.
Then the unlawfully obtained data was used to carry out unauthorised financial transactions, purchase cryptocurrency and procure drugs on dark web, he said, adding that Armaghan maintained and operated multiple digital wallet accounts, including Binance, BitGo, Paxful, NoOnes and Coinbase.
""He further disclosed using third-party local bank accounts under the names of Rahim Bux, Abdul Rahim and Muhammad Hanif for transferring and withdrawing proceeds of crime,"" the IO said.
""The accused has confessed to using illegal crypto mining machines, purchasing stolen data from the Dark Web, and operating within an organised cybercrime network.""

Police solve case of food delivery rider’s murder in Hussainabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317349-police-solve-case-of-food-delivery-rider-s-murder-in-hussainabad,"Police have solved the blind murder case of a food delivery rider within 24 hours of the murder that took place in the Hussainabad area within the jurisdiction of Azizabad Police Station.
According to a spokesperson for the District Central police, police arrested four individuals for attempting to mislead the investigation and conceal the crime.
The spokesperson added that with the help of the information provided by the four suspects, police have launched the manhunt for the main suspect, Dilawar.
Two of the arrested suspects tried to paint the incident as a robbery bid that gone wrong, while the other two attempted to portray it as a case of a stray bullet. However, investigations revealed that Haris, who worked as a food delivery rider, was shot by their friend Dilawar.
Haris had come to Hussainabad to deliver food when Dilawar, acting like a street thug, used his weapon to intimidate him.
Dilawar reportedly forced Haris to do physical punishments at gunpoint. When Haris tried to de-escalate the situation and apologised, Dilawar opened fire.
The bullet fired by Dilawar pierced through one of Haris's thighs and lodged in the other. Haris was rushed to the hospital, but succumbed to his injuries due to excessive blood loss.
Police said they were making efforts to arrest the main accused, Dilawar, and raids were being conducted at various locations.

Society urged to foster understanding of individuals dealing with mental health issues,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317353-society-urged-to-foster-understanding-of-individuals-dealing-with-mental-health-issues,"We should not ignore the fact that mental health is a societal issue, and affects all genders equally—both men and women can struggle with it. Unfortunately, in our society, women’s mental health is often dismissed as drama, while men’s struggles are taken seriously. This mindset needs to change.
We must remember that drug addiction doesn’t just destroy an individual—it leads an entire nation toward devastation.
These views were expressed by Vice Chancellor University of Karachi Professor Dr Khalid Mahmood Iraqi while addressing the “Youth mental health and substance reliance awareness initiative” jointly organized by the KU’s Department of Political Science, Sports and Youth Affairs Department, Government of Sindh, and Legal Rights Forum. The event was held at the KU’s Audio Visual Centre on Friday.
He elaborated that one contributing factor to the rise in substance abuse is the lack of physical activity. “Our youth are deprived of opportunities for healthy engagement, and the state is reluctant to take responsibility. Across the world, the state has to ensure the welfare of its citizens and provide essential life facilities. However, our government has outsourced many of its responsibilities to NGOs, which is alarming.”
He highlighted that Pakistan’s future cannot prosper without economic growth. He observed that industrial development has nearly come to a halt, and investment in education remains insufficient. He emphasizes that instead of making lofty claims about a brighter future, we need to face ground realities and work towards tangible progress.
Professor Dr Khalid Iraqi shared that investment in education and economic growth is imperative for a prosperous future. Economic stability can also help reduce substance abuse, as financial hardships often push individuals toward addiction. He urged that it is crucial to identify and address the root causes driving young people toward drug dependency.
Members of the Provincial Assembly, Bilal Jadoon and Muhammad Danial, remarked that every individual faces challenges at some point in life. However, instead of escaping problems through substance abuse, we must tackle them and manage them effectively.
Addressing students, they emphasized that the youth are the nation’s future and its greatest asset. By actively participating in positive activities, they can drive the country toward progress.
Muhammad Danial encouraged students to join political parties, participate in local government elections, and contribute to the nation’s development through constructive efforts. He stressed the importance of selecting a clean and healthy environment, as surroundings significantly impact one’s well-being.
Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences Professor Dr Samina Saeed stated that drug abuse not only deteriorates physical health but also taints the purity of the soul. She mentioned that mental health challenges are an undeniable reality, and those suffering often fail to recognize their condition.
She asked that society change its approach, fostering understanding and support for individuals dealing with psychological struggles to ensure a healthier community.
The Program Manager of the Legal Rights Forum Shireen Ejaz shared that her organization consistently holds mental health awareness sessions because discussing mental well-being is still considered taboo in our society.
She said that seeking temporary relief through addictive substances ultimately leads to lifelong distress, and spreading awareness about this issue is crucial.

"Experts warn of growing use of e-cigarettes, other smokeless tobacco forms in schools, colleges",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317356-experts-warn-of-growing-use-of-e-cigarettes-other-smokeless-tobacco-forms-in-schools-colleges,"“Recent studies show that school and college students are using e-cigarettes and other smokeless tobacco (SLT) forms, more than adults everywhere, and about 37 million young population aged 13-15 is using tobacco globally.
Surprisingly in Pakistan, 1,200 to 1,500 youngsters begin smoking every day, and this results in hundreds of thousands of new smokers each year, many of whom will suffer from tobacco-related illnesses in the future.”
These views were shared by Muhammad Qasim, philanthropist and CEO of National Health Services (NHS) Diagnostics, at a public health awareness seminar yesterday, in connection with World No-Tobacco Day as part of its corporate social responsibility (CSR).
Smokers should be regularly screened for lung cancer as the condition remains the deadliest form of the disease in Pakistan, he said and emphasized that the government of Pakistan must take a strong action against the tobacco industry to protect its young citizens.
Guest speaker Prof Ahmad Nadeem Abbasi, consultant radiation oncologist, chair education programmes at the AKU and general secretary of the Radiation Oncology Society of Pakistan, highlighted that smoking is the most common cause of lung cancer (90%) across the globe, and lung cancer impacts approximately 2.1 million people and causes an estimated 1.8 million deaths every year.
The risk of lung cancer is significantly higher in smokers, with lifelong smokers having 20-40 times the risk compared to non-smokers. What is even more worrying is that smoking is linked to all major histologic types of lung cancer, including squamous, small cell, large cell, and adenocarcinoma. Lung cancer, once considered a man’s disease is now the top cancer killer in women, claiming more lives annually than breast cancer, uterine cancer, and ovarian cancer combined, Prof Abbasi said.
Smoking also causes 16 types of cancer and responsible for about 30% of all cancer deaths, and at least 80% of deaths from bronchitis and emphysema, he added.
“Smoking is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, responsible for 17% of all heart disease deaths and it claims 250,000 deaths per year in Pakistan. In fact, smoking damages the heart and blood vessels, increasing the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other CVDs. Quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk of CVDs and can prevent further damage” said guest of honor, Prof Faisal Ahmed, consultant cardiologist & HoD of the cardiology department at the LNH & OMI Group of Hospitals.
“If anyone does not smoke but sits in a surrounding where there is smoke, it is as if they smoked 200 cigarettes,” said Prof Faisal while highlighting the ill effects of secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke can cause health problems for pregnant women, babies, and young children. Children and babies who are around tobacco smoke are more likely to have ear infections and asthma. They are also at higher risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
In order to stop smoking and vaping for good, Prof Faisal recommended these tips: Set your “quit day” and take a “no smoking or vaping” pledge.
Stop smoking or vaping all at once on your quit day. This method works best for many people because it doesn’t drag out the quitting process.
Try nicotine replacement therapy e.g. Varenicline, Bupropion, nicotine chewing gum, nicotine inhaler or nose spray or nicotine patch.
Heavily engage in physical activities, stay active to distract and improve your mood, and visit non-smoking friends. Think about your loved ones, remember the people who care about you. Remind yourself of the benefits, keep the positive outcomes in mind. Try a new hobby that occupies your hands, such as painting, playing an instrument, woodworking or knitting.
Get rid of every cigarette, vape, match, lighter, ashtray and any other tobacco product in your home, office and car.
“People who smoke are 30 to 40 percent more likely to develop type 2 diabetes than people who don’t smoke. The more cigarettes you smoke, the higher your risk for type 2 diabetes. Smoking can cause diabetes by interfering with the normal function of your cells. The chemicals in cigarette smoke (7,000 in which 70 are known carcinogen) harm your body’s cells and can cause inflammation throughout the body, which may make your insulin less effective, when chemicals from cigarette smoke meet oxygen in the body, this process can also cause cell damage, called oxidative stress. Both oxidative stress and inflammation may increase your risk of developing diabetes, People who smoke have a higher risk of belly fat, which can raise your risk for type 2 diabetes, even if you aren’t overweight.”
These facts were shared by chief guest Prof. M. Zaman Sheikh, consultant diabetologist and endocrinologist and founder member and ex-vice president of the Pakistan Endocrine Society.
He said people with diabetes who smoke are also more likely to have serious health problems from diabetes, such as higher risks for serious complications including. Smoking increases bad cholesterol (LDL) and lowers good cholesterol (HDL) levels. Over time, high cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease.
Prof. Zaman Sheikh further explained that people who have diabetes and smoke have a much higher risk of blood vessel damage from inflammation. Blood vessels stiffen when they are damaged, and this leads to high blood pressure. Compared to people who don’t smoke, people who smoke and have diabetes are more likely to develop protein in their urine and subsequent terminal renal failure.
When you smoke cigarettes, you can damage important parts of your eyes necessary for maintaining clear eyesight and vision. Smoking causes damage and scarring to small blood vessels which can lead to poor circulation to the feet and legs. This increases risk of infections and ulcers which is the leading cause of diabetic amputations. Smoking-related inflammation also causes damage to the nerves that can lead to pain, numbness, and tingling.
While quitting smoking can't reverse diabetes, it can make it easier to manage your diabetes. The sooner you quit smoking, the quickly your body can start to heal. Quitting smoking improves blood circulation and glucose levels which regulates insulin, especially in diabetic patients, and reduces bad cholesterol as well as prevents many ailments and conditions, said experts.

‘97% of Pakistan’s pharmacies fail to store medicines properly’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317357-97pc-of-pakistan-s-pharmacies-fail-to-store-medicines-properly,"With an alarming 97 percent of pharmacies in Pakistan lacking temperature-controlled storage and biograde refrigeration, raising serious concerns about drug efficacy and patient safety, Alkhidmat Foundation has launched a new temperature-controlled home delivery pharmacy service aimed at transforming pharmaceutical care in the country.
Speaking at the launch ceremony held at Alkhidmat Headquarters in Karachi on Friday, health experts shared findings from a recent cross-sectional survey which inspected 1,003 drug stores across Pakistan. Only 4.1% of these stores were found compliant with regulatory requirements, while nearly 75% were selling general items alongside medicines, and a mere 12% had any qualified personnel—only a third of whom were pharmacists.
“Poor storage conditions directly compromise the potency of medicines. Only 11.4% of drug stores were found selling vaccines without proper refrigerators, and just 11.7% had power backup for refrigeration. With only 5.4% air-conditioned and most exposed to direct sunlight, this is a public health hazard,” said Syed Jamshed Ahmed, Director of Alkhidmat Pharmacy Services.
In response to these dangerous gaps, Alkhidmat has introduced its pharmacy home delivery service that ensures medicines are stored and transported under strict temperature control standards. “Our aim is to guarantee the quality and safety of medicines while making them more accessible and affordable for the people,” he added.
The service offers up to a 15% discount on essential medicines and delivers them directly to patients’ homes through a temperature-controlled supply chain—something almost unheard of in Pakistan’s retail pharmacy sector.
Umaima Muzammil, Deputy Director of Alkhidmat Pharmacy Services, criticized the current landscape where most drug outlets are unregulated and run by untrained staff. “We don’t have pharmacies, we have drug stores. Misreading prescriptions, dispensing wrong medicines, and storing drugs improperly are common issues that can lead to severe consequences, even death,” she warned.
Chief Networking Officer Naveed Baig noted that Alkhidmat is not operating this service as a business venture but as a public service initiative. “Most pharmacies are profit-driven. In contrast, we want to provide affordable, safe, and effective medicines to every household. When inflation is at an all-time high, this is genuine relief for patients,” he said.
He also highlighted Alkhidmat’s wider healthcare efforts, including Pakistan’s most affordable MRI services and expanded diagnostic facilities for low-income families. “Many families spend more on medicines than food. Through this service, we aim to reduce that burden significantly,” he said.
The survey also found that 33.4% of stores were operating with expired drug licenses, while less than half (47.4%) even displayed valid licenses. Just 40.2% of stores were protected from direct sunlight—an essential requirement for drug stability.
By ensuring proper storage, professional handling, and affordable access, Alkhidmat’s new initiative sets a new benchmark in pharmaceutical service delivery in Pakistan.
“This service is not just about delivery—it’s about delivering dignity, safety, and care,” said Syed Jamshed Ahmed, adding that their model could become a blueprint for responsible pharmacy practices nationwide.

Ajoka’s play shines at festival finale in China,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317312-ajoka-s-play-shines-at-festival-finale-in-china,"LAHORE : Ajoka's play ""Jhalli Kithay Javay"" was presented at the grand closing ceremony of the South-Southeast Asi Drama Festival in Kunming.  The play received prolonged applause and acclaim from a packed Yunnan Arts Council Hall, which included theatre scholars, artists, students and Yunnan government  officials. Ajoka's actors included Nirvaan Nadeem and Erum Navaee.
The cast included School of Drama students of the Yunnan Arts  University.  The  play was performed in Punjabi folk theatre style but use of elements such as traditional Chinese drum and flute made it a fine  example of Pak-China cultural collaboration. Writer and director of the play said this was perhaps the first time that Pakistani and Chinese collaborated a theatre play and praised the contribution of Chinese actors and technicians in making the play a great success.
Nirvaan Nadeem said he was much inspired by the audience response  and Yunnan Arts University students and teachers. Erum Navaee who played ""Jhalli"" in the play said she was overawed by the enthusiastic  audience response and learned a lot by working with Chinese actors.

Passage of underage marriage bill condemned,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317313-passage-of-underage-marriage-bill-condemned,"LAHORE : Top leaders of the Milli Yakjehti Council (MYC), including President Sahibzada Abul Khair M Zubair and Secretary General Liaqat Baloch, have condemned the recently passed underage marriage bill, calling it un-Islamic and unconstitutional.
In a joint statement, the MYC leaders vowed to launch a nationwide protest in consultation with all religious parties, saying the government allegedly disregarded Islamic injunctions and constitutional values. The statement said that legislation ignoring the Shariah principles regarding puberty and the clear injunctions of the Qur’an and Sunnah, as well as the President of Pakistan's assent to such a bill, is in direct violation of the spirit of the Constitution.
“The government’s move to enact this law, despite the Islamic Ideological Council (IIC) declaring it un-Islamic, is deeply alarming. It reflects a dangerous disregard for a constitutional and religious institution whose mandate is to ensure that all legislation aligns with Islamic teachings,” the statement read. The MYC leaders warned that religious groups across the country would raise a strong voice against this unconstitutional and un-Islamic lawmaking, and vowed to mobilise nationwide protests if the decision is not reversed. They criticised the government and the presidency for ignoring the IIC’s formal objection, which deemed the child marriage bill incompatible with both the Qur’an and the Constitution of Pakistan. The MYC maintained that the government has a responsibility to address social and societal issues through planning and reforms, but not at the cost of overriding religious guidance and constitutional integrity. The council demanded that the government immediately withdraw the un-Islamic bill and urged the President of Pakistan to reconsider his approval, emphasising his role as the guardian of the federation and the Constitution. They also called on the federal government to halt any provincial-level legislation based on the controversial bill. Religious leaders announced that the message from pulpits and mosques across the country would remain firm in defending Constitution of Pakistan.

‘Over 8m die annually from smoking-related diseases’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317318-over-8m-die-annually-from-smoking-related-diseases,"LAHORE : Smoking is causing lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases. More than eight million deaths occur in the world every year due to smoking-related diseases. Anti-smoking is not the responsibility of governments but it requires a collective effort. Parents should keep an eye on their children and inform them about the harms of tobacco.
The war against smoking can only be won by launching a comprehensive awareness campaign.
Principal Ameeruddin Medical College (AMC) Prof Dr Farooq Afzal expressed these views while giving an awareness lecture to medical students on the topic of “No Tobacco, Choose Life” on the occasion of ‘World No Tobacco Day’ at Lahore General Hospital (LGH) on Saturday.
Prof Farooq Afzal highlighted that lung cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure and many other deadly diseases are related to smoking, not only smokers but also non-smokers around them are affected, they also suffer the consequences.
This process is called ""peso smoking"". If a person in the family smokes, then his family and other family members are also present with him, it has double effects. On the one hand, his children and other young people develop a passion for this practice, and on the other hand, they are directly exposed to the negative effects of its smoke.
Principal AMC said that smoking is becoming a serious problem in our country, the young generation is especially affected by it, although many steps have been taken at the government level, such as banning smoking in public places and educational institutions as well as banning advertising of tobacco products, etc., but the implementation of these laws is weak and the availability of tobacco products at cheap prices everywhere in the market is not achieving the desired results of ending smoking.
Prof. Farooq Afzal said that it is not easy to quit smoking after getting addicted to it, but if a person is determined, everything is possible, with a little effort and willpower, this habit can be permanently eradicated.
He appealed that teachers should launch awareness campaigns in educational institutions, the media should promote a healthy lifestyle and launch a strict campaign against smoking, reporting in case of violation of laws in public places should be promoted. He said that World No Tobacco Day provides us with an opportunity to think collectively, take action and raise our voice against tobacco. This is not just a one-day message, but a permanent mindset through which we can make our society healthy, safe and prosperous.
It should be noted that World No Tobacco Day is celebrated every year on May 31st around the world to make people aware of the harmful effects of smoking and promote a healthy lifestyle. This day was started by the World Health Organization in 1987, and since then this day has become a strong global message against the scourge of tobacco.

Murree Road choking points demand urgent attention from Punjab CM,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317325-murree-road-choking-points-demand-urgent-attention-from-punjab-cm,"Rawalpindi : Since assuming office as Chief Minister of Punjab, Maryam Nawaz Sharif has set her sights not only on Lahore-the traditional seat of power-but also on the development of other districts across the province. Among them, she has shown particular interest in addressing the longstanding infrastructural and civic challenges of Rawalpindi.
Two major development projects are currently underway in the city, aimed at resolving chronic traffic congestion. The first is on The Mall, a main artery that cuts through the heart of Rawalpindi and connects it to both Lahore and Peshawar via the GT Road. The second is a flyover on Adiala Road, a vital route that also leads to the well-known Adiala Jail.
Both projects are nearing completion and are expected to be opened to the public soon.
With these developments in motion, it is now crucial for the Chief Minister to turn her attention towards Murree Road-perhaps the city’s busiest and most significant thoroughfare. While the elevated Metro Bus Service has brought some relief to daily commuters, certain planning gaps continue to cause persistent bottlenecks.
Two critical choke points continue to hamper traffic flow along Murree Road: Liaquat Bagh Intersection and Marir Chowk. At Liaquat Bagh, commuters coming from Faizabad who need to turn onto Liaquat Road are forced into long waits due to the lack of an underpass, resulting in daily traffic jams. Similarly, Marir Chowk remains a major bottleneck, where the absence of a grade-separated crossing causes vehicles to back up for nearly a kilometer. The constant blare of ambulance sirens caught in the gridlock is a grim reminder of how urgent it is to address these infrastructural gaps. The delays faced by ambulances at these points pose a serious risk to patients, for whom every passing second can mean the difference between life and death. Urgent intervention is needed to ensure smooth mobility and safeguard public safety on this vital corridor.
Addressing these two points could transform Murree Road into a truly signal-free corridor. The Chief Minister is urged to prioritize this issue and allocate funds for it in the upcoming provincial budget, so that construction can begin in the next fiscal year.
Another issue needing attention is the long-delayed opening of a road link at Moti Mahal Chowk, which was intended to divert traffic from Marir Chowk towards Tipu Road and the old airport. This route would ease pressure on Murree Road and offer a faster connection for commuters heading towards the housing societies near the old airport or the Islamabad Expressway. Currently, drivers must traverse the entire length of Murree Road to reach Faizabad.
Adding to the traffic woes are frequent public protests and rallies, particularly near Liaquat Bagh. With no alternative route available, travelers are often forced to wait for the crowd to disperse before proceeding towards Islamabad.
The immediate reopening and development of the Moti Mahal Chowk link, along with resolving the structural issues at Liaquat Bagh and Marir Chowk, could significantly alleviate Rawalpindi’s traffic problems. It is hoped that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz will include these matters in her strategic development priorities for the city.

‘Islamabad Gender Parity Report’ launched,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317326-islamabad-gender-parity-report-launched,"Islamabad : Women's labour force participation in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) remains low at 22.5 per cent, says ‘Islamabad Gender Parity Report’ launched by the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), along the Ministry of Human Rights and United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
The report further says that girls outnumber boys in ICT public schools, but their representation declines in higher education and technical fields. It shows that the healthcare access, especially mental health and reproductive services, is alarmingly unequal in the federal capital whereas the conviction rates for violence against women remain dismally low as well.
Shedding light on the current state of gender equality in the Islamabad Capital Territory, the Islamabad Gender Parity Report provides an evidence base for policy-making and programming, highlighting systemic failures and areas for improvement.
The report is the result of extensive consultations with key stakeholders, including government ministries, provincial commissions, UN agencies, and civil society organisations.

ATC issues show-cause notices over alleged fake encounter,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317329-atc-issues-show-cause-notices-over-alleged-fake-encounter,"Rawalpindi : The Special Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi has issued show-cause notices to the Station House Officer (SHO) of Rawat Police Station and two police inspectors in connection with the alleged fake police encounter that led to the death of an accused individual in custody.
The court questioned the legality of the incident, stating, “If the accused was to be killed, why was the court’s warrant used? Why not register a murder case against both of you, including the City Police Officer (CPO) Rawalpindi, SSP Operations, and SP Saddar?”
The ATC directed the officers to submit a written response along with all relevant details before June 2, warning that failure to do so would result in legal action.
According to the show-cause notice issued to SHO Inspector Zahid Zahoor and Investigation Inspector Afzal Mehmood, both officers appeared before the court on May 20 to obtain non-bailable arrest warrants for Wahid alias Wahidi, named in FIR No. 1335/24 under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act and related charges. However, news later surfaced through national and social media that the accused had been killed in what was described as a staged encounter, allegedly sanctioned by senior police officials.
The court remarked that the killing of citizens in fake encounters is a ""slap in the face of the administration."" It condemned the misuse of court warrants as an attempt to give legal cover to an unlawful act and described the move as contempt of court.
The notice demands that both officers appear in person and explain why a murder case under Sections 302/109 of the Pakistan Penal Code should not be registered against them and senior officials involved. The court warned that failure to respond would be seen as an inability to defend themselves, in which case the court would proceed with legal action.
In a separate development, Rawalpindi’s sessions courts have handed down multiple death sentences in two unrelated double murder cases, including one involving the brutal killing of a sister-in-law.
In the first case, the Taxila Police registered an FIR in December last year against an accused named Babar, who was charged with murdering his elder brother’s wife with an axe during a domestic dispute. After a full trial, the court sentenced Babar to death and ordered him to pay Rs500,000 in compensation to the victim’s heirs.
In the second case, the Gujar Khan Police booked Muhammad Razaq in September 2018 for double murder, attempted murder, and causing grievous injuries. Razaq was accused of opening fire during an argument, killing two individuals and injuring another.

"EU, BC launch analysis to power Pakistani women’s digital skills revolution",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317330-eu-bc-launch-analysis-to-power-pakistani-women-s-digital-skills-revolution,"Islamabad : The European Union Delegation to Pakistan and the British Council have jointly launched a pivotal report titled “Skill Gap & Market Need Analysis” under Component 4 of the EU-funded Technical and Vocational Education and Training Sector Support Programme (Phase IV).
Conducted by Ipsos Pakistan, the study identifies critical digital and high-tech skill gaps across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Balochistan, and provides the foundation for two internationally accredited Centres of Excellence focused on equipping women with future-ready skills.
Launched under the patronage of Ms Wajiha Qamar, Minister of State for Federal Education & Professional Training, the report offers a comprehensive overview of labour market demands and outlines a strategic roadmap for developing inclusive, industry-aligned technical training in emerging technologies.
The findings show that Pakistan’s rapidly growing Information and Communications Technology sector exports reached US $3.2 billion in 2024, with expected revenue growth of 7.3 per cent by 2029, but only 16 per cent of ICT jobs are held by women.
A comprehensive list of 42 courses in 20 high-tech domains, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, and cloud security identified where demand is high in the industry but skills in short supply.
Fewer than 10 per cent of TVET institutes currently offer high-level, competency-based training in emerging technologies.
Minister of State for Federal Education and Professional Training Wajiha Qamar said, ""The report provided the evidence we need to close the gender gap in technology and create opportunities for the women and girls of Pakistan to lead in the digital economy.”
Jeroen Willems, Head of Cooperation, EU Delegation to Pakistan said the EU was proud to support Pakistan’s journey towards a green and digital future. ""By investing in women’s skills, we invest in the nation’s prosperity.""

"Time to take extra care of infants, children",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317331-time-to-take-extra-care-of-infants-children,"Rawalpindi : Both the private and public sector healthcare facilities in town including the three allied hospitals have started receiving a significant influx of child patients with gastroenteritis, diarrhoea and other water and food borne infections and according to health experts, the time has come for parents to take extra care of infants and children to avoid epidemics of cholera and diarrhoea in the coming days.
It is important that the pre-monsoon season is about to set in and above normal rainfall in the coming days is being expected in most parts of the country. According to health experts, if proper preventive measures are not taken by the parents well in time, the weather conditions may give a tremendous rise to certain infections among children and infants.
Studies reveal that in Pakistan, nearly 250,000 children under the age of five die each year due to diarrhoea, mainly because of the use of untreated and contaminated water and unhygienic food. The water-borne illnesses account for nearly 60 per cent of child deaths in Pakistan with approximately 630 children dying daily from diarrhoea.
According to health experts, at present, the trend of infections among children cannot be termed as an epidemic rather it is endemic, however, the trend might take the shape of an epidemic with continuous rain spells expected ahead. It is time to sensitize individuals, particularly parents to take extraordinary care in handling children and infants.
To avoid diarrhoea, children should be given water for drinking after boiling while boiled water should be used for preparing milk for infants. Water to be used for children and infants must be brought to ‘rolling boil’ for 5-10 minutes otherwise it might not be safe for a child to consume.
On hygiene, experts say that mothers must wash hands with soap before preparing milk for infants while children should be made habitual of washing hands with soap before and after eating and after going to the toilet. Fresh milk and food should be given to infants and small children each time and consumption of leftover food should be avoided.
Experts say that there is a need to educate mothers through public awareness campaigns on how to prevent summer and monsoon related infections and how to react in case a child gets an infection. Mothers should be informed that immediately after the incidence of diarrhoea (motion), a child should be given ORS (Oral Rehydration Salt) which certainly puts a patient out of danger. However as soon as a patient’s stool gets consistent, the ORS should immediately be stopped as a greater amount of Sodium in ORS might harm a healthy child.
It is necessary to create awareness among parents about various aspects of cholera, an acute infectious disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae that lives and multiplies its colonies in the small intestine. Studies reveal that in cholera, the watery motion resembles that of rice water and dehydration is much rapid as compared to diarrhoea. Health experts say that such a patient should immediately be taken to the nearest healthcare facility for treatment.
Massive watery diarrhoea is the major symptom of cholera that results in dehydration. Such dramatic water loss, if left untreated, causing severe dehydration leads to the thickening of the blood, circulatory collapse (shock) and death. Studies reveal that a good number of cholera victims die six hours after the onset of symptoms if not treated. Nearly 60 per cent of untreated patients die of the disease.
It is important that gastro, diarrhoea and cholera can be avoided by giving safe drinking water and hygienic food to infants and children and avoiding unhygienic living conditions. Experts say that families should have a clean and functioning lavatory and must avoid open defecation on ground, in or near water sources.

WHO calls for immediate ban on flavoured tobacco,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317332-who-calls-for-immediate-ban-on-flavoured-tobacco,"Islamabad : On World No Tobacco Day, the World Health Organisation (WHO) launched a publication and called on governments to urgently ban all flavours in tobacco and nicotine products—including cigarettes, pouches, hookahs, and e-cigarettes—to protect youth from addiction and disease.
According to WHO, flavours like menthol, bubble gum, and cotton candy mask the harshness of tobacco and nicotine, turning toxic products into youth-friendly bait. Flavours not only make quitting harder but have also been linked to serious lung diseases. Cigarettes, which still kill up to half of their users, also come in flavours or can have flavours added.
“Flavours are fuelling a new wave of addiction and should be banned,” said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO.
“They undermine decades of progress in tobacco control. Without bold action, the global tobacco epidemic—already killing around eight million people each year—will continue to be driven by addiction dressed up with appealing flavours.”
The publication, Flavour Accessories in Tobacco Products Enhance Attractiveness and Appeal, reveals how flavours and accessories like capsule filters and click-on drops are marketed to bypass regulations and hook new users.
Currently, over 50 countries have banned flavoured tobacco; more than 40 have disallowed e-cigarette sales; five have specifically banned disposables; and seven have imposed bans on e-cigarette flavours. However, flavour accessories remain largely unregulated. Countries such as Belgium, Denmark, and Lithuania are taking action, and WHO urges others to follow suit.
“We are watching a generation get hooked on nicotine through gummy bear-flavoured pouches and rainbow-coloured vapes,” said Dr Rüdiger Krech, WHO Director of Health Promotion. “This isn’t innovation—it’s manipulation. And we must stop it.”
The WHO also stated that tobacco products, including heated tobacco products, expose users to cancer-causing chemicals and should be strictly regulated.

Tax issues in Malakand to be resolved: Muqam,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317335-tax-issues-in-malakand-to-be-resolved-muqam,"MINGORA: Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON Amir Muqam on Saturday pledged efforts to resolve tax issues in the Malakand Division.
“We are making efforts and hope the full 18percent sales tax will be imposed,” he told the oath-taking ceremony of the newly-elected cabinet of the Swat Bar Association.
He claimed that while a development plan for the province had been approved, the provincial government was yet to implement it.
The minister said that the Pakistan Army had played a pivotal role in recent tensions with India. “Since May 11, the respect for the Pakistani passport has increased,” he claimed, crediting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s timely decisions as historic. He accused India of engaging in a proxy war against Pakistan and warned, “If India attacks again, it knows what the outcome will be. We will account for every drop of blood.”
He extended congratulations to the lawyer community, emphasising their critical role in addressing public grievances.
“I am not a minister, I am your brother,” he remarked, reaffirming his commitment to resolving local issues. Stressing the importance of justice and constitutional supremacy, he said, “We speak with facts and evidence, and our mission is the welfare of the people and the rule of law.”
He announced a grant of Rs5 million for the Swat Bar, including provisions for a solar system and computers. Facilities for parking and a hostel would be included in the next PSDP, he added.
“My office is always open to the public. Serving the people is not a favour, it’s my duty,” he said, adding he considers himself accountable to the public.

PHC Bar polls: Body completes probe into ILF candidate’s defeat,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317337-phc-bar-polls-body-completes-probe-into-ilf-candidate-s-defeat,"PESHAWAR: The committee constituted for the inquiry into the matter of not voting for the Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF) candidate in the recent Peshawar High Court Bar Association elections completed the probe and subsequently submitted the report to ILF president.
According to sources, a four-member committee conducted the investigation and submitted its report along with recommendations to the ILF president. The matter is now under review with input from PTI founder Imran Khan, and disciplinary action is expected against some senior members who allegedly voted against the nominated ILF candidate.
The committee’s findings will help determine the next course of action with the final decision to be made in consultation with Imran Khan.
It’s worth mentioning that in the PHC Bar elections, there was an alliance between the ILF and the Malgari Wakeelan. Advocate Alam Khan Adinzai was the joint candidate for the general secretary seat. However, ILF claims that some members voted for the opposition candidate, which led to the formation of the inquiry committee.
The four-member committee comprising Malik Samiullah Khan, Bilal Khalil, Alam Khan Adinzai advocates and other members, completed the investigation and submitted the report to the ILF president.

PIC performs cardiac procedure using intravascular lithotripsy,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317340-pic-performs-cardiac-procedure-using-intravascular-lithotripsy,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar Institute of Cardiology (PIC-MTI) has achieved a major milestone by becoming the first medical facility in the country to successfully perform intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), a cutting edge procedure that significantly advances the treatment of coronary artery disease.
“This revolutionary technology allows us to treat patients who were previously considered high risk or unsuitable for traditional interventions,” said Dr Ali Raza, medical director at Peshawar Institute of Cardiology.
“The use of sonic vibrations offers safer, more predictable outcomes and improves the overall success of the procedure,” he added.
Dr Abid, head of Cardiology at Peshawar Institute of Cardiology, noted that IVL, originally developed for kidney stone treatment, has now been adapted for cardiology with remarkable results.
“It uses a specially designed balloon catheter to break up calcium inside arteries without damaging the arterial wall. This reduces complications, shortens recovery time, and improves patient comfort,” he added.
The success of the procedure marks a major advancement in interventional cardiology and offers new hope to patients with heavily calcified coronary blockages, a condition that has long posed challenges for cardiologists in Pakistan.
Prof Dr Shahkar Ahmad Shah, dean and Chief Executive of Peshawar Institute of Cardiology, called the development a defining moment for the country’s healthcare system.
“Our team’s success with IVL reflects our unwavering commitment to innovation and patient centred care. We are proud to introduce world class cardiac procedures that raise the national standard of treatment,” he added.
The introduction of IVL is part of PIC’s broader mission to bring internationally recognised, state-of-the-art cardiac therapies to the public sector.
With this achievement, the institute further strengthens its role as a national leader in cardiovascular care and clinical training across Pakistan.

Corporal punishment: CM orders probe into death of student,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317341-corporal-punishment-cm-orders-probe-into-death-of-student,"PESHAWAR: Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Saturday took serious notice of the reported incident in which a student allegedly died due to corporal punishment by a teacher in a private school in Jamrud tehsil of Khyber district.
An official communique said the chief minister directed the authorities concerned to submit a detailed report on the incident.
He asked the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Private Schools Regulatory Authority to conduct a transparent and impartial inquiry and submit its findings at the earliest. The chief minister said that strict action would be taken if the incident was confirmed.
He stated that corporal punishment of children in educational institutions was a serious crime under the law and an intolerable act. Those found guilty, he said, deserve no leniency and would be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. The chief minister also directed the officials and institutions to take effective measures to prevent such incidents in schools.

"Maritime minister announces chamber to boost blue economy, sustainability",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317262-maritime-minister-announces-chamber-to-boost-blue-economy-sustainability,"KARACHI: Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Saturday announced the establishment of the Maritime Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) to promote the blue economy and advance environmental sustainability within the maritime sector.
Speaking at the Pakistan Business Council Forum, the Minister emphasised the urgent need to align maritime development with sustainability goals, particularly in the context of escalating climate challenges facing the Global South.
He noted that Pakistan’s coastal regions are increasingly vulnerable to rising sea levels, extreme weather events and environmental degradation -- factors that necessitate a dedicated platform to drive eco-conscious policymaking.
The minister said the MCCI would provide a specialised institutional framework to unify voices across the maritime landscape, covering sectors such as ports, shipping, logistics, fisheries and marine services.
“This chamber will not only support investment and innovation in the maritime sector but also prioritise sustainability at ports, promote green technologies, and foster carbon reduction strategies,” Chaudhry remarked.
He reiterated the government’s commitment to public-private partnerships and welcomed collaboration with environmental experts, industry leaders, and civil society to ensure that maritime growth contributes positively to national and global climate objectives.
The minister assured the business community that their concerns are being acknowledged and addressed, citing ongoing coordination with the chief minister of Sindh to ensure cohesive action across all levels of governance.
He also outlined the ministry’s roadmap for modernising Pakistan’s port infrastructure, with a focus on digitalisation, efficient cargo handling and environmental sustainability.
The Pakistan Business Council strongly supported the initiative, describing the MCCI as a critical step toward building a climate-resilient and economically vibrant maritime economy.

Chinese automakers get stern ‘price war’ warning after discount spree,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317263-chinese-automakers-get-stern-price-war-warning-after-discount-spree,"BEIJING: A top industry group had a stern rebuke Saturday for automakers fuelling a “price war”, a week after Chinese EV giant BYD announced sweeping trade-in discounts, with multiple competitors following suit.
“Since May 23, a certain automaker has taken the lead in launching a substantial price drop campaign... triggering a new round of ‘price war’ panic,” the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) said in a statement posted to its WeChat account.
The group warned that such “disorderly” competition would “exacerbate harmful rivalry” and hurt profit.
The statement, dated May 30, did not single out any company by name, but on May 23, BYD announced it was offering big trade-in discounts on nearly two dozen makes, offering discounts of up to 34 percent.
Its cheapest model, the smart-driving Seagull, now goes for a starting price of 55,800 yuan ($7,800), down from 69,800 yuan, with a trade-in.
Days later, Stellantis-backed Chinese EV startup Leapmotor announced similar discounts on two “entry-level” models through June 8.
Geely Auto announced Friday limited-time trade-in subsidies for 10 models, with its X3 Pro going for the lowest starting price of 44,900 yuan.
But there is growing domestic criticism against what the autos association called “involution” -- a popular tag used to describe the race to outcompete that ends up nowhere.
The CEO of China’s Great Wall Motor, whose annual revenue was roughly a quarter of BYD’s, compared it to the start of China’s years-long housing slump triggered by the 2021 default of property giant Evergrande.
“Evergrande in the auto industry already exists,” Wei Jianjun said this month in an interview with Chinese outlet Sina Finance.
“I hope that... all these years of hard work will not go to waste.”
Beijing has poured vast state funds into the electric vehicle sector, supporting the development and production of less polluting battery-powered vehicles.
But China’s automakers association on Saturday warned its goliaths to play fair.
“Leading companies must not monopolise the market,” the CAAM statement said.
It added that “with the exception of lawful discounting, companies must not sell products below cost nor engage in misleading advertising”.
Such behaviour disrupted the market and harmed both consumer and the industry, it said.
An unnamed official from China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology added that price wars “produce no winners and no future”, the state-backed Global Times reported Saturday.

"KSE-100 edges higher as investors await budget clarity, IMF progress",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317264-kse-100-edges-higher-as-investors-await-budget-clarity-imf-progress,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) ended the week on a cautious yet positive note, as the KSE-100 index posted a modest gain of 0.5 per cent week-on-week (WoW) to close at 119,691 points. While investor sentiment remained cautious amid stalled IMF talks and delayed budget presentation, the market showed resilience, closing the month of May with an impressive 7.5 per cent gain on a month-on-month (MoM) basis. Moving forward, the market’s direction will hinge on fiscal clarity, potential tax reforms and progress in IMF negotiations, factors likely to dominate investor focus in the weeks ahead.
According to Syed Danyal Hussain, analyst at JS Global, the outgoing week saw improved participation, with average daily volumes rising by 35 per cent WoW to 662 million shares. However, foreign investors continued to exit the market, recording a net outflow of $5.57 million, which was largely offset by local buying, especially from mutual funds and insurance companies.
The week started on a jittery note after the IMF concluded its visit without reaching an agreement on key fiscal targets, forcing the government to reschedule the federal budget announcement to June 10, 2025. Talks are still ongoing, focusing on increasing tax revenue and cutting back on expenditures, key conditions for unlocking the next tranche under the IMF programme.
In a positive development, China reaffirmed its commitment to refinance $3.7 billion in commercial loans by the end of June 2025, providing some external financing relief. Meanwhile, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) continued its market support activities, recording $223 million in net foreign exchange purchases in February 2025, bringing total purchases to $5.9 billion during the first eight months of FY25.
In the latest T-bill auction, the SBP raised Rs772 billion, exceeding its target of Rs650 billion, with yields remaining stable across all maturities. Additionally, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves rose by $70 million WoW to $11.52 billion, offering some cushion to the domestic currency.
Nabeel Haroon, analyst at Topline Securities, highlighted that the KSE-100 index rose 7.5 per cent MoM in May 2025. This rally was underpinned by the SBP’s decision to cut the policy rate by 100 basis points to 11 per cent, citing an improved inflation outlook. The IMF’s approval of the first review under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), along with the green light for an additional $1.4 billion under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), further boosted investor sentiment.
Macroeconomic indicators provided mixed signals. CPI inflation for April 2025 stood at 0.3 per cent, down from 0.7 per cent in March, signalling easing inflationary pressure.
Trade data, however, raised some concerns. The trade deficit widened sharply to $3.39 billion in April, up 55 per cent MoM, the highest in three years. Still, the current account managed a surplus of $12 million for the month, helped by a significant increase in remittances, which rose to $3.2 billion (up 13 per cent YoY). Cumulatively, the current account surplus stood at $1.88 billion for the first 10 months of FY25.
Average daily traded volume and value for the month were reported at 566 million shares and Rs28 billion, respectively, indicating improving liquidity conditions and growing investor appetite.
As investors look ahead, clarity on fiscal measures, taxation policies and progress with the IMF will be pivotal in shaping near-term market momentum.

OPEC announces sharp increase in July oil production,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317265-opec-announces-sharp-increase-in-july-oil-production,"VIENNA: Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other key OPEC+ members announced on Saturday a huge increase in crude production for July.
They will produce an additional 411,000 barrels a day -- the same target set for May and then June -- according to a statement, which is more than three times greater than the group had previously planned.
In recent years the 22-nation group had agreed to daily reductions of 2.2 million barrels with the aim of boosting prices.
But in early 2025, leading members of the group known as the ‘Voluntary Eight’, or V8, decided on the gradual output increase and subsequently began to accelerate the pace.
The moves have resulted in oil prices plummeting to around $60 per barrel, the lowest level in four years.

Trump pressure
OPEC+ “struck three times: (the output target for) May was a warning, June a confirmation and July a warning shot”, Rystad Energy analyst Jorge Leon told AFP.
“The scale of the production increase reflects more than just internal supply dynamics,” he said.
“This is a strategic adjustment with geopolitical aims: Saudi Arabia seems to be bowing to Donald Trump’s requests.” Shortly after taking office, the US president called on Riyadh to ramp up production in order to bring down oil prices, meaning cheaper prices at the pump for American consumers.
Saturday’s decision comes after a meeting of all OPEC ministers on Wednesday, where the alliance’s collective production policy was reaffirmed.
The decision is officially justified by “healthy market fundamentals” covering oil reserves and structural demand growth during coming months.
Riyadh ‘angry’
But markets have met this view with scepticism amid concerns about demand and a trade war launched by the United States.
Analysts see several possible motivations for the production hikes, one of them being Saudi Arabia and others penalising members for not keeping to their quotas under the cuts first agreed in 2022. The increase is all the more likely due to “the latest statements of Kazakh Energy Minister Yerlan Akkenzhenov, who has apparently already informed OPEC that his country will not reduce production,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, an analyst at Commerzbank.
“Saudi Arabia is angry with Kazakhstan”, which is seen as one of the main laggards, and which “produced 300,000 barrels per day more than its quota,” said Bjarne Schieldrop, an analyst at SEB.
Analysts meanwhile do not foresee a plunge in oil prices when markets open Monday as the announcement was largely anticipated, instead resulting in a “moderate” reaction. On Friday, the benchmark Brent crude futures price had settled at $62.61 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate was at $60.79.

KE CEO says multi-year tariff will not burden consumers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317266-ke-ceo-says-multi-year-tariff-will-not-burden-consumers,"KARACHI: K-Electric’s (KE) Chief Executive Officer Moonis Abdullah Alvi has clarified that the company’s proposed multi-year tariff (MYT) will not impose any additional burden on ordinary consumers.
Speaking to journalists during an informal interaction, Alvi stated that a uniform national tariff policy is in place, under which electricity consumers across the country pay the same rates. “There will be no special hike for Karachi consumers under the MYT,” he emphasised.
Highlighting the company’s progress since privatisation, Alvi noted that KE’s transmission and distribution (T&D) losses were at 43 per cent at the time of privatisation, compared to a national average of 28 per cent. “Today, our losses have been reduced to 20 per cent, while the national average stands at around 24 per cent,” he said.
According to Alvi, this reduction has translated into a benefit of Rs10 per unit in electricity tariffs. He added that effective implementation of the MYT would enable KE to make Karachi 90 per cent load-shedding free by 2030.
By that year, the city is projected to have five million electricity consumers and a demand of up to 5,000 megawatts (MW), he said. KE is investing in new technologies to reduce load-shedding down to the level of individual PMTs and feeders. Commenting on power theft and line losses, he revealed that of Karachi’s 2,200 feeders, around 300 are severely affected by theft and high losses. KE has proposed that the government step in to manage these areas. “If the government assumes responsibility for internal distribution on these feeders, the city could virtually become load-shedding free,” he said.
Alvi described KE’s relationship with consumers as a partnership. “With the support of citizens, public representatives and the city administration, the quality of power supply can be further improved,” he said. He also expressed willingness to connect captive power-based industries to the national grid and stated that KE is ready to adhere to agreed timelines for their transition.
In response to growing demand fuelled by rising economic activity, KE currently has the capacity to supply up to 4,500MW to the city, he added.

PTBA urges FBR to extend e-invoicing deadline for corporate taxpayers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317267-ptba-urges-fbr-to-extend-e-invoicing-deadline-for-corporate-taxpayers,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) has observed that it is practically impossible for a significant number of corporate entities to integrate with the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) centralised system via licensed integrators or PRAL within the stipulated timeframe.
While expressing support for the government’s documentation drive aimed at enhancing transparency in the supply chain, the PTBA highlighted challenges in implementing the electronic integration of hardware and software (e-invoicing) as required under SRO 709(I)/2025 dated April 22, 2025. The SRO mandates integration by June 1 for corporate tax filers and July 1, 2025 for individual tax filers, respectively (this has been extended from the previous May 1, 2025 deadline for corporate tax filers and June 1 2025 for individual tax filers.
In a letter addressed to the FBR chairperson, the PTBA noted that it had received numerous representations from member bars across the country, raising concerns over the fast-approaching deadline of June 1 for corporate taxpayers.
“Given the current circumstances, it appears virtually impossible for corporate tax filers to complete the integration process by the due date,” the letter stated. In the interest of proper documentation and effective implementation of supply chain integration, the PTBA has recommended that the deadline for corporate entities be extended to June 30, 2025.
The association expressed hope that the FBR would consider the extension favourably, in the broader interest of the government and the tax authority, as it would facilitate a smoother rollout and help ensure accurate and reliable data reflecting true economic activity and tax liability.

Sindh demands IMF refrain from imposing additional taxes on agriculture sector,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317268-sindh-demands-imf-refrain-from-imposing-additional-taxes-on-agriculture-sector,"KARACHI: Sindh’s Minister for Agriculture Sardar Muhammad Baksh Mahar has expressed serious concerns over the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) demand to impose an 18 per cent general sales tax (GST) and increase Federal Excise Duty (FED) on fertilisers, sprays and agricultural machinery.
In his statement, Mahar said, “The IMF’s demand is extremely unfair and anti-farmer, which will prove disastrous for the country’s agricultural sector and farmers. The IMF must refrain from proposing additional taxes on the agriculture sector.”
He emphasised that farmers across the country, including Sindh, are already suffering due to climate change, water scarcity and low crop prices.
The provincial minister warned that the new taxes would lead to an enormous increase in agricultural production costs, ultimately jeopardising food security. He said that this would trigger a new wave of inflation in the country.
Mahar strongly urged the federal government to persuade the IMF and make it aware of the importance of the agriculture sector.
He made it clear, “The IMF’s demand is causing severe unrest among farmers, and we vehemently oppose any such proposal.”
Concluding his statement, the Sindh agriculture minister said that providing facilities to agriculture is the greatest need of the hour, not imposing additional burdens on it.

Amazon pledges to continue aggressive data centre expansion,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317269-amazon-pledges-to-continue-aggressive-data-centre-expansion,"Amazon[dot]com Inc’s cloud services chief says the company is aggressively expanding server farms globally and looking to boost access to the latest artificial intelligence chips from Nvidia Corp, according to Bloomberg.
Amazon Web Services, the world’s largest seller of rented computing power and data storage, opened a cluster of data centres in Mexico earlier this year, AWS Chief Executive Officer Matt Garman said Friday in an interview with Bloomberg Television. The cloud division is also building out new facilities in Chile, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, Garman said.
Amazon has said that its AI franchise is on pace to bring in multiple billions of dollars over the course of a full year. Garman said Friday that the figure “is AWS” and represents customer use of its on-demand AI services.
Like rivals Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc’s Google, Amazon is racing to boost its capacity to power artificial intelligence tasks. Garman said it was working with Nvidia to expand its stock of the leading AI chipmaker’s latest GB200 semiconductors, which are available for AWS customers to test.
“Demand is strong,” he said.
A longtime AWS engineering leader and later sales chief, Garman took the top job at AWS a year ago, replacing Adam Selipsky.
Garman said he’d welcome the chance to host OpenAI’s models on AWS. The AI startup’s models are powered by Microsoft servers, but OpenAI earlier this year won permission to explore other partnerships if Microsoft doesn’t want the business itself.
“We encourage all of our partners to be able to be available elsewhere,” Garman said. “I’d love for others to take that same tack.”
He said it would be “OK, too,” if Claude -- the AI model built by Amazon partner Anthropic -- wound up on Microsoft’s cloud computing platform.
“It’s great that Claude’s making their services available elsewhere, and we see the vast majority of that usage happening in AWS though,” Garman said.

PAAPAM raises red flags over tariff policy after talks with government bodies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317270-paapam-raises-red-flags-over-tariff-policy-after-talks-with-government-bodies,"LAHORE: After a series of meetings with the Ministry of Industries and Production (MOIP) and the Engineering Development Board (EDB), the Pakistan Association of Auto Parts Manufacturers (PAAPAM) has raised alarm over the government’s proposed National Tariff Policy 2025-30, warning of dire consequences for domestic industry and employment.
During these meetings, PAAPAM leadership conveyed their deep reservations about the policy’s direction -- particularly the adoption of tariff rationalisation measures recommended by IMF consultants.  They criticised the lack of consultation with industry stakeholders and warned that such unilateral decisions would severely undermine the auto parts manufacturing sector, which is vital to Pakistan’s local OEM supply chain, including car, tractor, motorcycle, truck, bus, and defence/railway equipment production.
To escalate their concerns, PAAPAM convened an extraordinary general meeting where members voiced fears that the policy could trigger widespread factory closures and massive job losses. They argued that reducing tariffs would steer the economy further towards imports, weaken local industrialisation efforts and place additional pressure on Pakistan’s already limited foreign exchange reserves.
The association underscored that the auto parts industry plays a central role in developing skilled human resources, many of whom go on to secure employment overseas, contributing significantly to national remittances. Disruption in this sector would stall Pakistan’s engineering workforce pipeline and limit opportunities for skilled labour in global markets. “We urge the government to adopt a structured and long-term approach to tariff changes, rather than abrupt adjustments that destabilise the industry,” said PAAPAM Chairperson Usman Aslam Malik. “The livelihoods of thousands of skilled workers, and the sustainability of Pakistan’s industrial base, are at stake.”
Senior Vice Chairperson Shehryar Qadir added: “Our industry has worked hard to enhance quality and efficiency over the years.
A sudden tariff reduction would unravel decades of progress and unfairly expose local manufacturers to foreign competition. We need policy that supports growth -- not undermines it.”
Reaffirming its commitment to dialogue, PAAPAM called for the formation of a balanced and sustainable tariff structure in consultation with industry stakeholders. The association stressed that a collaborative approach is essential to protect jobs, strengthen domestic manufacturing and ensure long-term economic resilience.

Towards shared responsibility in reviving Pakistan’s economy,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317271-towards-shared-responsibility-in-reviving-pakistan-s-economy,"LAHORE: The trade and industrial sectors raise several valid concerns, but these are sometimes undermined when calls are made for broad concessions that may be economically unsustainable or counterproductive in the long term.
Rather than pursuing blanket exemptions, there is an opportunity for these sectors to work collaboratively with the government to address structural challenges such as tax evasion, smuggling, lack of documentation, governance gaps and policy inefficiencies. For example, the request to apply a uniform sales tax on yarn imports by exporters is well founded. However, proposals to exempt the entire textile value chain from sales tax risk reviving past issues, such as the misuse of invoicing systems.
Concerns over delayed tax refunds are widely shared, and many businesses report facing difficulties, including bureaucratic hurdles. Industry leaders could play a proactive role by compiling data on refund timelines -- highlighting both timely disbursements and problematic delays -- and by proposing improvements based on best practices from comparable economies. Transparency mechanisms and fair accountability processes can also help address grievances related to misconduct.
It is broadly acknowledged that challenges such as corruption can hinder economic efficiency. Strengthening institutional integrity and reducing opportunities for rent-seeking behaviour -- on both public and private sides -- would benefit all stakeholders. More constructive engagement from the business community in this area could drive systemic reform and build greater trust.
Low tax revenues remain a persistent issue. Improving tax compliance across all segments of the economy could help broaden the revenue base, enabling more equitable tax rates and reducing pressure on essential services. Informal financial flows and parallel exchange systems, such as ‘hundi’, continue to pose policy challenges. Ensuring regulatory clarity and fairness in enforcement would help create a more level playing field for all participants.
Although traders contribute significantly to GDP, their share of tax revenues remains relatively low. Past attempts to enhance compliance have had limited success. A more consultative approach, involving trader associations in the design of simplified tax regimes, could encourage broader participation. Similarly, transporters -- another vital part of the economy -- could also benefit from structured dialogue aimed at fostering better alignment with national tax goals.
There is also scope for reassessing the taxation of capital markets and real estate, sectors that have seen considerable growth over the past two decades. A consistent income tax policy, applied equitably across asset classes, could enhance revenue collection while promoting fairness.
Smuggling and informal trade continue to present serious challenges to the country’s productive sectors. Encouraging improved market oversight, coupled with capacity-building for enforcement agencies, could support efforts to curb these practices. Transparent procedures and stakeholder engagement can help ensure that compliance efforts are effective and equitable.
Overall, greater partnership between the public and private sectors -- based on mutual accountability and reform -- can pave the way for a more resilient and inclusive economic future.

Cashless card payments for public transport: Lagos commuters don’t trust the technology,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317272-cashless-card-payments-for-public-transport-lagos-commuters-don-t-trust-the-technology,"Public transport is the lifeblood of cities in many countries, moving millions daily to work, school and essential services. But paying for it in cash is not efficient. Long queues, fare disputes, revenue leakage and increased operational costs plague cash-based transport systems.
Contactless payment technologies, where commuters tap a card or mobile device, offer a potential solution. These are in wide use in developed nations, but adoption in developing economies has been slower and more complex. Infrastructure limitations, financial exclusion and consumer scepticism have been challenges. So is the integration of informal transport sectors.
Some cities, however, have decided to modernise their transport systems. For instance, Lagos in Nigeria introduced the Cowry card in 2020, aiming to replace cash on public buses. Kigali in Rwanda uses the Tap&Go card for cashless travel, with top-ups via app or agents. Cape Town in South Africa has the MyCiTi card, streamlining payments and reducing queuing.
These initiatives demonstrate the potential of contactless systems, but they also highlight the hurdles that remain. Unreliable internet access, frequent technical glitches, a persistent preference for cash among many commuters and the existence of informal transport operators are some of them. It’s crucial to find a way around these challenges, to build efficient, accessible and financially sustainable public transport systems in developing countries.
My research sits at the intersection of digital transformation, transportation service marketing and consumer behaviour, with a focus on emerging economies. I have studied the adoption of digital financial technologies, especially the way they can be used in public transport, to bring about change.
In a recent study I investigated the complex dynamics of contactless payment adoption in Lagos. The study looked at how consumers engaged with these systems and identified barriers to wider adoption. It also examined the governance of transport payment data. My findings affirmed that while interest in contactless cards was growing, people still preferred cash, especially outside the formal bus rapid transport system in Lagos.
City transport planners should note that these findings point to the need for inclusive, hybrid payment options.

Transport in Lagos
The research used ethnographic fieldwork, commuter interviews and sentiment analysis to assess consumer behaviour towards contactless transport payments. Over 18 months, we observed commuter interactions with the Cowry card system and conducted interviews to explore adoption patterns, perceived benefits and underlying barriers. The research tracked the stages of adoption, from initial awareness and consideration to actual engagement and post-adoption evaluation. This approach provided insights into the psychological, social and economic factors influencing payment method preferences.
Findings suggest that only around 15 per cent of commuters are fully engaged with the Cowry card system. This small but growing group consists mainly of early adopters, tech-savvy individuals and regular bus users. These are people who consistently use the contactless payment option as part of their daily commute.
Low digital literacy and limited smartphone access are significant obstacles. Many commuters lack the skills and resources to use digital payment systems effectively.
To use the Cowry system, commuters must first purchase a physical card and download the Cowry app on a smartphone. They can then top up the card using a bank card, mobile wallet, or by visiting a kiosk at bus stops. The card is tapped at entry points to board buses, or payments can be made via the app by scanning a QR code or entering a bus code. The system depends on access to smartphones, digital payment methods, and basic tech literacy factors.
There are around 170 million mobile subscriptions in Nigeria, but currently, only between 10 per cent and 20 per cent of the population uses a smartphone. Further, 60 per cent remained unbanked in 2024. Those factors limit the potential reach of digital solutions.
Distrust of financial technology providers and anxieties about system failures, hidden fees or fraud deter adoption. Commuters are wary of digital transactions. The lack of clear dispute resolution mechanisms amplifies these concerns.
Concerns about data privacy and security are also prominent. Many people are acutely aware of the risks, even if they don’t fully understand the technical details. Their caution is rooted in lived experiences with scams, mistrust of government systems, and fear of surveillance. Commuters are often reluctant to link their bank cards or mobile wallets to yet another app, worrying about who is tracking their movements through tap-in and tap-out data. There’s a general suspicion that sharing personal information might expose them to fraud or unwanted oversight. For many, paying by cash feels safer.
As one respondent said: They know when I enter and leave the bus. What else are they watching?
While Nigeria now has a formal data protection law (the Nigeria Data Protection Act), the system is still underdeveloped in terms of enforcement, public awareness and institutional capacity.
Integrating informal transport operators, who tend to operate on a cash-only basis, into the digital ecosystem is another challenge. They’re concerned about fees, technical complexities, and perceived loss of control over earnings if they adopt digital payment.
Digital infrastructure limitations, including patchy internet and unreliable mobile networks, further complicate the transition. Although there are card kiosks at bus terminals, these are not always convenient or operational. A respondent put it like this:
Sometimes the card doesn’t work, network is bad, and you’re just stuck there. Cash doesn’t fail like that.
While interest in contactless cards is growing, commuters see cash as quick and straightforward, especially in a fast-paced commuting culture. As one respondent said: I’m used to cash, it’s easy for me. I just enter the bus, pay, and go.

The way forward
Contactless payments offer many benefits. They promote financial inclusion, providing an entry point to digital banking for the unbanked. Transport data can revolutionise urban mobility planning, enabling data-driven decisions on routes, congestion and infrastructure. But there must be clear data protection policies to build public trust.
A multi-pronged strategy is essential: Public awareness campaigns: educate commuters about the benefits and security of digital payments, addressing misconceptions and building trust.
Infrastructure improvement: expand contactless options across all transport modes.
Data protection policies: establish clear regulations on data ownership, usage and access. This will enhance privacy and improve public confidence.
Public-private partnerships: foster collaboration to create affordable, user-friendly systems, calling on expertise from both sectors. Successful projects like South Korea’s T-Money system offer useful lessons.

China manufacturing shrinks in May despite trade war truce,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317274-china-manufacturing-shrinks-in-may-despite-trade-war-truce,"BEIJING: China’s manufacturing activity shrank in May for the second month running, official data showed on Saturday, despite Beijing reaching a temporary ceasefire in a blistering trade war with the United States.
Beijing and Washington agreed this month to pause staggeringly high tariffs, although US President Donald Trump on Friday accused China of breaching the de-escalation deal.
While the two sides reached a temporary truce in mid-May, China recorded a contraction in factory output for the month.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index -- a key measure of industrial output -- came in at 49.5, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The reading was up from April’s 49 but fell short of the 50-point mark that separates growth and contraction.
China’s overall economic output in May “continued to expand”, NBS statistician Zhao Qinghe said in a statement.
According to some “US-related enterprises”, foreign trade orders “restarted at an accelerated pace, and import and export conditions improved”, Zhao added.
The non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activity in the services sector, came in at 50.3, down from April’s 50.4.
Chinese leaders are aiming for economic growth this year of five percent, a goal considered ambitious by many economists as the country battles weak domestic consumption.
Although Beijing and Washington agreed this month to pause steep levies for 90 days, the two sides already appeared deadlocked in negotiations.
Trump argued Friday that Beijing had “totally violated” the bilateral deal, without providing details.

England’s Overton ruled out of West Indies series,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317291-england-s-overton-ruled-out-of-west-indies-series,"LONDON: England fast bowler Jamie Overton will miss the rest of the white-ball series against the West Indies after suffering a broken finger.
Overton sustained the injury while dropping a catch from just his second delivery in England´s 238-run win in the first one-day international on Thursday. The 31-year-old immediately sprinted to the dressing room clutching his right hand and grimacing.
After treatment, he returned to bowl five more overs, claiming career-best ODI figures of three for 22, but he is now set for a short spell on the sidelines.
“Jamie Overton has been ruled out of the remaining one-day internationals and the IT20s against the West Indies due to a broken right little finger,” an ECB statement said on Saturday.
England will not draft in a replacement for the last two ODIs on Sunday at Cardiff and Tuesday at The Oval, or for the three-match T20 series, which gets under way on June 6 in Durham.

Zverev tips Alcaraz to ‘be in final’ of French Open but is ready for battle,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317293-zverev-tips-alcaraz-to-be-in-final-of-french-open-but-is-ready-for-battle,"PARIS: Alexander Zverev tipped defending champion Carlos Alcaraz for another run to the final of the French Open but warned he was ready to “really battle” after the German advanced to the fourth round on Saturday.
Third seed Zverev, who lost to Alcaraz in last year´s title match in Roland Garros, booked his ticket to the last 16 with a three-set win over Italian Flavio Cobolli.
The three-time Grand Slam runner-up won through 6-2, 7-6 (7/4), 6-1 in two hours 30 minutes, and next plays 35th-ranked Dutch player Tallon Griekspoor.
“I honestly think that Carlos will be in the final, to be very fair,” said Zverev.
Second seed Alcaraz won 6-1, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 against 69th-ranked Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in his third round match on Friday to keep his title defence on course.
Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz arrived as the favourite at Roland Garros after securing the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open trophies in the build-up to the clay-court major.
But his fluctuating performances in the past two rounds have given his rivals reason to believe he is vulnerable.
“I don´t think there is anybody that, in that side of the draw, will challenge him too much, I think,” continued Zverev.
“I think he´s the favourite, of course, before coming into the tournament. I mean, I think everybody kind of realised that.
“But I think all the people that can challenge him, all the contenders, I would say, outside of him are all in the top half of the draw.
“I think we will have to really battle it out and I think he will enjoy watching it.”
Zverev is in the same half of the draw as world number one Jannik Sinner and three-time French Open champion Novak Djokovic, who is bidding for a record 25th Grand Slam.
As for his next opponent Griekspoor, Zverev joked: “I play him almost every week.” The 28-year-old German leads 7-2 in their previous meetings including both matches on clay.
“He´s the guy that I played the most in the last two years. I enjoy playing him. It´s always fun, weird matches.
“You know, most of the time high level. Some of the times, just crazy things happening.
“But I´m going to get ready. I´m going to prepare myself for a battle again, and yeah, if I continue playing the way I´m playing, I have confidence in my game.”
Griekspoor battled past American Ethan Quinn 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (2/7), 6-1, 6-4 in three hours 16 minutes to reach the fourth round in Paris for the first time.
Zverev has reached at least the semi-finals on each of his last four appearances at Roland Garros. “He (Cobolli) probably should have won the second set, but I kept fighting and then I had a bit of a mental advantage and it went my way.”

Pakistan eye T20 series whitewash against Bangladesh,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317294-pakistan-eye-t20-series-whitewash-against-bangladesh,"LAHORE:  Pakistan will be aiming to seal a series whitewash when they take on Bangladesh in the third and final T20I at Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday (today). Having already secured a dominant 57-run victory in the second T20I, Pakistan leads the three-match series 2-0 and will look to finish in style.
Pakistan’s batting unit has been in red-hot form, with Sahibzada Farhan, Hasan Nawaz, and Mohammad Haris delivering match-winning performances. In the second T20I, Farhan smashed a blistering 74 off 41 balls, while Haris added 41 off 25 deliveries.
Rookie batter Hasan Nawaz continued his excellent form, scoring 50 off 26 balls, ensuring Pakistan breached the 200-run mark once again.
The bowling attack, led by leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed, has been clinical in restricting Bangladesh. Abrar’s figures of 3-19 in four overs were instrumental in Pakistan’s comprehensive victory in the last match. Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Faheem Ashraf, and Shadab Khan will be key to Pakistan’s bid for a clean sweep.
For Bangladesh, captain Litton Das and his men will be playing for pride in this dead rubber, hoping for a turnaround. Tanzid Hasan showed early aggression in the second T20I, scoring 31 off 19 balls, while tail-ender Tanzim Hasan Sakib fought back with a valiant 50 off 31 balls. However, Bangladesh’s middle order struggled, failing to chase Pakistan’s high total. The wicket at Gaddafi Stadium as always is expected to be batting-friendly, offering scoring opportunities for top-order players. With the first two T20Is won by the side batting first, the toss remains crucial, favoring setting a target.
Salman Agha outlines long-term vision
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha has outlined his long-term vision for the national T20I team following their comprehensive 57-run victory over Bangladesh in the second T20I at Gaddafi Stadium. The triumph not only secured Pakistan a 2-0 lead in the series, but also marked their first T20I series win at home since December 2021, when they swept West Indies 3-0. Agha credited the team’s collective effort for the victory, describing it as ‘incredibly special’ in his post-match conference.
“This achievement feels incredibly special—I hadn’t realized it’s been three and a half years since our last home series win. The team’s effort has made me immensely proud,” he said. With the ICC T20 World Cup set to take place next year, Agha is focusing on building a squad with depth and versatility. He emphasized the importance of having 15 match-ready players, allowing for seamless replacements in case of injuries.

Bangladesh ex-captain Aminul new cricket board chief,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317296-bangladesh-ex-captain-aminul-new-cricket-board-chief,"DHAKA: Bangladesh´s first Test centurion Aminul Islam has been named president of the cricket board after Faruque Ahmed was ousted.
“This is a new high for me,” Aminul, who captained Bangladesh in their first World Cup appearance in 1999 and is better known as “Bulbul”, told reporters.
Since his retirement from playing, the 57-year-old has worked in development for the International Cricket Council and Asian Cricket Council.
Cricket and politics go hand-in-hand in Bangladesh and the sport has been hit by the turmoil that has wracked the country.
Former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024, fleeing by helicopter as crowds stormed her palace.
Faruque took up the post as Bangladesh Cricket Board president after the resignation of Nazmul Hassan, a close ally of Hasina.
BCB directors selected Aminul on Friday and he will serve as president until October.  Bangladesh suffered an embarrassing T20 series defeat to the United Arab Emirates in May.

India’s in-form Sudharsan to draw on county stints for England Tests,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317297-india-s-in-form-sudharsan-to-draw-on-county-stints-for-england-tests,"Chandigarh, India: In-form Sai Sudharsan will draw on county cricket experience as he switches from the IPL to the five-day game for his first Test tour with India when they travel to England.
The left-handed opener made a valiant 80 on Friday as Gujarat Titans went down to Mumbai Indians and were knocked out of the IPL.
The 23-year-old was key to Gujarat´s journey to the playoffs.
He is the leading batsman in the league with 759 runs, including one century and six half-centuries, at an average of 54.21.
Gujarat´s exit will give him extra time before he heads to England for a five-Test series beginning at Headingley on June 20.
Sudharsan, part of an 18-man India squad led by new captain Shubman Gill -- his Gujarat skipper and fellow opener -- had stints with English county Surrey last year and in 2023.
“It gave me a great experience,” he told reporters after Gujarat´s 20-run defeat at Mullanpur. “It improved my batting multiple folds in terms of technique and in terms of basics.”
Sudharsan has dominated bowlers in the IPL but admits adapting to the longer format in England will require a new “mindset and decision-making”. “After a long three months of white-ball tournament, certain things would have changed in your batting,” he said. “I think focusing more on basics and bringing back those to red-ball cricket will take some time.”
Chennai-born Sudharsan, who plays domestic cricket for the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, played three ODIs for India in 2023 and one T20 international last year.
The series in England will be India´s first without opener Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, the two veterans who retired from Test cricket in May.

Yates, 32, will claim a career-defining triumph on Sunday barring disaster after overhauling Del Toro with a brave solo attack on the key Colle delle Finistre climb and finishing the stage third behind Australian rider Harper and Alessandro Verre.
The Visma-Lease a Bike rider now only has to cross the line intact in Rome to win his second Grand Tour, with the final stage largely a procession around the Italian capital and Vatican City.
Yates, who broke down in tears at the line, is almost four minutes clear of Del Toro heading into the finale after redemption on the Finistre, the highest climb of this year´s Giro and an 18.5km slog up to 2,178 metres above sea level.
He lost the pink jersey the last time the Finistre featured in the Giro, on the 19th stage of the 2018 edition when he ended up finishing over an hour behind eventual victor Chris Froome in the overall standings.
“I think when the route, the ´parcours´, was released I always had in the back of the mind to try and do something here, and close the chapter, let´s say,” said Yates.
“Still a bit speechless, really, to know that I was able to do it.” Yates trailed both Del Toro and Richard Carapaz at the start of the stage after losing 22 seconds on Friday, but he secured victory after pulling away on the key climb.
UAE rider Del Toro spent most of the Finestre ascent just staying on Carapaz´s wheel and ended up unable to bridge the gap to Yates, handing over the pink jersey he had held since the ninth stage.
“We might have been the strongest, but we weren´t the cleverest,” said Carapaz, who was scathing of Del Toro´s passive performance in the decisive stage of his first Grand Tour.
“In the end, he´s lost the Giro, he didn´t know how to race well and the cleverest rider won.”
Yates ended up finishing the stage just under two minutes behind Harper, who claimed the biggest win of his career at the age of 30 after attacking from the break on the Finestre. “I don´t know what I´m happier about, winning the stage or seeing Yates win pink,” said Harper, who rode with the likely Giro winner at Jayco-AlUla.
“He´s an awesome guy and I had the pleasure of riding with him for a couple of seasons and doing a lot of racing with him. I don´t think anyone deserves the pink jersey more than him.”
The final stage will honour the late Pope Francis with an unprecedented ride through the Vatican, and new Pope Leo XIV will greet the cyclists as they pass through.

Lahore has a card of six races today,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317299-lahore-has-a-card-of-six-races-today,"LAHORE: The Lahore Race Club (LRC) is set to host an exciting day of thoroughbred racing as it stages the 40th Day Winter Meeting 2024-25 this Sunday evening.

"Germany qualify, England hit six in Women’s Nations League",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317300-germany-qualify-england-hit-six-in-women-s-nations-league,"PARIS: Germany joined already qualified France in the Women´s Nations League semi-finals as England knocked Portugal for six at Wembley on Friday.
Euro 2022 champions England shrugged off the shock international retirement of Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Mary Earps this week to sweep aside Portugal 6-0 and set up a tantalising decider for Sarina Wiegman´s side in the final group game against world champions Spain in Barcelona on Tuesday.
Spain eased past Belgium 5-1 and top their group by two points from England with only the winner of the four top-tier mini-leagues advancing to the semi-finals in October. Germany booked their ticket to the two-legged semis with a 4-0 rout of the Netherlands. That left them three points clear of the Dutch.
In the event of the two sides ending up level after Tuesday´s closing games the Germans will go through on the basis of their head-to-head results - they drew when they met in the opening game in February.
At Wembley the star of the show was Aggie Beever-Jones, who will forever remember her first ever start at the iconic stadium.
The Chelsea forward scored in the third minute, again in the 26th with a header from Lucy Bronze´s cross, and then completed her treble in the 33rd minute.
“I´m absolutely shattered,” the 21-year-old Beever-Jones told ITV.
“Coming into this today after a busy season and I got told I was starting and I wanted to help the team as much as I can. I´m absolutely delighted right now,” she added.
Joining her on the scoresheet were her club teammate Bronze, whose father is Portuguese, the Euro 2022 Golden Boot winner Beth Mead, and Chloe Kelly.
France, who secured their path to the semi-finals on the last matchday, maintained their perfect record beating Switzerland, hosts of July´s Euro 2025, 4-0 in Nancy.
Les Bleues were runners-up to Spain in last year´s final.
At Euro 2025 their group stage opponents include defending champions England and 2017 winners Netherlands.

"World Boxing introducing gender tests for all boxers, targets Khelif",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317301-world-boxing-introducing-gender-tests-for-all-boxers-targets-khelif,"PARIS: World Boxing announced on Friday it will introduce mandatory gender testing to determine the eligibility of male and female athletes wanting to take part in its competitions.
The international federation said it was introducing the policy after the furore surrounding boxers including women´s welterweight gold medallist Imane Khelif of Algeria at the Paris Olympics last year.
World Boxing will organise the boxing competition at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after being granted provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee.
World Boxing said it had informed the Algerian Boxing Federation that Khelif would have to undergo the test if she wanted to compete at the Eindhoven Box Cup in the Netherlands on June 5-10.
“World Boxing has written to the Algerian Boxing Federation to inform it that Imane Khelif will not be allowed to participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup or any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes sex testing,” it said in a statement.
Under the new policy, all athletes over 18 that want to participate in a World Boxing owned or sanctioned competition will need to undergo a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction genetic test, to determine what sex they were at birth and their eligibility to compete. The PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex.

Piastri outpaces Norris to grab Spanish GP pole,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317302-piastri-outpaces-norris-to-grab-spanish-gp-pole,"BARCELONA: Oscar Piastri outpaced title rival and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris in the final minute of a gripping qualifying session on Saturday to clinch pole position for the Spanish Grand Prix.
The championship leader clocked a near flawless final lap of one minute and 11.546 seconds to beat Norris by 0.209 seconds as McLaren claimed a dominant one-two having also topped all three practice sessions.
Four-time world champion Max Verstappen was third for Red Bull ahead of Mercedes´ George Russell, seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Ferrari and Kimi Antonelli in the second Mercedes.
Charles Leclerc was seventh in the second Ferrari ahead of Alpine´s Pierre Gasly, Racing Bulls´ impressive rookie Isack Hadjar and local hero two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin.
It was Piastri´s fourth pole of the season and career as he seeks to extend his three-point lead ahead of Norris in the drivers´ championship.
“Nice work, very nicely done, everyone,” said the cool 24-year-old Australian on team radio. “That´s quite some turnaround from last year. Well done everyone. Let´s have some fun tomorrow!”
He added: “I´m very glad to be on pole here and now I just need a good start. It´s a long run to the first corner!”
Norris said: “Oscar has driven really well and he deserved it. But it is a great result for the team.”
Piastri´s two-second advantage is the biggest this season between pole and second place.
After an early fast lap from Aston Martin´s Lance Stroll in Q1, the big guns arrived in torrid heat with a track temperature of 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit), and the air at 29, punishing conditions for tyres on a high-degradation track.
The session was briefly stalled when Alpine´s Franco Colapinto stopped in the pitlane and, after a delay, forced others to undertake him leading to a frantic final two minutes.
Yuki Tsunoda in the second Red Bull was eliminated in 20th and last place along with Colapinto, Williams´ Carlos Sainz - his worst qualifying result at his home event - in 18th, Esteban Ocon of Haas and Sauber´s Nico Hulkenberg.
For Tsunoda, it was a major setback as he sought to solve Red Bull´s dilemma in searching for a partner to push Verstappen. At the front, Piastri topped Verstappen and Norris.
In Q2, McLaren´s duo led the first runs ahead of Verstappen, Russell and a revived Hamilton before choosing not to take a second go as Hadjar shone, taking sixth and splitting the Ferraris.
Out went Alex Albon of Williams, Sauber´s Gabriel Bortoleto, Racing Bulls´ Liam Lawson, Stroll and Oliver Bearman in his Haas.
The top 10 shootout began with Piastri lapping in 1:11.836 before Norris overhauled him by 0.017sec for provisional pole on the opening charge.
Russell was third ahead of Leclerc, Verstappen and Hamilton before a late Alonso lap lifted him to fifth amid roaring appreciation.
Cloud cover affected conditions for the second runs as both McLaren men fought for pole with the Australian prevailing.  It was McLaren´s first front row lockout in Spain since 1998.

Hamilton determined to make Ferrari adventure work,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317303-hamilton-determined-to-make-ferrari-adventure-work,"BARCELONA: Lewis Hamilton was disappointed, but determined on Friday evening after a difficult day of practice at the Spanish Grand Prix, during which former team-mate Nico Rosberg suggested his age may be catching up with the seven-time world champion.
Hamilton, who joined Ferrari this year, wound up 11th after second free practice and described his car as “not driveable”, a description moderated by team boss Fred Vasseur who admitted “the comments on the radio were a bit extreme”.
As the 40-year-old Briton battled to drive his capricious car around the Circuit de Catalunha, Rosberg, who beat him to win the world title in 2016, told SkyF1 that age was likely to be a factor in his struggles this year.
“Even if he´s the greatest of all time, at some point you are going to get a little bit slower and that´s age related,” said Rosberg. “And when you are 40, it´s going to happen sooner rather than later.”
Leclerc, Hamilton´s Ferrari team-mate was sixth and said he was pleasantly surprised by his car´s performance and potential. Hamilton maintained a stoical expression.
Asked about his day, he said: “Not fun. It´s a beautiful place, the weather has been amazing, but no, not a good day.”
He added that he did not feel he was using his experience to motivate the team.
“I wouldn´t say that. You just keep your head down and keep working away. You just don´t give up. You keep going, you keep pushing.”
Rosberg had some sympathy for Hamilton.
“If we can come to the worst car, it´s the Ferrari,” he said. “Oh my goodness! Poor Lewis Hamilton. That car is a handful.
“I mean the rear is just so loose and snappy so even on the entry, Lewis had to fully steer out again to avoid binning. So, I really feel for him at the moment.”
Hamilton, who has won the Spanish race a record six times, on Thursday went to some length to end speculation claiming he had a difficult working relationship with his race engineer Riccardo Adami.
“There is a lot of speculation and most of it is BS,” he told reporters.
“We have a great relationship. He is amazing to work with. He is a great guy, working so hard, as we both are. It is all noise and we are ignoring it.”

Melbourne City edge crosstown rivals to win A-League title,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317304-melbourne-city-edge-crosstown-rivals-to-win-a-league-title,"MELBOURNE: Yonatan Cohen proved the hero as Melbourne City claimed the bragging rights over crosstown rivals Melbourne Victory with a 1-0 victory to lift the A-League title on Saturday.
In front of a sell-out crowd of 29,902 at AAMI Park, Cohen scored in the 10th minute before the disciplined City shut down Victory with gritty defending in a nerve-jangling second-half.
City claimed their second title having reached the grand final for the fifth time in the last six years.
“It´s amazing to do it against our rivals,” City defender Nathaniel Atkinson said. “We got that early goal and we knew with our defence that we could keep a clean sheet.”
It was a bitter disappointment for Victory, who lost at the final hurdle for the second straight season to once again fall short of equalling Sydney FC´s record of five titles.
“It´s really tough to be in this position two years in a row,” Victory defender Roderick Miranda said. “We had chances in the beginning, but in the second-half they defended really well.”
The powerhouse clubs had never previously met in a grand final since the A-League replaced the National Soccer League in 2005 as Australia´s top football competition.
The blockbuster decider was a tonic for a competition that has been mired by financial strain and declining popularity since the Covid-19 pandemic.
A heavy police presence was visible before the game as opposing supporters marched through the streets and set off flares, but there were no reports of violence.
Amid a febrile atmosphere inside the stadium, Victory made the early running with striker Daniel Arzani providing headaches for City´s defence. But City, entering with an unbeaten eight-game streak, pounced against the run of play on their first foray forward.
Max Caputo´s bullet rifled off the upright and straight to Israel international Cohen, who hammered the third fastest goal in A-League grand final history.
City continued to threaten on the counterattack and a powerful header from Mathew Leckie was on target until a desperate dive from goalkeeper Jack Duncan came to Victory´s rescue.
The tireless Arzani tried to will an equaliser for Victory, but he had little room to weave his silky skills against the swarming City defence.
Cohen opened the second-half with a wickedly curling strike from the edge of the box only for Duncan to produce another outstanding full-stretched save.
Tensions flared between the teams as City missed several golden opportunities to end Victory´s resistance. But their steely defence held up as City erupted in jubilation when the whistle sounded.
After captaining Melbourne City to the club’s second Isuzu UTE A-League Championship, an emotional Aziz Behich explained why his unique journey to his maiden title made his crowning moment even sweeter. Aziz Behich waited 15 years for this moment to arrive.
From his debut for Melbourne Heart in 2010, to his return to a club transformed into Melbourne City in 2023, his intention has always been the same: to bring silverware to the club.
Behich was just a teenager when he first arrived at the Heart, originally on a short-term injury replacement contract. Cut by Melbourne Victory following a Grand Final appearance in his debut Isuzu UTE A-League season, Behich dropped back into the National Premier League before receiving another opportunity in the A-Leagues with Victory’s crosstown rivals.

Ukraine expands evacuations in Sumy region amid offensive fears,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317365-ukraine-expands-evacuations-in-sumy-region-amid-offensive-fears,"KYIV, Ukraine: Ukraine ordered the evacuation of 11 more villages in its Sumy region bordering Russia on Saturday amid fears Moscow was gearing up for a fresh ground assault.
Russia claims to have captured several settlements in the northeastern region in recent weeks, and has massed more than 50,000 soldiers on the other side of the border, according to Kyiv.
The evacuations came just two days before a possible meeting between the two sides in Istanbul, as Washington called on both countries to end the three-year war.
Russia has confirmed it will send a delegation to the Turkish city, but Kyiv has yet to accept the proposal, warning the talks would not yield results unless the Kremlin provided its peace terms in advance.
On Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accused Moscow of doing “everything” it could to sabotage the potential meeting by withholding its peace terms.
Authorities in Ukraine’s Sumy region said Saturday they were evacuating 11 villages within a roughly 30-kilometre (19-mile) range from the Russian border.

German Chancellor Merz to meet Trump amid transatlantic tensions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317366-german-chancellor-merz-to-meet-trump-amid-transatlantic-tensions,"BERLIN: Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz will next Thursday with US President Donald Trump for talks at the White House amid transatlantic tensions over trade and the war in Ukraine.
The talks will focus on relations between the two countries, German government spokesman Stefan Kornelius said Saturday, as well as “the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East and trade policy”.
The talks will be the first time the two leaders have met, and mark Merz’s first official visit as chancellor.
Trump has has rattled Europe with shifts in security and trade policy since returning to the White House, including an array of tariffs on European partners.
Speaking at the WDR Europaforum conference last Monday, Merz said the European Union could retaliate with measures against US technology companies or other tariffs if the transatlantic trade conflict escalates.
“We shouldn’t react heedlessly and hectically,” Merz said. “But if we can’t do anything else, we would need to use this tool.”
Merz and Trump have already had several telephone conversations, with the two earlier this month agreeing to visit each other, without giving dates.

"Four die as over 3,000 cases rock India in Covid resurgence",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317367-four-die-as-over-3-000-cases-rock-india-in-covid-resurgence,"NEW DELHI: India is witnessing a fresh surge in Covid -19 cases, with active infections rising to 3,395 and four virus-related deaths reported in the last 24 hours as of Saturday, May 31.
The highest number of cases has been reported from Kerala, followed by Maharashtra and Delhi, according to the Union Health Ministry. Despite the spike, officials have stated that the majority of infections are mild and manageable at home, and there is no immediate cause for concern.
Kerala currently has 1,336 active cases. Maharashtra recorded 68 new cases, including 30 in Mumbai and 15 in the Pune Municipal Corporation limits, bringing its total active caseload to 467. Delhi also reported a fatality, a 60-year-old woman who tested positive for COVID-19 while being treated for acute intestinal obstruction.
Karnataka recorded another death, a 63-year-old man with multiple comorbidities, including cancer and pulmonary TB, who had been fully vaccinated and was undergoing chemotherapy. This brings Karnataka’s total COVID-related deaths this year to seven, with six of the deceased having underlying health conditions.
The Karnataka health department has issued advisories urging citizens to wear masks in crowded places, maintain social distancing, and practice good hygiene. With schools scheduled to reopen in June, the government has directed both public and private schools to implement necessary precautions to safeguard children’s health.
Meanwhile, Odisha reported two new cases, taking the total number of active infections in the state to seven, all in stable condition. Across the country, 1,435 people recovered from COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, offering some relief amid the growing numbers. Health officials continue to monitor the situation closely and encourage the public to remain calm but vigilant.

Bulgaria faces protests over adopting euro,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317368-bulgaria-faces-protests-over-adopting-euro,"SOFIA, Bulgaria: Bulgaria is expected to get a green light from Brussels in June to adopt the euro -- but the prospect is unsettling many citizens.
“If Bulgaria joins the eurozone, it will be like boarding the Titanic,” Nikolai Ivanov, a retired senior official, told AFP at a recent protest calling for the country´s currency -- the lev -- to be maintained.
Since January, opponents of Bulgaria adopting the common European currency have launched demonstrations and demanded a referendum on the issue, amid a torrent of disinformation.
Memories of a 1996-1997 economic crisis that saw 14 banks go bankrupt and hyperinflation of more than 300 percent also resurfaced, fuelling the opposition.
Several recent surveys showed nearly half of those questioned said they were opposed to Bulgaria joining the eurozone.

France charges 25 suspects in crypto abduction cases,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317369-france-charges-25-suspects-in-crypto-abduction-cases,"PARIS:  Twenty-five people, including six minors, were charged in Paris over a spate of kidnappings and attempted abductions of top figures in France’s cryptocurrency world, prosecutors said on Saturday.
“Eighteen people have been placed in pre-trial detention, three have requested a deferred hearing, and four have been placed under judicial supervision,” the Paris public prosecutor’s office said, adding that the suspects were aged between 16 and 23.
The investigation into “attempted kidnapping by an organised gang” centres on a May 13 kidnapping attempt targeting the daughter and grandson of the chief executive officer of crypto firm Paymium, carried out in broad daylight in eastern Paris.
Prosecutors said the probe also covers “other unsuccessful plans”, including an initial failed attempt on the same targets the day before, and a disrupted operation near the western city of Nantes on Monday.
Authorities said this week they had thwarted the Nantes abduction and detained more than 20 suspects in connection with that plot and the one targeting Paymium boss Pierre Noizat’s family.
Footage of that attempted abduction shared on social media showed four masked men attacking Noizat’s daughter, her husband and their child in the French capital’s 11th district in mid-May.
All three suffered light injuries and were taken to hospital.
Noizat later praised his “heroic” son-in-law and a man who used a red fire extinguisher to fend off the attackers.
According to a source close to the case, it was while investigating that abduction attempt that the police discovered the new plot near Nantes.
Most of the suspects were born in France and others in Senegal, Angola and Russia.Among those arrested so far are suspects accused of involvement in carrying out the abductions and more senior figures believed to be involved in logistics, according to sources close to the case.
Ambroise Vienet-Legue, who represents an 18-year-old suspect in the Nantes plot, described the accused as “very young”, lured by money and out of their depth.  “My client admitted to being a fuse in a criminal machine” and deeply regrets it, he said.
