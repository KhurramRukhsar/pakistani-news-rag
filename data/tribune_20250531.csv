Zardari links progress to centre-province coordination,"US
President stresses unity, democratic continuity in meetings with PPP, cabinet members
President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday said that the country's progress and prosperity were contingent upon strong coordination between the federal and provincial governments as he called for joint strategies and institutional cooperation to address the multifaceted challenges.
""National development targets can only be achieved when the Centre and provinces work in tandem,"" Zardari said during a string of high-level meetings at the Governor House in Lahore.
The president met with PPP leaders, federal ministers and political workers to discuss political stability, economic recovery and public service delivery.
The meetings focused on the upcoming budget, the worsening economic situation and ongoing development projects.
It is pertinent to note that the meetings come as the president has intensified efforts to reorganise the PPP in Punjab, and has recently issued detailed organisational directives. He has also reportedly extended his stay in the provincial capital till June 1.
According to sources, the president repeatedly stressed the need for national unity, parliamentary strength and responsive governance.
In one session, a delegation led by former premier Raja Pervez Ashraf, accompanied by PPP Punjab President Syed Hassan Murtaza, Information Secretary Nawab Shehzad Cheema, Mehr Irshad Sia and others, briefed the president on constituency-level issues and shared suggestions for public relief.
Governor Punjab Sardar Saleem Haider was also present.
Zardari said the country urgently needs political stability and national consensus, stressing that ""democratic forces must walk together to ensure public welfare and national progress"".

Weaponising water: India's destabilising role in South Asia,"PK
.
India's aggressive and unilateral approach to regional geopolitics, exemplified by its suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), is a stark reminder of its willingness to prioritise hegemonic ambitions over regional stability. This weaponisation of shared natural resources highlights India's increasing disregard for international norms and raises critical questions about its commitment to sustainable and cooperative regional development.
India also failed to present credible evidence linking Pakistan to the Pahalgam incident and instead used unfounded allegations to portray Pakistan as a scapegoat while rationalising its own escalating hostility. Such actions further obstruct dialogue and hamper regional cooperation.
Meanwhile, Pakistan has consistently advocated for a fair and neutral investigation into the Pahalgam incident, showing its commitment to justice and transparency. Even in the face of aerial provocations and civilian casualties, Pakistan refrained from retaliation until it was left with no choice.
India seems to be using unfounded accusations to strategically target Pakistan internationally and deflect from its internal issues, like human rights abuses in Kashmir and anti-Muslim violence in India. It much prefers hostility and dominance over constructive engagement and peacebuilding.
South Asia is already one of the most water-stressed regions in the world, facing climate change, resource shortages and economic inequality. The IWT once ensured fair distribution of water between India and Pakistan, but India's decision to weaken this treaty now threatens Pakistan's agricultural sector, which supports over 70% of its population.
Cutting water supplies worsens Pakistan's food security and hinders climate adaptation while also setting a dangerous precedent for powerful nations to weaponise shared resources. Such actions sow mistrust, making regional cooperation even harder.
India's actions reveal a deep contradiction in its foreign policy. On one hand, it wants to be seen as a global leader in climate action and international cooperation, aiming to be a vishwaguru (global teacher). While on the other, its divisive regional behaviour reflects selfishness and power plays. This double standard damages India's global reputation and weakens its moral authority on climate justice and sustainable development.
Global response to this crisis has been disappointing. While Pakistan's procurement of $1.4 billion from the IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility is a positive step for climate adaptation, India's IWT violation barely faces accountability. Global inaction sends a dangerous message: powerful nations can break treaties without consequences. This ultimately encourages similar behaviour elsewhere and weakens international systems.
South Asia now stands at a crucial moment. The region can either continue down a path of conflicts fuelled by resource disputes or work together to find common solutions. The South Asian Water Security Initiative (SAWSI), building on the principles of the IWT, could promote fair water sharing, joint efforts to combat climate change, and better regional stability.
But it can only succeed if India changes steps away from its current aggressive policies and takes on the role of a responsible leader, working for mutual trust and shared progress. Otherwise, water conflicts even risk causing global instability.
Water has always been a symbol of life and growth, sustaining civilisations for millennia. Its weaponisation risks destroying that legacy and deepening divisions across South Asia.
The international community must recognise the gravity of this crisis and hold India accountable for its actions, prioritising peace over political gain.
India must also rethink its priorities and let go of its hegemonic ambitions, embracing a future built on collaboration and coexistence. Only then can it restore its credibility and ensure a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.

Markets in twin cities buzz with Eid prep,"US
Shopkeepers attract customers with special discounts

The festive spirit is in full swing, with families, youth, and children eagerly searching for the best deals, turning the cities into a lively spectacle of colour, joy, and celebration.
The commercial hubs are bustling with activity as vendors display vibrant Eid collections, ranging from traditional attire to festive delicacies. Shopkeepers attract customers with special discounts, adding to the excitement and anticipation of the upcoming celebration.
This year, rising tailoring costs make off-the-rack outfits a practical choice, offering affordability and diverse fashion options. For many, these pre-stitched options strike the right balance between affordability and trendiness.
Inamur Rehman, a resident of Islamabad, while talking to the media, said, ""It's overwhelming to witness such massive crowds yet encouraging for local businesses."" he highlighted how ready-made garments have streamlined Eid shopping for many while stressing the need for more discounts.
""Shopkeepers should offer promotions to help more people celebrate Eid with ease,"" he said, adding that it's essential to support the underprivileged during this time. ""As Muslims, we have a duty to remember and support those who are less fortunate,"" said Romana, a shopper from Rawalpindi.
""This year, I chose ready-to-wear clothes because of their variety and affordability,"" she said. ""I found everything I needed, in line with the latest trends and traditional styles."" She urged authorities and business owners to introduce more price cuts on Eid-related items. ""If discounts are offered, lower-income families would be able to participate in the celebrations without financial strain,"" she added.
After spotting the crescent moon of Dhul Hijjah on coming Wednesday, the shopping frenzy is set to intensify as malls and bazaars extend hours to accommodate surging crowds.

"Cabinet approves major climate, legal reforms","US
Expresses concern over Ali Wazir's repeated arrests
The 33rd meeting of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Cabinet, chaired by Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, convened on Friday to deliberate on a broad array of legislative, administrative, and development matters.
Key cabinet members, the Chief Secretary, Advocate General, and senior officials attended the session.
Briefing media on the outcomes, Advisor to the Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations, Barrister Dr Muhammad Ali Saif, said the cabinet approved the Climate Action Board (CAB) Bill 2025, a landmark step toward a coordinated provincial response to climate change.

It will function autonomously and be empowered to appoint staff and consultants necessary to execute its mandate.
In legislative actions, the cabinet endorsed forwarding three provincial assembly resolutions to the federal government. Resolution No 167, passed on April 28, voiced grave concern over the repeated arrests and alleged mistreatment of former MNA Ali Wazir. It demanded his immediate release, access to medical care, and withdrawal of politically motivated cases.
Resolution No 161 urged a revision of Pakistan's Afghanistan policy, citing its failure to curb terrorism in K-P and its negative impact on bilateral relations. It called for K-P to be given a more active role in peace dialogues.
The third resolution, No 168, condemned India's aggressive posture, including threats related to the Indus Waters Treaty, and expressed solidarity with Pakistan's armed forces. The assembly urged the international community to act against India's violations of international obligations.
Among development projects, the cabinet approved an enhanced budget for the construction of Jani Khel police station in Bannu, increasing costs from Rs100 million to Rs140.43 million. It also sanctioned a cadastral mapping pilot project in Peshawar and Mohmand through an MoU between the Board of Revenue and the Survey of Pakistan.
Further approvals included amendments to Health Department recruitment rules enabling hiring of dental surgeons and nurses, and changes to the Tourism Act 2019 to empower the board to manage employment matters of tourism police.
The cabinet ratified construction of a 750-meter road near Odigram Bridge in Lower Dir at a cost of Rs190 million and raised the budget for Takatak-Haya Sairai Bridge to Rs1.02 billion.

Poland moves to curb migrant crossings,"US
.
Poland said Friday that it had launched an information campaign abroad to deter migrants from trying to cross into the European Union through its border with Belarus.
Warsaw has blamed Belarus and its ally Russia for what it calls a hybrid operation to increase migratory pressure at its eastern border in a bid to destabilise the bloc, allegations both countries deny.
In March, the Polish government suspended the right to seek asylum, a move intended to deter irregular migrants that was met with outrage from rights groups.
""Poland protects its borders effectively. We've launched an information campaign in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Pakistan and Egypt that is aimed at illegal migrants,"" Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski said on X.
He linked to one of the campaign's videos that showed Polish border guards escorting individuals, as well as other images like barking dogs, stop signs, handcuffs and money.
""If someone illegally crosses the border, they will not receive asylum,"" the narrator says in Pashto.

Postal Life Insurance awaits Rs48b refund,"US
.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatization has directed the finance ministry to make a plan of returning Rs48 billion to Postal Life Insurance, as the company is struggling to meet its expenditures.
A meeting of the standing committee was held on Friday under the chair of Dr Farooq Sattar.
Finance ministry officials told the panel that the government had earmarked Rs14 billion over the last four financial years for the insurance firm. However, it has utilized only half the amount. The company officials told the committee that the organization
was established in 2021 on an emergency basis to get Pakistan's name removed from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s grey list.
Postal Life Insurance currently possesses Rs48 billion in funds but the amount is lying with the finance ministry, which is neither returning the amount nor paying interest, the company officials told the NA panel. They added that the company failed to pay its clients their insurance claims on time due to paucity of funds.

Govt official martyred in Surab terror siege
A senior district administration official was martyred after heavily armed terrorists, belonging to Fitna al Hindustan, launched a coordinated attack on a bank and the residences of government officers in Surab, Balochistan, officials said on Friday.
Shahid Rind, a spokesperson for the provincial government, and Hamza Shafqaat, the commissioner of Quetta, confirmed that Hidayatullah Buledi, the additional deputy commissioner (ADC) of Surab district, was martyred while fighting the terrorists.
Officials and witnesses stated that 20 to 30 terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan entered the market of Surab city on motorcycles in the evening and targeted soft civilian areas such as banks and markets.
Ordinary Baloch women and children were also attacked in the market, they added.
""Heavily armed militants launched a coordinated assault on a bank and the residences of senior government officers in Surab Bazaar,"" spokesperson Rind said in a statement. ""The attackers looted the bank and set fire to several official residences,"" he added.
During the attack, Rind said, ADC Revenue Hidayatullah Baloch Buledi was martyred while resisting the terrorists. He said that women and children were present in the ADC's residence at the time of the assault.
However, despite the presence of his family members, Buledi stood firm against the attackers.
He paid rich tribute to Buledi, saying that the ADC fought valiantly to protect Baloch children and women from the terrorists and ultimately laid down his life in the line of duty. ""He has set a new example of bravery by sacrificing his life for the nation,"" Rind said.
""Deputy Commissioner Surab compound was attacked. Unfortunately, Additional Deputy Commissioner Mr Hidayat Buledi embraced martyrdom. The attack was carried out by Fitna al Hindustan. Mr Buledi was a LUMS alumnus. Levies and other law enforcement agencies valiantly fought them back,"" Shafqaat tweeted.
According to Rind, the attack was not a random act of violence but part of a calculated attempt to destabilise the province. ""This operation was carried out by Indian-backed proxies. It is a clear effort to challenge the state's authority and spread fear,"" he asserted.
""By targeting Baloch areas and Baloch women and children, Fitna al Hindustan has once again proven that these Indian-sponsored terrorists have no connection with Balochistan and Baloch traditions,"" the spokesperson stated. ""Indian proxies have taken action on their orders.""
Security forces, including the Frontier Corps (FC), police and Levies, promptly reached the spot and launched a joint clearance operation. ""Search and clearance operations are ongoing, and the enemies of peace will be brought to justice,"" the spokesperson said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the cowardly attack on innocent citizens, officers of the administration, and a bank by terrorists in Surab. He paid tribute to ADC Hidayatullah Buledi for embracing martyrdom while defending his area from terrorists.
The prime minister expressed sympathy with the bereaved family members of the martyr. ""ADC Hidayatullah Buledi set an example of bravery while fighting against the terrorists. The sympathies of the whole nation are with the family of the martyred,"" he said in a statement.
Shehbaz said that terrorists had targeted innocent and unarmed citizens, including children and women.
""The attack by cowardly terrorists on the citizens and their properties is openly and evidently reflective of their animosity towards the people and the progress of Balochistan,"" he said.
""The war against terrorists will continue until their complete elimination from the country. The armed forces of Pakistan are working day and night to exterminate the proxies who are spreading terrorism in Pakistan under the patronage of India,"" the prime minister stated.
""The whole nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces in completely wiping out the elements involved in terrorism with the abetment of India.""
He directed that the persons involved in the incident be identified and given exemplary punishment.

"Swiatek, Sabalenka into French Open last 16","US
Musetti battled against Argentine Mariano Navone to progress into the next round.
Iga Swiatek kept her bid for a fourth consecutive French Open title on track Friday, advancing to the last 16 at Roland Garros along with top women's seed Aryna Sabalenka and Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen.
Reigning men's champion Carlos Alcaraz will look to book his place in the last 16 later to join Italy's Lorenzo Musetti and Dane Holger Rune who both rallied to set up a fourth-round clash.
Swiatek came through despite a very close second set against Romania's world number 60 Jaqueline Cristian, winning 6-2, 7-5 in nearly two hours in sweltering conditions on Court Suzanne Lenglen.
""Before it was 20 degrees when I played my first match but today it was 30 degrees. It is not easy to adjust but I have played in every condition,"" said Swiatek.
The 23-year-old Pole awaits the winner of a big-hitting showdown between Elena Rybakina and Jelena Ostapenko, who has beaten Swiatek in all six of their previous meetings.
A former world number one, who has fallen to fifth in the WTA rankings, Swiatek has not won a title since her third consecutive title on the Parisian clay in 2024.
Swiatek broke the 60th-ranked Cristian twice in a comfortable first set, but she was pushed a lot harder by her rival in the second and had to save six break points.
""She went for it every time I gave her a chance,"" said Swiatek, hoping to become the first woman to win four successive Roland Garros titles since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.
""I'm just happy that I was super solid and didn't give any free points but she used her chances.""
Earlier Sabalenka produced a dominant display in a 6-2, 6-3 win over Serbian left-hander Olga Danilovic.
""Olga is a fighter. I enjoyed our battle,"" said Madrid Open winner Sabalenka after beating her 34th-ranked rival in 79 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier.
The 27-year-old Belarusian next plays 16th-seeded American Amanda Anisimova for a place in the quarter-finals.
Anisimova ousted Danish 22nd seed Clara Tauson 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in their third-round tie.
Zheng ended the run of Canadian teenager Victoria Mboko 6-3, 6-4.
The Chinese eighth seed has now won nine successive matches at Roland Garros following her run to Olympic gold last year.
""We had some really good points, it was not an easy match,"" said Zheng.
""Today was a tough battle against Qinwen,"" said 18-year-old Grand Slam newcomer Mboko.
""Lots of things to learn and hopefully come back to my next tournament with some more positives and (having) improved on my game.""
Zheng is through to the fourth round in Paris for the second time and will next Russian 19th seed Liudmila Samsonova who brushed aside Ukraine's Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-3.
Zheng and Samsonova will both be bidding for a first Roland Garros quarter-final berth.
Eighth seed Musetti won 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 against Argentine Mariano Navone in three hours and 25 minutes.
Musetti arrived in Paris as one of the form players in the world after backing up his runner-up finish in Monte Carlo with semi-final runs in Madrid and Rome.
But the Italian dropped his first set in Paris against world number 97 Navone.
""I've grown up a lot. A match like this I don't know if I would (have) come back a few years ago,"" said Musetti.
""The heat was pretty tough to manage. But happy to find a way to turn around the match.""
Musetti, who reached the fourth round in Paris for the third time, next plays Rune who rallied past France's Quentin Halys in five sets.
In the night session, second seed Alcaraz steps up for a third-round meeting with 69th-ranked Bosnian Damir Dzumhur.
Four-time Grand Slam champion Alcaraz is the title favourite after securing the Monte Carlo Masters and Italian Open trophies in the build-up to the clay-court major. The 22-year-old Spaniard has reached the second week in 10 of his last 11 Slam appearances.

France bans smoking in public to protect kids,"IN
New law to cover beaches, parks, schools
France will ban smoking in all outdoor places that can be accessed by children, including beaches, parks and bus stops, the health and family minister announced Thursday.
Famed as a country where smokers linger over cigarettes on cafe terraces or strolling down cobblestone streets, France has increasingly tightened restrictions on tobacco use in public spaces in recent years.
The new ban, which will enter into force on July 1, will cover all spaces where children could be present, including ""beaches, parks, public gardens, outside of schools, bus stops and sports venues"", said the minister Catherine Vautrin.
""Tobacco must disappear where there are children,"" Vautrin said in an interview published by the regional Ouest-France daily on its website.
The freedom to smoke ""stops where children's right to breathe clean air starts,"" she said.
The ban will also extend to schools, to stop students smoking in front of them. Offenders face a fine of up to 135 euros ($154), Vautrin said.
The ban will not extend to France's iconic cafe terraces however, the minister said. Electronic cigarettes, which have boomed in France in recent years, are also not covered.
France already forbids smoking in public spaces such as workplaces, airports and train stations, as well as playgrounds. Anti-smoking groups had been fighting for a broader ban.
An estimated 35 per cent of France's population are smokers — higher than the averages for Europe (25 per cent) and the world (21 per cent), according to the World Health Organisation.
Around 75,000 people are estimated to die from tobacco-related complications each year in France.
According to a recent opinion survey, six out of 10 French people (62 per cent) favour banning smoking in public places.
Vautrin said there were no plans to place additional taxes on cigarettes ""at the moment"", citing the thriving black market that emerged after existing taxes were introduced in a bid to discourage smoking. afp

Pakistan becomes co-signatory to body
China signed a convention setting up an international organisation for mediation in Hong Kong on Friday that Beijing hopes will be on par with the International Court of Justice and bolster the city's international credentials.
The move comes amid growing geopolitical tensions that have been exacerbated by US President Donald Trump's global trade war and fuelled risks of a sharp worldwide economic downturn.
Pakistan became a co-signatory to the IOMed, a statement by the Foreign Office said.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar signed the convention establishing the organisation during a ceremony attended by officials from several countries, including Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos and Serbia.
Representatives from around 20 international organisations, including the United Nations, were also expected to participate, according to Hong Kong's public broadcaster RTHK.
""IOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,"" the statement quoted him as saying.
Speaking at the high-profile gathering, Dar lauded the visionary leadership of the People's Republic of China for spearheading the creation of IOMed. He hailed China for once again leading a transformative initiativecomparable in impact to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
The DPM underlined that Pakistan reaffirmed its commitment to peaceful conflict resolution by becoming a founding member of the newly established International Organization for Mediation (IOMed).
Senator Dar described the establishment of IOMed as ""the birth of an important global institution dedicated to mediation and peaceful dispute resolution,"" and commended the selection of Hong Kong as the organization's headquarters. Calling the city a ""super connector,"" he noted its symbolic value in bridging East and West.
Reiterating Pakistan's dedication to the principles of the UN Charter and international law, Dar highlighted the country's recent efforts, including the establishment of the International Mediation and Arbitration Center (IMAC) in Pakistan, aimed at advancing commercial dispute resolution.
The Foreign Minister also used the platform to draw attention to pressing global conflicts, citing unresolved issues such as Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian territories, and warned against the rise of unilateralism and populism.
The mediation body aims to cement Hong Kong's presence as a top centre to resolve disputes between countries, leader John Lee said earlier this week, adding that it's status would be on par with the International Court of Justice and the Permanent Court of Arbitration of the United Nations in The Hague.
Indonesia, Pakistan, Laos, Cambodia and Serbia were among the countries attending the signing ceremony. Representatives from 20 international bodies including the United Nations were also expected to join, public broadcaster RTHK said.

BJP leader admits downing of five Indian jets,"PK
Former MLA Swamy says Modi has failed so he has to go
Subramanian Swamy, a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, has admitted that Pakistan downed five Indian fighter jets, including Rafale aircraft, during the four-day military confrontation between the two neighbouring countries earlier this month.
Swamy, a known critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fired a broadside against his own party's government, denouncing the failure of the authorities in apprehending the perpetrators of April 22 Pahalgam attack in which 26 tourists were killed.
Tensions between the two countries escalated after the attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) tourist resort. It turned into a full scale military confrontation, when India fired missiles at mosques and civilian targets in six Pakistani cities in the wee hours of May 7.
The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) was swift to respond to Indian aggression, downing six enemy aircraft. On May 10, Pakistan launched operation Bunaynum Marsoos, hitting dozens of Indian military targets and forcing New Delhi to request for the ceasefire, which Pakistan accepted.
Though the international media confirmed that Pakistan had shot down Indian warplanes, including its prized Rafales, but the Indian government kept mum to officially concede to the Pakistan's claims. Swamy is the first senior BJP leader to finally admit that Pakistani was right.
""Pakistan shot down five of our aircraft using Chinese fighter jets. Their performance was commendable, whereas our French Rafale jets were underwhelming,"" Swamy said, while speaking on a podcast. ""Insufficient,"" he replied, when asked about the French-made Rafale jets.
Swamy also levelled serious allegations regarding the controversial Rafale deal, claiming that there was widespread corruption in the procurement process. ""This will never be investigated as long as Modi is the prime minister, because he won't allow it,"" he asserted.
Swamy denounced the Indian government's failure in apprehending those, who perpetrated ""a grave crime"" in Pahalgam. ""We should have avenged it, but we failed to do so,"" lamented Swamy, who served in the Rajya Sabha – upper house of Indian parliament – from 2016 to 2022.
In response to another question about Modi's public rapport with US President Donald Trump, he dismissed the relationship as ""superficial"". He said: ""Modi is a master manipulator, deceiving the public. But Indians living abroad know the truth — he has no real stature in USA. He is, in essence, a servant.""
Swamy also accused Modi of caving under international pressure during the crisis. ""The United States asked for a ceasefire, and you submitted. Who authorised that decision? Was it the military? No. It was your fear of the United States, and especially Donald Trump. Modi's cowardice has been exposed.""
He repeated his call for Modi's resignation. ""We need a new course of action in the coming months,"" he said. ""Modi must step down. He has failed to uphold the founding principles of our republic so he has to go. It's not just my opinion — many others agree, though they are afraid to say it publicly,"" he added.

Power companies violating agreement: minister,"US
He states companies not utilizing imported gas as per agreement, instead selling expensive gas domestically
Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik has stated that power-generating companies are not utilizing imported gas as per agreements and resultantly expensive gas is being sold to domestic consumers at subsidized rates, leading to a rise in circular debt.
""The power companies are violating their agreements, which is increasing the liabilities of the national gas importing companies,"" said Malik, while speaking to the media at the head office of the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) on Friday.
The minister revealed that smuggled fuel is spreading like a ""cancer,"" and to curb it, petrol pumps are being registered and digital nozzles installed.
""The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) will become fully digital in two to three months, enabling complete monitoring of fuel supply and sales from refineries to petrol pumps,"" he said, adding that 85% of moving stock digital tracking has already been completed.
The energy minister said no final decision has been made yet to increase the Petroleum Development Levy (PDL), and its enforcement on prices has not taken place for now.
He emphasized the need for a coherent and unified energy policy, suggesting that all energy sources must be evaluated on equal standards.
Malik highlighted that the government's success in reducing electricity prices and maintaining current petrol and diesel prices is a significant achievement.
However, relief in the electricity sector has become a burden on the petroleum sector.

LHC directs humane euthanasia of stray dogs,"US
Upholds animal birth control policy
The Lahore High Court (LHC) has directed authorities across Punjab to euthanise only incurably ill or mortally wounded stray dogsand to do so strictly in accordance with medically approved and humane protocols.
Justice Shahid Karim issued the order while hearing petitions filed by Eiraj Hassan and others, seeking proper enforcement of the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Policy 2021 and protection of stray dogs against inhumane culling practices.
The court emphasised that the policy must be implemented ""in letter and spirit"" by all concerned departments, including the Local Government and Community Development (LG&CD) Department and its affiliated officers throughout Punjab.
The 2021 policy explicitly outlines that only dogs diagnosed as incurably ill or mortally wounded by a qualified veterinarian appointed by a Tehsil Implementation Committee (TIC) can be euthanised. It further mandates that euthanasia must be carried out humanely - by administering sodium pentothal for adult dogs or Thiopental Intraperitoneal for puppies.
Crucially, the policy prohibits euthanising a dog in the presence of another dog.
The policy also prescribes guidelines for the care and management of healthy stray dogs.
Sterilised dogs must be vaccinated before being released, and marked for identification through ear clipping, tattoos, nylon collars, or tokens.
The branding of dogs is expressly forbidden. Detailed records of all sterilised and vaccinated dogs must be maintained.
Petitioners' counsel, Altamush Saeed, urged the court to recognise that dogs are sentient beings capable of emotions and therefore must not be subjected to cruelty or brutal killings.
He argued that the most effective approach to controlling the stray dog population and eradicating rabies lies in mass vaccination and sterilization through established TNVR (Trap, Neuter, Vaccinate, Return) protocols, supervised by qualified veterinarians.
Saeed further highlighted that even rabid dogs should not be indiscriminately culled and stressed the need for sterilizing and relocating healthy dogs rather than killing them.
He also called for public awareness campaigns, staff training in animal welfare, and the introduction of animal welfare education in schools in line with Articles 9, 9A, and 25A of the Constitution, which relate to the right to life, security, and education.
The court was informed that various government departments had already issued directives to implement the policy and compliance had begun across multiple local government offices. Justice Karim acknowledged the progress made, noting that the LG&CD appeared fully aware of its legal obligations and was taking steps accordingly.
""Since the respondents are complying with the policy, as is also evident from the replies filed in this case, the petition is disposed of with the direction that the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Policy 2021 shall continue to be implemented and followed by all concerned departments,"" Justice Karim stated in his concluding remarks.
The court's order marks a significant shift in the state's approach to stray dog managementfocusing on humane treatment, scientific methods, and legal responsibility rather than reactive culling, often carried out under public pressure or panic.
Animal rights advocates have welcomed the judgment, calling it a progressive step toward ethical and effective animal population control and public health safety.

Pakistan upgrades ties with Afghanistan
Pakistan on Friday officially confirmed that it was upgrading diplomatic ties with Afghanistan and would soon exchange ambassadors with Kabul, in a significant shift in Islamabad's policy towards Kabul.
The announcement of upgrading ties was first made by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi last week when he hosted foreign ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan in Beijing.
On Friday, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who held a second meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister within a span of 10 days in Hong Kong, issued a statement, announcing the upgrading of ties with Kabul.
""Pakistan-Afghanistan relations are on a positive trajectory after my very productive visit to Kabul with the Pakistan delegation on 19th April 2025,"" Dar said in a statement.
""To maintain this momentum, I am pleased to announce the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its Chargé d'Affaires in Kabul to the level of Ambassador,"" he added.
""I am confident this step would further contribute towards enhanced engagement, deepen Pak-Afghan cooperation in economic, security, CT & trade areas and promote further exchanges between two fraternal countries,"" he further said.
Pakistan and Afghanistan have maintained diplomatic presence in each other's capitals but the missions were headed by charged affairs and not the full time Ambassadors.
Exchanging ambassadors means that Pakistan would move a step closer to recognizing the Taliban government. China was the first country which sent a full time Ambassador to Kabul and accepted the Taliban envoy in March this year.
A senior Pakistani official defended the move, saying apart from China, other regional countries including Turkey and Russia were also contemplating appointing their full time Ambassadors to Kabul.
It is believed that China was nudging both sides from behind the scenes to resolve their issues through dialogue.
Sources said for the first time the Taliban government had shown not only willingness but initiated certain steps to rein in groups operating out of its territory.
The Taliban government recently launched a crackdown on elements supporting groups inimical to Pakistan. Kabul in particularly targeted Afghan citizens, who joined the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Another major sign suggesting a shift in its approach was a statement by Senior Afghan Taliban commander Saeedullah Saeed, who on Wednesday warned militant factions against unauthorized jihad, particularly in Pakistan, saying such actions were against Shariah and the orders of the Islamic Emirate's leadership.
Speaking at a police passing-out ceremony, Saeed said that fighting in any country, including Pakistan, without the explicit command of the Amir is not permissible.
""Joining various groups to wage jihad abroad does not make one a true mujahid,"" he stated. ""Only the Amir of the state has the authority to declare jihad — not individuals or groups.""
Saeed emphasized that those carrying out attacks independently or moving between regions to conduct operations cannot be classified as legitimate fighters under Islamic law. ""Jihad based on personal ego or group loyalty is considered fasad (corruption), not legitimate resistance,"" he added.
The issue of terrorism was one of the key talking points during the three-way talks in Beijing.
The Chinese official read out said Wang Yi stressed the need for combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. He also called for joint cooperation to combat the menace of terrorism and cautioned against external interference.
In the wake of recent escalation in tensions into a military conflict between India and Pakistan, New Delhi was trying to reach out to the Taliban government.
Breaking from its decades-old policy, Indian External Affairs Minister S J Shankar spoke to the Afghan interim Foreign Minister.
The move seems to be part of India's recalibration in order to put pressure on Pakistan. But the meeting in Beijing appears to have preempted that move.
The Chinese foreign ministry statement suggested that there was great incentive for the Taliban government to work closely with Beijing and Islamabad.

Bitcoin Strategic Reserve,"US
.
Pakistan's recent announcement of a state-backed Bitcoin Strategic Reserve is the latest in a series of major shifts in global crypto policy and is earning simultaneous praise and consternation. Though the policy change comes on the heels of the US setting up its own strategic crypto reserve — the largest in the world — the US reserve has been populated with only recovered and seized crypto, and the country has been clear that it does not intend to get involved in mining.
Pakistan, on the other hand, must learn from the experiences of El Salvador, which became the first country to fully legalise crypto in 2021 and the first to have a crypto-induced economic crash a year later. Despite Bitcoin having recovered its price since El Salvador has had to scale back crypto purchases and mining to meet the terms of an IMF bailout that was necessitated by the failure of crypto to help improve its teetering economy, which advocates had promised was a sure thing — something that should ring familiar for Pakistanis.
Our Bitcoin czar, Bilal Bin Saqib, recently said assets would ""never, ever be sold"" as a long-term bet on decentralised finance. While this may help a country benefit from price appreciation in the long run, Pakistan's foreign reserves are often little more than pocket change, leaving little wiggle room to spend on crypto without sacrificing elsewhere. Also, Bilal skipped over the point that Bitcoin is still technically illegal in Pakistan under SBP and SECP rules.
The pivot to crypto is a high-stakes gamble which, if executed transparently, could attract foreign investment and foster financial inclusion. But the current approach feels more like a technocratic fantasy, that could prove to be two steps back for the economy and a great leap forward for corruption.
After all, the Bitcoin advisors include Binance, which does business with the children and companies of President Trump, and World Liberty Financial, which is majority-owned by the Trump family and includes investors who faced fraud charges until the Trump administration dropped the cases against them. Or maybe that is the goal — investors have dropped billions into Trump-owned crypto products. Most of that money will end up in the Trump family's pockets, while the investors have seen benefits ranging from pardons to favourable White House policies.

Electricity focus hurts balance,"US
Minister says RLNG ignored by power producers while circular debt, diesel smuggling both rise
Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik has stated that the overemphasis on the power sector in recent years has undermined other vital components of Pakistan's energy landscape, particularly the gas and petroleum sectors.
During a visit to the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) head office in Karachi, Malik remarked that while electricity remains a critical component of national energy planning, the persistent neglect of the petroleum and gas sectors is aggravating existing problems, most notably the growing circular debt. He revealed that power generation companies had committed to purchasing six LNG cargoes but are now failing to honour those agreements, leaving around 600 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of imported RLNG unused. This failure, he cautioned, is leading to an accumulation of receivables at Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and contributing to a rise in circular debtcontrary to International Monetary Fund (IMF) directives aimed at reducing it.
Malik disclosed that the government is considering borrowing from banks to cover gas-sector dues, following a financing model already used in the power sector. He also raised the alarm over rampant diesel smuggling, calling it a ""cancer"" within the petroleum industry. To counter this, the ministry has launched a wide-ranging digitisation initiative. All trucks transporting petroleum products will be brought under a digital monitoring system, and every unloading point will be officially recorded.
The digitisation drive will also cover petrol pumps across the country, where manual nozzlesfrequently used for fuel theft or the sale of smuggled fuelwill be replaced with digital meters linked directly to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
To finance this upgrade, the petroleum ministry is preparing a proposal for the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to approve an additional fee on petroleum products. Though Malik did not specify the fee amount, sources suggest it may be Rs1.35 per litre for oil marketing companies and Rs1.40 for dealers.
On the issue of new residential gas connections, Malik said a final decision would be made after consultation with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. He noted that the gas pipeline infrastructureparticularly in Karachiis outdated, with some pipelines over 40 years old. SSGC's network alone spans 55,000 kilometres, underscoring the magnitude of the challenge.
Malik also discussed plans to improve energy trade with the United States by exploring petroleum imports. A special committee under the finance minister is reviewing the proposal.
He concluded his Karachi visit with a tour of Pak-Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO), where he was received by Managing Director Irteza Ali Qureshi and senior company officials.

Govt eyes 4.2% growth in FY26,"US
Inflation seen at 7.5% as tight fiscal, monetary policies continue
The government has proposed a 4.2% economic growth target for the next fiscal year, on the back of the revival of both the sunken agriculture and industrial sectors, but stated that achieving the target will depend on the effective management of the economy.
It has also set a 7.5% inflation target for the next fiscal year but said that the external sector may come under pressure due to multiple factors.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government will continue maintaining tight fiscal and monetary policies, marking the fourth consecutive year of fiscal consolidation, according to the proposed plan for fiscal year 2025-26. The plan will be presented to the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) on Monday for approval, before being laid before the National Economic Council (NEC) for final endorsement. The APCC will be chaired by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, while the NEC, a constitutional body, is chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
According to the proposed plan for FY2025-26, Pakistan's economy is projected to grow by 4.2%, signalling expectations of a broad-based recovery. The commodity-producing sectors are forecast to expand by 4.4%, driven by a 4.5% rebound in agriculture and 3.5% growth in Large Scale Manufacturing, as per the proposed plan.
This year, the agriculture sector performed poorly, posting only 0.6% growth as all major crops showed negative growth.
However, according to the planning ministry's new plan, agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops targeted to grow 6.7 % and cotton ginning with a goal to increase its output by 7% as well as robust performance in the livestock sector.
In a bid to show some decent economic growth in this fiscal year, the government claimed that the livestock sector posted 4.7% growththe highest in 25 years. For the next fiscal year, livestock is projected to grow by 4.2%.
The proposed plan shows that the industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in Large Scale Manufacturing, with a growth target of 3.5%, along with 3% growth in mining and quarrying, and sustained growth momentum in construction and electricity, gas, and water supply.
The electricity, gas, and water supply sector, which was claimed to have grown by 29% this year, is projected to grow by only 3.5% next year. Many observers have questioned the credibility of the 29% growth figure claimed by the government for this year.
The construction sector, which the government said grew by 6.6% this year, is targeted to grow by only 3.8% in the next fiscal year.
The proposed plan states that fiscal and monetary policies will aim to ensure consolidation and stability, with inflation expected at 7.5% due to the low base effect, risks of continued trade tensions, and domestic tariff rationalisation measures.
The government plans to drastically cut import duties to open the economy to foreign competition, following the advice of both foreign and local private consultants.
The proposed plan states that the services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4%, supported by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage and communications, financial services, and real estate.
The National Accounts Committee approved a 2.7% economic growth rate for the current fiscal year, falling short of the 3.6% target. This shortfall was primarily due to a sharp contraction in key commodity-producing sectors, including a 13.5% decline in important crops caused by adverse weather conditions, reduced rainfall, input shortages, and policy shifts.
However, the plan states that economic growth projections for the next fiscal year reflect cautious optimism, contingent on effective macroeconomic management and stable external conditions.
For FY2025-26, the government has proposed a national savings target of 14.3% of GDP. The investment-to-GDP ratio is projected to rise to 14.7%, up from 13.8% this fiscal year.
According to the plan, the higher investment ratio reflects a narrowing saving-investment gap that will be financed through modest external inflows. The current account deficit is projected to remain low at 0.4% of GDP for the next fiscal year.
The government again missed the investment-to-GDP target this fiscal year, and it remains rare for annual targets set at the beginning of the year to be fully achieved.
Public investment is projected to rise from 2.9% to 3.2% of GDP, while private investment is expected to increase from 9.1% to 9.8%. This year, the private investment target was missed by a significant margin.
The proposed plan also warns that the external sector may come under pressure, as easing import restrictions and debt repayments could widen the current account deficit. However, strong remittances, recovering exports, and anticipated external financing are expected to help cushion these pressures and support external sustainability, it added.

Nobody's content with the 'content',"US
Fahad Mustafa's words against family vlogging point to a larger debate
Recently, Fahad Mustafa's old comments against family vlogging and the overuse of the word 'content' resurfaced online and caused an uproar among Tiktokers and YouTubers.
""'Content' is the most overrated word in this country. There is no such thing as content. Everyone is selling their families. They haven't even left graveyards alone. They go to their mother's grave, and record themselves saying I'm missing my mother, please pray for her. What kind of 'content' is this?"" Mustafa had said when asked about sharing the screen with digital content creators during a TV appearance. ""I can tell a good or a bad story. But I can't sell my family. I can't sell myself. If you go on a film or TV shoot, it takes time to do this. They can't understand that this takes us 8 to 10 hours since they live in a 10-second world.""
While the comment offended the Instagram, TikTok and YouTube content creators especially Rajab Butt, as Ricky Gervais says, ""Just because you're offended doesn't mean you're right.""
This back-and-forth has sparked a debate between the traditional media vs digital 'content'. But it's not a clash between Mustafa and Butt. The actor didn't even mention the YouTuber by name. The scope of this is much bigger than a forced, illogical personal feud.
Content overload
What Mustafa spoke about is a worldwide concern of artists in the face of countless challenges faced today. Be it AI coming in as a wrecking ball to destroy authentic human expression, shorter attention spans engineered over the last decade by social media overconsumption or the declining understanding of storytelling and art due to the aforementioned issues, there are already more than enough battles artists today are fighting to preserve their chosen media and forms of expression.
This is not to defend shows like Mustafa's Jeeto Pakistan, which feed into the same Black Mirror-esque humiliation-in-exchange-of-gifts convention. But Mustafa has created work with a certain artistic integrity in film and TV both, namely Actor in Law and Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum.
However, phone cameras and social media platforms combined today have created an illusion that everyone is an artist, actor, or filmmaker. While the democratisation of the media has had numerous benefits, and this is certainly not an issue of gatekeeping, talking into a camera and showing what you cooked for lunch does not exactly require an abundance of talent or skill.
There are many arguments to be made against family vlogging. The internet is full of stories of disgruntled and traumatized individuals forced by their in-house vlogger, be it a parent or a child, to be documented 24/7 for the sake of views. But the crux of the matter isn't even that.
It's the fact that 'content' has replaced art, cinema and storytelling.
The issues start with the usage of the word 'content' which piles up every artform into one giant automated factory where every creation serves the algorithm and the algorithm, in turn, feeds it back to us.
It disintegrates the distinguishing characters of each art form and strips it of any value. This is why Mustafa's comments about the word ring true. If everything is content, then there's no difference between a feature film that takes years to produce and a bag of apples.
This argument doesn't devalue platforms like YouTube which can be used for a myriad of purposes from education to art and music and everything in between. It criticizes the forced homogeneity of all art forms. And family vlogging is definitely not an art form.
Casting influencers
In recent years, even in Hollywood, we have seen a number of so-called social media influencers turn to film and TV. But none comes to mind when thinking about who has excelled and been recognized for their skills. One can bring up Logan Paul but he has succeeded in WWE and pro-wrestling is a vastly different kind of storytelling than film or TV.
Films which star the influencers usually land on streaming platforms which again play by the algorithm and casting content creators becomes essentially the same as product placement or a gimmick to cater to the said individual's social media following.
Earlier this year in an interview with Variety, Ethan Hawke also lamented the fact that filmmakers are being forced to cast based on Instagram following.
He said, ""Sometimes I'll be setting a movie up and someone will say, 'Oh, you should cast Suzie.' I'm like, 'Who is she?' 'She has 10 million followers.' I'm like, 'OK cool, has she acted before?' 'No, but' And you're like, 'Wow, so this is going to help me get the movie made? This is crazy.' So if I don't have this public-facing [platform], I don't have a career? And if I get more followers I might get that part? What?""
Just because someone is a social media 'content' creator doesn't automatically mean they'd be good at acting or creating any kind of art. The mindset involved in both is on the opposite ends of the spectrum.
That ties in with another question: aren't most studio films made with the intent of profit and hence, they cast bankable actors to attract their fanbase. How is that different from casting a digital content creator?
One response to that would be that the bankable actors can usually, if not always, act and do their job well. It's the same as when Pakistani media networks and digital platforms tried to make the 'Chaiwala' into the next big star after he went viral for his looks. It didn't work.
As a filmmaker, there's a massive difference between working with trained professionals and amateur enthusiasts. Most of the time, the lack of understanding of the process results in a low-calibre work. But we live in a world where everyone only wants to be on screen and get those 15 minutes of fame. And if 10-second reels can do that, who would spend months and years to tell a good story?

"PTI MNA, ex-MPA among 11 convicted in May 9 rioting case","US
ATC judge imposes various prison terms, fines; Four convicts arrested; Charges included attacking Ramna police station
The Islamabad Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Friday convicted and sentenced 11 individuals to various prison terms and fines in connection with the violence that occurred on May 9, 2023.
The charges against them included attacking the Ramna police station, assaulting police personnel, committing arson, and spreading terrorism.
Among those convicted were Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Member of National Assembly Abdul Latif and former Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa MPA Wazirzada Kailashi.
Following the announcement of the verdict, four of the convicts, Muhammad Akram, Mira Khan, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, were arrested from the court premises. Arrest warrants were issued for the remaining seven, namely Abdul Latif, Wazirzada Kailashi, Zaryab Khan, Samuel Robert, Abdul Basit, Shan Ali and Muhammad Yousuf.
The verdict, delivered by ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, stated that the accused attacked the Ramna police station, opened fire, pelted stones and attempted to kill police officials. They also set motorcycles on fire.
According to the court's decision, the accused were sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined Rs200,000 each for acts of terrorism.
Moreover, they were sentenced to five years in prison and fined Rs50,000 each for attempting to kill police personnel; four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 each for burning motorcycles; another four years in prison and a Rs40,000 fine each for setting the police station on fire; three months in prison for obstructing police work; and one month in prison for violating Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
The May 9 cases refer to violent attacks on state installations that followed the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan on corruption charges in 2023. A number of individuals were arrested in these cases, which have been tried by both military courts and anti-terrorism courts in various cities.
ATCs across the country continue to hear related cases. In April, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Chief Justice Yahya Afridi, directed ATCs to conclude proceedings in May 9 cases within four months.
In Lahore, 14 cases remain pending in two ATCs, which are currently hearing them on a daily basis at Kot Lakhpat Central Jail. However, a judge of one of these courts noted that the unavailability of case records was creating significant obstacles to meeting the Supreme Court's deadline.
ATC Administrative Judge Manzer Ali Gill wrote to Punjab Prosecutor General Syed Farhad Ali Shah, stating that the police records were not being provided to the deputy prosecutor conducting the trial for various reasons.
The judge emphasised that the matter had been brought to the attention of the prosecution office to take necessary steps to ensure that witnesses could be recorded on every hearing date. He cautioned that failing such action, the court would proceed according to the law.
It has been observed that the majority of May 9 cases have faced adjournments due to the unavailability of relevant records. On each hearing date, police officials have informed the courts that the case records remain with the Supreme Court.

Using Fawad and Hania as examples, Faysal pointed out that while fans may have expected a faster or louder reaction from them, attacking them publicly was unnecessary and potentially harmful. ""Okay, let's talk about Fawad Khan and Hania Aamir - why are people going after them? I didn't like the bashing they received,"" he said.
Acknowledging the criticism Fawad received for not immediately speaking up, Faysal offered a more empathetic perspective. ""Yes, we admit that Fawad tweeted (for Pahalgam) and he wasn't vocal otherwise but he tried to save his film (Abir Gulaal), a project he worked on for six months,"" he explained. ""After whatever happened, he did speak out.""
Fawad had remained relatively silent during the initial wave of protests and statements in support of Kashmir and Palestine, prompting criticism from fans who expected him to take a firmer public stand. However, Faysal urged people to consider the pressures artists face, especially when involved in international projects.
""Hania tweeted and Mahira has been vocal from day one,"" Quraishi added, noting that Mahira Khan's stance was appreciated by many. ""But still, it wasn't appropriate to attack Fawad and Hania.""
He further suggested that Fawad's silence might not have come from indifference, but from fear of damaging a career milestone. ""Fawad just tried to protect his film. Maybe he realised later that he was wrong,"" Faysal said. ""Nowadays, people get angry and lash out at artists which puts them in danger.""
Learning from the past
In a pointed reminder of how public outrage can escalate dangerously, Faysal recalled a past incident involving late singer Junaid Jamshed. ""The same thing once happened to Junaid Jamshed. People spread hate about him, and he was physically attacked,"" he reminded viewers. ""Is this what people want?""
Commenting on how fellow host Nadia Khan had been vocal about her stance, he added that he had cautioned her from the beginning. ""Nadia is a very good friend of mine, and I had personally warned her that it wasn't our concern and we shouldn't do this,"" he noted.
Throughout the interview, the actor maintained that while everyone has the right to speak, or not to, public dialogue should not come at the cost of safety or compassion. ""Let's not destroy our own people. Let's understand. Everyone has a reason, everyone has pressure,"" he said.
Set to hit cinemas this Eidul Azha, Deemak offers a chilling departure from the season's typical romantic releases. Directed by Rafay Rashdi and written by debut screenwriter Ayesha Muzaffar, the film blends psychological horror with haunting family drama. The trailer hints at a tense power struggle between Faysal's character, his new wife (Sonya Hussyn), and his domineering mother (Samina Peerzada), layered with elements of possession and dark magic.
Through this promotional event held in Lahore, fans got a sneak peek of the cast's onscreen personas, and the buzz has only grown louder since. While the lead trio commands attention, the supporting cast is no less impressive, featuring Bushra Ansari, Javed Sheikh, and Saman Ansari in intriguing roles shrouded in secrecy.
With Deemak competing against the star-studded rom-com Love Guru, audiences this Eid will have two wildly different cinematic experiences to choose from: fluff and frights, laughter and lore.

NA panel to probe CIE paper leaks,"US
Standing Committee on Education expresses lack of confidence in the Cambridge system
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Education has expressed lack of confidence in the Cambridge examination system and decided to investigate the alleged leak of papers during the recent CIE exams.
The committee — which met with MNA Azeem Zahid in the chair — expressed serious concerns over the declining credibility of CIE in Pakistan due to repeated incidents of paper leaks.
Muhammad Ali Sarfraz, an MNA from Faisalabad, shared purported video evidence provided by students that allegedly confirms the leak of papers from the May 2025 O and A Level exam series. While the malpractice may have benefitted only a small group of students, Cambridge's response — either cancelling exams or relying on average-based grading — could unfairly penalise a large number of students.
He urged Cambridge to consider re-administering the affected papers or adjusting the grade thresholds.
The committee also questioned the oversight mechanism for CIE in Pakistan. A representative from the Ministry of Federal Education clarified that the ministry does not regulate Cambridge assessments, placing responsibility with the Inter Board Committee of Chairmen (IBCC).
However, IBCC Executive Director Dr Ghulam Ali Malah said that he had not been formally assigned any such oversight responsibility. He revealed that authorisation had previously been granted — without IBCC consultation — to allow Cambridge exams to be conducted by private schools in addition to the British Council.
Dr Malah referred to a similar incident last year, when a paper was cancelled due to a leak, Cambridge failed to share the results of its internal investigation with IBCC. Instead, the committee learnt of the developments through legal notices.
In the end, the committee decided to set up a subcommittee to independently investigate the leaks. The subcommittee comprises Dr Aleem, Zaib Jaffar, Muhammad Ali Sarfraz, and Dr Ghulam Ali Malah. It has been tasked with reviewing the circumstances of the exam breaches and, if required, will seek to engage with Cambridge representatives based abroad due to the limited mandate of local officials, including Cambridge's Pakistan representative, Uzma Yousaf.
The investigation is scheduled to begin after June 16, following a request from Yousaf. During the meeting, she attempted to shift attention by criticising the performance of Pakistani education boards, suggesting that many students opt for Cambridge due to their shortcomings. However, committee members rebuffed her remarks, saying that not all Pakistani boards perform poorly and that her focus should remain on addressing the issues within the Cambridge system.
The committee reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring fairness and transparency in academic assessments and stressed the importance of protecting students from the consequences of administrative lapses.

Celebrities urge UK to end arms sales to Israel,"US
Dua Lipa, Benedict Cumberbatch sign open letter
Pop star Dua Lipa joined some 300 UK celebrities in signing an open letter Thursday urging Britain to halt arms sales to Israel, after similar pleas from lawyers and writers.
Actors, musicians, activists and other public figures wrote the letter calling on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to ""end the UK's complicity in the horrors in Gaza"".
British-Albanian pop sensation Dua Lipa has been vocal about the war in Gaza and last year criticised Israel's offensive as a ""genocide"".
Israel has repeatedly denied allegations of genocide and says its campaign intends to crush Hamas following the deadly October 2023 attack.
Other signatories include actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton and Riz Ahmed, and musicians Paloma Faith, Annie Lennox and Massive Attack.
""You can't call it 'intolerable' and keep sending arms,"" read the letter to Labour leader Starmer organised by Choose Love, a UK-based humanitarian aid and refugee advocacy charity.
Sports broadcaster Gary Lineker, who stepped down from his role at the BBC after a social media post that contained anti-Semitic imagery, also signed the letter.
Signatories urged the UK to ensure ""full humanitarian access across Gaza"", broker an ""immediate and permanent ceasefire"", and ""immediately suspend"" all arms sales to Israel.
""The children of Gaza cannot wait another minute. Prime Minister, what will you choose? Complicity in war crimes, or the courage to act?"", the letter continued.
Earlier this month, Starmer slammed Israel's ""egregious"" renewed military offensive in Gaza and promised to take ""further concrete actions"" if it did not stop – without detailing what the actions could be.
Last September the UK government suspended 30 out of 350 arms export licenses to Israel, saying there was a ""clear risk"" they could be used to breach humanitarian law.
Global outrage has grown after Israel ended a ceasefire in March and stepped up military operations this month, killing thousands of people in a span of two months according to figures by the health ministry in Gaza.
The humanitarian situation has also sparked alarm and fears of starvation after a two-month blockade on aid entering the devastated territory.
Over 800 UK lawyers including Supreme Court justices, and some 380 British and Irish writers warned of Israel committing a ""genocide"" in Gaza in open letters this week.
1,218 people were killed in the October 2023 attack, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Israel's military aggression in Gaza has killed 54,084, mostly civilians, in Gaza according to its health ministry, displaced nearly the entire population and ravaged swathes of the besieged strip. AFP

"After DeepSeek, China's JC10 moment","DE
.
Amidst the intricate tapestry of Chinese intellectual and academic circles, a distinct sense of pride permeates the nation's achievements. The recent, albeit perilous, Indo-Pak confrontation (May 7-10) serves as a catalyst for this sentiment. As the ongoing war of information and propaganda intensifies, Chinese intellectuals eagerly celebrate the groundbreaking milestones achieved through their technological advancements, particularly in the domains of AI-driven satellites, jet fighters and missiles, in collaboration with the Pakistan Air Force. They find amusement in the spotlight that has been bestowed upon their defence hardware, which emerged triumphant after four days of engagement.
Following the DeepSeek, Beijing and Shanghai have experienced a collective sense of triumph akin to the JC10-PL15 Moment for most academics. This moment is fueled by the successful demonstration of their technology, which has garnered widespread attention.
An excerpt from The National Interest elucidates the recriminations between the Indian and French governments over access to source codes for the Rafale jets. These events have engendered both anger in India and amusement in Beijing.
Chinese social media platforms have been abuzz with these developments, as they find amusement in the circumstances. After all, why should they not? Chinese weapons and warplanes exceeded expectations during the conflict. When news emerged of India's inability to access Dassault's source code, coinciding with India's capture of an intact Chinese PL-15 missile, one of Beijing's ""wolf warrior"", diplomats took to X to mock New Delhi: ""India invested $288 million per Rafale, yet they lack access to the source code. Furthermore, they assert their ability to 'extract the software' from the wreckage of a PL-15 missile. However, they are unable to access the fundamental functions of their own Rafale jets.""
While exuberance is understandable, it should not be construed as complacency. The Indo-Pak confrontation has only served as a catalyst for further pursuit of excellence through meticulous deliberation and strategic planning, both domestically and internationally.
Discussions at universities, think tanks and official quarters continue to be influenced by the recent four-day conflict between nuclear rivals, India and Pakistan. The episode appears to have energised Chinese academia to engage in forward planning and explore options for enhanced and more effective cooperation with partner countries, particularly Pakistan.
Why is this the case? Consistency is ensured by the Communist Party, which underpins China's entire political economy and the intellectual growth led by a dedicated leadership that ascends the political ladder through a rigorous accountability process. Only those with the utmost integrity and demonstrated commitment to the party and the people are successful in this process.
What unites these individuals is an unwavering faith in the well-being of citizens and the belief that investment in human resources is essential for progress.
Whether it is the iconic Great Wall in Beijing or Shanghai, Yiwu or Guangzhou, China's defence hi-tech capabilities, dozens of high-altitude glass bridges, or Shanghai's Global Finance Center, they all convey the same message: unwavering policy consistency, honesty and visionary leadership, coupled with absolute focus on the welfare and education of the people. These factors have transformed China and propelled it to a position where it is now asserting itself even against the United States. While President Trump's bullying tactics were met with resistance, China agreed to engage in diplomatic discussions but refused to yield.
The recent grand summit in Kuala Lumpur, which involved China, ASEAN and the GCC, provided a glimpse of Beijing's unwavering commitment to peaceful engagement and win-win cooperation rather than coercive diplomacy. While President Biden's Build Back Better World initiative has seemingly lost momentum, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) continues to thrive and attract an increasing number of countries.
Since Xi Jinping assumed the presidency in 2012, China has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in research and capacity building. Notably, the Chinese military has undergone a significant reduction in personnel, with nearly 300,000 personnel being eliminated. Additionally, the generals have been instructed to prioritise their professional duties and future challenges rather than engaging in commercial ventures. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) must maintain its focus on excellence and avoid any involvement in commercial activities. Both the PLA and the Communist Party have endured severe purges of high-ranking officials for corruption, inefficiency and betrayal of their responsibilities.
The driving force behind China's current success lies in an ecosystem anchored in solid planning, facilitated knowledge and skill development, and the pursuit of excellence. This system operates on merit and celebrates knowledge and skills.
Coincidentally, as I was concluding this article, a public service text message arrived on my mobile device, reminding us that May 30th is the 9th National Science and Technology Workers' Day and coincides with the 25th National Science and Technology Activity Week.
""We extend our utmost respect to all science and technology workers. Let us harness innovation as our guiding principle and hard work as our propulsion, collectively constructing the vision of a robust nation through science and technology,"" said the message from the ministry.
This inspiring message serves as a testament to the recognition of science and technology as the indispensable key to self-sufficiency and competitiveness, positioning China at a significant advantage over other nations.
It is unsurprising that China is experiencing a surge of technological achievements that few countries can boast of - something that instills a sense of confidence and fosters national pride.

Death toll in Nigeria flooding rises to 115,"US
.
Flash floods that ripped through parts of central Nigeria have killed at least 115 people, an emergency services official said on Friday, with the toll expected to rise further.
Teams of rescuers continued to search for missing residents after torrential rains late on Wednesday through early Thursday washed away and submerged dozens of homes in and around the town of Mokwa, located on the banks of Niger River, in Niger state.
""We have so far recovered 115 bodies and more are expected to be recovered because the flood came from far distance and washed people into the River Niger,"" Ibrahim Audu Husseini, a spokesman for the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, told AFP.
""Downstream, bodies are still being recovered. So, the toll keeps rising,"" he added.
He said many were still missing, citing a family of 12 where only four members have been accounted for.
""Some bodies were recovered from the debris of collapsed homes,"" he said, adding that his teams would need excavators to retrieve corpses from under the rubble.

SBP injects Rs1.15tr to stabilise markets,"US
Gold slips Rs700 per tola to Rs348,600; rupee gains 5 paisa to 282.02/$
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) conducted a major liquidity injection on Friday, deploying a total of Rs1.148 trillion into the banking system through a mix of conventional and Shariah-compliant open market operations (OMOs). Under the conventional reverse repo facility, SBP injected Rs970 billion, including Rs250 billion for a 6-day tenor at 11.10% and Rs720 billion (partially accepted) for a 14-day tenor at 11.08%.
Simultaneously, the Shariah-compliant Mudarabah OMO contributed Rs178 billion, split almost evenly between 6-day and 14-day tenors, both priced at 11.10%. This Rs1.15 trillion operation is among the largest single-day liquidity injections this year, signalling the SBP's proactive approach to maintaining stability in the interbank market amid tight liquidity conditions.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee posted a marginal gain against the US dollar in the interbank market, appreciating by 0.02% on Friday. By the end of the trading session, the local currency closed at 282.02, up by five paisas from Thursday's closing rate of 282.07. According to Ismail Iqbal Securities, the rupee has depreciated by 1.23% on a calendar year-to-date (CYTD) basis and by 1.30% on a fiscal year-to-date (FYTD) basis.
On the commodities front, gold prices in Pakistan declined on Friday, reflecting losses in the international market. The fall came as the US dollar gained strength and investors responded to recent tariff announcements. However, a softer US inflation report sustained hopes of a possible interest rate cut.
According to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), the price of gold dropped by Rs700 per tola, settling at Rs348,600, while the rate for 10 grams decreased by Rs599 to Rs298,868.
Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, said the market remains range-bound. ""Gold hit a high of $3,322 and is trading around $3,290, with strong support at $3,260,"" he noted, adding that, ""Unless the price breaks above $3,340$3,350, downward pressure is likely to continue.""

Stupidistan,"US
.
This piece seeks to expose a key contradiction between form and substance — between aspiration, machinations, desperation, incompetence, and incoherence — evident among our eastern neighbours, and is not polemical. Recent events have thrown these elements and contradictions into sharp relief, necessitating a deep dive into their mindset and increasingly radicalised diaspora.
We also see how a sense of entitlement has created cognitive dissonance, where the causal link between actions and consequences is denied or ignored, feeding into a sense of ambush and victimhood.
First, let me spell out a few caveats. I do not relish any nation's humiliation or misery, even if self-inflicted. My choice of title reflects my frustration with the pack of contradictions today's India has become, rather than being motivated by calumny. Two, you do not need to remind me of my nationality.
Today, we talk about India, yet I can be just as critical of my own homeland. Third, the proof of the pudding is in my theoretical framework. As an ardent follower of Karl Popper, I can say that what dismays me in India is elemental, not prejudicial.
Every culture can have utopian visions and theories about historical destiny. Those specific patterns worry me universally because they justify present suffering for supposed future benefits — often resulting in cruelty. Let's begin.
India today calls itself a civilisational state. This is pure gibberish outside Toynbee or Huntington's political spin on such terms. Look at the term's etymological journey: Civitas (Latin): city-state, citizenship; Civilitas (Latin): civility, refinement, courtesy; Civiliser (French): to civilise, to refine; Civilisation (French, 18th century): the process of becoming civilised. Huntington's assertion that religion may have something to do with it is just an opportunistic projection.
This Indian assertion was defined more succinctly by MS Golwalkar as ""race pride"". But here is the catch: race as a common denominator cannot exclude Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, local Muslims, or Christians. Here, Huntington provides a useful device by othering them culturally.
I have written a lot about Huntington. It is tragic to see the devastating power of suggestion — where, by picking the right moment and concealing prejudice in academic garb, a clever opportunist can cause far-reaching damage. One is surprised to see how many depressed identities accepted Huntington's caricature of them at face value, took it as a licence to misbehave, and ran with it.
On January 1, 2020, Netflix launched a series called Messiah. Much of the series is filmed in Israel, showing the Jewish state's affinity for the project. In one scene, the protagonist, a CIA official, finds a young barista reading Huntington's book and tells him, ""The only thing you need to remember is that he was right."" No beating about the bush.
In India's case, you must appreciate the sociology of this mindset: over a millennium of being ruled by foreigners in your own land. Then, today's lot learned to live in a world where hate and prejudice were the unquestioned operating system for two decades following 9/11.
So, Francis Fukuyama's isothymia (the desire to be recognised as equal to others) became megalothymia (a strong, often excessive, desire to be recognised as superior or better than others).
But even before 9/11, significant changes had begun. In 1989, Kashmir erupted, formalising the image of the enemy: Muslims supported by Pakistan, in turn supported by China. Then came the demolition of the Babri Mosque. A recent American Hindu convert was getting primed for an interesting twist at that time.
When Huntington gave his lecture and published his essay, David Frawley ran with it. He had converted to Hinduism in 1991 and called himself Pandit Vamadeva Shastri. Within a few short years, he was churning out books priming Indian and Hindu minds for the post-9/11 cruelty. Consider the titles: Arise Arjuna: Hinduism and the Modern World (1995), Awaken Bharata: A Call for India's Rebirth (1998), and my favourite, Hinduism and the Clash of Civilizations (2001, erm). He was awarded the Padma Bhushan in 2015 by the Modi government.
So when 9/11 happened, India was ready to be part of the Islamophobic grand architecture. While Pakistan and many others went through hell to prove they were not the West's enemy, India gained privileges — through blackmail on matters like the 2002 parliament attack, the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline, and the Mumbai attack — while Pakistan was framed as the evil one himself.
India grew rapidly. The Indian diaspora, already known for its competence, benefited from tailwinds. While the earlier waves of Indian immigrants had to integrate fully, the new wave had no such compulsion. They brought their third-world view with them, became Modi bhakts after the 2002 Gujarat pogrom, and worked very hard to help him become PM.
He could not have ruled a country as diverse as India without being a rockstar in their eyes. They wanted blood sports. He gave them that. Until now, of course — when that bubble has collapsed. Now, even if he resumes the war, he has no redemption. They will move on to the next strongman — or a brief secular interregnum.
The recent war is quite similar to Kargil. When a Pakistani premier, whose approval had skyrocketed due to nuclear tests, announced that the country was withdrawing from Kargil, his popularity fell immediately, and his government within three months. India's toxic mix is far more potent. If Modi survives this, he will truly be a miracle worker.
Even so, India's friends-and-family network remains strong. Justin Trudeau, who offended India, is gone. So is Joe Biden and his running mate. From the shadows, this lot manufactures crises and consent. At the peak of the Trump tariff wars, the US president had to step back when treasuries faced turbulence.
Before suspending tariffs on most countries, his first act was to hand over Tahawwur Rana to India and increase tariffs on China — which pleased New Delhi. After the recent South Asian war, his announcement of a ceasefire did not go down well with the lot. The bond market is again facing shocks, and a mini-coup has erupted within the billionaire flank of Trumpworld. Elon Musk had quit, citing disagreements regarding One Big Beautiful Bill. His earlier defence of H1B visa beneficiaries — particularly Indians — was already a dead giveaway.
This speaks to the power this lot has. When he moved to downsize the CIA, a concern was voiced that he was channelling forces with scores to settle with the Five Eyes intelligence community. If you find pieces in publications like The Atlantic arguing that Trump's proposed Golden Dome missile shield — meant solely for North America — should also cover Quad countries (a notion kept alive by Indian enthusiasm), know that this lot is at work.
Mind you, this gratuitous use of power for such small wins — and this take-no-prisoners approach — does not go unnoticed. But sadly, it is the weak and vulnerable among the diaspora who pay the price of this extravagance.

Won't allow India to cross IWT red line: PM,"US
Shehbaz alarmed by weaponisation of water
Rejecting the weaponisation of water, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the red line by holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance and endangering millions of lives for narrow political gains.
""India's unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin's water, is deeply regrettable. Millions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed,"" the prime minister said, addressing the three-day High-Level International Conference on Glaciers' Preservation.
The conference is being attended by over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international organizations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.
The prime minister, in his comprehensive address, touched all the relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan's climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water and call to protect nature and humanity's shared destiny.
""The world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new lowthe weaponisation of water,"" he told the international conference being hosted by the Government of Tajikistan in collaboration with the United Nations, UNESCO, WMO, the Asian Development Bank, and other key partners as a historic moment for climate ambition, glacier preservation, and international cooperation.
The 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, through a resolution, had declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers' Preservation, 21st of March as World Day for Glaciers starting in 2025, and that the Government of Tajikistan will host the International Conference on the subject in 2025. The prime minister said that Pakistan, being home to over 13,000 glaciers, was the most concerning as glaciers contributed nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus River system – the lifeline of our civilisation, culture and economy.

Hazlewood in great touch for WTC final,"US
Aussie fast bowler's 3-21 takes Royal Challengers in IPL final
Australia's Josh Hazlewood said it was perfect preparation for the World Test Championship final after delivering a match-winning performance on his return to the IPL.
The fast bowler finished with figures of 3-21 as Royal Challengers Bengaluru sealed their place in the IPL decider with an eight-wicket thrashing of Punjab Kings on Thursday.
The 34-year-old only recently rejoined Bengaluru after returning home due to a shoulder injury and following the stoppage in the league caused by the conflict between India and Pakistan.
He struck two key blows at Mullanpur including skipper Shreyas Iyer for two as Bengaluru bundled out Punjab for 101.
With the WTC final at Lord's between Australia and South Africa starting on June 11, it was a perfect reminder of his prowess.
""I've got to be bowling. You know, wherever I am in the world I've got to be bowling, getting ready for that game anyway,"" Hazlewood said.
""There's no better place than I think out in the middle. Obviously you've got to bowl more hours of training from time to time to build up for a Test, but to get that intensity right up, there's no better place than the IPL.""
He added: ""I don't bowl too much differently in Test match cricket than tonight, so it's still that hard length, so I feel in a good place.""
Some foreign stars including Australia's Mitchell Starc did not return.
But Hazlewood decided to be with Virat Kohli's Bengaluru and after his spell of 3.1 overs at a bowling-friendly pitch feels ready for a critical fortnight.
""Worked really hard the last few weeks on the shoulders to get back and got some good overs into it the last sort of 10 days,"" said Hazlewood.
""And yeah it is feeling good to be back.""
Bengaluru, who are chasing their first IPL title, await their opponent in the final on June 3 at the world's biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad.
""I think we've just got all bases covered,"" said Hazlewood.
""I think any one of the five or six bowlers can bowl at any moment of the game, whether it's the start, middle or end.""

Egypt denies court ruling threatens historic monastery,"US
.
Egypt and Greece sought to ease tensions over the historic St Catherine's monastery in the Sinai peninsula on Friday after a controversial court ruling said it sat on state-owned land.
Cairo has denied that the ruling threatens the UNESCO World Heritage landmark after Greek and church authorities warned of the sacred site's status.
St Catherine's monastery was established in the sixth century at the biblical site of the burning bush in the southern mountains of the Sinai peninsula and is the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery.
A court in Sinai ruled on Wednesday in a land dispute between the monastery and the South Sinai governorate that the monastery ""is entitled to use"" the land, which ""the state owns as public property"".
But on Friday, in a phone call with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said Cairo was ""fully committed to preserving the unique and sacred religious status of Saint Catherine's monastery, and ensuring it is not violated"".

"Same ban, new promise","US
.
The Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), in collaboration with the Islamabad Capital Territory administration, banned the manufacture, import, distribution, sale and use of single-use plastics in 2019, and once again in 2023. Despite the longevity of these bans, the federal capital has repeatedly failed to enforce them, with a survey revealing that more than 60% of household garbage in Islamabad comprises polythene bags while 30% comprises plastic bottles.
The enactment of eco-friendly regulations consistently followed by governmental inaction is a theme that the city is much too familiar with. Similar to the lack of implementation seen after Solid Waste Management Regulations 2023, the federal government has lagged behind in spreading awareness and enforcing the plastic ban. The aforementioned survey also revealed that 44% of people were unaware of the 2023 regulations banning single-use plastic.
This neglect is once again being tackled as the climate ministry has claimed to intensify its crackdown on the use of plastics which includes recently levied fines on several violators. A spokesperson for Pak-EPA says that large amounts of banned products have been confiscated through targeted inspections. While these inspections are an essential step for climate-friendly practices, they risk becoming futile within a broader picture if not regularly conducted.
If such practices are carried out periodically, the only goal they accomplish is to punish a handful of people engaged in behaviour that is prevalent across the city. For a sustainable and pragmatic approach, the government must execute efforts to fine violators, seize banned products and issue warnings in a consistent manner.
Additionally, it should ensure that alternatives to plastic, such as paper or cloth bags, are accessible and affordable. These actions will ultimately encourage citizens to stand with the regulations rather than feeling ambushed by erratic crackdowns.

I think Fernandes wants to stay: Amorim,"US
The Man United captain is speculated to make a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia
Ruben Amorim said Friday he believes captain Bruno Fernandes wants to stay at Manchester United amid speculation about a lucrative move to Saudi Arabia.
Fernandes started United's match against Hong Kong as they came from behind to win 3-1, with teenage substitute Chido Obi scoring twice.
Manager Amorim, who took over from Erik ten Hag during the season but led United to a dismal 15th-placed finish in the Premier League, has plenty to ponder during the post-season break.
Foremost among his concerns is the future of key man Fernandes, who is reportedly weighing up a big-money move to Al Hilal.
Asked after the victory if that was the 30-year-old Fernandes's last appearance in a United shirt, Amorim replied: ""I don't think so, I don't know for sure, but I don't think so.
""He sees us taking some actions and to change all the things ... I think he wants to stay.""
Amorim added of his fellow Portuguese: ""I talk with him, I explained some things and I just have that feeling when you talk to someone, I think you have that feeling if he wants to stay.""
Beaten and booed off in Malaysia on Wednesday, United were underwhelming in the first half of their second post-season friendly as they brought the curtain down on a poor campaign.
Having fallen behind to a soft Hong Kong goal, Obi struck with a smart turn and finish five minutes after the break and again with a glancing header on 82 minutes.
Ayden Heaven scored with a late header as United ended their Asia trip on a winning note. Portugal international Fernandes had a bright first half at the 40,000-capacity Hong Kong Stadium, which was about 85 percent full, before going off.

Norris fastest in first Spanish GP practice,"US
Max Verstappen ended the session as his closest rival
McLaren's Lando Norris followed up his victory in Monaco by lapping fastest in first practice for the Spanish Grand Prix on Friday, with Red Bull's Max Verstappen ending the session as his closest rival.
The Briton, winner last Sunday to close to only three points behind championship-leading teammate Oscar Piastri after eight of 24 rounds, set a best time of one minute and 13.718 seconds at the Circuit de Catalunya.
Verstappen was 0.367 slower but missed some 20 minutes of the session with mechanics working to change the car's rear suspension.
Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton -- winner a record-equalling six times in Spain -- was third on the timesheets, 0.378 off the pace and ahead of teammate Charles Leclerc (+0.520) with Piastri fifth (+0.576).
The session was the first in which teams used new front wings to meet stricter flex tests introduced for the Spanish weekend, but there was no immediate sign of any significant change.
Liam Lawson was sixth fastest for Racing Bulls with Oliver Bearman seventh for Haas, Isack Hadjar eighth for Racing Bull and Verstappen's teammate Yuki Tsunoda ninth. Alpine's Pierre Gasly completed the top 10.
Mercedes, McLaren's closest rivals in the constructors' standings, had George Russell 11th and Kimi Antonelli 18th.
The session featured two young drivers gaining experience, with Frenchman Victor Martins replacing Alex Albon at Williams and Japanese Ryo Hirakawa for Esteban Ocon at Haas.
Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, who was 13th in his Aston Martin, launched an impassioned defence, meanwhile, of the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya which appears set to be ditched after 33 years of hosting the Spanish Grand Prix.
A new street circuit in Madrid is expected to be confirmed soon as host of the 2026 edition.
""I don't think that we will lose Barcelona, that's my opinion and my wish as well,"" said Alonso who is an ambassador for Barcelona F1.
""I think it's good to have new venues and countries, but we need to keep some traditional circuits where the history of F1 has been written.""
Russell says Albon has more to pay after lobster dinner
George Russell says Alex Albon still owes him because the tab for a lobster pasta dinner picked up by his friend and Formula One rival after the Monaco Grand Prix was not enough to make amends for the race.
Mercedes driver Russell finished 11th last Sunday with Albon ninth and Williams teammate Carlos Sainz 10th, the pair using strategy to defend their scoring positions on an afternoon without overtaking.
Russell, who had scored points in every round up to Monaco, said afterwards that Albon would be paying for dinner and the Thai obliged.
""He ordered the most expensive thing on the menu,"" Albon told reporters hungry for more detail at the Spanish Grand Prix. ""He did, actually. It was the lobster pasta.
""Lobster pasta, in Monaco... Monaco is not cheap. On race weekends, they bump up the prices everywhere.""
Albon said he chose a carbonara, admittedly with wagyu beef, and Russell skipped dessert.
Asked whether it had been an expensive restaurant, Russell suggested Albon escaped lightly. ""Not expensive enough. So, the bill is definitely not even just yet,"" he said.

Stocks surge on budget relief prospects,"US
KSE-100 rallies 720 points, driven by blue-chip buying in oil, banking and fertiliser sectors
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed the week on a bullish note on Friday, lifted by strong gains in blue-chip oil, banking and fertiliser stocks amid growing optimism about the upcoming federal budget measures. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged over 700 points.
Analysts attributed the rally to investor hopes for pro-growth budgetary announcements, including some relief for oil refineries, real estate and agriculture sectors, along with a proposed 1.5% levy on imports aimed at supporting local industries and stabilising the rupee.
Despite the upbeat close, the benchmark index remained shy of the 120,000 milestone, posting a 0.5% weekly gain.
""Stocks closed bullish, led by blue-chip shares of oil, banking and fertiliser sectors amid hopes for positive federal budget announcements,"" said Arif Habib Corp Managing Director Ahsan Mehanti.
""Budgetary relief for oil refineries, real estate and agri-sector, a proposed 1.5% tax on imports to support industries and rupee stability played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX,"" he added.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a rise of 719.69 points, or 0.60%, settling at 119,691.09.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote that the PSX closed the week with a 0.5% gain, although the index remained below the 120,000 mark.
On Friday, 58 stocks advanced while 41 declined. Key contributors to the gains included Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC, +2.24%), Meezan Bank (+4.4%) and Hubco (+1.6%) while TPL REIT Fund 1 (-7.63%), Pakistan Petroleum (-1.03%) and Pakistan Oilfields (-1.31%) were the major drags.
Among macro developments, Azerbaijan announced a $2 billion investment package for Pakistan during a trilateral summit with Turkey. Meanwhile, the State Bank purchased $5.9 billion from the currency market since June 2024 to strengthen its foreign exchange reserves.
On the fiscal front, the FBR is proposing higher withholding tax rates for vehicles with engine capacities above 1,300cc in the upcoming budget. In the corporate sector, Pharaon Investment Group's potential divestment of ACPL is drawing interest from competitors including Cherat Cement and Bestway Group, AHL added.
Topline Securities, in its daily review, wrote that continuing its previous day's momentum, the KSE-100 index largely traded in the positive zone and closed at 119,691, up 0.60%.
The top positive contribution to the index came from FFC, Meezan Bank, Hubco, Pakgen Power, Engro Holdings and MCB Bank as they cumulatively contributed 668 points.
Traded value-wise, Attock Refinery (Rs1.66 billion), DG Khan Cement (Rs878 million), Hubco (Rs807 million), FFC (Rs708 million), Meezan Bank (Rs661 million) and Mari Petroleum (Rs607 million) dominated the trading activity, Topline said.
Muhammad Hasan Ather of JS Global said the KSE-100 index extended its bullish momentum, climbing 720 points to close at 119,691. The rally was driven by strong investor sentiment amid declining inflation, current account surplus and Fitch's upgrade of Pakistan's credit rating to ""B-"".
Robust activity in banking, energy and cement sectors further buoyed the sentiment. With over 1,358 points added in two sessions, the momentum suggests a continued upside, contingent on sustained macroeconomic stability and clarity on political and external financing developments, he said.
Overall trading volumes stood at 580.3 million shares, significantly lower than the previous session's 741.7 million. The total traded value was Rs22.7 billion, down from Rs23.9 billion in the previous session.
A total of 474 companies were traded, out of which 259 stocks closed higher, 161 declined and 54 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom led the volumes chart with 79.7 million shares, losing Rs0.06 to close at Rs1.37. K-Electric followed with 47.7 million shares, losing Rs0.20 to settle at Rs5.32. Cnergyico PK saw trading in 35.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.07 to close at Rs7.86. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs612.5 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

KCCI urges PM to release Rs23b power subsidy,"US
Bilwani says procedural delays in disbursement due to KE hurts Karachi alone, calls for direct payment
President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Jawed Bilwani, has urged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ensure the release of the long-overdue Rs23 billion relief in electricity bills on incremental consumption. In a statement released on Friday, he called for the inclusion of this relief in the upcoming federal budget for FY2025-26, lamenting that although it was allocated in earlier budgets, it has yet to be disbursed — affecting only Karachi's industrial sector, while the rest of the country has received the benefit.
As per the statement, Bilwani wrote a letter to the prime minister, acknowledging the government's steps to support the business community but expressed deep concern over the continued delay in providing the subsidy for the period from July 1, 2021, to October 21, 2023. He noted that Karachi's industries remain under immense financial pressure due to administrative and legal complications.
He stated that the total subsidy for the period stands at Rs33 billion, of which Rs23 billion is undisputed and should have already been disbursed. Funds were earmarked in previous budgets — Rs22 billion in FY2021-22, Rs13 billion in FY2022-23, and Rs7 billion in FY2023-24 — but the subsidy has not reached recipients due to procedural delays involving K-Electric.
""K-Electric (KE) operated without a stay order for nearly nine months yet failed to pass on the subsidy to consumers,"" said Bilwani, adding that NEPRA did not enforce compliance, and legal obstacles have dragged the issue. He pointed out that KE's appeals were dismissed by a tribunal in July 2024, but the matter remains stalled due to a stay order from the Islamabad High Court.
KCCI has urged immediate verification of the figures by the Power Division and NEPRA, stressing that the verified subsidy should be reflected in the upcoming budget. Crucially, KCCI proposed that the undisputed Rs23 billion be paid directly to industrial consumers instead of routing it through KE to avoid further delays.
""This is not just a legal obligation; it is a matter of economic justice and national interest,"" Bilwani said.

ECP submits reply in reserved seats case,"US
Says PTI was never a party to the case before apex court
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has submitted its written statement to the constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court hearing review petitions in the reserved seats case, stating that the PTI was never a party to the case before the SC.
On January 13, 2024, a three-member SC bench upheld the ECP's December 22, 2023 order declaring the PTI's intra-party polls null and void.
As a consequence of the SC verdict and its ""misinterpretation"" by the ECP, the PTI candidates had to contest the February 8, 2024 general elections as independents.
Eighty such independent candidates reached the National Assembly and later joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) in an apparent bid to claim reserved seats for women and minorities.
The ECP, however, refused to allocate the seats to the party, a decision that the SIC challenged in the Supreme Court.
On July 12, 2024, a full bench of the apex court through a majority of 8 to 5 resurrected the PTI as a parliamentary party, noting that 39 of the lawmakers who had submitted certificates of their affiliation with the PTI along with their nomination papers were already PTI lawmakers.
The SC ruled that the remaining 41 lawmakers who had not submitted the affiliation certificates at the time of nomination papers' submission could do that now within a period of 15 days.
The government later filed review petitions against the ruling and now a CB is hearing the case.
In its reply, the ECP said the majority of judges who endorsed the July 12 order did not take note of the clarifications issued on September 14 and October 18.
""Before these clarifications, the case was never presented before the full 13-member bench.
The majority decision violated Article 10-A and Article 4 of the Constitution.""
The ECP stated that the majority judgment incorrectly mentioned that the PTI was present before the court. It contended that PTI never requested the reserved seats, nor did it seek them on any forum.
It said through the July 12 decision, the SIC was substituted in place of PTI. It said the list for reserved seats is submitted before polling in accordance with the election schedule. However, the PTI was ordered to submit the list for reserved seats after the elections, which is contrary to the law.
Additionally, it said, 39 members were declared as PTI members contrary to the legal procedure. Relief under Article 187 was granted beyond the scope of the court's jurisdiction and the ECP was not heard when Section 94 of the Election Act was invalidated.
Meanwhile, the PPP has also submitted additional statements to the Supreme Court, claiming that the court's July 12 decision went beyond the petition and the relief sought.
The real issue was simply whether the SIC was entitled to reserved seats. The matter of awarding reserved seats to PTI was never under consideration.
This same question - whether SIC was entitled to reserved seats - was posed before the ECP, the Peshawar High Court, and the SC, it said.
The party contended that the SC issued a decision on reserved seats that was unrelated to the actual petitions before it. The court exceeded its jurisdiction and granted relief that had never been requested.
The PTI and the SIC are two distinct political parties, it added.

SadaPay's Turkish owner faces money laundering probe,"IN
Fintech Papara CEO taken into custody along with 12 others
Papara — a Turkish financial technology company that acquired Pakistan's leading fintech SadaPay in May 2024 — is currently under investigation by Turkish authorities for alleged involvement in money laundering, illegal betting, and other financial crimes.
The company's founder and CEO, Ahmed Faruk Karsl?, has been detained along with 12 others as part of a sweeping law enforcement operation.
According to a report by Turkiyetoday.com, the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office confirmed that Karsl? was taken into custody during coordinated early morning raids across Istanbul. Authorities have seized a wide range of assets linked to the suspected criminal network, including eight businesses under PPR Holding Inc., multiple properties, luxury vehicles, yachts, and cryptocurrency wallets.
The investigation, supported by data from the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT), the Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK), and other regulatory bodies, revealed that Papara's platform was allegedly used to facilitate illegal financial transactions.
Investigators found that 102 of the 26,012 user accounts created through Papara's technology were directly involved in high-volume illegal betting and fund transfers. These transactions were routed through 274 different bank accounts and eventually funneled into 16 cryptocurrency wallets as part of an elaborate money laundering scheme.
Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya stated that 13 individuals have been detained and that assets of the companies and suspects involved have been frozen. The financial crimes unit estimates that the illicit transactions amounted to over 12.9 billion Turkish lira (approximately $330 million).
Papara, which reportedly has over 21 million users and a valuation exceeding $2 billion, acquired Pakistan-based SadaPaya licensed Electronic Money Institution (EMI) regulated by the State Bank of Pakistan — exactly one year ago. However, Pakistani authorities have not yet reported any links between the Turkish investigation and SadaPay's operations in Pakistan.
Industry experts believe that the developments in Turkey necessitate a careful review by Pakistani regulators. A fintech analyst Muhammad Yasir urged the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to closely monitor local fintech operators associated with foreign sponsors.
""This case highlights the need for enhanced regulatory oversight and continuous due diligence,"" noted Yasir, adding, ""While the allegations pertain to activities in Turkey, the reputational impact on SadaPay is inevitable. SBP must re-evaluate its existing EMI regulations and adopt a proactive approach to managing cross-border financial risks.""
He added that as financial technologies evolved and cyber-financial crimes grew increasingly sophisticated, Pakistan's regulatory framework must be regularly updated to safeguard consumer interests and the integrity of the national financial system.

Israel threatens Hamas with 'annihilation',"US
Trump says Gaza ceasefire close
Israel on Friday said Hamas must accept a hostage deal in Gaza or ""be annihilated"", as US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire agreement was ""very close"".
It came amid dire conditions on the ground, with the United Nations warning that Gaza's entire population was at risk of famine.
Defence Minister Israel Katz said Hamas must agree to a ceasefire proposal presented by US envoy Steve Witkoff or be destroyed, after the Palestinian group said the deal failed to satisfy its demands.
""The Hamas murderers will now be forced to choose: accept the terms of the 'Witkoff Deal' for the release of the hostages -— or be annihilated.""
Israel has repeatedly said that destruction of the militant group was a key aim of the war.
Negotiations to end nearly 20 months of war in Gaza have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough, with Israel resuming operations in March following a short-lived truce. In the United States, Trump told reporters ""they're very close to an agreement on Gaza"", adding: ""We'll let you know about it during the day or maybe tomorrow.""
All the while, food shortages in Gaza persisted, with aid only trickling in after the partial lifting by Israel of a more than two-month blockade.
Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency, on Friday called Gaza ""the hungriest place on earth"".
""It's the only defined area -- a country or defined territory within a country -- where you have the entire population at risk of famine,"" he said.
Later, the UN condemned the ""looting of large quantities of medical equipment"" and other supplies ""intended for malnourished children"" from one of its Gaza warehouses by armed individuals. Aid groups have previously warned that desperation for food and medicine among Gazans was causing security to deteriorate.
Israel has meanwhile doubled down on its settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank, while defying calls from French President Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders for a two-state solution. This week it announced the creation of 22 new settlements in the West Bank.
London called the move a ""deliberate obstacle"" to Palestinian statehood, and UN chief Antonio Guterres' spokesman said it pushed efforts towards a two-state solution ""in the wrong direction"".
On Friday, Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to build a ""Jewish Israeli state"" in the Palestinian territory which Israel has occupied since 1967.
Israeli settlements in the West Bank -- considered illegal under international law -- are seen as a major obstacle to a lasting peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Katz framed the move as a direct rebuke to Macron and others pushing for recognition of a Palestinian state.
Macron on Friday said that recognition of a Palestinian state, with some conditions, was ""not only a moral duty, but a political necessity"".
Israel's foreign ministry accused the French president of undertaking a ""crusade against the Jewish state"".
Separately, a diplomatic source told AFP that Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan would make the first visit of its kind to the West Bank on Sunday.
The White House announced on Thursday that Israel had ""signed off"" on a new ceasefire proposal submitted to Hamas.
The Palestinian militant group said the deal failed to satisfy its demands, but stopped short of rejecting it outright.
In a statement on Friday, it said it was ""holding consultations"" on the proposal.
Gaza's civil defence agency told AFP that at least 45 people had been killed in Israeli attacks on Friday, including seven in a strike targeting a family home in Jabalia in the north.
Palestinians sobbed over the bodies of their loved ones at Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital following the strike, AFPTV footage showed.
""These were civilians and were sleeping at their homes,"" said neighbour Mahmud al-Ghaf, describing ""children in pieces"".
""Stop the war!"" said Mahmud Nasr, who lost relatives. ""We do not want anything from you, just stop the war."" The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Jabalia strike, but said separately that the air force had hit ""dozens of targets"" across Gaza over the past day.

"Pindi bans bird, drone activities near airports","US
Also prohibits disposal of garbage, offal of sacrificial animals around airport premises
The Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner on Thursday imposed a ban within a five-kilometer radius of Islamabad International Airport and both military airbases — Nur Khan (Chaklala) Airbase and Qasim Airbase -— due to the potential risk of bird strikes with aircraft.
The restrictions include pigeon flying, keeping pigeons in large cages, kite flying, and the operation of all types of drones. Additionally, the disposal of garbage and animal remains (especially from sacrificial animals) in and around airport premises and aircraft landing/takeoff zones has also been prohibited.
Violations of these orders will result in legal action and arrests.
The decision was made during a meeting chaired by Additional Deputy Commissioner General Ehsan Tariq who ordered immediate enforcement of the ban. All relevant authorities were instructed to initiate inspection and monitoring operations to ensure strict compliance.
The meeting also reviewed cleanliness measures around the airports during Eidul Azha, specifically in areas such as Khurram Colony, Sadiqabad, Koral Chowk, Dhok Hafiz, and Chah Sultan. Concerned departments were issued directives to maintain hygiene and proper waste management in these areas.

National Assembly Standing Committee on Home Chairperson Faryal Talpur chaired a high-level meeting of the committee and discussed serious issues including sale of drugs online, drug use in educational institutions, crackdown on terrorists, and prevention of opium cultivation in Sindh.
The panel also took up the issue of the sale of chemically manufactured milk.
Faryal also inquired about police performance in the fight against drugs. She issued directives to ensure a comprehensive and organised province-wide crackdown on drug mafias and demanded data on conviction rates in drug-related cases. She stressed for exemplary punishments for drug mafias.
On the occasion, Sindh Home Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar mentioned that drug mafias will not be spared, and it is imperative to take effective measures to eliminate them.
Additional IGP Karachi Javed Alam Odho informed the meeting that in the past three months, 28 cases were registered across the province against drug mafias, leading to the arrest of 33 suspects. During the same period, 83 FIRs were registered against supplying drugs in schools, resulting in 81 arrests.
Joining the meeting via video link, IGP Sindh Ghulam Nabi Memon stated that a coordinated action against drug mafias is his main objective. Senior supervisory officers from districts, zones, and police ranges are regularly instructed through meetings. He emphasised that the eradication of crime in any form is the top priority of the police.
Faryal Talpur instructed that all SSPs be mandated to submit review reports regarding actions against drug mafias. She also directed steps to digitise food delivery services at the provincial level.
She also sought a report on how drugs reach educational institutions. She ordered the DIG CIA to devise a strategy in coordination with the administrators of educational institutions to ensure complete prevention of drugs.

"Travel advisory issued for Babusar Top, Gati Das","US
Officials say weather conditions continue to deteriorate due to recent snowfall
Given growing safety concerns and to ensure the smooth movement of traffic during evening hours, local authorities have issued an advisory for the public, particularly motorists and tourists planning to travel through the scenic yet hazardous routes of Babusar Top and Gati Das.
According to official sources, this precautionary measure has been implemented to minimise the risk of accidents and to ensure the well-being of travellers as weather conditions in the region continue to deteriorate due to recent snowfall. Authorities have reported that several spots along Babusar Top and Gati Das have witnessed significant snow accumulation in recent days, rendering the roads extremely slippery and dangerous for travel, especially during the late hours.
Motorists have been strongly urged to exercise maximum caution while driving in the affected areas. Officials have emphasised the need for vehicles to be in optimal condition before beginning any journey along these routes. Drivers are specifically advised to avoid speeding and reckless driving, which could lead to fatal accidents, given the current road conditions.
Furthermore, tourists planning to visit the region have been advised to stay updated on weather forecasts and road conditions before setting out. The authorities have stressed the importance of preparedness and have appealed to travellers to remain vigilant and cooperative.
In the event of any emergency, citizens are encouraged to contact the Mansehra police or the district administration for immediate assistance. Officials have assured that necessary steps are being taken to monitor the situation closely. The public is requested to follow all advisories and cooperate with law enforcement and emergency services during this period of heightened risk.

"Babar, Rizwan should only play Tests: Kamran Akmal","IE
'After another six months, they should be sidelined from ODIs too'
Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has backed the decision to drop star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan from the national T20I setup, suggesting the duo is better suited to the longer formats of the game.
Speaking on a recent podcast, Akmal addressed reports that Babar and Rizwan are being permanently sidelined from T20 internationals.
""That's absolutely the right decision,"" Akmal said.
""I believe this should happen because these players are more suited for the longer format of the game. In my opinion, they should now be kept on only for Test matches. Maybe after another six months, they should only be considered for Test cricket, both Babar and Rizwan,"" he added.
The former wicketkeeper batter went a step further, expressing doubts about the duo's continued role in One Day Internationals as well.
""After another six months, they should be sidelined from ODIs, too, because Pakistan hardly plays Test matches these days. No one is even talking about Test cricket. But if any real players are made, they are made through playing Test cricket,"" he remarked.
The 43-year-old the foundational value of red-ball cricket, asserting that proficiency in Tests enhances performance across all formats.
""You can't just play T20 and expect to be great at Test cricket too. If someone plays Test matches, they can handle ODIs and T20s as well,"" he said.
For the unversed, Babar Azamwho captained Pakistan in three consecutive ICC Men's T20 World Cups (2021, 2022, and 2024)last featured in a T20I in December 2023.
Since then, he has been out of favor, missing the home series against New Zealand in March and the ongoing three-match T20I series against Bangladesh, which kicked off on May 28 in Lahore.
Babar, who has been under scrutiny for a lean run in T20Is, hasn't scored a half-century since his 75-run knock against Ireland in May 2023.
He has played 128 T20Is for Pakistan, scoring 4,223 runs at an average of 39.83, including three centuries and 36 fifties.
Earlier this year, both Babar and Rizwan were omitted from the five-match T20I series in New Zealand as selectors opted to test younger players. The pair has not returned to the T20I squad since.
In another significant development, Mohammad Rizwan was recently removed from the T20I captaincy after leading in just two series. Salman Ali Agha has been appointed as the new skipper.
Babar's father responds to Kamran's remarks
Father of star Pakistan batter Babar Azam, Azam Siddique, has issued a fiery response following Kamran Akmal's controversial comments suggesting that Babar and Mohammad Rizwan should be limited to playing only Test cricket in the future. In his Instagram post, Siddique shared an old photo featuring himself, Babar Azam, and Kamran Akmal, with a caption indirectly addressing Akmal's remarks.
He reminded the former wicketkeeper, ""This child (Babar) never played under your captaincy, but you did play under his captaincy and got out for zero while he scored a century that day. Talking behind the backs of successful people is a compulsion of those who have failed.""

Pre-monsoon drain desilting drive launched,"US
Project aims to be completed by June 30, ahead of the flood season starting in July
As part of pre-monsoon preparations, the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) has launched a major desilting operation of the 22-kilometer-long Nullah Leh and 13 major stormwater drains across Rawalpindi.
Of total estimated cost of the project is Rs140 million, Rs80m will be spent on the complete desilting and realignment of Nullah Leh, while Rs60m is allocated for the storm drains.
The Punjab government has approved the budget for this project. The desilting of Nullah Leh and the storm drains is scheduled for completion by June 30. The flood season for Nullah Leh is expected to run from July to September 15.
Following Eidul Azha, a full-scale flood rescue drill will be conducted in low-lying areas like Javed Colony and Nadeem Colony. This exercise will include teams from the 111 Brigade, Rescue 1122, Civil Defence, and local police to simulate the evacuation of residents in case of flooding. The 111 Brigade will also be placed on red alert once the flood season begins.
From June 15, a centralised Flood Control Room will be activated under the supervision of the Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner. This control room, located at the Civil Defence Headquarters, will have representatives from all 12 relevant departments.
The Cantonment Boards of Rawalpindi and Chaklala will be responsible for cleaning the 11-kilometer stretch of Nullah Leh and associated storm drains that fall within their jurisdiction.
A special survey by the Civil Defence Department has identified 20 high-risk locations along Nullah Leh and the storm drains. These include Javed Colony, Nadeem Colony, Arya Mohalla, Chah Sultan, New Katarian, Amar Pura Drain, Dhok Dalal Lai Bridge, Dhok Najoo, Mohalla Raja Sultan Drain, Hazara Colony, Ratta Amral, Mohanpura, Gawalmandi, Dhok Chiragh Din, Tench Bhatta Chowk, Dhok Khabba, Arya Mohalla (again), and Sadiqabad.
The department has recommended enhanced monitoring and deeper desiltingby an additional two to three feetat these vulnerable points.
According to the WASA spokesperson and Director of Administration, Umar Farooq, the cleanup is being treated as a top priority. Both heavy and light machinery is being used, and this year, even hard-to-reach areas in narrow, congested streets will be cleared.
The desilting will improve water flow in both Nullah Leh and the storm drains. Moreover, the operation will continue beyond the initial cleanup until the end of the flood season.

A tool of suppression,"US
.
Laws are meant to be scrutinised - especially when they begin to encroach upon the very freedoms they are supposed to protect. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan's latest report on the PECA Act 2025 offers a much-needed critical lens on a law that has become a potent tool of suppression rather than protection.
PECA, in its current form and through its iterations since 2016, has consistently empowered the state at the expense of individual liberties. Its criminalisation of vague categories such as ""fake and false information"" — punishable by up to three-year imprisonment — opens the door to arbitrary interpretation and misuse.
Instead of combating genuine cybercrime, the law has increasingly been wielded to stifle dissent and as a muzzling tactic. This is not an isolated case. PECA is part of a growing pattern of repressive legal frameworks that aim to curtail civic spaces in Pakistan. Additionally, PECA introduces a regulatory authority, complaints council and tribunal — all operating under considerable executive influence. While oversight is necessary in any legal process, the concentration of power in a few hands raises concerns about fairness and impartiality. Such laws tend to erode the foundations of democracy by criminalising criticism and silencing voices.
The HRCP's call for the law's repeal is both timely and necessary. It is a reminder that no law should be above public scrutiny — especially one that so deeply affects the fundamental rights of citizens. Rather than discarding the law altogether, a more balanced approach could involve revisiting and refining PECA. Clearer definitions and better oversight mechanisms would go a long way in aligning the law with its original intent. Constructive reform, grounded in consultation with civil society, may be the best way forward.

Aima Baig is tempted to launch jewellery line,"DE
Singer admits love for layered-up accessories
In an Instagram Story shared recently, Aima Baig flaunted layers of jewellery that adorned her neck, ears, wrists, and fingers. In the video, the singer adjusted her multiple necklaces while tucking her hair behind her ear to reveal a crescent-style earring.
Rings glimmered on her fingers as she raised her hand to show off her wrist watch and bracelets. Although Aima didn't wear anything fancier than a casual shirt and jeans, she sported a big smile to show that she was satisfied with the bling she added to the overall look with her accessories.
""Layering up jewels gives me chills. In a good way, of course,"" she wrote. As inspiration struck, she asked her followers if she should launch her own jewellery line.
Whether or not the Baanware singer decides to commit to this endeavour remains to be seen. For now, she's thriving in her career as a musician.
Earlier this month, she won the Lux Style Award for Most Stylish Musician of the Year (Critics' Choice) for Satrangi. Expressing gratitude for the accolade on Instagram, she wrote, ""Thank you so much. I'm truly humbled.""
The feat caught the attention of Strings alum Faisal Kapadia, who said in the comments, ""Many congratulations! We need a treat."" Aima's beau, Rastah founder Zain Ahmad, also offered his support, lighting up her comments with fire emojis.
Fans were also quick to offer their heartfelt congratulations, flooding the section with heart emojis. ""You deserve it, my girl,"" a user wrote, echoing the sentiments of many others including fans from beyond Pakistan.
Last month, Aima performed for her dedicated international fans in Bangladesh. Sharing the concert photos, she wrote, ""Thank you for all the love, Bangladesh. You guys were truly magical, and a huge shout out to Yamaha for putting together an amazing stage.""

"Arshad, Yasir eye medals in Gumi","US
Pakistani duo qualify in style for Asian Championship finals
Pakistan will have a great chance of winning two medals at the Asian Athletics Championship 2025 javelin throw final on Saturday as Olympian Arshad Nadeem and the 2023 Asian bronze-medallist Muhammad Yasir Sultan will compete in the final after their stellar performances in the qualifying round on Friday morning in Gumi, South Korea.
Arshad Nadeem was undoubtedly the biggest name competing in the Championship, while Paris Olympics silver medallist India's Neeraj Chopra was absent from the event.
Arshad, the 28-year-old, who not only won the Olympic gold medal in Paris but also created an Olympic record with a throw of 92.97 metres, was making his international comeback in the qualifying round of the Asian Championship.
He was slotted in Group A, while Yasir competed in Group B of the qualifying round.
Arshad qualified for the final with a throw of 86.34m, in his first and only attempt. The final will take place on Saturday at 13:10 Pakistan time.
His was a leading throw, whereas Sri Lanka's Rumesh Tharanga Pathirage came closest to him on the leaderboard with a throw of 83.71 m overall, and Japan's Yuta Sakiyama was the third best with an 81.36m-throw.
""Thanks to your prayers I have qualified for the final of the Asian Athletics Championship,"" Arshad said in his social media post addressing his fans and Pakistani nation after the qualifying round.
""I am always grateful for your endless support, my final is at 1:10 pm, so I request your prayers for me to succeed and make Pakistan proud and raise our flag higher. Pakistan Zindabad.""
This is Arshad's first appearance after the Paris Olympics and he has trained for the Asian Athletics Championships in Lahore with his coach Salman Butt.
Rising star Yasir to defend his bronze
On the other hand, Yasir, who bagged the bronze medal in the last Asian Athletics Championship edition, is looking to improve his throw on Saturday.
His personal best performance on the international stage has been 79.93m, which he delivered in Bangkok at the Asian Championships two years ago.
In Gumi, he qualified for the final in his first attempt of 76.07m throw. He will aim to cross the 80m barrier in the final.
""The thing is, we have been doing good throws in training before this, and God willing, we hope that we will have good throws in tomorrow's final and it will bring honor to our country,"" Yasir's coach and mentor Fiaz Bokhari, who was also the former coach and mentor of Arshad, told this correspondent on the eve of the final.
Yasir and Arshad will be among 12 competitors looking for a podium finish on Saturday.
""Secondly, you may remember that last year Yasir came third in the Asian Championship Throwing in Bangkok, he threw 79.93 meters. This time, I hope he will throw his best because we have been throwing well in training.
""This is my second student who will cross the 80m-barrier after Arshad,"" added Bokhari, who has previously helped Arshad become the first Pakistani track and field athlete to qualify for the Olympics directly in 2019. He then led Arshad to the Toyko Olympics as well.
""Our target is Olympic qualification, so that we can pass the Olympic qualification and go to the Olympics. Since the World Athletics Championships are being held at the end of this year before the Olympics, we are trying to qualify there as well in Bangkok.""

Reborn' dolls divide Brazil,"DE
Collectors defend trend, push back at critics amid backlash
Gabi Matos looks the quintessential doting mum as she changes Ravi's nappy, cooing reassuringly as he stares up at her.
But this Brazilian ""newborn"" doesn't seem to mind having his nappy changed. In fact, he has no real emotions whatsoever.
Ravi is a hyper-realistic doll with an eerie resemblance to an actual infant.
Some of the so-called ""reborn"" dolls cry, suck dummies, pee, have nails, eyelashes and veins. But what really sets them apart from traditional dolls with waxy, smooth complexion is their puckered features and blotchy skin. Blink and you could mistake the bundle in the stroller in Rio de Janeiro for the real thing.
Demand for these replica babies, which first emerged in the United States in the early 1990s, targeting adults chiefly, has rocketed in the South American country in recent years.
""I always loved babies and dolls, from a very young age. When I discovered these art models I fell in love,"" said Ravi's 21-year-old ""mum.""
Made with silicone or vinyl, the price tag for these bundles of joy can run to thousands of dollars.
Matos, who lives in the southeastern Brazilian city of Campinas, received her first ""reborn"" - so-called because the first editions were traditional dolls modified by artists to look more life-like — aged nine.
Her collection now runs to 22 and looking after her tiny charges is a full-time job which she enacts daily for her 1.3 million YouTube followers.
But in the past few weeks, the admiring comments on her posts have become interspersed with attacks.
""People say I should be admitted to a psychiatric hospital because they believe that we treat them (the dolls) as if they were real children, which is not the case,"" she said. ""It's sad.""
A country divided
The dolls tottered into the public debate in April when a group of collectors held a gathering in a park in Sao Paulo.
Footage of the event went viral, along with a separate video of a reborn ""birth,"" in which an influencer extracts a disheveled doll from a fluid-filled bag passing for an amniotic sac and then clamps a make-believe umbilical cord.
Social media erupted with posts either condemning the would-be mothers' behaviour as deranged or dismissing it as a harmless hobby.
""Let these people raise reborn babies. If they procreate, it will be much worse!"" actress Luana Piovani wrote on Instagram, in a post that was viewed thousands of times.
Alana Generoso, a longtime reborn baby collector, who now owns her own doll store, insists that her customers are perfectly sound of mind.
""Many children come to the story, as well as adults that lead normal lives,"" the 46-year-old mother of real four-year-old triplets said.
Alana Babys Maternity Hospital in Campinas is designed to look like an authentic maternity ward.
Before handing over a doll to its new owner, employees in white coats take it from an incubator, weigh it, place it in a stroller and present the proud ""parent"" with a birth certificate.
""Here, you're not buying an ordinary doll, you're buying a dream,"" Generoso argued.
""Are there cases of people looking after the dolls as if they were real babies? Yes, but they're not a majority.""
The debate has reverberated all the way up to Congress. Some MPs are calling for ""reborn"" mums to receive psychological help, but others call for people who allegedly use their ""babies"" to jump the queue for public services to be punished.
Last week, an MP made clear which camp he was in when he brought his reborn ""granddaughter"" to parliament.
Playing with dolls is ""not a sin,"" Manoel Isidorio, an evangelical pastor, argued.
Like men with kites
For psychologist Viviane Cunha collecting dolls is a hobby that is only categorized as a disorder when it causes ""social, emotional or economic harm.""
""If for example the person skips work because 'the baby has a fever', and believes it to be true, then he or she needs professional help,"" she said.
Cunha linked the reborn fever to a global loneliness epidemic, which the World Health Organisation has tied to social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I think the doll comes from a search for an emotional bond or connection,"" Cunha said.
Matos argues that criticism of the dolls is sexist.
""Male hobbies like video games, flying kites, playing football are normalised. No-one says that they are too old to do these things, but women cannot take care of their dolls without people thinking we are sick.""

"Man, two sons shot dead over water connection dispute","US
Two injured in violent clash; police arrest main accused
A tragic shooting incident occurred in the suburban village of Chak 33 Fatah, Chishtian, where a dispute over a water connection escalated into deadly violence between two groups, resulting in the death of a father and his two sons from the same family.
Two others were seriously injured. According to initial reports, the altercation began as a verbal argument between Muhammad Amin and Muhammad Aslam over a water connection.
The situation quickly escalated, leading to an exchange of gunfire.
As a result, 55-year-old Muhammad Amin and his sons, 30-year-old Saeed and 28-year-old Waheed, were killed on the spot. Another son, Rashid, sustained critical injuries.
Muhammad Aslam, from the opposing side, was also seriously injured.
Rescue 1122 reached the scene and shifted all the deceased and injured to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital.
Due to their critical condition, both injured men were later transferred to Bahawal Victoria Hospital in Bahawalpur.
Upon receiving the report, Chishtian Circle DSP Akmal Basra and a large police contingent arrived at the scene, collected evidence and launched an investigation. Police said the primary motive behind the triple murder was the water connection dispute.
Bahawalnagar District Police Officer (DPO) Kamran Asghar took notice of the incident and sought a detailed report from the Chishtian Sadar Police.
A murder case has been registered against six suspects on the complaint of Amin's surviving son. The main accused, currently injured, is in police custody, while raids are being conducted to arrest the remaining suspects.
DPO Asghar emphasised that the protection of citizens' lives and property remains the police's top priority and assured that all resources will be used to bring the culprits to justice.
Inspector General Punjab Dr Usman Anwar also took notice of the triple murder and ordered swift arrests and a detailed report from the DPO.

Brook hails 'exceptional' Bethell in Eng win,"US
Victory ended Eng's seven-match losing streak in ODIs
Harry Brook predicted Jacob Bethell ""will be some player"" after the 21-year-old rising star impressed in England's thumping victory over the West Indies in the first one-day international at Edgbaston on Thursday.
There has long been talk over whether Bethell, recently returned from IPL duty, will go straight back into the Test side for the upcoming five-match series with India.
And that speculation will only intensify following Bethell's expertly-paced innings of 82 from 53 balls that propelled England to a huge total of 400-8 on his Warwickshire home ground.
Faced with trying to become only the second team in the 4,880-match history of men's ODI cricket to score over 400 to win, following South Africa's 438-9 against Australia at Johannesburg in 2006, the West Indies collapsed to 162 all out.
Brook, speaking after launching his reign as England's permanent white-ball captain with a dominant 238-run win, said of left-hander Bethell: ""He batted beautifully there.
""When one of us gets going, most of the time it's hard to stop us and he showed that. He couldn't go on and get three figures but it was a match-winning innings and he's going to be some player.
""He's a confident lad, I don't think he needs too much more bigging up, he knows he's a good player and we all know he's an exceptional player. He's going to have a very long England career if he keeps on batting the way he does. He brings so much to a side (because) he can bowl and field as well.""
Victory ended England's seven-match losing streak in ODI cricket and put them 1-0 up in this three-game series against the West Indies.
Barbados-born Bethell's Indian Premier League commitments meant he missed last week's Test win over Zimbabwe, with England not having to decide whether to retain him at number three after he starred in New Zealand in December or restore vice-captain Ollie Pope to that position.
Pope made a hundred at Trent Bridge but Test captain Ben Stokes revived the debate around Bethell by indicating the spin-bowling all-rounder could be back in the side to face India.
Stokes later insisted he was only talking about Bethell returning to the squad for the first of five Tests against India, starting on June 20 at Headingley.
But a relaxed Bethell told the BBC: ""Not a lot has been said to me, to be honest. At the end of the day in Test cricket, those boys have their spots and whatever happens, happens. I'll just be happy with whatever.""
Bethell rounded off England's innings on Thursday following earlier fifties from Ben Duckett (60), Joe Root (57) and Brook (58), while every batsman in the hosts' top seven passed 35.
""It was a pretty exceptional start from the boys,"" said Brook. ""Hopefully we can top that. The tempo we batted with throughout the innings was pretty much spot on.""
Saqib Mahmood then rocked the West Indies with three wickets and fellow paceman Jamie Overton did likewise despite dislocating his finger in his first over.
West Indies coach Darren Sammy, meanwhile, demanded an improved showing from the tourists in the second ODI in Cardiff on Sunday.
""We were really outplayed -- that was just not good enough,"" insisted the former West Indies captain.

Milan turn to old boy Allegri,"US
The ailing seven-time European champions hired Allegri after sacking Conceicao
Massimiliano Allegri returned to AC Milan on Friday as the ailing seven-time European champions try once again to rebuild following an awful season, on a busy day for managerial moves in Serie A.
Milan have turned to serial winner Allegri in their hour of need following the expected sacking of Sergio Conceicao, who leaves the San Siro club after five miserable months in charge.
Milan did not reveal details of the deal but Italian media widely report that Allegri has signed a two-year contract worth five million euros a season, with the option to extend for a further two years.
Allegri has become the fourth coach in a year for Milan, who finished this past Serie A season in eighth place and missed out on European football for next term.
The 57-year-old led Milan to the 2011 Scudetto in his first stint in charge, between 2010 and 2014, and he was their coach for one of the most infamous episodes in recent Serie A history.
Milan were beating Juventus, rivals for the 2012 league title, 1-0 in February that year when a Sulley Muntari goal was not given despite the ball clearly crossing the line.
Juve went on to draw that game 1-1 and then win their first title in nine years -- finishing the campaign unbeaten -- and two years later hired Allegri who then won Serie A five more times in his two spells with the Turin giants.
Allegri had been on hiatus since being sacked by Juve in May last year, his final act there being a post-match rampage after winning the Italian Cup in which he railed at officials and sporting director Cristiano Giuntoli.
Conceicao, a former Inter Milan and Lazio player, was hired in late December in place of his countryman Paulo Fonseca on a contract until next year.
The 50-year-old began in positive fashion at Milan by winning the Italian Super Cup in January, but he failed to claim a Champions League spot for a talented but inconsistent team that also lost the Italian Cup final to Bologna earlier this month.
Conceciao, 50, won 16 of 31 games in charge at Milan, including 11 victories, seven losses and three draws in the league and also had to deal with vociferous protests from supporters against the club's American owners RedBird.
Fans demonstrated in large numbers outside Milan's headquarters ahead of their team's final match of the season, a dead-rubber against relegated Monza last weekend.
That protest was a culmination of months of visible anger from supporters who have watched Milan slide down the league after Stefano Pioli took them to second place in 2023/24.

The incident occurred in Kohistan Colony where Nauman Naseer reported that three of his goats, tethered outside his home, were being loaded into two cars by four individuals.
He chased them and informed the police, who set up checkpoints and stopped the vehicles near PAF Chowk.

The stolen goats were recovered, and the owner positively identified the suspects.
Police also recovered Rs30,000 in cash and two vehicles used in the thefts.
According to an official spokesperson, the suspects confessed to multiple thefts.
SP Rawal Division Raja Haseeb stated that all facilitators, including the absconding suspect, will be apprehended soon and presented in court with solid evidence.

Future war risks engulfing whole countries: CJCSC,"IN
Gen Mirza says Pakistan, India start reducing troops after border clashes
Pakistan and India are close to reducing the troop buildup along their border to levels before conflict erupted between the nuclear-armed neighbours this month, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza told Reuters on Friday.
However, he warned the crisis had increased the risk of escalation in the future.
Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, drones, and artillery in four days of clashes, their worst fighting in decades, before a ceasefire was announced.
The recent clashes between Pakistan and India arose following the Pahalgam attack on April 22 in the Indian-Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) that killed 26 people.
New Delhi blamed the incident without evidence on Pakistani elements, a charge denied by Islamabad, which sought an independent probe into the incident.
On May 7, India launched missiles at civilian sites. This prompted a defensive response from Pakistan and a subsequent troop buildup by both countries along the frontier.
General Mirza said the two militaries had started the process of drawing down troop levels. ""We have almost come back to the pre-April 22 situation... we are approaching that, or we must have approached that by now,"" said Mirza, the most senior Pakistani military official to speak publicly since the conflict.
India's Ministry of Defence and the office of the Indian Chief of Defence Staff did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment on the remarks by Mirza.
Mirza, who is in Singapore to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue forum, said while there was no move towards nuclear weapons during this conflict, it was a dangerous situation.
""Nothing happened this time,"" he said. ""But you can't rule out any strategic miscalculation at any time, because when the crisis is on, the responses are different.""
He also said the risk of escalation in the future had increased since the fighting this time was not limited to IIOJK.
""This (conflict) lowers the threshold between two countries who are contiguous nuclear powers...in the future, it will not be restricted to the disputed territory. It would come down to (the) whole of India and (the) whole of Pakistan,"" Mirza said. ""This is a very dangerous trend.""
Reuters has reported that the rapid escalation of hostilities ended in part because of behind-the-scenes diplomacy involving the US, India, and Pakistan, and the key role played by Washington in brokering peace.
India continues to deny any third-party role in the ceasefire and said that any engagement between India and Pakistan has to be bilateral.
But Mirza warned that international mediation might be difficult in the future because of a lack of crisis management mechanisms between the countries.
""The time window for the international community to intervene would now be very less, and I would say that damage and destruction may take place even before that time window is exploited by the international community,"" he said.
Pakistan was open to dialogue, he added, but beyond a crisis hotline between the directors general of military operations and some hotlines at the tactical level on the border, there was no other communication between the two countries.
Mirza said there were no backchannel discussions or informal talks to ease tensions.
He also said he had no plans to meet General Anil Chauhan, India's chief of defence staff, who is also in Singapore for the Shangri-La forum.
""These issues can only be resolved by dialogue and consultations, at the table. They cannot be resolved on the battlefield,"" Mirza said.

Musk says to remain 'friend and advisor' to Trump,"AT
.
Billionaire Elon Musk said Friday he would remain a ""friend and advisor"" to Donald Trump, as the US president hosted an Oval Office farewell for the man who led his turbulent cost-cutting drive.
""I look forward to continuing to be a friend and advisor to the president,"" Musk told reporters after Trump handed a golden key as a gift to the departing leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
Musk, clad in a black T-shirt and jacket and wearing a baseball cap as he stood next to the seated Trump, said he would keep supporting the team that is ""relentlessly pursuing a trillion dollars in waste"" in reductions that will ""benefit the American taxpayer.""
He complained about how he has been portrayed, saying: ""We became, like, essentially the DOGE bogeyman, where any cut anywhere would be ascribed to DOGE.""
Musk, the world's richest person, has said he is stepping back from his role at the White House to focus on his companies, which include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X.
His formal exit comes after a bombshell report in The New York Times on his alleged drug use.
The newspaper said that Musk used so much ketamine during the 2024 campaign that he developed bladder problems and that he was also taking ecstasy and psychoactive mushrooms, and traveled with a pill box last year. Musk was immediately asked about the report. He did not reply directly and instead denounced The New York Times over its previous coverage of Russian interference in the 2016 election before moving to the next question.
DOGE under Musk's guidance has slashed billions of dollars in government spending, much of it already approved by Congress, including eviscerating the main US agency delivering foreign aid.

IHC annuls transfer order of service tribunal,"US
.
The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has partially accepted a petition filed by some district and sessions judges and declared the Islamabad District Judicial Service Tribunal's (IDJST) decision to send back deputation judges from the district judiciary null and void.
The IDJST tribunal comprising three IHC judges Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khanhad issued the order to repatriate the judges in the district judiciary serving on deputation as tribunal members.
Islamabad Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Abual Hasanat Muhammad Zulqarnain and others had challenged the decision in the IHC, whose single-member bench comprising Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir announced the verdict in the case.
The court held that the tribunal does not have suo motu powers against the tribunal itself. It clarified that it is not deciding the case on merits, and that the tribunal will decide the merits of the case.
The IDJST on March 21 annulled a notification of the Ministry of Law with regard to reconstitution of the tribunala decision that showed a growing chasm among the judges in the capital's high court.
The ministry on March 18 notified a new tribunal consisting of three IHC judges nominated by Acting Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro was to head the IDJST while it also comprised Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.
However, the existing tribunal comprising Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Babar Sattar declared the notification illegal in an order that also allowed the appeal of senior civil judge, Muhammad Shabbir.
In its order, the tribunal noted that there was no need for its reconstitution as there is no difference between the tribunal chairman and the members. The IHC in its order stated that after the change of the tribunal, Justice Tariq Jahangiri was no longer authorized to decide the matter.
The court added that the powers of the tribunal are limited and not equivalent to those of a high court judge.

Principal beats student to death in Khyber,"US
5th grader dies after brutal punishment; accused arrested
A heartbreaking incident unfolded in the Jamrud area of Khyber tribal district, where a fifth-grade student lost his life allegedly due to severe drubbing by his school principal.
The tragic event prompted swift action by law enforcement, with the prime suspect apprehended within an hour.
According to initial reports, the victim, Ittehad, son of Khyal Mat Khan and a resident of Sur Kamar Bhagyari, was brutally beaten by Principal Waqar Ahmed during a routine school assembly over a minor issue.
The young student sustained critical injuries and was rushed to the hospital, where he later succumbed to his wounds.
Taking immediate notice of the incident, District Police Officer (DPO) Khyber, Rai Mazhar Iqbal, directed Jamrud Station House Officer (SHO) Naseem Khan to take swift action.
Within just an hour, the policeusing modern investigative methods tracked down and arrested the accused, who has since been placed in custody. Legal proceedings against him are currently underway.
DPO Rai Mazhar Iqbal condemned the act, saying, violence against children and women will not be tolerated under any circumstances.
No one has the right to misuse the noble role of a teacher to commit such brutality.

Saudi FM to make landmark visit to occupied West Bank,"US
.
Prince Faisal bin Farhan will become the first Saudi foreign minister to visit the occupied West Bank on Sunday, a diplomatic source told AFP, as the Gaza war drags on and Riyadh pushes for Palestinian statehood.
The Saudi top diplomat will lead a delegation to Ramallah, a Palestinian embassy source said, the first such trip since Israel first occupied the Palestinian territory in 1967.
Prince Faisal's trip was revealed as Israel vowed to build a ""Jewish Israeli state"" in the West Bank, after doubling down on plans to expand settlements there.
""A ministerial delegation led by the minister of foreign affairs will go to Ramallah on Sunday,"" the embassy source told AFP.
Saudi Arabia sent a lower-level delegation to Ramallah in September 2023, its first since 1967, not long before Hamas's October 7 attack triggered the Gaza war.
International backlash has been growing since Israel resumed its offensive in Gaza in March, with a humanitarian crisis spiralling and the UN warning of famine throughout the territory.
Next month, Saudi Arabia and France will co-chair an international conference meant to resurrect the two-state solution at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Nearly 150 countries recognise the State of Palestine, which has observer status at the UN but is not a full member as the Security Council has not voted to admit it.
In May 2024, Ireland, Norway and Spain took the step of recognising a Palestinian state, but other European governments, including France, have not.
President Emmanuel Macron said in April that France could recognise a Palestinian state in June.
Macron said at the time that he wished to organise the New York conference to encourage recognition of the State of Palestine, ""but also a recognition of Israel from states that currently do not"".
Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam's holiest sites and the world's biggest oil exporter, was said to be close to recognising Israel before the start of the Gaza war.
US President Donald Trump, during a visit to Riyadh this month, called Saudi normalisation with Israel ""my fervent hope and wish, and even my dream"".
""You'll do it in your own time, and that's what I want, that's what you want,"" he said.
Last September, de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman stated clearly that Saudi Arabia would not recognise Israel without an independent Palestinian state.
This position was reaffirmed in November at a joint Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation summit where Israel was accused of ""genocide"" in Gaza.
On Friday, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to build a ""Jewish Israeli state"" in the occupied West Bank, a day after the government announced the creation of 22 new settlements there.

The United Nations honoured 57 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers from 32 countries, including two from Pakistan, who paid the ultimate price for the cause of peace last year serving the missions around the world, at an impressive ceremony Thursday that marked the annual International Day of UN Peacekeepers.
Among the posthumous awardees of Dag Hammarskjold medals are: Sepoy Muhammad Tarique and Havildar Ahsan Ullah Khan who both served with UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who presided over the ceremony in the Trusteeship Council Chamber at UN Headquarters in New York, gave away the awards for the fallen peacekeeper which were received by ambassadors of the countries they hailed from. The awards for the civilians, who lost their lives in line of their duty, were received on behalf of their families by the UN Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support, Atul Khare.
Pakistan's UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, accompanied by the Mission's Military Adviser Col. Umar Shafique, attended the ceremony and accepted the awards, along with other heads of missions and their military attaches.
The UN chief also presented awards to the 2024 Military Gender Advocate of the Year, Squadron Leader Sharon Mwinsote Syme from Ghana and the UN Woman Police Officer of the Year award to Superintendent Zainab Gbla of Sierra Leone. Both of them also serve with the United Nations Interim Security Force in Abyei (UNISFA).
The first UN peacekeeping operation was established in 1948 and today more than 68,000 civilian, military, and police personnel are posted at 11 missions in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
Pakistan is the 5th largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping, the UN's flagship activity.

Pakistan win BD T20 series,"HK
.
Opener Sahibzada Farhan notched his maiden half century and spinner Abrar Ahmed grabbed three wickets to guide Pakistan to another convincing 57-run win over Bangladesh in Lahore on Friday.
Farhan smashed a 41-ball 74 and Hasan Nawaz unbeaten 51 off 26 balls to help the home team post 201-6 before Abrar grabbed 3-19 to keep Bangladesh to 144-9 in 19 overs, with the last man Shoriful Islama unable to bat due to injury.
Pakistan, who won the first match by 37 runs at the same venue, take an unassailable 2-0 lead with the final match on Sunday, also in Lahore.
The win also gives a kickstart to Pakistan's new white-ball head coach Mike Hesson appointed earlier this month to stem a slide which saw them win just three of their last 13 T20s before this series.
Bangladesh raced to 32 in the first two overs but openers Parvez Hossain (eight) and Tanzid Hasan (19-ball 33 with five boundaries and a six) fell within two runs of each other.
From 46-2, Bangladesh slumped to 56-5 with Abrar dismissing Tohid Hridoy (five) and Jaker Ali (nought) off successive deliveries while pacer Hasan Ali had skipper Litton Das for six.
Tanzim Hasan, who topscored with a career best 31-ball 50, and Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 23 off 17 balls, added 33 for the eighth wicket but it was too late, too little.

A tale of two escalations,"HK
.
In any conflict between two countries escalation strategy controls the direction of the engagement. The initiation of conflict and its escalation depend upon who is in control of it and how it can be shaped or reshaped to dissipate the will of one's adversary. Once a conflict is started, the aggressor sets the benchmark and tone of its complexity.
The defending state can retaliate with a range of possibilities depending upon its historical friction with the aggressor, the dynamics of its internal security environment, its governance cum administrative structure and more importantly strength of its leadership. There are however two types of escalations which can happen in modern day warfare. The first one occurs in physical space while, side by side, the other unfolds in non-physical medium at multiple levels.
There are regions of convergence and divergence between the two escalations. The friction between these areas can provide room for future conflicts between two countries. A country which manages to expand its area of convergence between these two escalations can in fact strengthen its position locally and increases morale of its forces.
A large island of divergence between physical and non-physical escalations is a potential source of discomfort among the leadership, security organizations and public in a country. It can push such a state towards adventurism in coming days. Any effort to offset it or defuse it in any manner can be a win-win situation for people of both countries.
In a typical Pak-India scenario, India has upped the ante this year as compared to its response in 2019. This time round, it was inside Punjab and not in or around AJK. The other parts especially Balochistan and KP were deliberately omitted on multiple strategic counts.
Perhaps it was a rational Indian choice not to target these regions as it might trigger anti-India sentiments where militancy is quite active. As a result, India started off at a higher level on the escalation ladder. The reaction to such multiple hits inside Pakistan had to come in a tit for tat fashion.
However, Pakistan's response was mainly triggered by a barrage of attacks on its air-strips which also took its military by surprise in terms of target selection and attack intensification. In physical medium, de-escalation appears to be a permanent feature and actors, regional or international, are actually looking for an opportunity to synchronise the aggressor and the aggrieved.
In the present conflict, many actors appeared now and again, striving for some sort of hostility adjournment, permanent or temporarily. Since, the ceasefire has resulted into mutual talks it is important to gauge the outcome of these engagements. Essentially, in case of any such like future occurrence, a modality needs to be established in which the two sides can examine the evidence and discuss it before reaching at a conclusion.
A unilateral assessment of situation is bound to create friction leading to a future conflict. The questions arising are: Is the current de-escalation temporary or permanent? Is another dispute building up behind the scenes owing to the incomplete de-escalation mechanism?
The current conflict has also depicted another escalation which has taken place in cyber medium. Claims, counter claims, truths and lies - in different formats and on various platforms — have inflicted a series of psychological blows on both sides. It goes on polluting the minds, causing confusion, frustration and fear as well.
People usually believe in AI-generated images like old videos with new captions to create a false perception of escalation. Anything can happen in cyber space and anyone can say anything purposefully to modulate minds of citizens of both countries. Sometimes real facts and first-hand information are also transmitted on it, giving rise to new dimensions and proffer interesting avenues for analysis. This escalation is continuing in non-physical dimension and may not subside in coming days.
The friction between individuals or groups on a cyber platform can become a potential source of mistrust among communities and ethnic groups living in different geographical dispositions. The post-ceasefire consultation should take stock of it too.

It expressed deep concern over the CII's stance, which challenges the bill that sets 18 years as the minimum legal age for marriage and criminalizes child marriage in the federal capital.

Railways posts Rs83b revenue,"HK
Karachi Division leads gains as historic income signals recovery but not full revival
Pakistan Railways has announced earning a record-breaking Rs83 billion in revenue during the first eleven months of the current financial year FY25, showing a growth of 7.8% over the corresponding period.
According to the Railways spokesperson, this is the highest revenue collected by the organisation in any similar eleven-month period in its history. Federal Railways Minister Muhammad Hanif Abbasi hailed the achievement as historic, stating that ""through hard work and dedication, we will put Railways back on its feet.""
The revenue breakdown shows passenger trains contributed Rs42 billion, while freight services generated Rs29 billion. Other income sources, including property leases and commercial activities, added Rs12 billion.
Regional performance varied significantly, with Karachi Division emerging as the top performer — earning Rs13 billion from passengers and a substantial Rs25 billion from freight. Lahore Division reported Rs10 billion from passengers but less than Rs1 billion from freight. Both Rawalpindi and Multan Divisions earned Rs4 billion each from passengers, totalling Rs8 billion combined.
This performance represents a notable improvement over the same period last year, when revenue stood at Rs77 billion. The current figures suggest Pakistan Railways might surpass its full-year target of Rs88 billion with one month remaining.
This financial milestone comes against a backdrop of persistent challenges. For years, Pakistan Railways has struggled with aging infrastructure, frequent service disruptions, and safety concerns that have eroded public confidence. Many mainline tracks and bridges date back to the British colonial era, causing speed restrictions and delays. The organisation still operates at a significant operational loss when accounting for full infrastructure maintenance costs, despite this revenue increase.
While the Rs83 billion revenue demonstrates progress in financial management and operational efficiency, industry analysts said this represents recovery rather than transformation. Sustained investment in infrastructure modernisation, consistent service quality, and resolution of long-standing debt issues are still needed before Pakistan Railways can be considered fully revitalised.
""The revenue achievement offers hope, but the organisation's journey to becoming a truly modern, reliable, and profitable national transport service has just begun,"" they added.

India's 'hydro terrorism' untenable: COAS,"US
Field Marshal Munir says all inimical designs will be defeated
Pakistan will never be coerced, and all inimical designs to derail the country's counterterrorism efforts will be ""comprehensively defeated,"" Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir said on Friday, warning against India's ""unlawful and legally untenable hydro terrorism,"" calling for a peaceful resolution to the Kashmir dispute to ensure strategic stability in South Asia.
According to the military's media wing, the army chief made these remarks during his visit to Command and Staff College Quetta, where he addressed student officers and faculty members, touching upon operational readiness, regional stability, and Pakistan's national security doctrine.
""Pakistan's enemies will fail in their attempts to distract us from our focus on counterterrorism,"" Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), adding that the nation stands united in the defence of its sovereignty. He also underscored the need for a peaceful resolution to the internationally recognised Kashmir dispute.
The remarks come amid recent tensions between Pakistan and India following a series of military engagements triggered by the deadly Pahalgam attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), which claimed 26 lives, mostly tourists. India blamed Pakistan without evidence, prompting a chain of events that escalated into full-fledged cross-border hostilities.
India's use of force was met with a calibrated military response under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, which targeted Indian air assets, ammunition depots, and missile bases along the Line of Control and beyond. The operation formed part of a broader campaign, Marka-e-Haq, which ran from May 7 to May 10.
Paying tribute to the martyrs of the operation, the COAS said the people of Pakistan had become a ""wall of steel"" under national leadership. ""Marka-e-Haq is a testimony to our resolve, unity, and complete synergy among all elements of national power,"" he said, adding, ""Allah's help comes to those nations that stand for the truth and fight with unity.""
Highlighting the changing nature of modern warfare, the COAS said Pakistan's military remained prepared to respond across the full spectrum of conflict. He particularly criticised India's growing tendency to resort to unprovoked military aggression, cautioning that strategic stability in South Asia was increasingly fragile and hinged on justice, especially in Kashmir.

Tax shortfall exceeds Rs1 trillion,"US
It comes despite levying record new taxes, taking advances, blocking refunds
The shortfall in tax collection widened to an alarmingly high level of Rs1.03 trillion in just 11 months of the current fiscal year despite imposing record new taxes in the budget, taking advances, withdrawing money from people's bank accounts and blocking refunds of companies and individuals.
Only in May, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) faced a mammoth shortfall of Rs205 billion despite paying 5.3% less refunds compared to last year. The embarrassing outcome brings into question the government's strategy of collecting taxes from the already burdened classes and sectors of the economy.
One of the reasons for missing the monthly target by a wide margin is no new recovery of arrears in litigation cases, which both the government and the FBR had promised to recover through expeditious settlement of the cases.
The FBR provisionally collected Rs10.21 trillion from July through May of the current fiscal year, falling short of the target by Rs1.03 trillion, according to its statistics. The collection was still around 28%, or Rs2.2 trillion, higher than the previous fiscal year, but not enough to stay on track.
The key reasons behind the higher collection compared to last year were the imposition of more taxes in budget, particularly on the salaried class and corporate sector, and expansion of sales tax net to many untaxed areas. Yet the FBR missed the target by Rs1.03 trillion.
The FBR did not respond to a request for comment till the filing of the story.
The shortfall is far more than what the government committed in talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in March this year, when the lender lowered the target by Rs640 billion for the full fiscal year.
In a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance on Thursday, PPP MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig said that the FBR illegally recovered money from multiple bank accounts in Karachi to meet its targets. Moreover, Utopia Industry, one of the top 12 exporters, is struggling to get Rs3 billion in refunds, a situation many industries are facing despite official claims of clearing refunds within 72 hours.
Details showed that in May the FBR paid Rs2 billion, or 5.3%, less refunds compared to the same month of last year. Total refund payments in 11 months reached hardly Rs458 billion, higher by just 1.1% and not in commensuration with the 28% rise in tax collection.
The salaried class was the most affected segment that paid a record Rs437 billion in taxes till April, which were 52%, or Rs150 billion, more than last year.
For May, the FBR's tax target was Rs1.1 trillion. However, despite taking advances and slowing refunds, it could collect Rs907 billion. The monthly collection was Rs271 billion, or 43%, more than last year, which a senior FBR official said was commendable in the current circumstances.
The IMF forced the country to impose new taxes, primarily burdening the salaried class and levying taxes on nearly all consumable goods, including medical tests, stationery, vegetables and children's milk.
For the July-May period, the FBR missed its targets for sales tax, federal excise duty (FED) and customs duty but again exceeded the income tax target on the back of overburdening the salaried class.
Income tax collection amounted to Rs4.9 trillion during the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, higher by Rs296 billion from the target. It was also Rs1.1 trillion more than last year. The burden was shared by the salaried class and the corporate sector as retailers and landlords remained under-taxed.
Sales tax collection stood at Rs3.5 trillion, a whopping Rs900 billion less than the target of Rs4.4 trillion. Sales tax remained the most difficult area for the FBR and one of the reasons for the low collection was less-than-estimated growth in large industries. The government had immensely increased the sales tax burden in the budget. The collection was Rs755 billion higher than last year.
The FBR collected Rs672 billion in FED, which was Rs166 billion less than the target. However, it was Rs180 billion higher than last year. The government did not spare homes, lubricants, fruit juices, cement, sugar, etc from FED in the last budget. Yet it failed to meet the target.
Customs duty collection stood at Rs1.16 trillion, below target by Rs265 billion. The collection was hit by lower-than-projected import volumes. It was also marred by the manipulation of goods declaration forms by importers in connivance with the corrupt elements. The amount was Rs172 billion higher than last year.

Govt plans steep hike in traffic fines,"PK
.Move aims to curb rising road violations and improve public safety
The Punjab government is finalising a sweeping proposal to revise traffic penalties across the province, with some fines expected to rise as much as tenfold.
The move, initiated under the directives of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, aims to curb rising road violations and improve public safety.
According to SSP Traffic Ghazanfar Ali Shah, common offences such as riding without a helmet, driving against traffic, and driving without a valid license will now carry proposed fines of Rs2,000.
""The ex-isting fine structure has been in place since 2006 and is no longer effective in today's traffic envi-ronment. A revision is critical to improving road discipline,"" he said, adding that the updated fines will be enforced immediately once approved.
In response to growing concerns over traffic violations, Punjab's traffic authorities have intensified operations against unlicensed drivers.
Over 178,000 challans were issued this month alone for driving without a license, with Lahore accounting for more than 70,000 cases.
Additional Inspector General (AIG) Traffic, Mirza Farhan Baig, has instructed all regional traffic units to adopt a zero-tolerance approach toward un-licensed motorists.
""No leniency will be shown. Citizens must obtain proper licenses to ensure their safety and avoid penalties,"" he stated.
In another major development, district police have been empowered to assist in recovering unpaid e-challans.
With more than Rs6 billion in outstanding dues, defaulters now face home raids and potential restrictions on vehicle transfers, registrations, and other official processes.

The Legal Advisor to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Ali Azeem Afridi has tendered his resignation, citing concerns over alleged illegal activities within the assembly.
In a letter addressed to the Speaker, Afridi stated that while he was appointed based on merit and legal expertise, his conscience no longer allows him to remain silent on matters he believes violate the Constitution and the law.
However, he emphasized that his role as a legal advisor had been more impactful and clarified that he could not be part of any illegal or unconstitutional activities under any circumstances.
According to him, this is the right time to step down from the position, and he has made a final decision. He mentioned that he would now prioritize his legal practice.
A copy of his resignation was also sent to the Secretary of the provincial assembly.
On the other hand, according to the spokesperson for the K-P Assembly Secretariat, Ali Azim Advocate was appointed as Legal Advisor during the tenure of the previous government. The Assembly Secretariat, keeping in view institutional policy and discipline, reassessed his services. Based on this reassessment, Ali Azim was advised to resign respectfully.
The spokesperson stated that he was aware of the likely outcome, but instead of following the advice, he fabricated a narrative.
There were also serious reservations from the PTI's subsidiary organization, Insaf Lawyers Forum (ILF), regarding Ali Azim's political and personal activities. The ILF had repeatedly pointed out his involvement in such activities.

Teachers applaud revival of tax exemptions,"PK
Govt had abruptly discontinued 25% rebate, drawing criticism from the education sector
The teaching community in the federal capital has welcomed the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue's approval of the Income Tax (Second Amendment) Bill 2025, which aims to reinstate critical tax relief for salaried individuals, especially teachers and researchers.
The Senate panel, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, endorsed the bill, focusing particularly on reversing recent tax burdens that had led to significant salary deductions for teachers. This development follows the federal cabinet's earlier decision, dated March 26, 2025, to reinstate the 25% tax rebate for full-time teachers and researchers.
The rebate had been abruptly discontinued four months prior, drawing widespread criticism from the education sector. Reacting to the committee's approval, Fazal-e-Maula, Chairman of the Joint Education Action Committee Teachers, praised the move as a ""positive step,"" but noted that more comprehensive measures were needed. ""While the restoration of the 25% tax rebate is appreciated, it is only a small relief. The government must go a step further and introduce an education allowance,"" he said. He also advocated for aligning teachers' salaries with those of other government employees in equivalent grades.
Prof Danish Yaseen, Joint Secretary of the Federal Government College Teachers Association (FGCTA), echoed similar sentiments. ""After restoration of the 25% rebate, teachers now stand where they previously were. But the government should consider further incentives, as is done in other countries. Teachers should not be burdened with financial worries, only then they can foster a peaceful and focused classroom environment.""

"K-P seeks FED hike on gas, levy on oil","US
PTI govt wants greater revenue from oil and gas, urges relaxation in moratorium on supply
The provincial government run by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) has demanded that the federal government increase federal excise duty (FED) on gas as well as introduce a similar levy on oil in the upcoming budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
Sources told The Express Tribune that special assistant to the K-P chief minister on energy and power took up the matter in a recent meeting with representatives of the federal government.
He apprised them that the FED on gas had not been revised for a long time and the duty had not been imposed on oil despite repeated requests from the provincial government.
Consequently, he said, Article 161 of the Constitution remains unimplemented. He requested the urgent attention of the federal government towards revising the FED on gas, based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and imposition of FED on oil in the upcoming budget.
K-P has emerged as a major oil and gas producing province. Therefore, it wants more revenue on the hydrocarbon production.
During the meeting, the federal and provincial governments decided that the director (oil) would carry out a consumer impact analysis in consultation with the K-P government and place the matter before the prime minister for a decision. In the meantime, the provincial government may also request the Finance Division and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to include the FED on oil in the FY26 budget.
Regarding the FED on gas, it was decided that the director (gas) would conduct a consumer impact analysis in consultation with the K-P government and place the matter before the prime minister for a decision. Meanwhile, the provincial government may also ask the Finance Division and the FBR to revise the FED on gas in the budget.
Moratorium on gas connection
The K-P government has also requested the federal government to relax the moratorium on new gas connections on an immediate basis in its oil and gas producing districts.
These districts are arguing that it is their right to receive gas supply. However, there have been many cases in some K-P districts where residents are receiving direct gas supply without paying bills, causing increase in the circular debt.
In order to expedite the execution of new gas development schemes in the oil and gas producing districts of K-P, it was decided that the director general (gas) would share cost estimates with the Energy & Power Department of the province. These schemes will be executed on a cost-sharing basis between Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and the K-P government through the provision of funds in the FY26 budget.
The special assistant to the K-P CM also drew attention towards the forced curtailment of gas supply from various fields in the province, which has not only resulted in production losses and damage to reservoirs, but also caused substantial revenue loss to the provincial government in the form of royalties, windfall levy, etc.
He requested the establishment of a mechanism to avoid the forced reduction of oil and gas production at local fields in the best interest of both the province and the federal government.
