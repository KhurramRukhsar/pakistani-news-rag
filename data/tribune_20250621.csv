Tanker driver pushes bus full of picnickers into sidewalk,"DE
15, including women and children, injured, errant driver escapes
Several passengers were injured when a bus carrying families to Kalri Lake for a picnic met with an accident on the National Highway near the Razzaqabad Police Training Centre on Friday morning.
The mishap occurred when the bus driver reportedly lost control of the vehicle after being aggressively tailgated and honked at by a speeding water tanker. The bus veered off the road and collided with a sidewalk, leaving more than 15 people injured, including women and children. Rescuers and police arrived at the scene and shifted the injured to JPMC.
According to an Edhi spokesperson, the passengers were residents of Orangi Town and were on a family excursion at the time of the accident.
Initially, some of the injured declined medical assistance but later agreed to treatment after being persuaded by Edhi volunteers and police.
Among the severely injured were six passengers identified as 48-year-old Mukhtar Ahmed, 25-year-old Mohtasim Hussain, 18-year-old Naveed Hussain, 20-year-old Azeem Shakir, 20-year-old Naqqash, and 26-year-old Gulshan.
Police confirmed that the tanker driver, believed to be responsible for the collision, fled the scene after the mishap. Further investigations are underway.

Man held for burning 10-month-old son,"DE
The police registered a case against Amir based on the complaint filed by Nasima
A dispute between a husband and wife has landed their 10-month-old baby boy in the hospital due to alleged torture and burns inflicted by his father. Ahmed's father, Amir, allegedly tortured and burned him during an altercation with his wife, Nasima, at their residence in Liaquatabad.
The infant was admitted to the National Institute of Child Health (NICH) in critical condition. According to police, the incident occurred a few days ago when Amir got into an argument with his wife and brutally beat their son before placing him on a burning stove. The baby suffered severe burns and was initially rushed to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital before being shifted to NICH.
The authorities were informed about the incident, and the in-charge of the Woman and Child Protection Cell Sobia Nazir visited the hospital and recorded the mother's statement. The doctors attending to the baby said that the child was subjected to severe physical abuse and is currently fighting for his life.
The police registered a case against Amir based on the complaint filed by Nasima, who had married Amir two years ago. She alleged that on June 11, Amir physically abused their son and threatened to kill him by placing his hands and legs on the burning stove, causing severe burns.
Amir was arrested by the Woman and Child Protection Unit. During the initial investigation, he claimed that his wife was demanding a divorce, which led to the altercation. However, further investigation is underway to determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Sri Lanka deports dozens of Chinese,"US
.
Sri Lanka deported 85 Chinese nationals on Friday, months after they were detained on suspicion of carrying out cybercrimes against banks.
The suspects were expelled for violating the terms of their tourist visas and fined around $250 each.
""They were arrested by police in October over allegations that they were carrying out online scams targeting international banks,"" a senior immigration official who asked for anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to media without permission, told AFP.
He said the group, including 13 women, was flown to the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou on a chartered SriLankan Airlines flight on Friday morning accompanied by Sri Lankan police and Chinese security escorts.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan police said a court in the central Kandy district ordered the electronic devices seized from the group to be handed to Chinese authorities. AFP

Two booked for TikToker's 'gang rape',"US
Alleged victim claims Khanpur police stalling arrests
Khanpur police have registered a case against two suspects for allegedly gang-raping a content creator.
The woman had approached the district police officer (DPO) of Haripur seeking justice after allegedly being gang-raped in a moving vehicle on Khanpur Road.
The DPO, Farhan Khan, took notice and ordered Khanpur police to register a case. An FIR has been filed under Sections 376, 392, 505, and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
However, no arrests have been made yet. Sources claim that police in Khanpur are allegedly facilitating the suspects.
It is reported that intermediaries conveyed messages to the accused advising them to seek pre-arrest bail immediately after the FIR was filed.
The victim, identified as a 26-year-old from Taxila, has also allegedly received a message criticising her for going directly to the DPO.
Insiders further reveal that Khanpur police have been deliberately delaying the investigation and are keeping the suspects informed of all developments.
The victim's close associates stated she is prepared to pursue all legal avenues to ensure the arrest of the culprits and, if necessary, will approach the courts.

The small graves of Gaza and the silence that enables them,"US
.
There are some truths too painful to bear, yet too dangerous to ignore. In Gaza, children are being killed — by bombs, by siege, by a world that has decided their lives are expendable. Behind the numbers are tiny bodies, lifeless in rubble. They are dreams shattered before they began, futures erased with the press of a button.
These children are not soldiers. They carried schoolbooks, not rifles. Their only crime was being born in a place where war is a constant, and where even childhood is seen as a threat. And yet, they die by the hundreds with hospitals overwhelmed, schools flattened, and their homes turned into graves. Their parents dig through the ruins with bare hands, searching for a body to bury something, anything, to hold onto in their grief.
But amid this horror, there is another kind of tragedy, which is a big silence from the most powerful voices in the world. Chief among them is the United States of America. As Gaza burns, the US continues to arm, defend and shield Israel at global forums. It vetoes resolutions for ceasefires. It downplays war crimes. It offers not just weapons but political cover. And with each uncritical statement of support, more small graves are dug. This is not neutrality. This is complicity.
The children of Gaza are dying under bombs made in America, fired with impunity by an ally emboldened by silence. The so-called ""unshakable support"" for Israel has come to mean unshakable disregard for Palestinian lives. Human rights are not divisible. You do not get to mourn one child and ignore another because of the flag they died under.
And now, the shadow of a broader war is no longer looming — it has begun. With Israeli strikes already hitting Iran, what was once framed as ""pre-emptive defence"" now risks spiralling into a regional conflict far beyond Gaza's borders. The US administration warns against escalation, even as it green-lights the conditions for it. The world sees this contradiction, and so do the grieving families of Gaza. They understand that the line between indifference and endorsement is thin, and America has crossed it long since.
What is the value of diplomacy, of human rights, of law when the most vulnerable can be massacred and the world's superpower defends the machinery that kills them?
This is not about denying Israel's right to exist or to defend itself. This is about denying any state the right to kill children and call it security. This is about recognising that US policy is not abstract — it has blood on it. Every weapon shipment, every veto at the UN, every statement that calls a massacre ""regrettable"" instead of ""unacceptable"" sends a message that some lives matter more than others. And yet, the world still watches.
Hope feels thin in Gaza. But if there is to be any hope at all, it must begin with truth. It must begin with the courage to call things by their name. What is happening to Palestinian children is not just war — it is the consequence of decades of political shielding, of selective outrage, of using human lives as pawns in geopolitical games.
If the world has any conscience left, it must act. Not tomorrow. Now. Because every time we look away, another small grave is dug. And history will ask not only who did this, but who let it happen.

PSX closes flat over Israel-Iran tensions,"US
Profit-taking erases early advances; index holds 120,000 level
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed flat on Friday as investors remained cautious amid ongoing uncertainty about the Israel-Iran conflict.
After opening on a positive note, driven by reports that the Trump administration may delay its decision on taking action in the Middle East by two weeks, the benchmark KSE-100 index touched the intra-day high of 120,829 points. However, it later succumbed to profit-taking, settling marginally higher by 21 points at 120,023. Key support at the 120k level held firm throughout the week despite volatile sessions.
""Stocks closed lower on fears of an escalation in Middle East tensions,"" said Ahsan Mehanti, Managing Director of Arif Habib Corp. Weak rupee and a slump in global equities fuelled panic selling at the PSX, he said.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index posted a slight gain of 20.65 points, or 0.02%, and settled at 120,023.24.
Topline Securities, in its review, wrote that the KSE-100 index, after opening on a positive note, traded in the positive zone for most part of the session on news that the Trump administration had decided to exercise restraint and would decide on US action in the Israel-Iran conflict within two weeks. However, due to the lack of confidence, the index came down during latter hours to close flat at 120,023, up 0.02%.
Top positive contribution to the index came from Hub Power, Systems Limited, UBL, OGDC, Maple Leaf Cement and Pakistan Petroleum as they cumulatively added 168 points. On the flip side, top negative contributors were Pakgen Power, TRG Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Pakistan Services, Engro Fertilisers and MCB Bank, which erased 180 points from the index, Topline said.
""It was another volatile session that ended with thin change,"" noted Ali Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Limited, as the benchmark index closed marginally higher at 120,023 (+21 points). It is pertinent to note that the 120k level has so far proved to be a saviour throughout the week.
He pointed out that the market opened on a positive note, driven by media reports suggesting a possible de-escalation in the Israel-Iran conflict. However, profit-taking in the final hour, ahead of the weekend, erased early gains as short-term investors squared off their positions, Najib added.
Mubashir Anis Naviwala of JS Global commented that the market started the session on a weak note, with sentiment remaining cautious throughout the day. After touching the intra-day high of 120,829, the index dropped to the low of 119,872 amid profit-taking.
However, the positive takeaway was that the index managed to close above the 120,000 psychological mark, he said.
Overall trading volumes were recorded at 421.6 million shares compared with the previous tally of 604.5 million. The value of shares traded was Rs15.7 billion. Shares of 468 companies were traded. Of these, 178 stocks closed higher, 245 fell and 45 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 42.8 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs1.45. It was followed by TRG Pakistan with 26.7 million shares, losing Rs5.12 to close at Rs56.68 and Pervez Ahmed Consultancy with 25.5 million shares, losing Rs0.25 to close at Rs2.84. During the day, foreign investors sold shares worth Rs69.3 million, according to the NCCPL.

Fuel and food items lift SPI by 0.27%,"US
Short-term inflation extends upward trend but annual reading eases 2.06%
The Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) for the week ended June 19, 2025 recorded an increase of 0.27% compared to the previous week, driven by higher prices of key food and energy items, according to data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).
Notable weekly increases were seen in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, up 14.86%), potatoes (3.75%), diesel (3.10%), gur (2.25%), chicken (2.17%), sugar (2.13%), petrol (1.88%), mustard oil (1.12%), powdered milk (0.97%), broken Basmati rice (0.84%), cooked daal (0.68%) and prepared tea (0.39%).
Conversely, prices declined for eggs (-9.53%), tomatoes (-5.62%), garlic (-1.03%), pulse gram (-0.35%), 2.5kg vegetable ghee (-0.17%), five-litre cooking oil (-0.03%) and bananas and firewood (-0.01% each).
Out of 51 essential items monitored across 50 markets in 17 cities, prices of 23 items rose, eight fell and 20 remained unchanged.
On a year-on-year (YoY) basis, the SPI showed a decrease of 2.06%, with major drops in prices of onions (-63.22%), tomatoes (-56.11%), electricity charges for Q1 (-41.63%), garlic (-32.58%), pulse mash (-19.09%) and potatoes (-17.97%). However, significant annual increases were recorded in ladies' sandals (+55.62%), pulse moong (+28.90%), sugar (+26.19%), powdered milk (+25.93%) and LPG (+21.77%).
The weekly SPI serves as a key tool to gauge short-term price movements in essential commodities and to monitor inflationary trends across the country.
The SPI has shown mixed trends in recent weeks, with slight fluctuations influenced by petroleum price revisions and market demand dynamics. After experiencing declines earlier in May, the SPI has been gradually inching upwards since late May, indicating renewed inflationary pressures in both food and energy segments, according to data compiled by Optimus Capital Management.
Market observers suggest that the coming weeks may witness further volatility depending on global commodity prices and domestic supply conditions. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) noted that inflation was expected to trend up and stabilise in the target range during FY26.
JS Global Research Head Muhammad Waqas Ghani noted that following a 3.5% YoY increase in May 2025, the monthly Consumer Price Index (CPI) was expected to stand at 3.1% in June.
The base effect is now fading, signalling a return to normalised price trends. This will take the FY25 average to 4.6%, down from the FY24 average of 23.9%.
Food inflation for June 2025 is expected to rise 2.8% on a YoY basis, which was 0.97% last year, owing to the dissipation of base effect. Nevertheless, price decreases in certain food items are likely to lead to a month-on-month (MoM) decline in food inflation. Housing, gas and electricity segment is projected to post a 4% YoY decline in June, primarily due to a reduction in electricity tariffs.
Core inflation is expected to clock in around 8.5% YoY in June 2025. It is pertinent to note that core inflation, which excludes food and energy items, has remained around 9-10% for the past many months. Urban core inflation was registered at 7.3% in May while rural core inflation was reported at 8.8%.

Woman chokes husband to death,"US
.
A woman killed her husband by strangling him to death with the help of her paramour in Madina Town on Friday.
In a separate incident, a labourer lost his life after being hit on the head with a chair during a scuffle at a local mill.
Police said Humaira Bibi was having an affair with Shoaib alias Shebi, who had visited her at her residence in X Block, Madina Town.
When her husband, Muhammad Nawaz aged 45 arrived home, Humaira Bibi hid Shoaib in a room and later, along with him, she strangled her husband to death.
The police arrested Humaira Bibi, while Shoaib is still at large. The police have launched a manhunt to arrest the absconding accused.
In another account, a labourer named Abdul Razaq, 30, was beaten to death by his coworkers, including Ehsan Ullah, at a private mill in the jurisdiction of Chak Jhumra police station. As the altercation escalated, Ehsan Ullah along with three other accused persons allegedly assaulted Abdul Razaq, hitting him on the head with a chair.
The victim succumbed to his injuries and died on the spot.
Upon receiving information, the police arrived at the scene, took possession of the body, and shifted it to the hospital for post-mortem examination.
Meanwhile, the mystery surrounding the death of police constable Arshad Naveed has been solved.
The murder suspect has been arrested and confessed to killing the constable and throwing his body into the Saim Canal.

Water — not a bargaining chip,"US
.
In international diplomacy, some agreements are too foundational to tamper with. The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), signed in 1960, is one such rare pillar of stability between Pakistan and India. It has stood wars, diplomatic tensions and political changes. Now, however, with an alarming twist, India has unilaterally ""held it in abeyance"", an expression of elasticity with potentially disastrous results. This is not just a bureaucratic manoeuvre. It is an affront to legal norms, a threat to regional peace, and most gravely, a dangerous suggestion that water, the source of life, is now a bargaining chip.
Water is not optional for Pakistan. With more than 80% of its agricultural output relying on the Indus River system, and with already dwindling per capita water availability, any disruption to this flow is an existential threat. The provinces of Punjab and Sindh, which form the country's breadbasket, would face drought, economic paralysis and civil unrest. The consequences would not be limited to economic losses as it would increase inequalities, fuel provincial tensions and make an already unstable situation in the political arena much more complex.
The legal basis of the Indian claim of the treaty being in abeyance is weak and the first in history. There is no provision in the IWT allowing a suspension and anyway what due process has been adopted by India in its regard under the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties. Under Article 57 of the Convention, a treaty may be suspended only by mutual consent or within the framework of the treaty itself and neither of these applies here. Article 60 does allow for suspension if a material breach occurs which India has no proof of. In essence, India has invented a legal grey area to justify a political decision. It is a breach not only of treaty obligations but of the basic principles of international law.
To turn water into a pressure tactic is to reduce a humanitarian and ecological concern into a geopolitical lever. And once that precedent is set, it becomes dangerously difficult to undo. If water is fair game in power politics, what comes next?
This is why the global community cannot afford to stay neutral. South Asia is already one of the most water-stressed regions. Climate change is causing shrinking glaciers and monsoons slackening, and has been speeding the dearth of platforms. The IWT despite all its shortcomings was a paradigm of collaboration on common resources. Such an undermining not only destabilises Pakistan, but also sends the signal to other riparian basins in Africa, Latin America and Central Asia that a unilateral weaponisation of water security is possible.
Pakistan must act, but not recklessly. Although there is nothing wrong with citing India's shift as a possible casus belli, it has to first make all the diplomatic attempts. That involves appealing to the Security Council of the UN under Chapter VII of the UN Charter that specifically provides the possibility of interfering when there is a threat of peace.
Water, especially when controlled by one nuclear power over another, constitutes exactly that kind of threat. The P5 states must be reminded of their 1998 commitment to intervene if South Asia's stability is at risk. That moment is now.
This is not merely about sovereignty or national pride. It is about redefining what should be off-limits in conflict. Civilian water access cannot be a pawn in strategic calculus. Pakistan's response must reinforce this principle, legally and morally. Because if this treaty falls, the damage will go far beyond the Indus Basin — it will corrode the very idea of principled diplomacy.
Water sustains life; it should never be used to choke it. The IWT is not a perfect document, but it is a symbol of what diplomacy can achieve even between enemies. To treat it as a bargaining chip is to abandon that legacy and to gamble with peace itself.

FTO prevents taxmen from sealing retail shops,"SG
Directs FBR to fix Point-of-Sale system glitches, train field officers
In a major relief for tier-I retailers, the Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO) has issued a comprehensive ruling in favour of the formal retail sector, directing the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to stop sealing shops and address critical technical issues in the Point-of-Sale (POS) system.
A complaint, filed by the Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP), highlighted serious concerns including POS system failures, excessive integration costs, profile disconnections, missing invoice uploads and the lack of coordination between the FBR and its automation wing – Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited (PRAL).
The FTO has directed that no sealing of tier-I retail outlets should be carried out until all technical issues were fully addressed. It recommended the FBR to consult CAP on future POS-related glitches and enforcement strategies to ensure mutual resolution of issues and smoother compliance.
The FTO ruling strongly criticised the lack of technical training among FBR's field officers, noting their inability to resolve system-specific issues, and advised enhanced coordination with PRAL.
""The FBR is instructed to develop a forewarning system for tier-I retailers to inform them about POS disconnections, token expiry or auto shutdowns in order to avoid abrupt disruptions,"" it said.
The FTO recommended that POS security tokens should not expire before five years, with prior intimation to the retailer. The lack of a bulk download feature in the POS system – a longstanding concern among retailers – was acknowledged by the FBR, which submitted the Change Request Form. The FTO emphasised its urgent application.
The ruling confirmed that invoices frequently failed to sync with FBR servers and retailers faced ""fake disconnect"" errors, though the system was running. The FBR attributed that to substandard software, but the FTO stressed the need to resolve such issues technically and administratively.

Iran rejects nuclear talks with US,"PK
Iran rejects nuclear talks with US
Iran said on Friday it would not resume nuclear negotiations with the United States until Israel halts its attacks, as Israel's military chief warned the week-old war will be ""prolonged"".
A series of blasts were heard in Tehran on Friday as Iran's Fars news agency said air defences had been activated, as Israel kept up its bombardment and Iran launched missiles at its arch enemy.
""We must be ready for a prolonged campaign,"" Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir told Israelis in a video statement, eight days after his country launched a massive wave of strikes it said were aimed at stopping Iran from developing nuclear weapons — an ambition Tehran has denied.
""The campaign is not over. Although we have made significant achievements, difficult days still lie ahead,"" he said.
As US President Donald Trump mulls the prospect of entering the war between the two foes, top diplomats from Britain, France and Germany met with their Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi in Geneva.
Referring to nuclear negotiations with Washington that had been derailed by the war, Araghchi said after the meeting that ""Iran is ready to consider diplomacy once again and once the aggression is stopped"".
Tehran did ""support the continuation of discussion with"" the European countries and was willing ""to meet again in the near future"", Araghchi told reporters.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said ""we invited the Iranian minister to consider negotiations with all sides, including the United States, without awaiting the cessation of strikes, which we also hope for"".
Barrot said there ""can be no definitive solution through military means to the Iran nuclear problem"" and warned that it was ""dangerous to want to impose a regime change"" in Iran, after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not rule out killing supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
On the streets of Tehran, many shops were closed and normally busting markets largely abandoned on Friday, an AFP journalist reported.
""I'm not afraid of the war, I stay open but business is really bad,"" said a vendor at the Tajrish market who declined to give his name for security reasons.
Nearby, police set up a checkpoint while workers repaired a road damaged in a recent Israeli strike.
Since Israel launched its offensive on June 13, targeting nuclear and military sites but also hitting residential areas, Iran has responded with barrages which Israeli authorities say have killed at least 25 people.
A hospital in the Israeli port of Haifa reported 19 injured, including one person in serious condition, after the latest Iranian salvo.
More than 450 missiles have been fired at the country so far, along with about 400 drones, according to Israel's National Public Diplomacy Directorate.
Iran said on Sunday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 224 people, including military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. It has not updated the toll since.
A US-based NGO, the Human Rights Activists News Agency, provided a toll on Friday based on sources and media reports, saying at least 657 people have been killed in Iran, including 263 civilians.
Israel's military said it struck missile launchers in southwestern Iran after overnight air raids on dozens of targets including a nuclear research centre.
In Israel, sirens sounded in the afternoon after missiles were launched from Iran for the second time on Friday. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had targeted military sites and air force bases.
Trump said on Thursday he will decide ""within the next two weeks"" whether to involve the United States in the fighting.
A US Navy official said Friday that an aircraft carrier will be moved closer to the Middle East next week, making it the third in or near the region.
""This is a perilous moment, and it is hugely important that we don't see regional escalation of this conflict,"" said Britain's Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who earlier stated ""Iran can never develop or acquire a nuclear weapon"".
Western governments suspect Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability.
The International Atomic Energy Agency said that while Iran is the only country without nuclear weapons to enrich uranium to 60 percent, there was no evidence it had all the components to make a functioning nuclear warhead.
""So, saying how long it would take for them, it would be pure speculation because we do not know whether there was somebody... secretly pursuing these activities,"" the agency's chief Rafael Grossi told CNN.
""We haven't seen that and we have to say it.""
In an interview with German publication Bild, Israel's top diplomat Gideon Saar said he did not ""particularly"" believe in diplomacy with Iran.
""All diplomatic efforts so far have failed,"" said Saar, whose country had supported Trump's 2018 decision to abandon a previous nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the escalating confrontation is quickly reaching ""the point of no return"", saying ""this madness must end as soon as possible"".
UN chief Antonio Guterres meanwhile pleaded with all sides to ""give peace a chance"".
Any US involvement in Israel's campaign would be expected to involve the bombing of an underground uranium enrichment facility in Fordo, using powerful bunker-busting bombs that no other country possesses.
Switzerland announced it was temporarily closing its embassy in Tehran, adding that it would continue to fulfil its role representing US interests in Iran.

SHC orders opening of Governor House for acting governor,"US
Principal secretary informs court governor is abroad and took keys with him
The Constitutional Bench of the Sindh High Court (SHC), comprising Justice K.K. Agha and Justice Adnan-ul-Karim Memon, heard Acting Governor Owais Qadir Shah's petition challenging the locking of Governor House offices.
The court ordered the immediate reopening of these offices and directed the principal secretary to submit a compliance report by June 23.
During the urgent hearing, the bench granted acting governor immediate access to the Sindh Governor's official residence. The court specifically ordered the unlocking of all offices (excluding private residential quarters) and restrained the principal secretary from obstructing the acting governor's access.
The court also directed that a copy of the judicial order be transmitted to the President of Pakistan and the Principal Secretary of the Governor's House, Sindh.
In the petition, it was averred that since assuming charge, the Acting Governor, Owais Qadir Shah, has been denied entry to the Governor's House for official duties which is a violation of Article 104 of the Constitution. Governor Kamran Tessori has been abroad since June 2.
Acting Governor of Sindh, Owais Qadir Shah, informed the court that a meeting on law and order in the was scheduled for today, specifically to discuss matters related to Muharram. The home minister, secretary, IG Sindh, and other officials reached for the meeting.
However, the principal secretary stated that the governor had taken the office keys with him. Owais Qadir Shah stated that this was an act of considering the Governor's House as their personal lounge.
He cited the Constitution, which clearly states that in the absence of the governor, the acting governor can perform duties.
Owais Qadir Shah said, he would write to the chief minister, highlighting that this was a mockery of the Constitution.

Art Basel opens to subdued market,"US
Global art sales continue to decline
The world's biggest art fair takes place in Switzerland this week, with global crises creating a more sombre mood, according to participants, and galleries showing less expensive works amid a slump at the top end of the art market.
A fixture since 1970, Art Basel is widely viewed as a key barometer for the health of global art sales.
Works by over 4,000 artists are on show, including a Pablo Picasso painting valued at over $30 million shown by US gallery Pace.
Global art sales fell 12 per cent last year, the second annual decline in a row, according to a report by UBS. The drop was particularly sharp at the top end - defined as works selling at auction for over $10 million - where sales tumbled by 39 per cent.
""It's true the galleries are bringing material that is in a different price point to what it used to be,"" said Vincenzo de Bellis, Chief Artistic Officer and Global Director of Art Basel Fairs. ""And it's natural, there's a different expectation.""
One artwork had sold for between $13-17 million by Wednesday, the only one to fetch at least $10 million over the first two days, sales confirmed by exhibitors show. Last year, four pieces worth $10-20 million sold during the same period.
""I think the mood is very subdued,"" said Gaurav Madhok, a visitor from London who has been going for over 12 years.
More than five gallery representatives said there were fewer American clients at stalls than in previous years.
A separate UBS report showed a 4.6 per cent jump in private individuals' wealth in 2024, with the US faring especially well, creating over 1,000 new dollar millionaires daily.
""We've seen a lot of European curators,"" said Georgia Lurie, a director of the Pippy Houldsworth gallery. ""But Americans are thin on the ground, both collectors and museum people.""

The sugar swindle,"US
.
The sweetener has left sourness with the customers. The incongruous decision of the federal government to export sugar and then import it back is being pondered by the hapless nation with their jaws dropped. Either the authorities are too naïve to understand the mechanics of basic economics, or they are obsessed with vested interests.
This is not the first time that a sugar scam is on the cards. Rather, it has become a modus operandi of successive governments to appease the sugar mafia — especially the mill owners and those who share the booty in the ruling clique — by playing with the support price of the sugarcane crop, then manipulating the raw and processed cost of sugar, and finally throwing it to the wolves at the altar of national interests.
This time again, the government has decided to import 750,000 metric tonnes of sugar that it had itself sold in the international market under a mysterious calculus. The product was sold at a price tag of Rs114 billion, and no one is sure what amount of foreign exchange it will incur to bring it back home. Such lopsided decisions are a crime, per se, and must warrant retribution.
Surprisingly, the swift manner in which the proposition and the entire decision-making process receive prompt passage from all stakeholders is enough to raise eyebrows, and warrants a national debate and inquiry. As far as the commoner is concerned, it leads to inflation, apart from torpedoing the domestic supply chain. This gimmick has led to a rise in sugar prices, and now the commodity is being sold at Rs190 per kilogram — a staggering Rs50 higher than the pre-export price. Yet the Ministry of National Food Security has the audacity to claim that there are sufficient stocks, and that imports were meant to lower prices!
This annually enacted swindle, meant to hoodwink the nation, is a curse. While the country has a total annual consumption of 6.4 million tonnes, it must ensure that appropriate stocks are guaranteed before any ambitious decision to export is taken — with due public endorsement. A valve to involve the consumers is indispensable to put a stop to such scams happening right under the official eyes and ears.

Omar warns of oil shock from conflict,"DE
.
Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan has warned that the ongoing Iran-Israel war will shake the global economy as Iran and Kuwait hold the world's largest oil wells.
Speaking at a press conference, the PTI leader described Israel's onslaught on Iran as a terrorist attack, lamenting that the Iranian leadership was attacked that plays an important role.
He said the world consumes 104 million barrels of oil per day. If anything happens in the aftermath of the conflict, strategic reserves would last only about 12 days.

Mexico's Chicano style meets Japan's Harajuku,"US
Designer's fusion sparks buzz
In a leafy park in Mexico City, beside colonial era fountains and food stands, Italia Segovia's designs are turning heads, as usual.
A pink ruffled dress with white lace and big bow; a high-school vibe tartan dress tied with a pale yellow shawl imprinted with Mexico's patron saint the Virgin of Guadalupe, all accentuated with loud heavy makeup.
Segovia, known to her friends as Kumiko, calls her work Chicanjuku: a fusion of Mexican-American Chicano culture and Japanese Harajuku style, named after the Tokyo district renowned for its bright colored accessories, outlandish makeup, and elaborate hairstyles.
""It's like a food blender of styles,"" Segovia said of her designs, which have also become a core part of her identity.
Chicano style was popularised by Mexican-Americans in the US who felt out of place in both countries because of their mixed backgrounds, said Segovia. Though she is not Mexican-American, she has several relatives in the US who inspired her deep love for the style she now draws from.
Segovia, who has almost 30 thousand followers on Instagram, mashes the oversize shirts, khakis and flat brim caps analogous to Chicano culture with the candy-floss fairy-tale pop of Harajuku. The makeup might include dark lining around the lips and eyeliner that emulates Japanese Geisha style.
""You can always experiment with fashion and art as long as it's from a place of knowledge and respect,"" Segovia said.
Segovia's distinctive aesthetic has even caught the eye of admirers in Japan. In June, she made special outfits for three Japanese E-Queens, a subculture of electronic music dancers, who she connected with months earlier online.
The group met up in Mexico City for a photo shoot and street dance, dressed in Segovia's outfits.
""I love how she uses texture,"" said Shirendev Oyun-Erdenen, a Japanese E-Queen who dances under the name Maaya the Bee.
""Helping people feel free to experiment and not be afraid. That's what it's all about,"" Segovia said. Reuters

CB mulls SC powers for 'complete justice',"DE
Raja replied that he would explain this in detail later.
Some members of a constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court raised a number of questions with regard to the SC's powers to ensure ""complete justice"". They also asked how non allocations of reserved seats to the PTI could be called a violation of fundamental rights.
PTI leader Kanwal Shauzab's counsel Salman Akram Raja on Friday resumed his arguments in support of the SC's July 12 majority order in the reserved seats case before the 11-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan that is hearing review petitions against the verdict.
Raja, in his arguments, stated that it is the responsibility of this court to protect fundamental rights and this responsibility is assigned to it by the Constitution.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail asked Raja as to how Article 187 applies in this case.
Article 187(1) gives the Supreme Court the power to issue any order or direction necessary for doing complete justice in any case pending before it while Article 187(2) gives it the powers as a civil court to enforce its decisions, including issuing orders to any person or authority.
Raja replied that he would explain this in detail later. He said the Supreme Court has broader authority and can use Article 187 together with Article 184 to deliver complete justice.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether Article 184(3) is used in public interest cases.
Salman Akram Raja responded in the affirmative. He said the SC can use Article 184(3) for public interest and fundamental rights. ""When there is destruction or crisis, one does not ask which article appliesthen the Supreme Court must step forward and do what is necessary.""
Justice Mandokhail asked whether, if a constitutional violation occurs but no specific article applies, the SC should still take action. The lawyer said in such a situation, the SC should do whatever is necessary.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar noted that Article 199 cannot be read together with Article 187. He remarked that under Article 199, the high court has powers that even the Supreme Court does not possess.
Article 199 of the Constitution outlines the writ jurisdiction of the high courts. It empowers high courts to issue various writs (orders) to enforce fundamental rights and ensure lawful conduct by authorities.
Justice Salahuddin Panhwar asked what, in his view, are the limits of the Supreme Court's powers. Justice Jamal Mandokhail said, ""My brother judge suggests that there must be some limit to the powers. Does the Supreme Court have unlimited powers in every case?""
He then asked whether any constitutional or legal violation occurred in the majority decision of the reserved seats case. Salman Akram Raja said, ""There was no overreach in the Supreme Court's decision.""
Justice Mandokhail remarked that the Constitution itself gives parties the right to join within three days. Justice Aminuddin Khan interjected.

Ton-up Jaiswal makes Eng toil in first Test,"US
India 215-2 at tea in Headingley with Gill unbeaten at 58
India's Yashasvi Jaiswal marked his first Test innings in England with a superb century and captain Shubman Gill hit an unbeaten fifty as the tourists took control of the series opener at Headingley on Friday.
India dominated the bulk of the morning's play after being sent into bat, only to lose two wickets in quick succession as they ended the session on 92-2.
By tea on the first day of the opening Test in a five-match series, India were firmly back in control on 215-2, with 23-year-old opener Jaiswal 100 not out.
Gill, in his first innings as skipper since succeeding the retired Rohit Sharma, was also in fine form on 58 not out.
The pair had so far shared an unbroken partnership of 123 in 25.2 overs, with India going through the second session without losing a wicket.
England captain Ben Stokes' decision to bowl, which may have been influenced by the fact the last six Tests at Headingley have all been won by the team batting second, meant England did not have to face India's star paceman Jasprit Bumrah at the start of the match.
It also gave England a chance to strike an early blow against an India top order without experienced batsmen Rohit and Virat Kohli after the pair retired from Test cricket within days of each other last month.
But an England attack without retired greats James Anderson and Stuart Broad and missing injured express quicks Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, rarely threatened on a good pitch.
Chris Woakes, sidelined by an ankle problem earlier in the season, returned to take the new ball in place of the injured Gus Atkinson, with Brydon Carse given a home debut in the other change to the England side that beat Zimbabwe recently.
Jaiswal and Rahul seized on anything loose as India made a stylish start to their quest for just a fourth Test series win in England after their triumphs in 1971, 1986 and 2007.
With India's openers approaching a century partnership, England made a double strike.
Rahul, on 42, drove loosely at a wide ball from Carse and edged to Joe Root at first slip
Moments later, number three Sai Sudharsan joined the long list of batsmen who have made a duck on Test debut when a glance off Stokes was well caught by diving wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.
But India's third-wicket duo seized back the momentum with a century stand full of sublime stroke-play.
Gill was especially severe on Woakes as he on-drove and cut the all-rounder for commanding boundaries before completing a 56-ball fifty — his quickest in Tests —- with a pulled four off Josh Tongue.
Stokes brought on Shoaib Bashir to add variety to his attack but the off-spinner's first ball was cuffed through the covers for four by Jaiswal. Jaiswal appeared to suffer several bouts of cramp before he went to 99 with two superb boundaries off Carse.
A quick single took an elated Jaiswal to a 144-ball hundred, including 16 fours, as he completed his fifth century in 20 Tests and third against England.
Before play both teams and the match officials observed a minute's silence in memory of the victims of an Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad that killed all but one of 242 people on board, with players also wearing black armbands as a mark of respect.

Govt seeks input for NEV policy implementation,"US
PM aide says policy can reduce 4.5m tonnes of CO2 emissions, save $1b in oil imports
The government has started seeking feedback on the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Policy 2025-30, which is a key step towards implementation of the draft policy termed not just an environmental commitment but also an economic imperative.
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan addressed a dissemination and feedback workshop on Pakistan's NEV Policy 2025-30, where he highlighted it as a milestone in the country's journey towards a cleaner, greener and more sustainable transport future.
He stated that the NEV Policy was a vital component of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vision to ensure that 30% of all new vehicle sales were electric by 2030. He emphasised that the policy was not just an environmental commitment but also an economic imperative.
He noted that implementation of the NEV Policy could reduce up to 4.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, save $1 billion in annual oil imports and help avoid Rs405 billion in health-related costs. Moreover, the policy will enable productive use of 126 terawatt hours (TWh) of surplus electricity, which would otherwise go to waste.
To encourage EV adoption, the government is offering consumer subsidies including Rs65,000 for electric two-wheelers, Rs400,000 for electric three-wheelers and Rs15,000 per kilowatt-hour for electric four-wheelers.
Additionally, 40 fast charging stations are expected to become operational on highways by the end of 2025, improving infrastructure for EV users. Haroon Akhtar announced that provinces were being encouraged to offer free NEV registration to support nationwide adoption.
He emphasised the policy's role in promoting industrial growth and local manufacturing, noting that 57 local manufacturing certificates had been issued and over 90% localisation for electric motorcycles and rickshaws had already been achieved.
International players are showing growing interest in Pakistan's NEV sector, which Akhtar described as a positive signal for foreign investment and technology transfer.

Governor House's locks cause uproar in PA,"BG
Treasury benches take strong exception to acting governor being denied full access to Governor House
The Sindh Assembly continued the general discussion on the provincial budget for the upcoming fiscal year on Friday. Both members of the assembly and provincial ministers participated in the debate, briefing the house on the performance of their respective departments and future plans.
During the session, presided over by Deputy Speaker Anthony Naveed, concerns were raised about the restrictions on access of acting governor to the Governor House.
Minister for Parliamentary Affairs, Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, informed the house that Speaker Awais Qadir Shah, who has been acting governor for 22 days, was not allowed to enter the Governor House or perform his duties.
Lanjhar revealed that Governor Kamran Tessori had sealed the offices and taken the keys to Saudi Arabia, prompting the speaker to approach the court, which ordered the offices to be reopened. Reading out the court order in the assembly, Lanjar sarcastically remarked that while Tessori claims to open the Governor House to the public, it is closed to the province's acting governor.
The minister appealed to the Chief Minister to take action against those responsible, as per the court's orders.
Former Speaker Agha Siraj Durrani criticised Tessori for restricting Acting Governor from performing his duties. Durrani stated that the Speaker's authority was disrespected and demanded that Tessori should follow the constitution and apologize to the Sindh Assembly.
Senior parliamentarian Nisar Ahmed Khoro also condemned the Governor's actions, maintaining that the country and assembly run according to the constitution. He questioned the Governor's authority over the Governor's House, calling it a symbol of occupation rather than governance.
He questioned the Governor's motives, suggesting that the Governor's House is not a personal property but a public institution. Khoro demanded that a resolution be passed in the Sindh Assembly to address this issue.
MQM-P MPA Taha Ahmed argued that the incident involving the acting governor was a result of a misunderstanding and lack of communication. He said that the party respects the office of the acting governor and believes that the issue should not be politicized.
He expressed pride in being part of the community that values its heritage and history. In the same session, Minister Ali Hassan Zardari shed light on the government's efforts in infrastructure development, announcing 48 new schemes in the upcoming budget.

Senate session turns critical over budget,"US
Lawmakers slam lack of minority welfare, Balochistan neglect
The federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26 came under fire in the Senate on Friday, with lawmakers from both treasury and opposition benches denouncing it.
Issues affecting minority communities in Sindh and the ongoing situation in Balochistan also featured prominently in the session.
The house, chaired by Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasir, briefly witnessed a boycott by opposition members due to the absence of any minister.
Debate on the budget resumed after the arrival of Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Chaudhry.
Senator Dinesh Kumar highlighted the alleged kidnapping of three girls and a boy from the minority community in Sindh. ""It is being heard that these girls were being forcibly converted,"" he told the house, urging the Sindh police chief to take immediate notice of the incident.
Responding, the deputy chairman directed the Sindh chief secretary and inspector general of police to submit a report and further instructed that the officers meet Senator Kumar to address his concerns.
Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Senator Waqar Mehdi informed the house that ""the girls had been recovered"" and would be presented before the relevant court in Karachi. He assured that ""there would be no discrimination against minorities"".
Maulana Attaur Rehman endorsed Senator Kumar's concerns and called for accountability from the Sindh government. Senator Raja Nasir Abbas added: ""There is no compulsion in religion and kidnapping of girls is wrong.""
Senator Khalil Tahir Sindhu pointed out that the budget contained no allocations for minorities or interfaith harmony. The deputy chairman responded by advising him to take up the matter within his own party, since he belonged to the ruling coalition.
Senator Khaleda Ateeb raised the issue of a tragic dumper accident in Karachi that claimed the lives of a woman and her daughter. ""Why is the dumper mafia so strong in Karachi?"" she asked.
Senator Mehdi replied that the provincial government was making efforts to enforce traffic laws.
Senator Jan Muhammad Buledi urged the government to play a greater role in efforts to stop the Iran-Israel conflict. He warned that ""Israel wanted to change the government in Iran and bring its puppets there"".
He also criticised the budget for ignoring Balochistan, saying: ""Balochistan cannot be ignored. We should have had a plan to fix the situation in Balochistan. Take Balochistan seriously.""
In response, Law Minister Tarar reiterated that Balochistan was a high priority for the government and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.

COAS makes pitch for trade with US,"BE
Urges Washington to view Islamabad through its own lens
Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir has said that Pakistan does not seek security assistance or aid from the United States, but rather trade, investment and mutual respect.
Speaking at a closed-door session with senior scholars, policy experts, analysts and representatives of leading international media outlets in Washington, the army chief praised President Donald Trump as ""one of the greatest and fantastic leaders"", a day after their landmark meeting at the White House.
""We want to be treated with respect and dignity,"" Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by several participants of the session, who spoke to The Express Tribune on condition of anonymity.
According to at least three attendees, the army chief addressed a wide range of issues, including Pakistan-US bilateral ties, counter-terrorism, economic challenges, internal social dynamics, and the country's democratic journey. His candid and confident tone impressed many in the room.
""This was a different Asim Munir than the one we saw during his first visit to Washington,"" said one participant. ""He was more composed, self-assured and spoke without notes for over an hour. Last time, he barely made an opening statement.""
Contrary to narratives often pushed by India, attendees noted that Field Marshal Munir did not display any inclination towards radical or religious extremism.
Instead, he referenced a historic speech by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah emphasizing equal rights for all citizens, regardless of religion, caste, or creed.
On foreign relations, he asserted that Pakistan's ties with China and the United States are not mutually exclusive. ""China has never asked us to limit our engagement with the US,"" he stated, urging Washington to view Pakistan through its own lens and not through the prism of China, India or Afghanistan.
The army chief also addressed democratic development in Pakistan, acknowledging that while Pakistan may not have achieved an ideal democracy yet, it aspires to build a democratic system modeled on strong institutions like those in the United States.
When asked about his two-hour-long meeting with President Trump, the field marshal declined to share specific details but described the interaction as ""fantastic,"" praising Trump's ""global vision"" and ""strategic clarity.""
Touching on the volatile Middle East situation, Field Marshal Munir called for diplomacy and peaceful resolution of the Israel-Iran conflict. He also highlighted the destabilizing role India has played in the region, accusing New Delhi of supporting proxy groups to foment unrest inside Pakistan.
Overall, observers described the engagement as one of the most candid and strategically focused interactions by a Pakistani military leader in recent memory.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the ISPR said the interaction with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan's principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan's strategic outlook.
In his remarks, the Chief of Army Staff highlighted Pakistan's unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order.
The field marshal eluded to the details and analysis of the Maarka-e-Haq, Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and elaborated on Pakistan's perspective on terrorism, noting the malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare.
The COAS emphasised that Pakistan has been on the front lines of the global war against terrorism, having rendered immense sacrifices — both human and economic — in pursuit of a safer and more secure world.
Field Marshal Asim Munir shed light on Pakistan's remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of information technology, agriculture, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the mining and mineral sectors. He invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in these sectors to unlock shared prosperity.
The army chief also provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan's balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law. He reaffirmed that Pakistan continues to play a responsible and proactive role in mitigating regional tensions and promoting cooperative security frameworks.
The discussion further included an evaluation of the long-standing Pakistan-US partnership. The COAS underlined the historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counter-terrorism, regional security, and economic development. He underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence.
Participants noted the openness and clarity of the COAS's perspectives and appreciated Pakistan's consistent and principled policies. The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States.
This engagement reflects Pakistan's commitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue.

Thousands protest against Israel,"US
Rallies taken out in Tehran, Baghdad and Beirut
Thousands of people rallied in Tehran, Baghdad and Beirut on Friday after weekly prayers to protest Israel's strikes on Iran, chanting slogans against Israel and its main backer, the United States.
Images on Iran's state television showed protesters in Tehran holding up photographs of commanders killed since the start of the war, while others waved the flags of Iran and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
""This is the Friday of the Iranian nation's solidarity and resistance across the country,"" the news anchor said.
""I will sacrifice my life for my leader,"" read a protester's banner, referring to Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
According to state television, protests took place in other cities around the country, including in Tabriz in northwestern Iran and Shiraz in the south.
Last week, Israel launched a blistering attack on Iran, prompting Tehran to retaliate with barrages of missiles aimed at Israel.
Mohammad Javad Haj Ali Akbari, the Imam leading Tehran's prayers, told worshippers that Israel had attacked Iran out of ""despair"", the official IRNA news agency reported.
He accused Israel of launching a ""psychological war"" to ""pit the people of the country against the government"".
""Their plans were precise, but their calculations were laughable,"" the Imam said.
With warnings of all-out regional war intensifying, fears are growing over an intervention by Iran-backed Iraqi factions, who have threatened Washington's interests in the region if it were to join Israel in its war against Iran.
In Iraq, thousands of supporters of powerful cleric Moqtada Sadr rallied after Friday prayers in Baghdad and other cities, AFP correspondents said.
Sadr, who has previously criticised Tehran-backed Iraqi armed factions, retains a devoted following of millions among Iraq's majority community of Shiite Muslims.
""No to Israel! No to America!"" chanted demonstrators gathered in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, the cleric's stronghold in the capital. ""It is an unjust war... Israel has no right"" to hit Iran, said protester Abu Hussein.
""Israel is not in it for the (Iranian) nuclear (programme). What Israel and the Americans want is to dominate the Middle East,"" added the 54-year-old taxi driver. In the city of Kufa, protesters set fire to Israeli and American flags.
Iraq is both a significant ally of Iran and a strategic partner of the United States.
In Lebanon, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters took to the streets in the group's stronghold in Beirut's southern suburbs. AFP

27 injured as track fault derails two trains,"US

At least 27 passengers were injured when two trains — Awam Express and Musa Pak Express — encountered a track fault while running between Khanewal and Mian Channu.
According to commuters, most of the injured suffered wounds to their arms and fingers.
Rescue 1122 teams provided immediate first aid to the victims upon their arrival at the Khanewal Station.
While the precise cause of the incident remains undetermined, passengers reported that those seated near the doors and windows were most affected by the impact.
According to sources, some unidentified individuals had allegedly attempted to steal a signal ladder installed along the railway track. Though they failed to detach it completely, the ladder was left misaligned, believed to be the likely cause of the mishap.
Pakistan Railways has since launched a formal inquiry into the incident to determine the exact cause and assess any security lapses.
Pakistan Railways recorded a total of 45 train-related incidents in the first six months of 2025, deepening concerns over the persistent safety and infrastructure challenges across the national railway network.

"Cabinet okays uplift, pension reforms","US
Clears Rs3.2b plan to procure 50 buses for BRT
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Cabinet, in its 34th meeting held on Friday under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, approved a series of development initiatives and administrative reforms aimed at strengthening infrastructure, healthcare, public service delivery, and pension management across the province.
One of the major decisions included the approval for procurement of 50 additional diesel-hybrid buses for the Peshawar Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system at a cost of Rs3.2 billion.
This move comes in response to the growing public demand and recent expansion of BRT routes from six to eight, including new routes DR-11, DR-13, and DR-14. With this addition, the BRT fleet will grow beyond the current 244 buses, improving service frequency and coverage.
The cabinet also approved the merger of four ADP scheme campuses of the ""ZamungKor"" Model Institute for State Children in Swat, DI Khan, Abbottabad, and Peshawar Girls Campus into the main Peshawar-based autonomous body. The merger aims to streamline operations and improve care for over 1,000 children currently enrolled across the facilities.
In a significant financial reform, the cabinet approved Pak Qatar Asset Management as the 13th asset management company under the Contributory Provident (CP) Fund Rules 2022. The CP Fund, introduced in 2015, is part of pension reforms shifting from an unfunded to a funded pension model, ensuring sustainability and investment of pension contributions through SECP-registered firms.
The cabinet passed several legal amendments, including revisions to the K-P Right to Public Services Act, 2014. The updates aim to enhance e-governance, coordination, and public accountability, while also introducing provisions for marginalized communities. Amendments were also made to Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Public Private Partnership Rules 2021, reducing the bidder response time from 60 to 30 days, to accelerate project delivery.
Health sector improvements were also prioritized, with the cabinet approving enhanced funding for several ongoing projects. These include an increase in cost for Balakot's Category-C Hospital from Rs575 million to Rs924.596 million, conversion of 50 rural health centers into 24/7 facilities (Rs1.7 billion), and upgrade of 200 Basic Health Units for round-the-clock maternal care (Rs2.96 billion). Additionally, a Rs346 million grant was sanctioned for modern equipment at Peshawar Institute of Cardiology.
The cabinet also approved a non-ADP scheme worth Rs124 million to resume salaries for Provincial Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Agency (PERRA) staff and directed the issuance of termination notices to contract employees from July 2025. Other approvals included financial assistance of Rs10 million for a cancer patient, appointment of Rubab Mehdi as K-P's Ombudsperson, and inclusion of Makniyal in Urban Area Development Authority Haripur.
Further allocations included Rs1.5 billion for transformer repair, Rs1.041 billion for settling PESCO dues, and Rs400 million for irrigation sector maintenance. The cabinet lifted a vehicle procurement ban to allow two official vehicles for District and Sessions Judges in Mohmand and Khyber and approved outsourcing of tobacco cess collection (excluding factories).
The cabinet also sanctioned the hiring of legal counsel for an anti-narcotics case in the Supreme Court and reviewed land utilization and timber trade mechanisms in Upper Kohistan and Chitral.

"Court settles conversion of three Hindu sisters, cousin","US
Allows adults to practise Islam, returns minors to parents
The controversy surrounding three Hindu sisters and their minor cousin who embraced Islam was settled in a court of law in Sanghar district on Friday apparently to the dismay of the parents.
The court allowed the two adult sisters to live independently and practice their new religion while the police was told to handover the minor sister and cousin to the parents with a condition that the two will not be coerced in the matter of religion.
The court set free the arrested computer teacher Farhan Khaskheli, who was blamed for allegedly kidnapping the complainants children at gunpoint and for compelling them to change religion, and his brother Zulfiqar Khaskheli. They, besides two others, were booked in an FIR lodged on June 18 on the parents' complaint.
The parents of Dashina Bai and Harjeet Kumar, whose Muslim names are Sidra and Abdul Rafay, were directed to submit an undertaking with a personal recognizance (PR) bond of Rs10 million each, assuring that they will not pressurize their children to revert to their old religion. ""... [a] person's religious belief isn't tangible and couldn't be seen or touched, as such faith is the matter of heart and conviction, therefore, no court could declare said conversion as invalid and void,"" the judge Asif Ali underlined.
The court further ordered the police to shift the adult sisters Jiya and Diya, who also renamed themselves as Mariam and Khadija, as well as the minors to Gosha-e-Aafiat Trust of Jamia Masjid Al-Falah in Karachi. The minors' custody will be given to the parents after they submit the PR bond.
During the hearing the three sisters and their male cousin deposed before the court that they accepted Islam without compulsion or greed. They also absolved the accused persons of the charges of kidnapping. ""The statements of 17 years old Dashina and 14 years old Harjeet have been recorded and both the minors have deposed that they have embraced Islam with their own free will,"" the judge noted.
Quoting verse number 256 of Surah Baqrah from the Holy book, the judge stated that Islam prohibited forced conversion. But he distinguished the case in question from the one in which element of force becomes evident.
""... it can't be out of the box to say that minors lacked legal capacity to abjure their religion and the change of religion didn't, ipso facto, deprive a parent of right to custody of a child and applicants being the real parents of minors are entitled to the custody.""
Three sisters and their cousin left their home and accepted Islam on June 18. The Hindu community reacted to the incident by alleging that their children have been kidnapped.
However, the sisters and their cousins released their video statements on social media, stating that they have embraced Islam. Still the police lodged a kidnapping FIR on the parents' complaint and on June 19 they recovered all the four from a shelter house near Katti Pahari area in Karachi and brought them back to Sanghar.
On Friday morning they all were produced before the concerned court to depose.

Alcaraz overcomes Munar to reach Queen's quarters,"US
The world number two defeated fellow Spaniard Munar in a marathon match
Top seed Carlos Alcaraz was pushed all the way by fellow-Spaniard Jaume Munar in a thrilling contest before clinching a 6-4 6-7(7) 7-5 win and advanced to the Queen's Club Championships quarter-finals on Thursday.
Alcaraz recently came out on top in an epic French Open final against Jannik Sinner, and while this second round clash in London may not have reached those same dizzying heights, the British crowd were served up an enthralling battle. The world number two was a break down in the deciding set but showed his strength once more as Alcaraz stretched his winning run to 15 matches, the longest streak of his career.
""It was a really tough battle that we had today,"" Alcaraz said after more than three hours on court.
""He's a great competitor and he showed how difficult it is to beat him.""
Alcaraz, the 2023 champion, looked well in control as he eased to take the opening set, and after saving four break and set points at 5-4 down in the second he forced Munar to a tiebreaker.
The pair traded early breaks with neither player holding serve over the first four points, before a Munar double fault allowed Alcaraz to take a 5-4 lead. He smashed an ace but then hit a double fault of his own on match point.
Munar made him pay this time to force a deciding set.
After Alcaraz went 2-0 up, the French Open champion was broken in his next two service games and Munar went into a 4-2 lead.
Alcaraz, however, was not done yet, and two more breaks of serve sealed a hard-earned victory as he continued his preparations for Wimbledon, where the Spaniard will be aiming to complete a hat-trick of triumphs.
""I'm proud of the level I showed today. It's my second match on grass this year,"" Alcaraz said.
""There were moments I struggled a lot mentally and physically. I still don't know how I'm standing here. But I'm really happy I've given myself another chance in the quarter-finals.""
Alcaraz will face French lucky loser Arthur Rinderknech after his 7-5 7-6(3) win over American Reilly Opelka. Rinderknech has lost both previous meetings with Alcaraz, the last loss coming at Queen's in 2023.
British number two Jacob Fearnley reached his first ATP Tour quarter-final with a 6-3 2-6 6-2 win over French qualifier Corentin Moutet.

Trump endorses Pakistan's rise as a regional stabiliser,"US
White House luncheon for Field Marshal Asim Munir marks a major reset in bilateral ties
The White House luncheon hosted by US President Donald Trump for Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday marked more than just a routine meeting — it signalled a major reset in US-Pakistan relations.
This major reset in the relations between the two countries includes a permanent and enduring bilateral partnership, such as cooperation in counter-terrorism, mutual trade in mines and minerals, and cryptocurrency.
President Trump's praise for Pakistani political and military leadership, particularly Field Marshal Asim Munir, during his press conference after the meeting, clearly reflects the world's growing confidence in the strong leadership and decision-making of the Pakistani leadership.
Donald Trump hosted Field Marshal Asim Munir at an unprecedented White House luncheon on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters at the Oval Office following the meeting, Trump said he was ""honoured"" to meet Field Marshal Asim.
Trump said that the primary reason for hosting Pakistan's army chief was to ""thank"" him for avoiding further escalation with India in May and helping bring an end to tensions. ""I wanted to thank him for not going into the war, just ending the war,"" Trump said.
When asked what he wanted to achieve from the meeting, Trump told reporters: ""Well, I stopped a war ... I love Pakistan. This man was extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side — he did. They were going at it  — and they're both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.""
Pakistan and India were embroiled in a four-day conflict, exchanging missiles and drones for the first time since both sides became nuclear powers in 1998. The conflict, dubbed Marka-e-Haq, occurred between May 7-10 and was sparked by Indian missile strikes inside Pakistan on May 7.
Against this backdrop, what makes the meeting between Field Marshal Asim Munir and President Donald Trump historically significant? This is because Pakistan has demonstrated its role as a key regional stabiliser in South Asia.
The meeting took place amid heightened regional tensions due to the Iran-Israel conflict. Amid this escalation, Iran says ""Tashakur [Thank you] Pakistan"" on the one hand, while on the other hand, Trump is also saying that it was an honour for him to meet Field Marshal Asim Munir.
At the White House media talk, Trump acknowledged that Iran situation was also discussed in the meeting and that Pakistan knew Iran better. He appreciated Pakistan's perspective and positive role during the Iran-Israel war. Furthermore, Pakistan also has very excellent relations with China.
In the South Asia region, India's relations with all the regional and many global players have been affected due to its biased mentality. India is clearly becoming isolated at the world stage because of its arrogance and belligerence. This became clearer after the Marka-e-Haq.
Pakistan is a clear winner in the Marka-e-Haq and emerges as a regional power in South Asia. India, on the other hand, is losing its global political capital for being an arrogant, stubborn and illogical war-mongering country.
It now emerges that Pakistan and India are hyphenated at the global level, and India's attempts in the past to isolate Pakistan have failed miserably. After the Marka-e-Haq, the decades-old Kashmir issue has returned to the global limelight, and the US is ready to play its role in resolving this important issue.
In fact, Field Marshal Asim Munir's visit to the US is historic and his meaningful meeting with President Trump, that too at a time of Iran-Israel tensions, has elevated Pakistan's status as a source of regional stability.

Jirga meets governor over post-merger grievances,"US
The tribal elders also highlighted the continued non-payment of compensation
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi met with a tribal Jirga led by former MNA Hameedullah Jan at the Governor House on Friday.
During the meeting, the Jirga apprised the governor of the growing unrest and challenges facing tribal communities following the merger of the former FATA regions into Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Members of the Jirga expressed strong concerns over the imposition of taxes on the merged districts, particularly criticizing the 10 per cent tax on industries as an unjust and oppressive move.
The tribal elders also highlighted the continued non-payment of compensation to those displaced during military operations in areas such as Bara. In response, Governor affirmed that all promises made to the tribal population during the merger must be fully honored.
""I am advocating for the tribal people at every forum and have consistently stressed the need to address their post-merger deprivations,"" he stated.
The governor added that recommendations from tribal elders would be included in the steering committee for development projects in the former FATA, emphasizing respect for local input and the need for unity to resolve provincial challenges.

PHC questions FIR in PECA case,"BG
Bench asks how SHO acted without FIA mandate
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has issued notices to the federal government and other relevant authorities, seeking a response regarding the registration of an FIR against a local lawyer under the Pakistan Electronic Crimes Act (PECA).
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Abdul Fayyaz heard the case. During the proceedings, Justice Syed Arshad Ali questioned the legal basis of the FIR, remarking, ""How can the police register a case under the PECA Act when it falls under the jurisdiction of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)? How can an SHO file such a case?""
The petitioner, Advocate Roman Shah, appeared before the court. Justice Arshad Ali asked him why the FIR had been registered. Shah responded that he was unaware of the specific allegations and only knew that it had been filed under PECA.
Justice Abdul Fayyaz noted, ""The PECA Act falls within FIA's domain. How did the SHO register the FIR?"" Justice Arshad Ali further added, ""If the matter is within FIA's jurisdiction, then the SHO has no authority to register such a case.""
The petitioner informed the court that he had already secured interim bail. The Assistant Attorney General told the bench that the FIR was based on a social media post made from the petitioner's account, allegedly targeting a senior official of a security agency.
Justice Arshad Ali questioned the petitioner's actions, asking, ""Why do you share such content that creates problems?"" In response, Advocate Roman Shah denied ownership of the account, stating, ""This is not my account. Nowadays, fake accounts are created using other people's photos. I have no knowledge of this post.""
Following the hearing, the court issued notices to the federal government and other respondents, directing them to submit their replies.

IT potential showcased at US investment conference,"US
Envoy highlights prospects of collaboration, driven by Pakistan's talented youth
The embassy of Pakistan in Washington DC on Friday hosted the final sequel of ""Pakistan-US Tech Investment Conference 2025,"" drawing a significant turnout of information technology firms, tech executives, business leaders and entrepreneurs.
The day-long event capped the series with earlier sessions in Dallas, Texas and New York City last week, geared towards highlighting Pakistan's growing potential in the IT sector, which was poised to attract foreign investment.
The conference was a collaborative effort from the embassy of Pakistan, Pakistan Software Export Board (PSEB) under the Ministry of IT and Telecommunication, the Ministry of Commerce (through its trade officers), P@SHA (Pakistan's sole trade association for IT and IT-enabled services) and The Organisation of Pakistani Entrepreneurs (OPEN) Global.
In his opening remarks, Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States Rizwan Saeed Sheikh underscored that the conference was a testament to Pakistan's IT potential and its future ambitions.
""The IT sector is the most promising in terms of growth and development. Pakistan is only beginning to unfold its IT potential,"" the ambassador stated. He highlighted Pakistan's unique position, saying, ""Our geography lends us both geopolitical and geo-economic significance and our country has prospered over the past 78 years despite various challenges.""
Highlighting prospects of collaboration with the US, Sheikh stressed the importance of Pakistan's young, talented population and the profitability of its market for US investors.
""Pakistan's IT market offers profit to investors. With a thriving 65% young population below the age of 30, Pakistan and the US have every reason to collaborate in the most futuristic domain, ie, IT. Let's come together as two mega countries and make it happen for the benefit of the whole world,"" he remarked.
The envoy announced an upcoming video series designed to share success stories of Pakistani tech entrepreneurs, aiming to inspire the nation's youth to pursue their dreams in the startup ecosystem.

Pope warns of AI risks to young brains,"US
.
Pope Leo XIV warned on Friday of the potential consequences of artificial intelligence (AI) on the intellectual development of young people, saying it could damage their grip on reality.
Since his election as head of the Catholic Church on May 8, the pope — a mathematics graduate — has repeatedly warned of the risks associated with AI but this is the first time he has spoken out exclusively on the subject.
""All of us... are concerned for children and young people, and the possible consequences of the use of AI on their intellectual and neurological development,"" the American pope warned in a written message to participants at the second Rome Conference on AI.
""No generation has ever had such quick access to the amount of information now available through AI.
""But again, access to data — however extensive — must not be confused with intelligence,"" Leo told business leaders, policymakers and researchers attending the annual conference. AFP

Armenia PM in talks with Erdogan on 'historic' Turkey visit,"US
.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan was meeting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Istanbul on a rare visit to arch-foe Turkey, in what Yerevan describes as a ""historic"" step toward regional peace.
The talks began shortly before 7:00 pm (1600 GMT) at Istanbul's Dolmabahce Palace, Erdogan's office said.
Armenia and Turkey have never established formal diplomatic ties and their shared border has been closed since the 1990s.
Analysts said Pashinyan would make the case for speeding up steps towards normalisation with Turkey in a bid to ease Armenia's isolation.
Relations between the two nations have been historically strained over the World War I-era mass killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire — atrocities Yerevan says amount to genocide. Turkey rejects the label.
And they have been further complicated by Ankara's close ties to Turkic-speaking Azerbaijan, and its support for Baku in its long-running conflict with Armenia.
Ahead of the talks, Pashinyan visited the Armenian Patriarchal Church and the Blue Mosque and met members of the Turkish Armenian community, he said on his official Facebook page.
But his visit sparked unease back home. Police rounded up ""several dozen"" opposition supporters in the capital Yerevan and beyond Friday, rights groups and a lawyers coalition said.
Armenia's interior ministry did not comment on the detentions, but said police had acted on information about plans to disrupt the peace.
""This is a historic visit, as it will be the first time a head of the Republic of Armenia visits Turkey at this level. All regional issues will be discussed,"" Armenian parliament speaker Alen Simonyan told reporters on Thursday.
""The risks of war (with Azerbaijan) are currently minimal, and we must work to neutralise them. Pashinyan's visit to Turkey is a step in that direction.""
An Armenian foreign ministry official told AFP Pashinyan and Erdogan would discuss efforts to sign a comprehensive peace treaty as well as the fallout from the Iran-Israel conflict.
A day ahead of his visit, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev was in Turkey to meet Erdogan, hailing the two nations' alliance as ""a significant factor, not only regionally but also globally"".
Erdogan repeated his backing for ""the establishment of peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia"".
The two nations had agreed on the text of a peace deal in March, but Azerbaijan has since outlined a host of demands — including changes to Armenia's constitution — before it will sign the document. AFP

Trump extends date of TikTok sale for third time,"US
Platform will operate in the US until September 17
President Donald Trump announced Thursday he had given social media platform TikTok another 90 days to find a non-Chinese buyer or be banned in the United States, reported AFP.
""I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),"" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, putting off the ban for the third time.
A federal law requiring TikTok's sale or ban on national security grounds was due to take effect the day before Trump's January inauguration.
The Republican, whose 2024 election campaign relied heavily on social media, has previously said he is fond of the video-sharing app.
""I have a little warm spot in my heart for TikTok,"" Trump said in an NBC News interview in early May. ""If it needs an extension, I would be willing to give it an extension.""
TikTok on Thursday welcomed Trump's decision.
""We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users,"" the platform said in a statement.
Digital Cold War?
Motivated by a belief in Washington that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese government, the ban took effect on January 19, one day before Trump's inauguration, with ByteDance having made no attempt to find a suitor.
TikTok ""has become a symbol of the US-China tech rivalry; a flashpoint in the new Cold War for digital control,"" said Shweta Singh, an assistant professor of information systems at Warwick Business School in Britain.
Trump had long supported a ban or divestment, but reversed his position and vowed to defend the platform -- which boasts almost two billion global users -- after coming to believe it helped him win young voters' support in the November election.
The president announced an initial 75-day delay of the ban upon taking office. A second extension pushed the deadline to June 19.
He said in May that a group of purchasers was ready to pay TikTok owner ByteDance ""a lot of money"" for the video-clip-sharing sensation's US operations.
Trump knows that TikTok is ""wildly popular"" in the United States, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Thursday, when asked about the latest extension.
""He also wants to protect Americans' data and privacy concerns on this app, and he believes we can do both things at the same time.""
The president is ""just not motivated to do anything about TikTok,"" said independent analyst Rob Enderle. ""Unless they get on his bad side, TikTok is probably going to be in pretty good shape.""
Tariff turmoil
Trump said in April that China would have agreed to a deal on the sale of TikTok if it were not for a dispute over his tariffs on Beijing.
ByteDance has confirmed talks with the US government, saying key matters needed to be resolved and that any deal would be ""subject to approval under Chinese law.""
Possible solutions reportedly include seeing existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.
Additional US investors, including Oracle and private equity firm Blackstone, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance's share in the new TikTok.
Much of TikTok's US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company's chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.
Uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok's valuable algorithm.
""TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand - it's simply not as powerful,"" said Kelsey Chickering, principal analyst at Forrester.
Despite the turmoil, TikTok has been continuing with business as usual.
The platform on Monday introduced a new ""Symphony"" suite of generative artificial intelligence tools for advertisers to turn words or photos into video snippets for the platform.

Deaths from Congo virus,"US
.
Just this week, five fatal cases of the Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), commonly called Congo fever, have been reported in the country. Three of the deaths happened in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and two in Karachi. The deaths in Karachi – of two men ageing 25 and 42 – mark the first in Sindh this year from Congo virus. Both succumbed within days of their diagnoses, highlighting the severity of the disease and the lack of timely intervention, medical preparedness, and public awareness surrounding it.
Despite being endemic and officially recognised as a major public health threat, the prevalence of Congo virus is not widely documented in Pakistan. Symptoms of the disease can include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea, and even bleeding under the skin. The virus is mainly spread to humans through tick bites or by coming into contact with the blood or tissue of infected animals, which exacerbates its spread during and after the Eid-ul Azha season.
This year, roughly 6.8 million animals were sacrificed in Pakistan, according to the Pakistan Tanners Association (PTA). However, the country lacks a proper system required to manage the health and safety risks of such a large-scale event. Livestock are often brought into the city without regulatory health screening and temporary cattle markets are erected without an understanding of biosecurity protocols.
The use of gloves, protective clothing and proper disposal of animal waste is advised by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ahead of the festival but not only are these practices barely observed, they are often considered unnecessary and needless.
Unfortunately, prevention and care are the only options for managing the Congo virus as there are no FDA- or WHO-approved drugs for CCHF, or a commercially available vaccine. Therefore, the government must boost its efforts to strengthen surveillance, public awareness and biosecurity measures to prevent wider outbreaks in the future.

Elite clubs come under tax ambit,"US
Elite clubs come under tax ambit
The government's plan to ban economic transactions by ineligible persons from the start of new fiscal year has faced a setback, as a National Assembly panel found the online portal being developed to determine the eligibility criteria for carrying economic transactions was far from the finishing line.
National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance Chairman Syed Naveed Qamar gave his critical post-review assessment on Friday after reviewing the government's much-trumpeted plan to catch tax evaders.
The committee, nonetheless, supported the government's proposal to impose income tax on the earnings of elite recreational clubs, like Islamabad Club and Guns and Country Club that charge more than Rs1 million membership fees.
Work on the online platform is far from the finishing line, said Naveed Qamar, a day after he and other committee members took a briefing of the new system in a visit to the Federal Board of Revenue headquarter.
The statement made by the chairman after reviewing the system shows that FBR has failed to develop a credible online system.
The government has proposed to ban economic transactions by those whose assets and wealth statements do not support buying a plot, a car, invest in securities or maintaining bank accounts.
The committee had linked the approval of the powers with the FBR's ability to develop a system that is free from the exploitation of the taxpayers. The FBR had earlier promised to develop this system by April this year.
The FBR's briefing showed that it was merely a prototype system that cannot be described fully functional and does not have the ability to achieve the intended purposes, said Usama Mela, the member of the standing committee and the PTI MNA.
In his post-budget press conference, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had warned that if the Parliament did not approve the proposed amendments, the government may have to impose Rs400 billion to Rs500 billion in new tax measures. But his organization has not developed a trustworthy system.
There is still a chance that the National Assembly committee will approve these amendments but their enforcement will be linked with the development of a credible online platform.
The new system determining the eligibility criteria of taxpayers to undertake economic transactions would not be enforced from July 1st, the Chairman FBR Rashid Langrial told the standing committee. He further explained that the current system will continue until a new system is put in place.
The government has already proposed in the law that these new conditions will take effect after the approval of the federal government.
The chairman of the standing committee proposed that initially the FBR should apply the new system to a set of taxpayers instead of fully rolling it out. The chairman FBR agreed to the recommendation.
The government has proposed that only those people can buy cars, plots, invest in securities who have sufficient declared white legal resources to buy these assets and maintain bank accounts
According to the bill, the ineligible persons would not be allowed to withdraw cash from their bank accounts beyond a certain limit. However, it gives certain relaxations to them, including the freedom to procure up to 800cc vehicles, buses, trucks and tractors and invest in shares up to a certain limit.
The new system was conceived by Rashid Langrial in order to collect due taxes from people, either filers or non-filers. An eligible person can make major purchases of up to 130% of the value of cash and assets, declared in his last tax return and the wealth statement or he can justify any new source.
Recreational Clubs
The FBR informed the standing committee about an amendment in the law to capture the incomes of the elite clubs, which are exempted from paying income tax. The government has proposed to exclude these recreational clubs charging over Rs1 million for the membership fee from the purview of the non-profitable organizations.
The Islamabad Club is very much coming in the tax net, said Muhammad Aurangzeb.
The club had been built as a recreational facility for the bureaucrats and diplomats. Over the years, its fee was exorbitantly increased to many millions of rupees. Its membership is being offered to only the richest or the influential people, denying others from availing facilities being built on the state land.
The standing committee also rejected a government budget proposal of indirectly charging income tax from the farmers despite their income cannot be taxed by the federal government.

Oil prices slip as US sanctions ease fears,"US
.
Oil prices slipped on Friday as the US imposed new Iran-related sanctions marking a diplomatic approach that fed hopes of a negotiated agreement, a day after President Donald Trump said he might take two weeks to decide US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict.
Brent crude futures were down $2.27, or 2.9%, to $76.58 a barrel by 11:48 am EDT. US West Texas Intermediate crude for July was down 21 cents or 0.3% at $74.93. The more liquid August contract was down around 0.1%, or 5 cents, to $73.45.
Brent was on track to rise 3.2% on the week, while front-month US crude futures were set to increase by 2.7%.
President Donald Trump's administration has issued fresh Iran-related sanctions, including on two entities based in Hong Kong, and counter-terrorism-related sanctions, according to a notice posted to the US Treasury Department website.
The sanctions target at least 20 entities, five individuals and three vessels, according to Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control.
""Those sanctions are cutting both ways, they may be part of a broader negotiation approach towards Iran. The fact they are undertaking this is a signal they are trying to resolve this outside of conflict,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York.

Body of veteran actress found days after her death,"US
Ayesha Khan, 77 was found dead in her Gulshan-e-Iqbal apartment on Thursday evening
She died alone, forgotten — until the stench of her decaying body forced the world to remember.
The tragic discovery of TV artiste Ayesha Khan's body, lying unnoticed for days in her own home, has exposed the cruel fickleness of fame and the chilling reality of how quickly the spotlight fades.
Neighbours, driven to desperation by the unbearable odour of death, finally called police-unveiling a grim end for a star the world had left behind.
Ayesha Khan, 77, a celebrated figure of the drama industry, was found dead in her Gulshan-e-Iqbal apartment on Thursday evening. Police sources confirmed that the actress had likely passed away nearly a week before her discovery, with neighbours only informing police after a foul odour emanated from her residence.
According to officials, Ayesha, who lived alone, was believed to have died in her bathroom. Her children, who reside outside Karachi, were informed. The body was shifted to JPMC for medico-legal formalities before being moved to the Edhi morgue in Sohrab Goth.
Dr Summaiya Syed, the police surgeon, said that a post-mortem examination is pending, awaiting the arrival of her legal heirs. Police have classified the case as an unnatural death but found no immediate signs of foul play.
Born in 1948, Ayesha Khan was a pioneering actress of Pakistan Television (PTV), renowned for her compelling performances in classic dramas. Her career spanned over five decades, during which she played strong, nuanced female characters that left an indelible mark on the industry. She was also the elder sister of the late actress Khalida Riasat.
Ahmed Shah, President of the Arts Council of Pakistan, expressed deep sorrow over her demise, calling it a ""great loss for Pakistani drama."" Funeral arrangements will be announced once her family completes legal formalities. Ayesha's tragic and solitary passing has sparked debates about the welfare of aging artistes, raising questions about the industry's responsibility toward its veterans once the limelight fades.

"WB, IMF climate snub 'worrying': COP29 presidency","US
.
The hosts of the most recent UN climate talks are worried international lenders are retreating from their commitments to help boost funding for developing countries' response to global warming.
This anxiety has grown as the Trump administration has slashed foreign aid and discouraged US-based development lenders like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund from focussing on climate finance.
Developing nations, excluding China, will need an estimated $1.3 trillion a year by 2035 in financial assistance to transition to renewable energy and climate-proof their economies from increasing weather extremes.
But nowhere near this amount has been committed.
At last year's UN COP29 summit in Azerbaijan, rich nations agreed to increase climate finance to $300 billion a year by 2035, an amount decried as woefully inadequate.
Azerbaijan and Brazil, which is hosting this year's COP30 conference, have launched an initiative to plug the shortfall that includes expectations of ""significant"" contributions from international lenders.
But so far only two — the African Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank — have responded to a call to engage the initiative with ideas, said COP29 president Mukhtar Babayev.
""We call on their shareholders to urgently help us to address these concerns,"" he told climate negotiators at a high-level summit in the German city of Bonn this week.
""We fear that a complex and volatile global environment is distracting"" many of those expected to play a big role in bridging the climate finance gap, he added.
His team travelled to Washington in April for the IMF and World Bank's spring meetings hoping to find the same enthusiasm for climate lending they had encountered a year earlier.
But instead they found institutions ""very much reluctant now to talk about climate at all"", said Azerbaijan's top climate negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev.
This was a ""worrisome trend"", he said, given expectations these lenders would extend the finance needed in the absence of other sources.
""They're very much needed,"" he said.
The United States, the World Bank's biggest shareholder, has sent a different message.
On the sidelines of the April spring meetings, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent urged the bank to focus on ""dependable technologies"" rather than ""distortionary climate finance targets.""
This could mean investing in gas and other fossil fuel-based energy production, he said. Under the Paris Agreement, wealthy developed countries — those most responsible for global warming to date — are obligated to pay climate finance to poorer nations. AFP

Axe falls on Attock Jail superintendent,"BG
The investigation revealed how the torture occurred and raised questions
The Superintendent of District Jail Attock, Arif Shehbaz, has been removed from his post while five other officers have been suspended following the emergence of a disturbing video showing inmates being tortured under the supervision of jail officials.
According to sources, the video footage — reportedly recorded inside the jail — showed prisoners being brutally assaulted by fellow inmates in the presence of administrative staff.
Inspector General (IG) of Prisons Punjab, Mian Farooq Nazir, took notice of the incident and appointed DIG Prisons Rawalpindi Region, Rana Abdul Rauf, as the inquiry officer.
The investigation revealed how the torture occurred and raised questions about how recording devices made their way into the high-security facility.
Based on the inquiry findings, the IG Prisons submitted a report to the Punjab Home Department.
Following the initial investigation, the home department ordered the immediate removal of Arif Shehbaz, directing him to report to the IG Prisons Office in Lahore.
Ishtiaq Gul has been appointed as the new superintendent, while Sarfraz Haroon has been posted as deputy superintendent executive at Attock Jail.
Additionally, five officials were suspended for negligence and misconduct.

BD take control after dramatic turn in Galle Test,"US
Shanto not out on 56 as visitors lead by 187 on 4th day
What seemed like a batting paradise for the first three days took a dramatic turn after the lunch break on day four, catching even Bangladesh's pace bowling coach Shaun Tait by surprise. The once-flat Galle wicket suddenly began to challenge batters, with seven wickets falling in the final two sessions. If the pitch and weather conditions remain unchanged, an exciting finish is on the cards on the final day.
Bangladesh, holding a 10-run lead going into their second innings, reached 177 for 3 by stumps on day four, stretching their overall lead to 187 runs. The third session saw visible signs of deterioration, with dust coming off the surface and the batters facing significant challenges.
Despite the tougher conditions, half-centuries from Shadman Islam and Najmul Hossain Shanto helped put Bangladesh in a strong position. The pair added 68 runs for the third wicket, after which Shanto and Mushfiqur Rahim began building another significant partnership, putting on an unbeaten 49 runs for the fourth wicket. Shanto remained not out on 56, while Mushfiqur was unbeaten on 20.
Earlier in the innings, opener Anamul Haque Bijoy once again failed to deliver, scoring just 4 off 14 balls after a duck in the first innings. His fellow opener, Shadman, added 36 runs with Mominul Haque for the second wicket. Mominul, like in the first innings, got settled before throwing his wicket away with a sweep shot, managing 14 off 40 deliveries.
Shadman, who looked in good touch, reached his sixth Test fifty and went on to score 76 off 126 balls with seven boundaries before getting out. Shanto continued the momentum and brought up his sixth Test half-century as well.
Among the Sri Lankan bowlers, Prabath Jayasuriya, Tarindu Ratnayake, and Milan Ratnayake claimed one wicket each.
Earlier in the day, Sri Lanka were firmly in the lead and looked poised to overtake Bangladesh's first-innings total with ease. Resuming the morning session on 465 for 6, with Kamindu Mendis and Milan Ratnayake at the crease, they reached the break with their advantage intact. However, a post-lunch collapse saw them lose their last four wickets for just 20 runs, getting bowled out for 485falling short by 10 runs. Off-spinner Nayeem Hasan was the star for Bangladesh, picking up five wickets.

SBP injects Rs14tr to bridge gaps,"US
Indirect fiscal financing via OMO amid IMF borrowing limits; rupee down 6 paisas to 283.70/$
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) conducted one of the highest Open Market Operations (OMOs) on June 20, 2025, injecting liquidity worth a substantial Rs14.3 trillion into the banking system to meet temporary and structural liquidity requirements.
According to official data, the SBP accepted Rs13.93 trillion through a conventional reverse repo (injection) at a rate of return of 11.03% per annum across 36 quotes. Additionally, a Shariah-compliant Mudarabah-based OMO injection of Rs375 billion was executed at a return of 11.11% per annum with three accepted quotes.
Sana Tawfiq, Head of Research at Arif Habib Limited termed this ""among the highest single-day OMOs by the central bank,"" attributing the surge to both temporary and permanent factors. She noted that currency in circulation typically rises ahead of Eid, creating a temporary liquidity gap.
On the structural side, debt repayments and a time lag between repayments and fresh inflows are elevating liquidity needs, she explained. She added that the government's fiscal deficit financing — constrained by International Monetary Fund (IMF) conditions that bar direct borrowing from the SBP — has further amplified OMO reliance, with banks channelling funds into government securities instead.
Market experts expect the liquidity injections to remain elevated in the near term until inflows match outflows and post-Eid cash demand normalises.
Furthermore, the Pakistani rupee extended the declining trend against the US dollar in the interbank market on Friday, slipping by 0.02%.
By the close of trading, the local currency settled at 283.70 against the greenback, down by six paisas from the previous day's closing rate of 283.64.
Globally, the US dollar was on track for its largest weekly gain in over a month, supported by safe-haven demand as investors remained cautious over escalating tensions in the Middle East and their potential impact on the global economy.
Meanwhile, gold prices in Pakistan fell on Friday in line with the international market, which remained steady but on track for a weekly loss as investors awaited clarity on the Israel-Iran conflict after US President Donald Trump delayed a decision on possible involvement.
According to data released by the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), the price of 24-karat gold per tola dropped by Rs1,595 to settle at Rs357,000. Similarly, the rate for 10 grams of gold declined by Rs1,368 to Rs306,069.
Internationally, gold prices were steady on Friday and poised for a weekly loss after President Trump delayed a decision on entering the Israel-Iran conflict, according to Reuters. Spot gold was little changed at $3,369.63 an ounce, as of 1557 GMT.
Adnan Agar, Director of Interactive Commodities said gold prices remained range-bound on Friday, with the metal trading between $3,340 and $3,375 in the international market, as investors awaited clarity on geopolitical developments in the Middle East.
He told The Express Tribune that the market has been on a downward trend for the past five trading sessions, with a key support level identified at $3,320.

"Israeli forces kill 60, half near aid centres","US
.
Gaza's civil defence agency said 31 Palestinian aid seekers were among at least 60 people killed Friday by Israeli forces, the latest in a string of deadly incidents near aid distribution sites.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that five people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 26 others near a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli-controlled strip of land that bisects the Palestinian territory.
Thousands of Palestinians have gathered there daily in the hope of receiving food rations, as famine looms across Gaza after more than 20 months of war.
The Israeli army told AFP that its troops in the Netzarim area had first fired ""warning shots"" at ""suspects"" approaching them.
When the individuals continued advancing, ""an aircraft struck and eliminated the suspects in order to remove the threat,"" the army said.
Similar incidents have occurred in that area regularly since late May, when the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation opened its distribution centres, as Israel eased a two-month aid blocakde.
The privately run foundation's operations in Gaza have been marred by chaotic scenes. UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with it over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
Elsewhere in the territory on Friday, Bassal said 14 people were killed in two separate strikes in and around the central city of Deir el-Balah, and 13 others in three Israeli air strikes in the Gaza City area.
One of those strikes, which killed three people, hit a phone charging station in the city, Bassal said. In southern Gaza, two people were killed ""by Israeli gunfire"" in two separate incidents, he added.

Salah in line for Player of Year award,"US
Professional Footballers' Association name list of nominees
Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah was among six players nominated for the Professional Footballers' Association Men's Player of the Year award on Friday.
The 33-year-old played a key role in Liverpool's Premier League title triumph last season with 29 goals and 18 assists.
The Egypt star was voted Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association — securing almost 90 percent of the votes, marking the biggest winning margin this century — and is the firm favourite to land the PFA prize.
Salah is joined on the shortlist by Liverpool team-mate Alexis Mac Allister, Arsenal's Declan Rice, Cole Palmer of Chelsea, Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes.
Palmer, who won the PFA Young Player of the Year award for 2023-24, was a surprise choice for the list given his struggles for Chelsea last season.
Rice starred in midfield for Arsenal, hitting a career-high nine goals while adding 10 assists in 52 appearances in all competitions.
Sweden striker Isak scored 23 goals for Newcastle as they qualified for the Champions League and ended a 56-year trophy drought by winning the League Cup.
Fernandes was one of United's few bright spots in the club's worst top-flight campaign since 1973-74, with eight league goals and 10 assists.
This year's awards ceremony will be held in Manchester on August 19.
Liverpool agree deal for Bournemouth's Kerkez: reports

The 21-year-old caught Liverpool's eye last season with his fine form for Bournemouth, including two goals and five assists in 38 Premier League appearances.

Khanpur Dam storage drops to critical level,"BG
Water crisis looms large in Rawalpindi, Islamabad
The water level at Khanpur Dam has dropped to just 9.67 feet above dead level, raising alarms about a looming crisis in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The dam now resembles a pond, with water levels falling from 1982 feet to 1919 feetjust 9 feet above the dead level of 1910 feet.
According to an official, water supply for irrigation to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has already been suspended.
Presently, Islamabad's CDA and Rawalpindi are receiving only 50 cusecs of water, which is also at risk of being halted.
The dam's current inflow is 25 cusecs, while the outflow stands at 103 cusecs.
Experts warn that if rains do not arrive soon, the decreasing water levels could lead to a severe drinking water crisis, impact aquatic life, and devastate agriculture in the surrounding areas.
Orchards and canals in the Khanpur region have already dried up.
In the event of prolonged drought, millions of residents in the twin cities could lose access to drinking water, and tourism in the Khanpur area may take a significant hit.
During the three days of Eid, over 200,000 tourists visited the dam, with more than 50,000 vehicles arriving at the site, generating substantial revenue through parking fees. However, if the situation worsens, water-related activities and local employment tied to tourism could collapse.

WASA Lahore secures biggest budget share,"US
Bags 59 of 94 water, sanitation projects across province
The Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) Lahore has emerged as the primary beneficiary in Punjab's development outlay for the water and sanitation sector in fiscal year 2025-26, securing the lion's share of funds under the Annual Development Programme (ADP).
According to the budget document presented by Punjab Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman in the Punjab Assembly, a total of 94 ongoing schemes worth Rs58.13 billion have been allocated across five WASA agencies.
Of these, Lahore alone accounts for 59 projects with an estimated cost of Rs24.83 billion, highlighting a sharp imbalance in the distribution of development funds.
The remaining four agencies — Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Multan, and Rawalpindi — have been allocated a combined total of only 35 schemes valued at Rs33.29 billion.
Critics have pointed to this disparity as a sign of systemic neglect toward cities outside the provincial capital. In terms of new schemes, WASA Lahore again topped the list with 24 new initiatives for the upcoming fiscal year.
WASA Gujranwala received only two new projects — valued at Rs5.9 billion and Rs1.51 billion respectively — with budgeted allocations of just Rs.122 million and Rs.13 million for the next year.
Despite submitting hundreds of new proposals, agencies such as WASA Multan, Faisalabad, and Rawalpindi were left out of the new development portfolio altogether.
Senior officials from these agencies, speaking on condition of anonymity, expressed frustration over the exclusion, warning that millions of residents, especially in Faisalabad — the textile hub of Pakistan — will remain deprived of clean drinking water.
For ongoing projects, WASA Faisalabad received funding for 17 schemes worth Rs19.5 billion, while WASA Multan secured four schemes totalling Rs5.17 billion, and WASA Rawalpindi was granted five projects amounting to Rs6.38 billion. However, actual fund allocations for 2025-26 remain meagre: Rs126 million for Faisalabad, Rs365 million for Multan, and Rs.166 million for Rawalpindi — figures that stakeholders say are insufficient to meaningfully advance the existing work.

Glacier crushes three selfie-taking tourists,"SG
Incident took place near Sohni Waterfall, where victims were posing for photos
Three tourists from Lahore died after being struck by a glacier near the Batakundi area of Naran, authorities said on Friday. The ill-fated members of the same family were taking pictures and selfies beneath the glacier at the time of its collapse.
The glacier fell unexpectedly, resulting in the deaths of three tourists from the same family, all residents of Lahore. The deceased have been identified as 35-year-old Tahir, 13-year-old Abu Bakar, and 22-year-old Tayyab.
According to officials from the Kaghan Development Authority (KDA), the incident took place near Sohni Waterfall, where the tourists were posing for photos when the glacier suddenly gave way and buried them. All three victims died on the spot. Their bodies were later transported from Naran to Lahore.
Advisor to K-P CM on Culture, Tourism, Archeology and Museums, Zahid Chanzeb, expressed deep sorrow over the tragedy and directed relevant authorities to provide full support to the affected family. He also urged tourists to avoid unstable areas and refrain from taking selfies in dangerous locations.
Stressing the importance of safety at tourist destinations, he emphasised the need to raise awareness about precautionary measures and instructed officials to further strengthen safety protocols across all tourism sites.
Selfie obsession
Every year, dozens of tourists lose their lives at scenic destinations due to their passion for selfies and TikTok videos. A few days earlier, a tourist from Quetta drowned in the Kunhar River while filming a TikTok video, and another young man was swept away at the Jareed area of the same river.
Taking photos, selfies, and making TikToks at unsafe and unstable locations is proving to be extremely dangerous for tourists. Although similar incidents have been reported in the past, authorities have not imposed any restrictions on photo sessions in such hazardous areas. Many tourists, viewing such activities as ""adventure,"" engage in them recklessly, often with fatal consequences.
In previous years, similar accidents occurred on the Saif-ul-Malook Lake road, where tourists were buried under falling glaciers. Likewise, every year tourists drown in the Kunhar River while attempting to take photos near the water. Despite these recurring tragedies, both tourists and relevant departments fail to take preventive measures.
Such incidents often turn moments of joy into mourning for the victims and their families. In response, provincial tourism advisor Zahid Chanzeb said that efforts would be made to ensure safe tourism in the Kaghan Valley, and that public awareness campaigns would be launched to educate tourists about the importance of safety precautions.

Signal-free corridor takes shape in Pindi,"US
Punjab chief minister expected to inaugurate flyover, underpasses on June 30
Nawaz Sharif Flyover from Khawaja Corporation on Adiala Road, along with two underpasses on Mall Road and an underground pedestrian walkway, has entered its final phase of completion. These projects are expected to be inaugurated later this month.
Additionally, the construction of a flyover and underpasses at the busy Kachehri Chowk, as well as underpasses at Qasim Market, Race Course, and Charing Cross, is expected to commence soon — likely during the ongoing summer vacation period of educational institutions, in order to expedite completion.
Having been constructed at a cost of Rs2.3 billion, Nawaz Sharif Flyover at Khawaja Corporation Chowk on Adiala Road is in its final stage. Although the project could not be inaugurated on June 3 as initially planned, it is now expected to be inaugurated by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on June 30.
On the same day, she is also likely to inaugurate two underpasses on Mall Road — at Flashman Hotel Chowk and Mall Plaza Chowk — as well as the underground pedestrian walkway near AFIC. This project is expected to be completed by June 30 as well, with a total cost of Rs4.388b.
Meanwhile, a decision has been made to construct additional underpasses at three of the busiest intersections on Mall Road and Peshawar Road: Qasim Market, Race Course Chowk, and Charing Cross.
The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) has been instructed to relocate underground utilities — electricity, gas, water supply, and sewerage — from these locations to facilitate construction.
Moreover, a major project involving the remodelling and expansion of Kachehri Chowk has been approved.
This project includes the construction of two flyovers and three underpasses, with an estimated cost of Rs8.5b. The Punjab government has already allocated funds for this project.
Sources say following the completion of the two flyovers and three underpasses at Kachehri Chowk, and with the construction of five underpasses on Mall Road and Peshawar Road, this entire route will effectively become a signal-free corridor up to Motorway Chowk.
It is worth noting that an underpass at Golra Mor has already been completed and is operational. The Punjab government is funding all these infrastructure projects, which are being executed by the provincial Communications and Works (C&W) Department.
Schools get operational boost
The Punjab Education Department has released an amount of Rs464.5 million for the operational expenses of all public schools in the Rawalpindi Division.
An amount of Rs4.58715 billion has been released for the fourth and final quarter of the outgoing fiscal year to cover operational expenses and utility bills for all 43,000 public primary, middle, high, and higher secondary schools across the province.

Death wish or stress test?,"PK
.
In the past three years, humanity has seemed to teeter on the brink of extinction. When the war in Ukraine began, many of us struggled to visualise the full scope of the threat we faced. Any miscalculation could have brought the war to Europe, where two nuclear powers sit. Further escalation could have led to an extinction-level event — once the nightmare of the Cold War — by dragging the US directly into war with Russia.
Last month, we witnessed another episode of extreme brinkmanship, where — compelled by the desire to maintain its muscular image — a populist government afflicted with a shrinking mandate risked full-blown war with its neighbour. India's policy decisions these days seem to have little to do with rationality. It often convinces itself that it can offset the consequences of its actions through a mix of diplomacy, espionage, propaganda and wealth. Since few have dared to challenge the incumbents in New Delhi, their incremental brinkmanship (2016, 2019, 2025) did not come into sharp relief — until now. But the fact is that had President Trump not intervened, or had Pakistan's conventional defences not held, we could have been trying to survive in a nuclear wasteland.
Now, yet another gift that keeps giving: Israel's incremental belligerence. First Gaza, then Lebanon, Syria, Yemen — and now Iran. In Iran, it seeks to destroy its nuclear programme and, if possible, overthrow the state. Israel now claims to have destroyed most of the nuclear infrastructure above ground, but lacks the bunker-busting munitions to destroy the underground facility at Fordow. That is why it urges the US to enter the fray.
This is a curious development, because until recently, Israel had no shortage of bunker busters. Consider the indigenously developed Spice systems and Rafael's Rocks family of weapons. For instance, the MPR-500 is a smart bomb designed to wreak havoc underground. In Gaza, while claiming to destroy Hamas's fortified underground network of tunnels, Israel regularly used 5,000-lb GBU-28 laser-guided bunker-busting bombs — originally deployed during Operation Desert Storm.
A Jerusalem Post report dated 28 September 2024, titled 'Inside Israel's Operation: Step-by-Step Breakdown of How Nasrallah Was Eliminated' by Amir Bohbot stated: Netanyahu gave the go-ahead for the targeted assassination that would shake the Middle East and the Arab world. The Air Force command gave the green light to arm aircraft with bunker-busting bombs.
You're telling me that after invading a potentially nuclear-capable country, Bibi Netanyahu suddenly realised, ""Oops, we didn't check the depleted inventory""? That would be like Elon Musk taking you to Mars and suddenly realising he forgot to arrange water or oxygen for the colony. What is going on? Bibi can be accused of many things, but such debilitating oversight is not one of them.
When you listen to Israeli hawks in the media, you realise they're talking about altogether different weaponry. They want the US to use low-yield nuclear weapons. You may rightly ask: Israel is a nuclear state — why would it need another country's help when it could act alone? Because it has long maintained a façade of deliberate nuclear ambiguity. In fact, the Israeli nuclear programme is the Middle East's worst best-kept secret.
Even so, since when has Israel cared about international law or diplomatic niceties? The objective is clear: to drag the US into a murder-suicide pact — at least diplomatically. Once it becomes America's war, Israel cannot be held solely accountable for starting such a large-scale conflict.
But revisit the unofficial ask: low-yield nukes are still nukes. Use them to destroy a nuclear facility, and imagine the ramifications — not only for the country being attacked, but for the international order. A nuclear incident could trigger a chain of events that draws other nuclear-capable great powers into the fight. That is the very definition of a world war.
It is as if the human race has suddenly developed a death wish. Why else would anyone risk nuclear war if they and their people want to live?
Given that the triggers for such wars are usually a mix of national anxiety and rage over human loss (Pahalgam, 7 October), where leaders ostensibly vow to avenge such deaths and ensure nothing like it happens again — how can they not see that the consequences of their actions could lead to far wider devastation, killing far more people and destabilising global security?
How many millions would have died if India and Pakistan had turned nuclear? Do these missile exchanges between Israel and Iran not kill people on both sides? Imagine the fear and anxiety among civilians across the region. I'm not preaching. I'm asking legitimate questions. Do these leaders not mind the annihilation of the human race? If they don't — why?
It is easy to explain this fatalism within the Abrahamic faiths. All three major monotheistic religions share a similar eschatology. While the timing of the end is still a matter of debate in Islam, Christianity and Judaism, many believe that the three millennia allotted to human existence are over, and therefore the end is nigh. Despite considerable wiggle room, Muslims face a different dilemma: since no specific date is given, many feel free to see the end whenever they want. After every few centuries, they find themselves in a bind and start thinking the end is near — ergo, Al-Qaeda and ISIS's end-times wars.
This may explain the tragedy of monotheists. But why are people of polytheistic or pantheistic orientation — like many Indians — not afraid to risk it all?
That's when you realise that religious fanaticism might be one factor driving brinkmanship, but eschatology is not the sole reason. We don't know what is in Bibi or Modi's hearts, but we know that they excel at exploiting religiosity and the fanaticism of division to stay in power. To do so, they also promise their people a resurrection of golden past glories in a modern setting.
But in Bibi's case, it is clear that even that promise is a means, not an end. As I've mentioned before, he faces many criminal charges — some so petty that mentioning them alongside a prime minister's title seems insulting. In India's case, it is apparent that its ruling elite wants China and America to start a war that will weaken both, allowing India to silently claim the superpower crown.
If I weren't Popperian in outlook, I would have thought that history either seeks the destruction of humankind or intends to subject it to a stress test. But even so, my paranoid mind — shaped by science fiction and conspiracy thrillers — keeps pushing me in that direction.

"World Order — exceptionalism, aggression, brazen hypocrisy","BE
.
Israel's ongoing reaction to the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, and the current ungrounded aggression against Iran only reinforced a bitter reality of the world today — the post-9/11 order rests on brazen aggression and high-handedness of the mighty ones who have arrogated to themselves the right to define conflict, self-defense, evil, terrorism and victimhood.
The world order today knows no values, no morality. Nor any consideration for national or international law. Notions such as rule of law and democracy have meanwhile been reduced to fiction. We still hear a lot of western pontification on extremism and terrorism but it's pretty ironic that they don't apply the same yardstick to Israeli actions against women and children in Gaza, Lebanon and Iran. On the contrary, all leaders defended this as ""Israel's right to self-defence"".
Donald Trump — as it turns out — simply lied when he vowed to ""end wars"" and uttered his contempt for the deep state. He had vowed to reform the justice department which he described as ""department of injustice"" immediately after his reelection.
Bit by bit, the G-7 nations have scornfully pulled down the very values they championed for decades by inventing a self-serving exceptionalism in their own favour (read in Israel's favour). Today, they condemn attacks on Israel as criminal but hail the killing of nearly 60,000 Palestinians as self-defence.
All G-7 leaders dub Iran as the source of instability but are literally blind to — in fact complicit with - the Israeli actions of first killing Palestinians and now recklessly bombarding Iran to neutralise their nuclear weapons, although a US report, according to CNN, says Iran is far away from making a nuclear bomb. But all that seems just an excuse for crippling Iran and brining about a regime change.
On the sidelines of the recent G-7 summit in Alberta, Canada, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz spelt out this backhanded approach by the Israel apologists - a virtual endorsement of Israeli actions to date.
""This is the dirty work Israel is doing for all of us — this mullah regime [in Iran] has brought death and destruction to the world,"" Merz said in an interview with the ZDF broadcaster. In a separate interview with Welt TV, Merz also suggested Israel's attacks on Iran could lead to the demise of the Islamic republic's leadership.
""To be honest, I can hardly imagine the mullah regime returning to its old functions,"" he added, in a glaring display of hypocrisy born off cold-blooded geopolitics.
The G-7 essentially endorsed the Israel position on Iran. This way they themselves undercut the very themes they touted for decades as the West's unique selling point (USP) i.e. democracy, rule of law and human rights with the United Nations watching on as a silent, literally irrelevant spectator. Its predecessor — the League of Nations — had ceased to exist on April 20, 1946, largely due to its inability to prevent major global conflicts, particularly World War II. Will the United Nations meet the same fate and drown in irrelevance? For all practical reasons, the UN has been reduced to a debating club of the elite that thrives off the funding from member countries.
Israel today is doing what Rudolf Hitler did first against neighbouring European countries and then against Russia. Hitler's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939 triggered reaction from America, Russia, Britain and France, with the last two mentioned countries declaring war on Germany on September 3, and so began the World War II.
Will the murder of nearly 60,000 Palestinians and hundreds of Iranians as well as the potential Chinese and Russian reaction lead to the undoing of the United Nations that has been irrelevant at least since October 2023?
Blind exceptionalism — basically another synonym for hypocrisy — is causing a major shift in global politics. Battle lines have further deepened with willful demonisation of Iran and its major supporters thus far i.e. China and Russia.
This exceptionalism is stinkingly obnoxious, evident also from a recent article in The Wall Street Journal.
""The US, Israel and India blundered by allowing Pakistan to acquire nuclear weapons. Repeating the blunder with Iran would be far worse,"" says an oped by Sadanand Dhume in the Journal's June 18, 2025 issue.
Once again, this extremely self-serving argument — as if it were the benevolence of these countries and not relentless efforts of Pakistani scientists and engineers — exposes the exceptionalism being peddled in western official corridors and media houses.
Nobody speaks of how Israelis and Indians got hold of nuclear weapons. Neither of them has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but continues to demonise Pakistan's nuclear capability like a crime committed. For the G-7 nations crimes, it seems, against hapless Palestinian women and relentless attacks on Iran are self-defence, while Pakistan's nuclear capability and Iran's nuclear pursuits are an unacceptable offence.

Traders announce halting sugar sales over govt failure,"US
Sugar prices have surged to Rs190 per kg in urban areas, up to Rs200 per kg in rural regions
The Karyana Merchant Association Punjab has strongly condemned the continued and devastating rise in sugar prices, attributing the crisis to the government's complete failure to intervene.
In response, the association has announced a province-wide halt in sugar sales at all grocery stores and has appealed to the public across the country to boycott sugar and instead use alternatives such as jaggery (gur) and unrefined sugar (shakkar).
The association described the control of sugar prices as ""extremely difficult,"" noting that in the open market, sugar prices have surged to Rs190 per kg in urban areas and up to Rs200 per kg in suburban and rural regions.
According to Sheikh Rizwan Shaukat, the central general secretary of the Karyana Merchant Association, and Saleem Pervaiz Butt, the president of the Rawalpindi Division, both the federal and Punjab governments have proven utterly powerless and ineffective in curbing sugar prices.
Wholesale sugar prices are increasing daily by Rs100 to Rs300 per bag. They alleged that a powerful sugar mafia is exploiting the nation while small grocery shop owners are being unfairly targeted through fines and legal action.
They further criticised the inconsistent sugar policies — allowing export at one time and import at another — as mechanisms for profiteering. Despite repeated meetings with senior officials and ministers over the past two months to alert them to the exploitation occurring in the name of sugar, the authorities have failed to take any effective action.
Now, the association says, they are left with no other option but to halt sugar sales altogether to avoid heavy fines, penalties, and arrests.

Messi lights up Club World Cup,"US
PSG stunned by Brazilian side Botafogo 1-0
European champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered a shock 1-0 Club World Cup defeat to Brazilian side Botafogo on Thursday after Lionel Messi lit up the tournament with a brilliant free-kick winner for Inter Miami.
Atletico Madrid and Palmeiras also won as the second round of group matches began, but it was Botafogo who stole the headlines.
A first-half goal from Igor Jesus proved the difference as last year's Copa Libertadores winners all but sealed a place in the knockout rounds from Group B in front of 53,699 fans at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in California.
PSG are one of the favourites for FIFA's 32-team tournament after a dazzling season which culminated with a scintillating 5-0 demolition of Inter Milan in the Champions League final.
But their hopes of securing a victory which would have seen them become the first side into the last 16 were stymied by a resilient performance from their opponents from Rio de Janeiro.
""A lot of people wondered, but we showed how strong Botafogo is,"" goalscorer Jesus said after the win, which kept all of South America's representatives unbeaten at the competition in the United States.
""It was a difficult game and we had to defend well, and we did our job and scored a goal.""
Botafogo took the lead against the run of play on 36 minutes as Jefferson Savarino's through ball split the PSG defence and released Jesus.
He then did brilliantly to wrongfoot the covering Willian Pacho before sweeping a shot that took a slight deflection past goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma on its way into the net.
""We knew it was going to be a very difficult match -- they defended very well,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique.
""This Club World Cup is very intense and difficult and all the teams are highly motivated, especially when they're playing against us.""
Botafogo's win leaves them firmly on course for the last 16, with a final group game against Atletico to come on Monday.
Atletico bounced back from a 4-0 loss to PSG as Diego Simeone's side beat Seattle Sounders 3-1.
Pablo Barrios scored twice, including an 11th-minute opener which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.
Belgian Axel Witsel came off the bench at half time and almost immediately made it 2-0, nodding in from close range after a Marcos Llorente shot was tipped onto the woodwork.
Albert Rusnak quickly pulled one back for Seattle, only for Barrios to score again for 3-1.
Botafogo top Group B with six points, with PSG and Atletico each on three and Seattle facing probable elimination after two defeats.
Earlier, Messi scored a trademark free-kick to secure a 2-1 comeback win for Inter Miami against Porto in Atlanta in Group A.
The Argentine superstar found the top corner with a set-piece nine minutes after half time to clinch a surprise victory for the MLS side and give them a strong chance of progressing.
Samu Aghehowa's early penalty gave Porto the lead and they had the better of the first half.
But Telasco Segovia blasted Miami level and then Messi's free-kick helped them claim a noteworthy scalp.
""It's a huge joy, the whole team made a big effort, we worked really well,"" Messi told broadcaster DAZN.
""It's a really important win for us and we have to enjoy it.
""You can see that we want to compete and today we competed against a really good European team.""
Javier Mascherano's Inter Miami have four points from two games, meaning they are level atop the group with Palmeiras.
The Brazilians beat Egypt's Al Ahly 2-0 at MetLife Stadium outside New York.
A Wessam Abou Ali own goal gave Palmeiras a 49th-minute lead before Flaco Lopez doubled their advantage 10 minutes later.
The match was then suspended in the 63rd minute because of a weather warning, with players and fans instructed to take shelter because of a nearby storm before the action eventually resumed.
A draw between Inter Miami and Palmeiras on Monday will send both teams into the last 16.

Going loco for Labubu,"US
Monster dolls defy poor perception of China's exports
Small, fuzzy and baring sharp teeth, Chinese toymaker Pop Mart's Labubu monster dolls have taken over the world, drawing excited crowds at international stores and adorning the handbags of celebrities such as Rihanna and Cher.
Beijing-based Pop Mart is part of a rising tide of Chinese cultural exports gaining traction abroad, furry ambassadors of a ""cool"" China even in places associated more with negative public opinion of Beijing such as Europe and North America.
Labubus, which typically sell for around $40, are released in limited quantities and sold in ""blind boxes"", meaning buyers don't know the exact model they will receive.
The dolls are ""a bit quirky and ugly and very inclusive, so people can relate"", interior designer Lucy Shitova told AFP at a Pop Mart store in London, where in-person sales of Labubus have been suspended over fears that fans could turn violent in their quest for the toys.
""Now everything goes viral... because of social media. And yes, it's cool. It's different.""
While neighbouring East Asian countries South Korea and Japan are globally recognised for their high-end fashion, cinema and pop songs, China's heavily censored film and music industry have struggled to attract international audiences, and the country's best-known clothing exporter is fast-fashion website Shein.
There have been few success stories of Chinese companies selling upmarket goods under their own brands, faced with stereotypes of cheap and low-quality products.
""It has been hard for the world's consumers to perceive China as a brand-creating nation,"" the University of Maryland's Fan Yang told AFP.
Pop Mart has bucked the trend, spawning copycats dubbed by social media users as ""lafufus"" and detailed YouTube videos on how to verify a doll's authenticity.
Brands such as designer womenswear label Shushu/Tong, Shanghai-based Marchen and Beijing-based handbag maker Songmont have also gained recognition abroad over the past few years.
""It might just be a matter of time before even more Chinese brands become globally recognisable,"" Yang said.
TikTok effect
Through viral exports like Labubu, China is ""undergoing a soft-power shift where its products and image are increasingly cool among young Westerners,"" said Allison Malmsten, an analyst at China-based Daxue Consulting.
Malmsten said she believed social media could boost China's global image ""similar to that of Japan in the 80s to 2010s with Pokemon and Nintendo"".
Video app TikTok — designed by China's ByteDance — paved the way for Labubu's ascent when it became the first Chinese-branded product to be indispensable for young people internationally.
Joshua Kurlantzick from the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) told AFP that ""TikTok probably played a role in changing consumers' minds about China"".
TikTok, which is officially blocked within China but still accessible with VPN software, has over one billion users, including what the company says is nearly half of the US population.
The app has become a focus of national security fears in the United States, with a proposed ban seeing American TikTok users flock to another Chinese app, Rednote, where they were welcomed as digital ""refugees"".
A conduit for Chinese social media memes and fashion trends, TikTok hosts over 1.7 million videos about Labubu.
Labubumania
Cultural exports can ""improve the image of China as a place that has companies that can produce globally attractive goods or services"", CFR's Kurlantzick told AFP.
""I don't know how much, if at all, this impacts images of China's state or government,"" he said, pointing to how South Korea's undeniable soft power has not translated into similar levels of political might.
While plush toys alone might not translate into actual power, the United States' chaotic global image under the Trump presidency could benefit perceptions of China, the University of Maryland's Yang said.
""The connection many make between the seeming decline of US soft power and the potential rise in China's global image may reflect how deeply intertwined the two countries are in the minds of people whose lives are impacted by both simultaneously,"" she told AFP.
At the very least, Labubu's charms appear to be promoting interest in China among the younger generation.
""It's like a virus. Everyone just wants it,"" Kazakhstani mother-of-three Anelya Batalova told AFP at Pop Mart's theme park in Beijing.
Qatari Maryam Hammadi, 11, posed for photos in front of a giant Labubu statue.
""In our country, they love Labubu,"" she said.
""So, when they realise that the origin of Labubu is in China, they'd like to come to see the different types of Labubu in China.""

Justice Shah warns against extending CB tenure,"US
Says move deepens crisis, erodes SC's legitimacy amid unresolved 26th Amendment case
Senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah has cautioned that the extension of the Constitutional Bench (CB) without resolving the core legal challenge surrounding it could further undermine the top court's legitimacy and deepen the ongoing institutional crisis.
""The Commission must wait till the constitutionality of the 26th Constitutional Amendment is decided by this Court before addressing matters that flow directly from it. Proceeding with extensions or re-appointments to a Constitutional Bench whose very legal foundation is under serious constitutional challenge further deepens the institutional crisis and weakens the Court's legitimacy,"" Justice Shah wrote in a two-page letter addressed to the Secretary of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
A copy of the letter was also shared with all JCP members. However, the commission, by majority vote, disregarded Justice Shah's concerns and extended the tenure of the Constitutional Bench until November 30.
Justice Shah noted that his office had verbally informed the Secretary JCP on June 12 that he would not be available in Pakistan to attend the meeting scheduled for June 19.
""One would have reasonably expected that due to non-availability of one of its Members, the meeting would be deferred — particularly in keeping with past practice, where meetings have been deferred due to the unavailability of Members representing the Executive. Additionally, the meeting falls in the summer vacations announced by the Court.
However, it appears that the meeting is continuing as scheduled — perhaps due to the judiciary's minority position in the Commission,"" the letter read.
Justice Shah also requested that his written submissions be included in the official minutes of the JCP meeting, as he would be unable to attend, even virtually.
He stressed that the commission must recognise how the ongoing delay in resolving the constitutionality of the 26th Amendment is eroding the Court's credibility and shaking public confidence in its impartiality.
""It is both surprising and regrettable that rather than first addressing the legitimacy of the 26th Amendment, the Commission is rather insensitively prioritising the matter of judicial extensions — an act which, in substance, continues the disputed scheme introduced by that very amendment,"" the letter states.
Justice Shah also warned against the growing influence of the Executive over the Commission.
""It is imperative that the Court's image is not allowed to drift under the control or convenience of the Executive, which now appears to wield disproportionate influence over the affairs of the JCP.""
Pending adjudication of constitutional challenges, he proposed that all judges of the Supreme Court be nominated to the Constitutional Bench on an interim basis.
""Any selective inclusion without a transparent process or identifiable criteria is patently discriminatory and damaging to institutional harmony.""
Justice Shah stressed the urgent need to develop formal criteria for the selection of judges to the Constitutional Bench before any further constitution or expansion takes place.
""The absence of objective standards renders past nominations vulnerable to the charge of cherry-picking. This ad-hocism has already cast a long shadow on the legitimacy of the Constitutional Bench, and continued exclusion of senior judges without reason only worsens that perception.""
Addressing another item on the JCP meeting's agendarelated to the framing of rules under Article 175A(20) of the Constitution — Justice Shah asserted that no policy decision should be made until the 26th Amendment's constitutionality is settled, as it is currently being challenged in a series of petitions.
In closing, he urged that his concerns be taken seriously.
""The strength of the judiciary rests on its credibility, its internal coherence, and its fidelity to constitutional principle — not on expediency or executive preference. If the Commission is to retain its institutional legitimacy, it must lead with integrity, transparency, and collective wisdom.""

Teen social media ban clears first hurdle in Australia,"US
Successful software trial hints age rule can work
Some age-checking applications collect too much data and no product works 100% of the time, but using software to enforce a teenage social media ban can work in Australia, the head of the world's biggest trial of the technology said on Friday.
The view from the government-commissioned Age Assurance Technology Trial of more than 1,000 Australian school students and hundreds of adults is a boost to the country's plan to keep under 16s off social media.
From December, in a world first ban, companies like Facebook and Instagram owner Meta, Snapchat, and TikTok must prove they are taking reasonable steps to block young people from their platforms or face a fine of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million).
Since the Australian government announced the legislation last year, child protection advocates, tech industry groups and children themselves have questioned whether the ban can be enforced due to workarounds like Virtual Private Networks, which obscure an internet user's location.
""Age assurance can be done in Australia privately, efficiently and effectively,"" said Tony Allen, CEO of the Age Check Certification Scheme, the UK-based organisation overseeing the Australian trial.
The trial found ""no significant tech barriers"" to rolling out a software-based scheme in Australia, although there was ""no one-size-fits-all solution, and no solution that worked perfectly in all deployments,"" Allen added in an online presentation.
Allen noted that some age-assurance software firms ""don't really know at this stage what data they may need to be able to support law enforcement and regulators in the future.
""There's a risk there that they could be inadvertently over-collecting information that wouldn't be used or needed.""
Organisers of the trial, which concluded earlier this month, gave no data findings and offered only a broad overview which did not name individual products. They will deliver a report to the government next month which officials have said will inform an industry consultation ahead of the December deadline.
A spokesperson for the office of the eSafety Commissioner, which will advise the government on how to implement the ban, said the preliminary findings were a ""useful indication of the likely outcomes from the trial.
""We are pleased to see the trial suggests that age assurance technologies, when deployed the right way and likely in conjunction with other techniques and methods, can be private, robust and effective,"" the spokesperson said.
The Australian ban is being watched closely around the world with several governments exploring ways to limit children's exposure to social media.

"Pakistan, China & BD set up trilateral forum","US
Development viewed as significant new alignments
China, Pakistan and Bangladesh have formed a first trilateral forum, in a significant development that highlights new alignments in the region.
The first meeting of the newly-formed trilateral meeting was held in Kunming, Yunnan province of China on Thursday.
The talks, held on June 19, brought together Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong, Bangladesh's Acting Foreign Secretary Ruhul Alam Siddique, and Pakistan's Additional Secretary for Asia-Pacific, Imran Ahmed Siddiqui.
Pakistan's Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch also joined the first phase of the discussions via video link.
Bangladesh had strained ties with Pakistan and relationship with China was not smooth during the 15-year-rule of Sheikh Hasina Wajid. But since her ouster in August last year, relationship between Pakistan and Bangladesh have seen dramatic improvement while China has also stepped in to advance its interests.
The establishment of trilateral forum was the result of behind the scene efforts by three countries. It will certain raise eye brows in India, which suffered a setback after the removal of Hasina government.
Pakistan, China and Bangladesh, however, stressed that their new initiative was not aimed at any third country.
According to the statement of Chinese Foreign Ministry, Vice Foreign Minister Sun reiterated Beijing's commitment to fostering a ""community with a shared future"" among neighboring countries. He described both Pakistan and Bangladesh as ""good neighbors, good friends, and important partners in high-quality Belt and Road cooperation.""
""All three countries are key members of the Global South and share the mission of national revitalization and modernization,"" Sun said. ""This trilateral cooperation is not only in line with the collective aspirations of our people but is also essential for ensuring peace, stability, and prosperity in the region.""
The trilateral dialogue focused on promoting economic development and improving the quality of life across the three nations. The delegations held in-depth discussions on launching cooperation initiatives in sectors such as industry, trade, maritime affairs, water resources, agriculture, climate change, education, youth exchange, healthcare, think tank collaboration, and human resource development.
The three countries agreed to establish a joint working group to monitor and implement the proposals and understandings reached during the meeting.
All sides emphasised that the China-Pakistan-Bangladesh trilateral engagement would be guided by principles of good-neighborliness, mutual trust, inclusivity, and win-win development. They also clarified that the framework adheres to true multilateralism and open regionalism, and is not aimed against any third party.
The meeting marks a new phase in regional diplomacy, with China aiming to build broader cooperative platforms that extend beyond traditional bilateral engagements.
Observers say the Kunming meeting could serve as a foundation for future China-led initiatives in South Asia, with an emphasis on development-driven diplomacy.

"Being refugee not a crime, says CM","US
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed grief over the death of three tourists from Lahore
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has asserted that being a refugee is not a crime.
""It is a cruel compulsion. No one becomes a refugee of one's own desire. One has to leave one's home, one's soil to save one's life,"" she stated in her message on World Refugee Day.
She highlighted, ""Wars come to an end, but the feeling of homelessness of refugees remains for generations. The helplessness of displaced refugees of Palestine and Syria amounts to a severe test for the humanity. The world must realise the grave reality that those who seek asylum are not weak, but oppressed.""
She outlined, ""Despite scarce resources, Pakistan has generously hosted millions of refugees by upholding their dignity and esteem. Pakistan has always become a vociferous voice of the oppressed and will continue to raise its voice for the welfare of refugees across the globe. I pray that may peace prevail, oppression be eliminated and every human being feels solace and peace across the globe.""
In another statement, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed grief over the death of three tourists from Lahore due to collapse of a glacier near Mansehra.
The chief minister also expressed sorrow over the demise of senior actress Ayesha Khan.

Labuschagne dropped for first WI Test,"US
Steve Smith to be rested to recover from injured finger
Australia on Friday dropped Marnus Labuschagne for the opening match of their three-Test tour of the West Indies after a poor run of form while Steve Smith is out injured.
Teenager Sam Konstas and Josh Inglis come into the starting XI for the opening match in Barbados starting on Wednesday.
Labuschagne opened the batting in the World Test Championship final loss to South Africa last week but managed scores of only 17 and 22 on a challenging Lord's pitch.
His last hundred for Australia in Test matches was in July 2023, against England at Manchester. Since then, Labuschagne has averaged 24.7 with the bat, in 16 matches.
""Marnus at his best can be a really important member of this team,"" chair of selectors George Bailey said.
""He understands his output hasn't been at the level we, or he, expects.
""We will continue working with him on the areas of his game we feel he needs to rediscover. We continue to value his skill and expect him to work through the challenge positively.""
Smith injured his finger while fielding in the slips at Lord's. He left the field and did not return, watching South Africa's winning run chase from the pavilion.
""Steve needs more time for the wound to heal so we'll give him another week's rest and assess his functionality after that,"" Bailey said.
The 19-year-old Konstas will earn his third cap for Australia, and his first since January.
He made a blistering debut against India in December, blasting 60 from just 65 balls opening the batting and playing a number of audacious scoop shots against Jasprit Bumrah.
Konstas managed only 53 runs in his next three innings, but the teenager's raw talent has selectors excited.
Inglis will also make his third appearance in Test cricket, having made 102 on debut against Sri Lanka in January.
Bailey said the batting order and final team would be determined closer to the first Test.

LCCI for addressing Gulf visa challenges,"US
Warns that visa issuance delays in UAE, Dubai, Saudi Arabia are harming trade
President of the Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry Mian Abuzar Shad has urged the government to take immediate and concrete diplomatic steps to resolve the mounting challenges in the issuance of business and labour visas by the United Arab Emirates, Dubai and Saudi Arabia.
The LCCI president said that continued delays and restrictions in visa issuance are causing serious disruptions to trade, investment and workforce mobility, which is affecting Pakistan's overall economic prospects in the region.
He expressed deep concern over the growing number of complaints being received from businesspersons, exporters, investors and human resources who are facing significant obstacles in obtaining visas from these countries, which have traditionally been among the country's most important trade and labour partners.
He said that the business community is suffering due to the lack of access to key Gulf markets where Pakistan has deep-rooted commercial and labour ties. These restrictions are not only causing distress to our entrepreneurs but also harming the nation's economic interests abroad.
He strongly urged the federal government to immediately initiate high-level diplomatic dialogue with the concerned countries to resolve these issues on an urgent basis.
Shad said that thousands of Pakistani businesses operate in these regions and that a significant portion of Pakistan's foreign remittances and exports are linked to the Gulf market. In light of this, any hurdles in the issuance of business and labour visas would not only dent Pakistan's economy but could also affect the development of host countries that benefit from skilled Pakistani labour and investments.

Rs1.275tr loans signed to ease circular debt,"US
.
Pakistan has signed term sheets with 18 commercial banks for a Rs1.275 trillion ($4.50 billion) Islamic finance facility to help pay down mounting debt in its power sector, government officials said on Friday.
The government, which owns or controls much of the power infrastructure, is grappling with ballooning ""circular debt"", unpaid bills and subsidies, that has choked the sector and weighed on the economy.
The liquidity crunch has disrupted supply, discouraged investment and added to fiscal pressure, making it a key focus under Pakistan's $7 billion IMF programme.
Finding funds to plug the gap has been a persistent challenge, with limited fiscal space and high-cost legacy debt making resolution efforts more difficult.
""Eighteen commercial banks will provide the loans through Islamic financing,"" Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, told Reuters.
The facility, structured under Islamic principles, is secured at a concessional rate of 3-month KIBOR, the benchmark rate banks use to price loans, minus 0.9%, a formula agreed on by the IMF.
""It will be repaid in 24 quarterly instalments over six years,"" and will not add to public debt, Power Minister Awais Leghari said.
Existing liabilities carry higher costs, including late payment surcharges on Independent Power Producers of up to KIBOR plus 4.5%, and older loans ranging slightly above benchmark rates. Meezan Bank, HBL, National Bank of Pakistan and UBL were among the banks participating in the deal.
The government expects to allocate Rs323 billion annually to repay the loan, capped at 1.938 trillion rupees over six years. The agreement also aligns with Pakistan's target of eliminating interest-based banking by 2028, with Islamic finance now comprising about a quarter of total banking assets.

PPP slams budget over South Punjab neglect,"US
Gilani warns of renewed demand for separate province
The Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarian (PPPP), a key ally of the ruling coalition in Punjab, voiced serious concerns on Thursday over what it termed as ""continued injustice"" to South Punjab in the provincial budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
Speaking on the second consecutive day of the general discussion on the annual budget, PPPP lawmaker Syed Ali Haider Gilani expressed frustration at the budgetary allocation for the region. He warned that if the government fails to address the grievances of South Punjab, the demand for a separate province may resurface with renewed force.
""If this injustice continues, no one can stop the people of South Punjab from demanding their own province,"" Gilani declared on the floor of the House.
He criticized the government for failing to address basic needs in South Punjab, particularly Multan, where, he said, residents are forced to drink contaminated water. ""WASA Multan was completely ignored in this budget, while WASA Lahore was given Rs 147 billion,"" he added, calling for the formation of a committee to investigate the regional disparities in budgetary allocations.
Meanwhile, the debate over the budget remained heated, with Opposition lawmakers terming it ""anti-people"" and accusing the government of neglecting public welfare.
Treasury members defended the budget as pro-people and development-oriented, claiming it would bring tangible benefits across Punjab.
The session also saw tensions rise over alleged damage to Assembly equipment. Speaker Punjab Assembly Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan expressed disappointment at the Opposition's accusations that microphones were broken under his directives.
""I am a man of principle and will not compromise on the dignity of this House,"" the Speaker said, announcing that a formal inquiry will be launched. ""If any lawmaker is found guilty of causing damage, they will be held accountable and required to compensate for the loss.""
The Assembly will continue the budget debate in the coming days.

"Robbers barge into DHA home, arrested after shootout","US
Police returned fire, meticulously shooting only to injure and capture the suspects.
The posh and quaint neighbourhood of Defence Housing Authority Phase II rang with the crackle of gunfire as police engaged robbers fleeing from a house near the Abu Bakar Masjid on the Second South Street in the early hours of Thursday.
A mobile squad of the Defence police station had received orders to respond to a distress call about dacoits at the said house.
As the mobile rolled into the street, cops detected figures lurking in the dark; apparently, the thugs were trying to escape. However, when the police challenged them, the suspects opened fire in a bid to escape. Police returned fire, meticulously shooting only to injure and capture the suspects.
The arrested men were then rushed to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medical care. They were identified as 20-year-old Aashiq Azeem, 20-year-old Roshan Shehzado, and 22-year-old Ali Asghar.
According to the police, the suspects were attempting to rob a bungalow when the police arrived on the scene. The suspects attempted to flee and fired shots, prompting the police to respond with counter-fire, resulting in the suspects being injured and arrested.

Bilawal declares diplomatic triumph over India,"US
PPP chairman given warm welcome after successful visit to the West
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari declared on Friday that Pakistan had outmanoeuvred India diplomatically, citing the resounding success of his global mission to rally international support for Pakistan's stance in the recent conflict with India.
Speaking at a grand reception hosted by the PPP upon his return from a diplomatic mission, Bilawal stated that India had tried to isolate Pakistan diplomatically but failed miserably, as Pakistan's narrative ultimately prevailed.
Bilawal led a high-level parliamentary delegation in the first week of this month. The delegation visited UN, Washington, London and Brussels to meet officials, opinion-makers and think-tanks and apprised them of Pakistan's fight against terrorism as well as the Kashmir issue.
The delegation comprised parliamentarians Dr Musadik Masood Malik; Sherry Rehman and Bushra Anjum Butt; Hina Rabbani Khar; Khurram Dastgir Khan and Faisal Subzwari; and two former foreign secretaries, Jalil Abbas Jilani and Tehmina Janjua.
Bilawal told the audience that the delegation visited 4-5 countries at the request of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the President Asif Zardari. ""I took your message to the United Nations, America, London and the European Union headquarters of Brussels,"" he said.
""I want to tell you that Pakistan was successful. Pakistan's narrative won in the international media and India's narrative was defeated,"" Bilawal said in his speech. ""We conveyed the message of Pakistan, peace, Kashmir and Sindhu [river],"" he added.
Speaking about the four-day conflict with India dubbed as Marka-e-Haq between May 7-10, he said that Pakistan army inflicted a crushing defeat on India, which was a seven times bigger country in size. ""We all are proud of this [military victory].""
""India is trying that Pakistan failed at the diplomatic level, but I want to tell you that Pakistan was successful and India failed,"" he said, adding: ""Pakistan won the war on the diplomatic front because — Pakistan stood for truth and India relied on lies.""
He stressed that the Kashmir issue had been very important for Pakistan, as well as the PPP. ""We raised the voice of Kashmir at many places. President Donald Trump has said that he is ready to help resolve the Kashmir issue. This is a historic achievement,"" he said.
The PPP chairman condemned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for threatening to stop Pakistan's water. He warned that if India cast an evil eye on the Indus waters, ""we will fight another war and defeat them again"".
Bilawal said that India would have to accept the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), which gave three rivers to Pakistan and three to India. ""India will have to accept international law and the water treaty; otherwise, Pakistan will wage another war, and then all the six rivers will be ours.""
Bilawal told the audience that Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir came to America, when the Pakistani delegation was leaving. He added that Field Marshal Asim Munir's meeting with President Trump at White House meant India had lost the war.
Referring to India's allegations of terrorism, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was committing terrorism, then ""why our army chief was so welcomed there?"" Today, he added, the world understood the importance of Pakistan in the fight against terrorism. ""This is our diplomatic victory.""

Lahore's Puffball quits MUBI,"US
Animation studio protests streamer's links to Israel
Pakistani animation studio Puffball has announced the removal of its films from global streaming platform MUBI, citing what it called a deeply unethical financial affiliation. In a joint statement issued on Instagram on Thursday in collaboration with Indian studio Spitting Image and the peace-building initiative Project Dastaan, Puffball condemned MUBI for accepting USD100 million in funding from Sequoia Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm known to have recently invested in Israeli defence tech companies.
""We are deeply disturbed by MUBI's decision to accept investment from Sequoia Capital, a firm that finances Israeli defence technology companies, especially after 20 months of live-streamed genocide by Israel against the Palestinian people,"" read the post. ""As artists and storytellers, we cannot in good faith continue to host our work on a platform whose financial affiliations abhorrently contradict the ethical frameworks we stand for.""
The statement confirmed that Puffball has formally requested the removal of its animated works Rest in Paper, Seabirds, and Sultana's Dream from the MUBI platform. The three films comprise the anthology Lost Migrations, an ambitious cross-border animation series made in collaboration with Spitting Image and Project Dastaan that tells overlooked stories of Partition survivors through experimental short films.
Founded in 2019 by filmmaker Arafat Mazhar, Puffball Studio first rose to critical acclaim with Shehr-e-Tabassum, a haunting dystopian short inspired by Pakistan's censorship regime and blasphemy laws. Their follow-up, Swipe, offered a direct reckoning with mob violence and religious extremism in Pakistan, further establishing the collective's voice as fiercely political and deeply rooted in local realities.
Project Dastaan, co-founded by Saadia Gardezi and Sparsh Ahuja, aims to reconnect displaced Partition survivors with their pre-1947 homes using immersive media, particularly virtual reality. Spitting Image, the Bangalore-based animation house that co-animated Lost Migrations, is known for its socially engaged storytelling and visual experimentation. Together, the three groups brought to life a quietly radical animation project across borders.
Sultana's Dream, animated by Puffball and based on the feminist utopia imagined by Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain in 1905, juxtaposes dreams of liberation with the violence of Partition. Seabirds, created by Spitting Image, examines a seafaring community displaced from Burma and then again by Partition, illuminating the layers of identity loss. Rest in Paper, a tribute to Saadat Hasan Manto's Toba Tek Singh, reflects on the absurdity of borders and the wounds they continue to inflict.
Under scrutiny
Puffball's decision resonates with other cultural boycotts being organised under the banner of the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement, which has gained traction among artists, writers, and academics calling for material and symbolic pressure on institutions linked to Israeli state violence.
Founded in 2007 as The Auteurs in Turkey, MUBI has carved out a global niche as a curated streaming platform for independent and arthouse films. Over the years, it has distinguished itself from mainstream giants through a rotating selection of auteur-driven cinema, often spotlighting underrepresented voices. In recent years, the platform has expanded beyond streaming into theatrical distribution and production. Buoyed by the success of The Substance, a body-horror drama that became a breakout hit in 2024, MUBI has cemented its place as a serious player on the international festival and awards circuit.
At Cannes this May, the company made headlines with its aggressive acquisitions, including the Jennifer Lawrence-led Die My Love for a reported USD24 million. However, it finds itself in hot water since disclosing a significant investment deal with Sequoia last month.
In addition to MUBI, the firm's May 2025 funding round also included a USD10 million investment in Kela, a surveillance tech company founded by four Israeli intelligence veterans. A subsequent round raised the company's total backing to $100 million, with Sequoia playing a central role. Critics point out that this link aligns MUBI, even if indirectly, with Israeli state interests amid an ongoing and widely condemned assault on Gaza.
Growing backlash
MUBI responded to the growing calls for boycott with an Instagram statement posted on June 14, clarifying that Sequoia is one of several firms it has partnered with since its founding. ""The beliefs of individual investors do not reflect the views of MUBI,"" the statement read. ""We take the feedback from our community very seriously, and are steadfast in remaining an independent founder-led company.""
Social media backlash surged after an X user posted, ""Time to add MUBI to the BDS list. They are now funded to the tune of USD100 million by Zionist venture capitalists Sequoia Capital, who are actively engaged in military support of the genocide."" The call was echoed by activist groups like Film Workers for Palestine, which demanded MUBI return the funds and sever ties in a statement shared on social media handles.
""Sequoia Capital is also a major investor in Airbnb, which profits off of stolen Palestinian land by renting homes in illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank,"" the statement said.
While MUBI continues to host Palestinian films and work by Palestinian filmmakers, critics argue that such gestures are rendered hollow if the company continues to accept funding tied to military operations against the very communities it claims to platform.
""I'm dying to know how much money MUBI has lost in cancelled subscriptions amid the Sequoia Capital investment drama. I hope a devastating amount,"" wrote one critic on X, while another asked netizens to ""cancel MUBI subscriptions for taking investment from Sequoia, who invest in Israeli military arms manufacture.""
According to one X user, there are viable alternatives to MUBI. ""Buy a box set and cancel your subscription. There are many ways of watching the show these days without giving money to Sequoia Capital,"" the post advised.

More time to prepare for Wimbledon: Sinner,"US
The world number one's early exit came after a defeat to the 45th-ranked Bublik
World number one Jannik Sinner is looking forward to a bit of unexpected down-time after his second round loss at Halle, to better prepare for Wimbledon.
The Italian defending champion went down 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 to the 45th-ranked Kazakh Alexander Bublik in Thursday's second round in the German grasscourt Wimbledon warm-up.
""I have to accept what happened. I'm now going to have a few days rest before Wimbledon, which are going to do me good"" said Sinner.
He now has 10 days between Thursday's loss and the start of his Wimbledon campaign, where he seeks to dethrone Carlos Alcaraz, his conqueror in a five-set epic French Open final at Roland Garros earlier this month.
Halle in 2024 is the only grass court title Sinner has to his name. He made it to the semi-finals in Wimbledon two years ago. Last year he was beaten in the quarters.
""Honestly a little break is going to do me good,"" the 23-year-old told Sky Italia.
""I came here (to Halle), I gave it my all after the Roland Garros defeat, it wasn't easy,"" he added.
""Despite everything I'm happy enough.
""I've played two matches before Wimbledon, if there'd been more it would have been even better.
""Now I've got to boost myself both mentally and physically, that takes a little time,"" but for Wimbledon, ""everything will be fine"".
Sinner's loss to Alcaraz at the French Open was his first defeat in a Grand Slam final.
Prior to that defeat Sinner also lost to Alcaraz in the Rome Open final just after returning from a three-month doping suspension following his Australian Open success.
Zverev overcomes stomach bug to set up Halle semi-final with Medvedev
Alexander Zverev's quest for a first grasscourt title took an unexpected turn at the Halle Open on Friday when the German second seed was forced to sprint from court to vomit mid-match before rallying to defeat Italy's Flavio Cobolli 6-4 7-6(8).
Second seed Zverev started the match on the front foot by breaking in the first game but as he was serving in the second, he requested a toilet break to throw up and bolted down the tunnel.
Once he returned, Zverev struggled with the intensity at first and clearly looked unwell, bending over in exhaustion after points and gasping for breath after a marathon rally.
""I felt fine before the match. Then all of a sudden, out of nowhere, I felt really, really bad. I felt ill, went to throw up and then 15 minutes later I felt OK again,"" Zverev said.
""I don't know what it was, I've never experienced that before. I hope I'll be fine in the next couple of hours when the adrenaline settles. After that I think it was a pretty good match.""
Although nowhere near 100%, Zverev held serve as he slowly drew on his reserves of energy, firing his first ace of the match on set point.
The second set was an even contest as Cobolli relied on his movement to continue troubling Zverev, but the German eventually triumphed in a close tiebreak, finishing the match with 22 winners and 12 points at the net.
The semi-final pits Zverev against Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev, a familiar foe who holds a 12-7 head-to-head advantage and has won their last three meetings.
""I think he's the guy that I played the most in my career. I'm looking forward to it,"" Zverev added.
""A lot of things happened in the last 18 months. He's one of my toughest opponents in my career. It's going to be a great match and I'm really looking forward to facing him.""
Medvedev moved into the semi-finals with a 6-4 6-3 victory over American Alex Michelsen despite suffering a nosebleed in the second set which forced the 2021 Halle runner-up to take a medical timeout.
However, the Russian served well to deny his opponent a single break point opportunity and wrapped up the contest in 85 minutes as he reached the last four without dropping a set, with the only thing causing problems being the shadows on the court.
""The shadows on the court made the conditions quite difficult. It took some time to get used to it. It was then better in the second set,"" said Medvedev, who will return to the top 10 ahead of Wimbledon.

Punjab unveils Rs50b shrimp farming expansion plan,"PK
The facility will include cold storage, value addition units, and a streamlined supply chain network
The Punjab government has launched an expansive Rs50 billion plan to scale up shrimp farming across the province, aiming to transform the sector into a major contributor to the local economy and export earnings.
Key components of the initiative include the development of a model fish market in Lahore and three state-of-the-art shrimp value chain estates in South Punjab's Muzaffargarh district.
According to the Department of Fisheries, a 3,000-acre shrimp farming site will be established in Rakh Ali Wala, Muzaffargarh, with an initial investment of Rs10 billion.
Additionally, value chain estates in Head Muhammad Wala, Rakh Ali Wala, and Shahgarh will be developed at a combined cost of Rs40 billion. The Punjab government has earmarked Rs3 billion in the upcoming fiscal budget to initiate these projects.
Deputy Director of Fisheries Tayyab Rizwan stated that the value chain estates will be fully integrated, featuring hatcheries, feed mills, and shrimp processing plants.
These facilities are expected to not only enhance shrimp production but also generate employment and stimulate seafood exports.
In Lahore, the government plans to construct a modern model fish market at a projected cost of Rs10 billion.
The facility will include cold storage, value addition units, and a streamlined supply chain network to improve market access for fish and shrimp farmers. An initial budget allocation of Rs848.6 million has been approved to commence construction.

Pak qualify for FIH Nations Cup final,"US
They edge France on penalty shootout in thrilling semi-final
Pakistan displayed an outstanding performance in the FIH Nations Cup as they defeated France in penalty shootout 3-2 after two sides remained tied at the National Hockey Stadium, Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
Pakistan goalkeeper Muneeb Ur-Rehman blocked three France chances, while Rana Waheed Ashraf, Hannan Shahid and Afraz struck for Pakistan to clinch a highly-rewarding victory.
The green shirts will face either New Zealand or Korea in the summit clash on Saturday.
The two teams remained inseparable after enthralling four quarters as the scoreline was tied at 3-3 at the full time.
The high-stakes clash got off to a nervy start as the two sides barred each other from scoring the opener in the first quarter. Pakistan got one penalty corner, while France had four.
The Blues eventually broke the shackles in the second quarter through Xavier Esmenjaud, who breached Pakistan's defence to score a sensational field goal in the 25th minute.
France doubled their lead just four minutes into the third quarter through Victory Charlet.
Pakistan then staged an astounding comeback by netting three goals within five minutes to head into the final quarter with a 3-2 lead.
Afraz netted Pakistan's first goal after a precise assist by Rana Waheed Ashraf in the seventh minute of the penultimate quarter.
The green shirts then survived a major scare when the referee ruled out France's penalty corner after a VAR review.
Seconds later, Pakistan were awarded a penalty corner, courtesy of a foul from a French defender.
The penalty corner was successfully converted by Sufyan Khan, drawing the two sides level at 2-2.
The green shirts, fuelled with momentum, secured the lead through Muhammad Hammadudin, which remained intact until the conclusion of the penultimate quarter.
The green shirts then tried to prevent France from scoring the equaliser by passing each other until a foul from their defender with just three minutes of action left gave the Blues a crucial penalty corner, which Charlet commandingly converted to neutralise Pakistan's lead.
Pakistan had a vital opportunity to score the tiebreaker in the 59th minute as they got a penalty corner, which was burnt by Sufyan Khan as he hit a France defender in the process.
Lamentable as Pak players deprived of allowances
Pakistan hockey team captain Ammad Butt has publicly voiced his frustration over the lack of financial support, revealing that players have yet to receive their daily allowances despite reaching the semi-finals of the FIH Nations Cup.
Speaking on behalf of his teammates, Ammad raised a heartfelt concern that mirrors the long-standing struggle of Pakistan's national sport.
""Is there anyone who truly understands the struggles of Pakistan hockey?"" Ammad questioned, drawing a stark comparison between the country's cricket obsession and the declining fortunes of hockey.
""Do our politicians care about the national sport? Do ministers take an interest in the game that once brought Olympic gold to this country? Businessmen spend crores on cricket leagues, but when it comes to hockey, there's no budget,"" he lamented.

Steel sector warns of collapse,"PK
Fears becoming first casualty of $1b import surge, 2 million job losses
Pakistan's steel sector may become the first casualty of the government's decision to open the economy to foreign competition, as a parliamentary review finds flaws in the assumptions behind cutting protection levels by 52%.
Abbas Akber Ali, patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP), warned on Friday that the proposed tariff reduction would push Pakistan toward trading in imported steel instead of manufacturing it locally.
If implemented, the new National Tariff Policy would shut down local mills, leading to $1 billion in annual steel imports and risking around 2 million jobs, he said.
PALSP Chairman Javed Iqbal Malik stated that the current protection level of 53% for the steel sector would fall to 10% by the policy's fifth yearfar below the 38% minimum needed.
Malik said the association met with Haroon Akhtar Khan, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries, who acknowledged their concerns but said he was powerless to help. He added that the PM's steering committee on industry concerns also refused to meet the industry.
Under the new policy, the average applied tariff rate will fall from 20.2% to 9.7% over five years, a 52% drop, Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance this week.
In FY26, tariffs will fall to 15.7%, a 22.3% cut in the protection wall. This will include reducing customs duty to 11.2%, additional customs duty to 1.8%, and regulatory duty to 2.7%.
The government said reforms are based on the World Bank's Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model. The Standing Committee had asked World Bank and commerce ministry officials to brief Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan.
Ayub and other members met with the experts on Friday in the Parliament House and later shared their observations with the committee.
Ayub told the committee that the GTAP model was static, had limitations, and was based on trading in only a few tariff lines. He also criticised the use of Pakistan Bureau of Statistics data, calling it unreliable, and noted the model ignored several key variables.
Committee Chairman Syed Naveed Qamar asked Ayub to submit his observations in writing to the committee.
The GTAP model projects exports to grow by 10-14% and imports by 5-6%. Over five years, it anticipates trade liberalisation to reduce the trade deficit by only 7%.
Abbas Ali urged the government to delay tariff rationalisation for at least one year or until the industry stabilises.
The association said the proposed policy could cripple domestic steel production, trigger a $4 billion foreign exchange outflow, worsen the import bill, and deepen the current account deficit.
With steel mill closures, 4,000 megawatts of electricity used by the industry would go idle, and 2 million jobs are at risk, Abbas said.
According to the association, the perception that the current tariffs protect the industry is inaccurate - only offsets cost differences caused by state-regulated input prices, especially energy.
""We can compete globally if electricity costs Rs20 per unit instead of the current Rs40,"" Abbas said, adding that high electricity rates raise local steel production costs by Rs50,552 per tonne.
Abbas said the industry does not seek protection having invested over Rs100 billion in modern European technologies and is regionally and internationally competitive.
Tariff reductions would allow semi- and fully-finished products to flood the market, raising the import bill by at least $1 billion, the association said.
Javed Malik stated that tariff cuts should be delayed until power, taxes, and interest rates become regionally competitive.
He noted that India, the world's second-largest steel producer, has increased protection for its steel sector. Bangladesh offers 90% protection, while Pakistan's protection level is half of this at just 43-57%.
Malik said Bangladesh imposes minimal sales tax per ton, while Pakistan charges Rs38,000, and pointed out that Bangladesh's largest mill has a capacity of 2.4 million tonnes, while Pakistan's largest 1.1 million-tonne mill is shut down.
Abbas said the government should have first introduced reforms with incentives for iron ore extraction alongside tariff cuts. This would increase raw material supply, reduce costs, improve quality, and enhance global competitiveness.
He added that Pakistan's steel production is just 6 million tonnes, compared to Iran's 35 million, India's 100 million, and China's 900 million tonnes.
India, China, Russia, and Iran all have state-owned iron ore mining companies supplying to private sectors, giving local manufacturers access to cheaper materials — about $30 per tonne.

Uphill task,"US
.
The government is continuing in its latest effort to privatise PIA, months after the previous failed attempt led to an embarrassing situation where a bidder with questionable credentials offered a laughably low bid that did not even meet the minimum bid. Two earlier privatisation attempts have also collapsed in the past two years. But despite the noticeably low interest in the market, privatisation is a critical condition of the IMF's recent bailout, which has made the government a motivated seller.
While PIA and the government may claim the airline has gotten its act back in order after it posted a small operating profit in 2024, after 21 consecutive loss-making years, the truth is far more nuanced, as state-administered life support made it possible. About 80% of its debt was offloaded onto public coffers, and several tax exemptions have buoyed its balance sheet and made the airline more attractive to suitors.
Unfortunately, the opacity of the bidding process has been a challenge for some otherwise competent potential bidders who are rich in expertise but may lack deep pockets. And despite the government's attempt to make qualification criteria stricter, most of the parties vying for the airline are not active in aviation-related industries.
The government should also look into some creative solutions that allow it to receive fair payment — perhaps in guaranteed installments with some deferral period — instead of setting unattainable deadlines for what could be one of the biggest corporate deals in Pakistan's history. It is also worth reanalysing why there has been so little international interest in the airline.
Market experts have noted the government's desire for PIA to remain Pakistani creates a conflict between pride and practicality. But the domestic airline industry is competitive enough to pick up the slack even if a prospective buyer wants to streamline PIA's operations. The focus should be on getting taxpayers some value for the billions they have poured down the drain.

Italy's immigration and emigration both soaring,"SG
.
The numbers of Italians leaving their country and of foreigners moving in have soared to the highest in a decade, official data showed on Friday, fuelling national concerns about brain drain, economic decline and immigration.
Italy has a right-wing government elected in 2022 on a mandate to curb migrant arrivals, but also has a shrinking population and growing labour shortages, highlighting the need to attract foreign workers.
Meanwhile the country's stagnant economy and low wages - salaries are below 1990 levels in inflation-adjusted terms - have been blamed for pushing many Italians to seek better fortunes abroad.
Last year 382,071 foreigners moved to Italy, up from 378,372 in 2023 and the highest since 2014, statistics agency Istat said. In the same period, 155,732 Italians emigrated, up from 114,057 in 2023 and also the highest since 2014.
The immigration figure beat the previous high for the last decade of 301,000 in 2017, and was well above that period's low of 191,766 from 2020 — the height of the Covid pandemic.
The figure of almost 270,000 nationals emigrating in the two-year period from 2023 to 2024 was up around 40% compared to the previous two years.
The two-year immigration figure for that period, of around 760,000, was up 31% from 2021-2022. The figures are derived from town registry offices, so are unlikely to reflect undocumented migration.
Ukrainians made up the biggest national group among those who arrived in 2023-2024, Istat said, followed by Albanians, Bangladeshis, Moroccans, Romanians, Egyptians, Pakistanis, Argentines and Tunisians.
As for the high number of emigrants, ""it is more than plausible"" that a significant number were ""former immigrants"" who moved abroad after acquiring Italian citizenship, Istat said.
The agency also said Italy's poorer south was continuing to depopulate, noting that almost 1% of residents in Calabria, the region with the lowest per capita income, moved to central or northern areas during 2023-2024. Reuters

Experts say FY26 plan ignores public welfare, pushes for more loans
After the federal budget, ordinary citizens face growing financial pressure while the elite continue to enjoy privileges, economic nationalists said.
They criticised the 2025-2026 federal budget as a collection of unrealistic ambitions and contradictions, claiming it has failed to offer meaningful relief for the public.
According to them, the budget is full of unrealistic ambitions and contradictions. It has failed to provide any substantial relief in essential areas such as poverty eradication, job creation, healthcare, and education. Instead, a series of new direct and indirect taxes has made basic necessitiesincluding flour, cooking oil, tea, and milkmore expensive.
They fear that rather than alleviating poverty, the budget is likely to further increase the miseries of common people.
Thus, the nation's wealth is being further diverted toward the privileged class — affluent businessmen, influential manufacturers, and manipulated chambers, who may have big visions, but not big hearts for the common people.
They said solar energy has become a public good providing much needed relief to common people who have been under the onslaught of unbearable utility bills. Ironically, the current budget has imposed a new 18 % tax on solar panels thus producing a new killing blow to common people further marginalising their lives, funds and savings alike.
Despite the government's tall claims, the gap between the state and society continues to widen, inching toward social unrest. The political capital of the incumbent government is under serious threat. High inflation, rising prices, new levies on petroleum products, and fresh taxes on solar panels have together become a draconian nightmare for common people.
Speaking about the federal budget beyond numbers highlighting a common man perspective, economic strategist and regional expert Dr Mehmoodul Hassan Khan said, elitist economics is creating ripples in the lives of common people in the country because of its immense and unbridled political cartelisation and so-called democratic cronies in the shape of members of provincial assemblies (MPAs), members of national assembly (MNAs) and ministers whose salaries and other associated benefits have unnecessarily been further increased, while giving a wrong message.
Consequently, social activists and liberals have termed so-called political messiahs as mafias who are eroding national exchequer for their own whims-cum-wishes.
Additionally, the federal finance minister did not have any justification of this increase because being a member of the national assembly salary of these legislators has been enhanced every year on a regular basis. Thus the Finance minister seems to be compromised before its political fraternity, he added.
""Initiation of people's friendly programmes and projects in terms of social development at the gross root level (Chinese CPC model of good governance), social entrepreneurship (models of Uzbekistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Brazil, Cuba, etc.), holistic and comprehensive social nets for deprived and middle class, provision of free health facilities (Chinese model of public health and poverty reduction), provision of free food stuff to poor students (Indonesian model) through financial fine tunings and policy readjustments is the need of hour.
He suggested initiating people-friendly programmes and projects focused on grassroots social development drawing inspiration from the Chinese CPC model of good governance is the need of the hour. Models of social entrepreneurship from countries like Uzbekistan, South Korea, Vietnam, Brazil, and Cuba should be studied and adapted. ""There is also an urgent need to establish holistic and comprehensive social safety nets for the deprived and middle class, ensure free healthcare (as in China's public health and poverty reduction model), and provide free food to poor students, following the Indonesian example. These measures can be made possible through financial fine-tuning and policy readjustment, Khan said.
Re-activation of micro financing facilities for social development, participation of the private sector, wealthy clergy, proper utilisation of holy shrines, charities, and a balanced growth model would be the right way, he remarked.
Only purposefully exempting real estate, construction and sugar sectors will achieve nothing because common people know that the heavy presence of housing societies, tycoons, infrastructure barons and mafia in legislation have their own vested interests and have nothing to do with the massive slumps nests of the common people in the country, the expert commented.
Renowned economist Dr Shahid Hasan Siddiqui, speaking in a television programme, remarked that over the past three years, poverty and unemployment have increased, while the most powerful segments — such as the stock exchange, corporate sector, and banks — earned record-high profits for the first time.
He said, ""The government always talked about export-led growth, but no significant growth is seen in export figures from 2022 to 2025. In the last two years, our remittances surged by $10 billion — unmatched in the region. Exports didn't rise over three years, while skyrocketing remittances caused major tax losses.""
The federal budget appears designed to secure continued International Monetary Fund (IMF) tranches and funding from other institutions to keep the limping economy afloat. But if this trajectory continues, we may, God forbid, return to the IMF again after 2027 — part of what some see as a larger geopolitical game and this budget is turning us to this direction, he cautioned.

Rail passengers suffer as cooling system collapses,"US
This has reportedly led to a decline in passenger turnout and advance bookings.
All ceiling fans at Platform No 3 of Rawalpindi Railway Station have stopped functioning, adding to the misery of passengers during the current spell of intense heat and humidity. The air conditioning system on the platform has also broken down, significantly worsening conditions for travelers.
Women, children, and other passengers waiting for trains were seen drenched in sweat and forced to stand under the scorching sun with no relief from the heat.
Adding to passenger frustration, train fares have been increased following recent hikes in petrol and diesel prices. Fares for air-conditioned coaches have gone up by 3%, while economy class fares have increased by 4%.
This has reportedly led to a decline in passenger turnout and advance bookings. Similarly, freight charges and parcel rates have also been raised by 4%.
In a separate development, the station's washrooms have been outsourced to a private contractor, who has introduced a token-based entry system.

Pakistani products shine at China expo,"US
.
With the growing popularity of Pakistani products such as fresh fruits, pink Himalayan salt and handcrafted goods among Chinese consumers, more and more Pakistani companies are using CPEC and the expo platform to reach Chinese buyers.
At this year's 9th China-South Asia Expo, Pakistan's pavilion occupied a prominent space. Many Pakistani businesspeople brought freshly made, locally sourced products directly from Pakistan to showcase at the event. According to exhibitors, convenient logistics, efficient sea freight services and streamlined customs clearance have made it easier for them to bring their goods to Chinese customers.
Faisal from Karachi brought rosewood furniture, wool scarves, handcrafted copperware and gemstone jewellery for his Chinese buyer. ""It's now quite easy to ship goods from Pakistan to China,"" said Faisal. ""From Karachi to any city in China, we can get our shipments delivered within 15 days. Tariffs are low and customs clearance is smooth. Everyone knew we were participating in the expo, so our goods were cleared efficiently at ports like Huangpu in Guangzhou and Tianjin. In fact, the economy is showing signs of improvement this year. I'm hopeful sales will be better than last year.""
Another trader said: ""It's not difficult to ship products to China – we use sea freight. Help is coming from all directions and the organisers along with the local government have made sure everything is well-organised and runs smoothly.""

She was my on-screen mother but brought a compassion reminiscent of a maternal figure, a presence that soothed, grounded and made a space feel more human,"" continued Adnan. ""In an industry that can often be brisk, brusque and bustling, Ayesha jee carried herself with a calm dignity. She was never loud, never needing to prove anything — her craft did all the talking.""

Days after US President Donald Trump hosted Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday held a telephone conversation, reaffirming their shared commitment to advancing bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace.
During what officials described as a ""warm and cordial"" exchange, the prime minister conveyed his best wishes for the US president and lauded his ""bold leadership"".
He particularly appreciated Secretary Rubio's diplomatic efforts in facilitating a ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India, a move that helped avert a major crisis between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
""The prime minister welcomed President Trump's positive statements about Pakistan, calling them encouraging for lasting peace in South Asia,"" read a statement from the Prime Minister's Office.
Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan's willingness to engage in meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding disputes, including Jammu and Kashmir, the Indus Waters Treaty, trade and counterterrorism.
The two leaders also discussed the escalating situation in the Middle East, particularly the Iran-Israel conflict. The prime minister stressed the importance of dialogue and diplomacy to defuse the crisis and reiterated Pakistan's readiness to play a constructive role in any peace efforts. ""The current situation is alarming, not just for the region, but for the entire world,"" he said.
On the economic front, Shehbaz emphasized the need to build on President Trump's focus on trade. He called for greater cooperation in sectors such as investment, energy, rare earth metals, mining, and information technology. He noted that strengthening economic ties was key to mutual prosperity.
Touching on security and counterterrorism, the prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan's resolve to eliminate terrorism from the country, especially threats posed by the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other terrorist outfits. Secretary Rubio commended Pakistan's ongoing counterterrorism operations and assured continued US support in combating these threats.
The two leaders also reviewed the recent visit of Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir to Washington, describing his talks with President Trump as ""cordial and productive."" They agreed on the need to translate this diplomatic momentum into tangible outcomes across multiple domains.
Prime Minister Shehbaz emphasized the importance of sustained high-level exchanges and renewed his invitation for President Trump to visit Pakistan. Shehab also expressed his desire to meet the US President. He also extended a separate invitation to Secretary Rubio for an early visit.
Secretary Rubio thanked the prime minister for the conversation and expressed Washington's desire to expand cooperation across areas of mutual interest. He acknowledged Pakistan's efforts in maintaining the ceasefire with India and encouraged Islamabad to continue leveraging its ties with Tehran to support peace initiatives in the Middle East.
The conversation, officials noted, signals a new chapter in Pakistan-US relations, with both sides expressing a firm intent to work together for regional stability and global peace.

NADRA amends national ID card rules,"US
Birth registration with union council made mandatory
The National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has implemented major amendments to the National Identity Card (NIC) Rules, 2002, in an effort to modernise the system.
The changes are designed to enhance security of the NIC system, curb fraudulent practices, and ensure greater transparency and efficiency in identity management across the country.
The NIC Rules were originally formulated in 2002, following the establishment of NADRA in 2000. NADRA prepared a comprehensive draft to align the rules with contemporary requirements. This framework has been approved by the Federal Cabinet and is now in effect.
A key feature of the new regulations is the mandatory requirement of birth registration with union council before the issuance of the Child Registration Certificate (CRC/Form B).
According to the revised rules, children under three years of age are exempt from providing biometric data and photographs. For children aged three to ten, a photograph and, where available, an iris scan is now required.
For those aged ten to eighteen, biometric data, including fingerprints, photographs and iris scans, are mandatory. Each child will also be issued an individual CRC with a specified validity period. These reforms improve the accuracy of child identity records and play a vital role in preventing illegal registrations and child trafficking.
Family Registration Certificate (FRC) has been granted legal status through these reforms.
Applicants must now submit an undertaking confirming the accuracy of the information provided. Citizens can obtain the FRC solely based on NADRA's records. The new rules define three family types: Alpha (by birth), Beta (by marriage), and Gamma (by adoption). Individuals must register any unlisted family members. Corrections can be made through the mobile app or NADRA offices, and incorrect entries can be removed. Unlike the previous system, the updated FRC will now include full details of men with multiple marriages, reducing ambiguity.
Furthermore, under the new regulations, married women are now allowed the facility to choose whether to display their father's name or their husband's name on their national identity card, according to their own preference.
In addressing the challenges citizens previously faced in verification, confiscation and cancellation of identity documents, NADRA has introduced several improvements. Verification boards at district, regional and headquarters levels are now legally bound to resolve all such cases within thirty days. The rules now extend these same procedures to certificates (FRC, CRC) as well.
The revised regulations introduce significant upgrades to Teslin identity card, which remains an affordable option for many citizens. These enhanced cards now feature key Smart Card security elements, including bilingual information in Urdu and English, easing passport applications. QR codes replace thumb impressions, offering modernized security without additional fees. The improved Teslin cards will continue to be issued quickly and at lower costs, making them more accessible to a broader population.
A key aspect of the amendments is the voluntary correction facility, allowing individuals with incorrect identity records to proactively inform NADRA for legal protection and correction.
To eliminate ambiguities and improve clarity, the amendments provide precise definitions for key identity management terms.
