PTI brands planning minister 'Goebbels',"US
PTI leaders were on Thursday denied access to party founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail
Reacting to the planning minister's statement, a PTI spokesperson accused him of trying to become the 'Goebbels' of what he called a 'mandate theft' government.
The spokesperson said the economic destruction under Ahsan Iqbal and his associates was unprecedented, and claimed the public understands the economy better than the ministers of the current government.
He stated that for the past three years, the people have suffered due to the incompetence and poor decision-making of those in power. ""The public cannot be misled by manipulated statistics, nor can those responsible for the economic collapse escape accountability,"" he added.
The PTI spokesperson said citizens are the direct victims of the government's destructive policies, and have already rejected the current rulers. ""Every segment of society sees the recent federal budget as a cruel joke,"" he asserted.
He said that the only viable path forward is to hand over the reins of government and the economy to the true representatives of the people.
PTI leaders denied access to Imran
PTI leaders were on Thursday denied access to party founder Imran Khan at Adiala Jail.
Talking to the media outside the prison, Member of National Assembly Nisar Jatt said the administration did not allow PTI leaders to meet Imran Khan, even though they had fulfilled all formalities. He criticized the Punjab government for what he called ""destroying farmers, labourers, traders and industrialists"".
PTI leader Alamgir Khan said the way PTI founder Imran Khan is being treated, Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav was not. ""We have no other option but to take recourse to road protests and peaceful resistance,"" said Alamgir Khan, adding, ""We won't refrain from waging a peaceful struggle.""
He said the PTI leaders were not allowed to meet Imran Khan. It made a new chapter of fascism. It is all happening after the passage of the 26 Amendment. The party leaders, family members and lawyers are being denied access to the imprisoned PTI founder.
Later, the PTI leaders returned peacefully from the prison facility.

"Imad urges Babar, Rizwan's inclusion in T20 squad","BR
He highlighted the need for adaptability and a fresh mindset in T20 cricket
Former Pakistan all-rounder Imad Wasim has expressed his strong support for star batter Babar Azam and former T20I captain Mohammad Rizwan, urging critics to trust their capabilities in the T20 format.
Speaking in a recent interview with a local sports platform, Imad highlighted the need for adaptability and a fresh mindset in T20 cricket.
""Simple is that — that should be the message and if they are willing to change it, if they want to play happy for them because they are such big players such big names for Pakistan and fans because people want to see them play like this and I am specifically talking about T20 cricket,"" Imad stated.
Responding to recent debates surrounding Babar Azam's role in the national side, the 36-year-old clarified that his earlier comments were specifically focused on T20 cricket and not a critique of Babar's performances in other formats.
""I am not talking about ODI or Test cricket because in ODI cricket Babar has got the best record in the world he will never be dropped to be honest and even in Test cricket so no question about Babar's performance like it's 50-over format you need some players to play like that and Babar does it better than anyone else in the world so One-Day cricket is totally different,"" he explained.
Imad further stressed the importance of introspection among senior players when it comes to the T20 format.
""But T20 I am talking about, I think they need to reflect if they they want to play T20 cricket and I know they can play and hopefully they will turn up and prove everybody wrong and I should be the one who will praise them,"" he concluded.
For the unversed, Babar Azam — who led Pakistan in three consecutive ICC Men's T20 World Cups (2021, 2022, and 2024) — last played a T20I in December 2023.
Since then, he has missed both the home series against New Zealand in March and the ongoing three-match T20I series against Bangladesh, which began on May 28 in Lahore.
Babar, who has faced criticism for his dip in form in T20Is, has not scored a half-century since his 75-run innings against Ireland in May 2023. He has represented Pakistan in 128 T20Is, scoring 4,223 runs at an average of 39.83, including three centuries and 36 fifties.
Earlier this year, both Babar and Rizwan were left out of the five-match T20I series in New Zealand as selectors looked to give opportunities to younger players. The duo has yet to return to the T20I setup since then.
In a notable change, Mohammad Rizwan was recently removed from the T20I captaincy after leading the side in just two series.
All-rounder Salman Ali Agha was named the new skipper and recently guided Pakistan to a dominant 3-0 series win over Bangladesh in Lahore.

Asim and Merub end engagement with grace,"US
Joint statement on IG requests privacy
Singer Asim Azhar and actor Merub Ali have officially ended their engagement, the couple confirmed via Instagram on Thursday.
In a heartfelt joint statement posted to his Instagram Stories, the Radd singer wrote: ""We hope this message finds you well. We wanted to take a moment to share something personal, as we believe we owe that to those who have supported us — fans, friends, and well-wishers.""
""After a great deal of thought and reflection,"" he continued, ""Merub and I have chosen to move forward on separate paths peacefully and mutually. While we shared meaningful moments and genuinely hoped for a future together, life sometimes takes its own course.""
Asim, who got engaged to the Sinfe Aahan actor in 2021, emphasised that the separation was amicable. ""We have the utmost respect for each other and the families involved, and always will,"" he wrote, requesting fans and media for privacy during this period.
The announcement concluded with a note of gratitude: ""Thank you for your continued support.""
The pair had long kept their relationship largely private, occasionally sharing glimpses of their bond on social media. Even before they confirmed their relationship status in 2021, the duo had been fuelling the rumour mill for quite some time.
Shortly before the engagement announcement, Asim took to X to clarify that he had never labelled Merub as his ""sister"", as was allegedly being claimed by some based on a doctored screenshot.
He wrote, ""To all reposting a screenshot of a 'news channel' that said I had labelled Merub as my sister [because] of a fake chat a fan had made, I clarified it a year ago."" The singer continued, ""Reminder, since this is a beautiful moment of my life that I want to cherish. Doosre ki khushi mai khush hona chahiye [You should be happy for others].""
He went on to add in a separate post, ""Clarification was important because the narrative was disgusting. Anyways, baaki sab ko mithaai jald hi ghar pohanch jayegi [the mithai will reach everyone else's homes soon]. I love you guys. Thank you for the love and duas.""
Merub also took to her Instagram story to request people to steer clear of spreading rumours for the sake of gossip. She wrote, ""Please refrain from spreading false info, fake dates and especially refrain from bringing other humans down to celebrate us,"" in a possible nod to fans bullying actor Hania Aamir, whom Asim previously dated.

Govt moves to fix teacher shortage,"US
The education minister also stressed the government's commitment to digital learning
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Education, Faisal Khan Tarakai, has announced a series of measures to tackle the shortage of teachers across the province.
Speaking to the media, he stated that recruitment of teachers through the Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency (ETEA) is currently underway to ensure merit-based hiring of qualified educators.
Under the Double Shift School Program, teachers are also being appointed on a temporary basis via Parent-Teacher Councils. Additionally, recruitment is ongoing in various districts under a UNICEF-supported initiative. The minister further revealed that interns are also being hired this year under a new scheme to support schools facing acute shortages.
Emphasizing the importance of teacher presence in classrooms, Minister Tarakai said, ""Every classroom must have a teacher — this is non-negotiable. We are committed to ensuring the availability of at least one teacher in each classroom across the province.""
He also highlighted the role of the Education Management Information System (EMIS), stating that comprehensive teacher data is being collected to guide effective planning and deployment. ""We are focusing heavily on teacher training, and have finalized an agreement with the University of Cambridge to provide professional development for newly recruited teachers through ETEA,"" he added.
The education minister also stressed the government's commitment to digital learning, stating that e-books and digital resources are being prioritized.
""Tablets and internet connectivity will be integrated into the education system. We are modernizing our infrastructure to ensure that our children are equipped to meet the demands of the 21st century,"" said Tarakai.

IHC rules telecom's tower deal taxable,"US
Orders telecom operator to pay Rs22b in taxes on transactional gain
A Division Bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), led by Justice Babar Sattar, has recently delivered a significant ruling in favour of revenue in a tax reference filed by a major telecom operator.
The ruling upholds the powers and jurisdiction of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in assessing tax liability on a high-value intra-group transaction involving the transfer of telecom operator's tower assets. As a result, the telecom operator is now liable to pay taxes amounting to approximately Rs22 billion ($78 million) on its gain from the transaction.
The landmark case focused on a 2018 internal asset reorganisation, where the Telecom Operator transferred its nationwide tower infrastructure to its wholly owned subsidiary.
The disposal of these assets for Rs98.5b ($940m) by the telecom operator was recorded in its financial statements as an accounting gain of approximately Rs75.9b. However, the telecom operator contended that the transaction was not taxable because the asset was disposed of to its wholly owned subsidiary, according to section 97(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (ITO) concerning intra-group transfers.
The IHC dismissed the petitioner's argument, stating that the provision permits a tax-neutral event only if all conditions of section 97 of the ITO are met. This includes ensuring that the written-down value of the transferred asset remains unchanged in the hands of the transferee compared to the transferor, meaning the transaction should not generate any economic value leading to taxable income. The Court determined that the transaction was conducted at a fair market value of USD 940 million, accepted by the petitioner as consideration, thereby violating section 97 of the ITO.
Consequently, the court concluded that the gain from the transaction was clearly a taxable event since nothing remained to defer taxation to a later date. Additionally, the Court ruled that the Commissioner had the authority to consider accounting income when evaluating taxable income.
This remarkable success of the FBR on judicial front is another step toward accomplishment of vision of the Hon'ble Prime Minister for expeditious liquidation of state revenue involved in the cases pending before the various appellate fora.
Under the guidance of Rashid Mehmood, Chairman of the FBR, Legal Wing of the FBR headed by Mir Badshah Khan Wazir, Member (Legal IR) in association with Director General (Law) has already taken a number of initiatives to actively pursue the pending cases by providing proper assistance to the courts.

Taxman told to enhance skills,"US
NA panel wants online platform to determine assets
In a major development, a National Assembly panel on Thursday linked approval of legal amendments to ban economic transactions by ineligible persons with tax machinery's ability to develop an independent and credible online platform to determine real value of people's assets.
The condition came a day after Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that the government may have to take Rs500 billion worth more tax measures, if the National Assembly did not approve the law to ban the economic transactions.
The committee would not pass the amendments related to the economic transactions until the members are satisfied that the Federal Board of Revenue has developed an independent and reliable online platform to assess people's assets, said Standing Committee on Finance Chairman Syed Naveed Qamar.
The government has proposed that only those people can buy cars, plots, invest in securities who have sufficient declared white legal resources to buy these assets and maintain bank accounts
The finance minister again reiterated on Thursday that the IMF has accepted Rs389 billion in collections on account of improved enforcement in the next fiscal year and for that the new legal powers were needed.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance had last month linked the approval of the bill to ban economic transactions with the government's ability to develop a credible online mechanism where the eligibility criterion can be independently determined and verified without harassment by the taxmen.
PPP's MNA Mirza Ikhtiar Baig raised the issue of first assessing the credibility of the new platform to make sure that the taxpayers are not harassed by the FBR.
Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal announced before the committee that the government has decided to give a 50% special relief allowance to all officers of the armed forces and 20% to other soldiers, in a move that acknowledges their contributions in defense of the nation.
This brings the total increase in the salaries of officers of the armed forces to 60% and to 30% for other soldiers after incorporating the impact of the regular increase in their salaries announced on June 10.
The announcement was made before the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue that on Thursday began discussions on the Finance Bill 2026, which is the real budget.
The government has given special relief allowance equal to 50% of the basic pay scale to the officers and 20% to junior commissioned officers and soldiers, said the Secretary Finance.
The Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, who is also a member of the standing committee, asked about the fiscal impact of the special relief.

Assured confusion,"RU
The warning from the finance wizards that revenue numbers are already locked with the IMF
This is perhaps the first budget in history which is at the cusp of a mini-budget even before being legislated. The euphoric order that it has laid by forecasting growth at 4.2% – at a time when all plum chips of production, agriculture, exports and FDIs are in disarray and tax collection is stagnated – is nothing but a proposition jotted down in economic non-viability.
Moreover, the Rs17.573 trillion layout categorically suggests that it will come down hard on spending, having already gone to the extent of unduly taxing revenue generating digital marketplaces, solar panels, cars and fuel, as well as agrarian tractors.
The point is that there is a serious flaw in budget-making, and the finance minister's proposal to raise new taxes to the tune of Rs432 billion is in doldrums. The obstacle has come from forces of status quo and they are the parliamentarians themselves!
The warning from the finance wizards that revenue numbers are already locked with the IMF, and in case of non-legislation of the proposed ""restrictions on economic transactions by ineligible persons lacking sufficient financial resources"", the government will have to impose an additional Rs500 billion worth of new taxes. This is where the supra-mini budget is on the cards.
So, what's next? And what if the IMF refuses to listen to our pathetic post-budget tale? Under a deal, as the second tranche of loan was released, the Fund was assured that at least Rs389 billion worth of new taxes should be raised through ""enforcement measures"", which is not possible without new legislation. The relevant House committee is already raising a hue and cry, and the prevalent partisanship in the coalition makes it an untenable order.
The government has exhibited selectiveness by unnecessarily appeasing the parliamentarians with a six-fold increase in salaries, and raising their developmental funds to the tune of Rs70 million each. For them, the FinMin acted as the devil's advocate too.
On the other hand, the government slapped a 2.5% deductable tax on the first slab of salaried class and failed to raise minimum wages this year. This waywardness is toiling and pushes the budget to the cliff.

"Stop telling people they are old and ugly, says Samina","US
Screen veteran slams ageism and body-shaming
Samina Peerzada and Sonya Hussaiyn may have just been warring on film as onscreen mother – and daughter-in-law in Deemak, but it will surprise no one to learn that in real life, both stars are united when it comes to denouncing the one issue that encompasses all women: body-shaming.
""We should not body-shame anyone,"" stated Samina categorically during a recent appearance on a local talk show. ""No one should say anything about anyone's looks. This is wrong. I don't like this at all. And it has become far too prevalent on social media.""
As a screen veteran, Samina, musing over a youth-obsessed society, added that she takes personal offence when unsolicited and baseless comments on age enter the equation.
""I especially dislike it when someone is a senior and they are told to just step back from it all,"" continued the Zindagi Gulzar Hai actor. ""For a start, in acting, there is no such thing as 'senior' or 'junior' – you are given a character, and you just play it, whatever your age. No one has the right to tell you to stay home and imply you should give up just because you are older.""
Adding her thoughts, Sonia chimed in with her own defence against unwanted aspersions.
""I think people have a habit of commenting on everything – not just on your body,"" pointed out the Saraab star. ""It is up to you how to take something positively or not. People will talk, and you need to know what to discard.""
Advising those who criticise age or looks, Samina urged fans to focus on merit and a happy demeanour, rather than lost youth and outward beauty. ""Instead of all this, you should count people's achievements and how hard they have worked to get to where they are,"" she insisted.
Hinting at double standards where the very act of taking pride in one's appearance is open to mockery the older one gets, Samina cited the example of fellow screen veteran Bushra Ansari – known amongst her fans and YouTube followers for facing negativity with a relentless positive energy.
""If someone looks after themselves and takes pride in how they look and are full of life, like Bushra – well, I admire her!"" stressed Samina with warmth. ""I love her energy! She does so many amazing things with such confidence, without any hesitation!""
With Samina's strictures on letting confidence go hand-in-hand with age, coupled with Sonya's advice on discarding unwanted comments, combating body-shaming may just become a little easier.

SC slams police over seized vehicles,"RU
Judges decry misuse as 'loot sale', summon report on case property cars
The Supreme Court of Pakistan has ordered the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Advocate General to submit a detailed report regarding all vehicles seized in criminal cases and currently held in police stations across the province.
A three-member bench, comprising Justice Mussarat Hilali, Justice Shakeel Ahmad, and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, issued the order while hearing a case at the Peshawar Registry.
The justices expressed serious concern over the unauthorized use of case property vehicles by police officers, terming the practice unlawful and unacceptable.
Justice Hilali remarked that police officials were treating seized vehicles as their personal property. ""It's like a loot sale,"" she said. ""They hand over vehicles to whomever they want, and these are then seen on roads with tinted windows. Instead of providing security, police have become a source of insecurity.""
Justice Shakeel Ahmad warned that the court would issue contempt notices to those responsible and pass strict orders to prevent the future use of seized vehicles. ""No one will be allowed to misuse these vehicles,"" he stated.
Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim added that the police had established a ""kingdom of their own,"" distributing vehicles as they pleased. ""This is not above the law, and we will not allow it,"" he said.
During the hearing, Advocate General Shah Faisal Utmankhel informed the court that 1,119 vehicles were parked at Daudzai Police Station's warehouse, while 36 more were kept temporarily at the Mathra Police Station. However, he admitted that he had limited time to gather complete data and requested more time to compile a full report.
Justice Hilali pointed to a vehicle previously summoned by the court that had been in use by a retired police officer for five years, without any official record. The court questioned why the vehicle was not stored in the warehouse, as required by law.
The bench also discussed the need for legal reforms under the province's narcotics laws to allow auctioning such vehicles and depositing proceeds into the public treasury. The Advocate General responded that no such rules currently exist.
The court emphasized that thousands of seized vehicles are decaying, piled on top of one another, or stripped of valuable parts. SHOs are reportedly using these same vehicles for raids and personal use.
The court warned that if the next report is inaccurate, strict action will be taken against responsible officials. It directed that the July report must clearly state each vehicle's location, status, and connection to any case. The case was adjourned until next month.

Pakistan secures $700m loan for Reko Diq,"PK
Indian opposition to foreign funding overruled
In a significant win for Pakistan, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the World Bank have approved a concessional loan of $700 million for the Reko Diq project, a major mining and resource development initiative.
This approval, granted during a board meeting in Washington, is a significant diplomatic victory for Pakistan and a major setback for India, which had actively lobbied against the funding.
As a result of this approval, the private sector is expected to invest $2.5 billion in the Reko Diq project, one of Pakistan's most important initiatives. The success in securing this loan is a testament to the effective diplomatic efforts of Pakistan, especially in light of opposition from India.
Dr Tauqeer Hussain Shah, advisor to the prime minister, played a key role in this achievement. He spearheaded efforts at the World Bank, successfully lobbying for the loan. His contributions were instrumental in securing this approval, marking a major milestone in the success of the Reko Diq project.
This loan approval strengthens Pakistan's economic position and highlights its successful diplomatic maneuvering in securing vital investments for the nation's future. The backing of this large-scale project is particularly significant in light of regional geopolitical tensions, with India actively seeking to block the project's financing.
With this decision, Pakistan has taken a crucial step forward in securing the success of the Reko Diq project, which is expected to play a pivotal role in the country's resource development sector.

My last few games were ordinary: Mathews,"US
Sri Lanka's prolific all-rounder is set to retire from Tests
The curtains are set to come down on Angelo Mathews' illustrious Test career in less than a weeks time in Galle – a fitting stage for a grand finale.
A teenage prodigy once tipped to be the next big all-rounder, Mathews weathered many storms, reinvented his game and ultimately carved out a niche as a dependable middle-order batter.
With 8,167 Test runs to his name, he signs off as Sri Lanka's third-highest run-scorer, behind the towering twin pillars of Kumara Sangakkara (12,400) and Mahela Jayawardene (11,814).
Unlike his two illustrious predecessors who batted with a touch of poetry, Mathews' craft was forged in grit rather than grace. His wasn't a willow that sang, but one that scraped and scrapped, often when the chips were down. Few would have wagered on him joining the elite run club, but through sheer consistency and an indomitable spirit, he made it.
In an exclusive interview with Telecom Asia Sport (www.telecomasia.net), Mathews opened up about his decision to hang up his boots.
""I wasn't happy with my returns in the last seven to nine games. By my standards, it wasn't up to the mark. I looked at the calendar – only two Tests scheduled over the next 18 months. One at 38, another at 39. Felt like a long wait and I thought it's best a younger player gets a crack.
Mathews admitted he was proud, yet slightly wistful. ""I never dreamt I'd finish as the third-highest run-scorer for Sri Lanka, especially behind two legends of the game. Yes, there's a tinge of disappointment not breaching that 10,000-run mark. Injuries and setbacks played their part, but I'm ever grateful to God for letting me play 118 Tests.""
Though the whites are being folded away, Mathews isn't done with cricket just yet. With the T20 World Cup coming up – co-hosted by Sri Lanka in eight months – he hasn't ruled out one final hurrah in coloured clothing.
Mathews said
I've always said that Test cricket is the ultimate examination. Like Virat Kohli mentioned, it's where you truly earn respect. It tests every aspect  — your skill, your character, your patience. That's the real deal.
""I've always said that Test cricket is the ultimate examination. Like Virat Kohli mentioned, it's where you truly earn respect. It tests every aspect — your skill, your character, your patience. That's the real deal,"" he said.
Mathews also fondly recalled two crowning moments in his career – leading Sri Lanka to their first-ever Test series win in England in 2014, and the historic 3-0 whitewash of Australia in 2016 to lift the Warne-Murali Trophy.
""That England series was something else — scoring back-to-back hundreds and winning from behind was deeply satisfying. Then to beat Australia 3-0 was special. I'll always be grateful to the players and support staff who made those memories possible.""
Beyond his own milestones, Mathews takes quiet pride in having nurtured the next generation. More than half of the current national side debuted under his captaincy.
""There's no greater satisfaction than seeing those youngsters blossom into match-winners. Identifying talent is one thing, but backing them through lean patches is what really matters. Watching them now — they're vital cogs in the wheel. It gives me hope that Sri Lankan cricket is in good hands.""

Migrants flee N Ireland unrest,"RO
A total of 13 people have now been arrested, and 41 police officers injured
Foreign nationals hid in wardrobes and attics to escape a wave of unrest which has rocked a Northern Ireland town, police said Thursday, calling for the protests to end and warning rioters they would face arrest.
""Stop this violence,"" said Northern Ireland police chief Jon Boutcher. ""We will come after you. We will arrest you. We will prosecute you successfully.""
He was speaking after three nights of unrest in the town of Ballymena, some 30 miles (48 kilometres) northwest of Belfast.
The clashes erupted on Monday night after two teenagers were arrested for the alleged attempted rape of a young girl at the weekend.
Police have not confirmed the ethnicity of the teenagers, who remain in custody and had asked for a Romanian interpreter in court.
After another barrage of petrol bombs, bricks and bottles, the crowds eventually dispersed late Wednesday without a repeat of the chaotic scenes seen on Monday and Tuesday when houses and businesses in areas where Romanian families live were torched.
A total of 13 people have now been arrested, and 41 police officers injured, though most of the injuries are not severe.
Three teenage boys aged 15, 17 and 18 were due to appear in court on Thursday having been charged with rioting, said police.
Boutcher described the riots as ""wanton, disgraceful criminal behaviour that is absolutely race motivated"", speaking at a news conference Thursday.
Police had helped evacuate foreign national families hiding in attics and wardrobes in their homes ""even though they had done nothing wrong"", he said.
""They are not criminals. They contribute positively to society here and are well integrated,"" he added.
Clonavon Road, where most of the riots happened in a neighbourhood known for having a large population of eastern Europeans, was almost deserted on Thursday.
Many of the houses were damaged, and British, English or Northern Irish flags hung from most windows, AFP reporters saw. Some had signs saying they were Filipino residents.

4 killed in tribal ambush,"US
The protest ended after assurance of the district's SSP Shahazeb Chachar
A tribal clash between Sundrani and Brohi clans on Thursday claimed lives of four people of the former group in Shikarpur district. The slain persons, Noor Muhammad Sundrani, Nizam Ahmed Sundrani, Adam Sundrani and the car driver Rasool Bux Marfani, were returning from a hearing in a court of law when their car was ambushed near a toll plaza.
According to police, armed men on motorbikes sprayed bullets on the deceased before making an easy escape. The Sundranis blamed Brohis for the killing. The community staged a sit-in protest at the toll plaza, demanding police action against Brohis.
The protest ended after assurance of the district's SSP Shahazeb Chachar who told that DSP Paras Bakrani has been tasked to investigate the matter.

"Man, mother gunned down","US
Victims targeted while returning from court hearing
A murder case defendant and his mother were gunned down in broad daylight near Matkay Bridge in Daska, in what police have confirmed was a targeted attack stemming from longstanding enmity.
The victims, identified as Saad Arif and his mother Rukhshana Arif, originally hailed from Wasnke, Tehsil Daska, but had been residing in Qila Ahmadabad, Narowal. They had traveled to Daska along with Saad's brothers, Muhammad Usama and Ahmad Arif, for a court hearing.
After attending the hearing, the family was returning home on motorcycles when, around 3:00pm, they were ambushed near Matkay Bridge in the Saddar Daska police precinct.
Three armed suspects riding a motorcycle opened indiscriminate fire, killing Saad and Rukhshana on the spot. Although the attackers fired at other individuals in the vicinity, no additional casualties were reported.
The assailants fled while firing shots into the air.
Police teams led by SP Investigation Usman Saifi, DSP Daska Khalid Aslam Jathol, Incharge CCD Sialkot Abid Rashid, and SHO Saddar Daska Jahanzeb Khan reached the crime scene, secured the area, and launched a manhunt for the suspects.
Rescue 1122 and the Crime Scene Unit collected forensic evidence and transported the bodies to Civil Hospital Daska's mortuary.
An FIR under sections 302, 109, and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code was registered at Saddar Daska Police Station on the complaint of Muhammad Usama, brother of the deceased.
The suspects named in the case include Adeel, Abdul Rehman and Waqas. Police revealed that the shooting is linked to the murder of Zain Ali, which occurred earlier this year on March 18.
In that case, registered at the same police station, Saad Arif was named as a suspect in Zain Ali's murder - a killing that had already intensified tensions between the two families.
DSP Khalid Aslam Jathol assured that law enforcement is actively pursuing the suspects and vowed they would be arrested soon and brought to justice.
Saad Arif and others had appeared in court to record their testimony, a fact well known to the suspects involved in the case.
SHO Jahanzeb Khan said when police teams conducted raids at the suspects' residences, they found the houses locked. This led investigators to believe that the suspects had carefully planned and executed the double murder.

"Pak to tour WI for ODIs, T20s in July","US
The squads' announcement for West Indies series is expected soon
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has completed internal discussions regarding the white-ball squads for upcoming international assignments, sources confirmed on Thursday.
According to insiders, the PCB is waiting for a response from the West Indies Cricket Board (CWI) on a proposal to convert the three-match ODI series into T20 Internationals (T20Is). If approved, the board is expected to announce a joint T20 squad for both the Bangladesh and West Indies series.
Sources said that the PCB is hopeful the CWI will agree to the proposed change, as the switch would align better with preparations for the T20-format ACC Men's Asia Cup 2025 and the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026.
The squad announcement is expected soon after a formal response is received from the West Indies board.
While no major changes are anticipated in the T20 squad, sources indicate that left-arm spinner Sufiyan Muqeem is likely to be included.
However, the return of senior players Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Afridi remains uncertain for the upcoming matches. The PCB's selection committee is hopeful that these senior players will bounce back, taking inspiration from other top players who made successful comebacks in the past.
Players have been told that the door for selection remains open, and strong performances in domestic and league cricket will improve their chances of a recall. The selection committee is also focusing on identifying and preparing young talent to meet the demands of modern cricket.
Pakistan is currently scheduled to tour the USA and West Indies in July and August for a white-ball series, which includes three T20Is and three ODIs.
The T20Is are set to take place on July 31, August 2, and August 3, while the ODIs are planned for August 8, 10, and 12 at the Brian Lara Cricket Academy in Trinidad.
However, the schedule may be revised if the ODI matches are officially converted to T20Is following further discussions between the PCB and CWI.
Change in selection committee
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday confirmed that only one change has been made to the national men's selection committee, which otherwise remains 'intact'.
In an official statement, the board clarified that data analyst Hassan Cheema has been replaced by Usman Hashmi, who will assist the selection committee but will not have any voting rights during team selection.
""The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has confirmed that the national selection committee remains intact,"" the statement read.
A PCB spokesperson added, ""The Board has only replaced the data analyst, who will have no voting right during team selection. Hassan Cheema has been replaced by Usman Hashmi as the data analyst to assist the selection committee.""
The rest of the selection panel remains unchanged, including former interim head coach Aaqib Javed, umpire Aleem Dar, and former cricketers Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq - all of whom hold voting rights.
Members of the national selection committee: Aaqib Javed (Member), Aleem Dar (Member), Asad Shafiq (Member), Azhar Ali (Member).
The PCB also stated that the committee will remain bound to consult with the head coach and captain of the respective teams before finalizing any squad.
This statement came in response to recent media reports claiming a major reshuffle in the committee was expected, which included the possible removal of Azhar Ali and Asad Shafiq.
Reports had suggested that former Pakistan captain Sarfaraz Ahmed and cricket analyst Sikandar Bakht - known for frequently criticizing PCB policies - were being considered as replacements.

PSX retreats from record on profit-taking,"US
Early gains fade as geopolitical worries pull index down by 260 points
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) experienced a turbulent session on Thursday, where the benchmark KSE-100 index hit a record intra-day high at 126,718 before reversing course to close modestly lower.
The day saw intense swings, reflecting both optimism fuelled by post-budget clarity and renewed pressure from geopolitical tensions.
Early gains were supported by improved investor sentiment, driven by the budget announcement, robust remittances and monetary policy expectations. However, the rally lost steam as the session progressed, with profit-taking in overheated stocks and geopolitical uncertainty, surrounding the Middle East, undermining sentiment.
Global equity selloffs, a slump in crude oil prices and a weakening rupee added to investor concerns.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti stated that stocks closed under pressure on geopolitical uncertainty and post-budget profit-taking in overbought shares. ""The rout in global equities on Middle East tensions, a slump in international crude oil prices and a weak rupee on contracting exports were among the key factors behind bearish close of the market,"" he added.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index lost 259.56 points, or 0.21%, and settled at 124,093.12.
KTrade Securities noted that the bourse experienced a volatile session as the KSE-100 index fluctuated between the high of 126,718 and low of 123,846, ultimately closing down 0.21% at 124,093.
Initial gains were driven by positive market sentiment following the FY26 budget, perceived as favourable for capital markets. However, rising geopolitical tensions involving Iran, Israel and the US prompted heavy profit-taking later in the day, it said.
Negative contribution mainly came from sectors such as investment banks, oil and gas, and fertiliser, where notable contractions were seen in Engro Holdings, Fauji Fertiliser, Pakistan Petroleum and OGDC.
Cement stocks saw strong buying before profit-taking set in. Given the ongoing regional uncertainties, the market outlook is likely to remain cautious, added KTrade.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Deputy Head of Trading Ali Najib wrote that the PSX witnessed a dramatic session, which led to a lower close for the KSE-100 index after hitting a record intra-day high.
The market opened strong, building on the previous session's bullish momentum and breaking key psychological levels of 125,000 and 126,000. However, profit-taking in the latter half erased gains and dragged the index into the negative territory.
The pullback comes after several sessions of aggressive rallying, largely driven by improved macroeconomic indicators and declining cut-off yields in the T-bill auction, Najib said.
Topline Securities mentioned in its review that the stock market ended on a negative note, weighed down by cautious investor sentiment and profit-taking. It attributed the downtrend largely to declines in shares of Engro Holdings, Fauji Fertiliser, Pakistan Petroleum, OGDC and Bank Alfalah, which erased 401 points from the index.
In contrast, support came from Pakgen Power, United Bank, Bank AL Habib, Lucky Cement and DG Khan Cement, which added 347 points.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the index hit a high of 126,718 before profit-taking dragged it down by 260 points. The analyst advised investors to watch for key support levels and use dips to accumulate stocks with focus on fertiliser, cement and banking sectors for near-term opportunities.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 1.02 billion shares compared with Wednesday's tally of 1.04 billion. The value of shares traded was Rs50.5 billion. Shares of 474 companies were traded. Of these, 170 stocks closed higher, 270 fell and 34 remained unchanged.
Sui Southern Gas Company was the volume leader with trading in 55.9 million shares, rising Rs0.78 to close at Rs41.92. It was followed by Fauji Cement with 50.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.49 to close at Rs47.36 and WorldCall Telecom with 49.3 million shares, falling Rs0.08 to close at Rs1.37. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs685.8 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

Passenger car sales jump 32% in 11 months,"US
Sales rise across all vehicle segments except tractors – industry seeks clarity on EV, HEV tax treatment
Passenger car sales increased by 32.1% to 94,388 units during the first 11 months of the current fiscal year compared to the same period in the previous year on account of a variety of reasons, including a dramatic fall in interest rates, back-to-back Eid festivities, anticipated price hikes ahead of the federal budget 2025-26, and others.
According to data released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA), sales of all vehicles, including two-, three-, and four-wheelers, increased; however, sales of farm tractors declined.
Sales of jeeps-cum-pickups rose by 66% to 31,706 units. Sales of trucks and buses increased by 95.7% to 3,776 units and by 73.3% to 719 units, respectively. Sales of motorcycles and rickshaws also surged by 30% to 1,378,131 units.
However, sales of farm tractors fell by a dramatic 36.8% to 26,401 units.
Automobile consultant and expert Shafiq Ahmed Shaikh said it augurs well that, excluding the tractor segment, other parts of the auto sector are gaining momentum as they are on an upward trend. This reflects that the auto industry is growing and regaining strength.
""In my opinion, there are four main reasons. First, the reduction in interest rates — different banks and financial institutions are offering good and affordable instalment schemes. Secondly, owing to information and rumours ahead of the federal budget that vehicle prices will rise, sales have increased. Thirdly, during both Eidul Fitr and Eidul Azha, sales witnessed substantial rises as customers wanted vehicles during the Eid holidays to celebrate in a better way. Finally, credit for the significant rise in vehicle sales also goes to improved law and order, which has supported the industry, along with favourable government measures allowing the industry to flourish.
In my opinion, the auto industry has the potential and capacity to grow. We foresee that the existing industry will face stronger competition from electric vehicles (EVs), as the future will mainly depend on EVs,"" he said.
Auto sector analyst Mashood Khan said all segments of the automotive industry performed well except for the tractor segment. The motorcycle industry has continuously gained strong momentum throughout the year due to the middle class, which cannot afford expensive four-wheelers. When it comes to the auto industry overall, it has started regaining strength.
Meanwhile, raising concerns about the recently announced federal budget 2025-26, MG Motors Pakistan General Manager (GM) Marketing Division Syed Asif Ahmed said the industry is seeking clarity on the budget.
Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) enjoy 8.5% GST compared to 18% on EVs. This anomaly has existed for many years, giving HEVs an advantage over EVs.
""Social media has reported an increase in the GST for HEVs from 8.5% to 18%. If true, this will jeopardise the huge investments made by almost all automakers in HEVs. The Finance Bill is silent on the subject, despite the Automotive Industry Development and Export Plan (AIDEP) 2021-26 commitment of no change in tariffs until June 2026. What is needed is for EV GST to be reduced to 8.5% to match HEVs,"" he said.
He added that used car importers are abusing the gift, baggage, and transfer of residence schemes for commercial trading. Allowing commercial imports of five-year-old used cars with reduced Regulatory Duty (RD) will distort the playing field against local assemblers.

Akram praises his statue amid social media flak,"US
Credit to the creators and full marks for effort, says former captain
Legendary Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram saluted on Thursday the ""effort"" of the artist who created a statue of him that has spawned scorn on social media.
The statue of Akram — one of the greatest left-arm fast bowlers to play the game — was installed outside the southwestern city of Hyderabad's Niaz Stadium in April.
Akram is shown bowling wearing the kit of the 1999 World Cup team, when Pakistan were runners-up.
Nearby is a statue of a tiger.
One fan mocked the statue, saying: ""The only thing that looks real is the ball,"" adding the face looked more like Hollywood hero Sylvester Stallone.
The affable Akram, however, took to social media to praise the effort.
""Lots of talk about my sculpture being erected at Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. Mine is definitely better than the tiger,"" he posted on X.
""It's the idea that matters. Credit to the creators, full marks for the effort and thanks to everyone involved.""
Australia has a history of placing statues of their iconic players outside their stadiums, while India unveiled one of master batter Sachin Tendulkar outside a stadium in Mumbai in 2023.
Niaz stadium chief Shiraz Leghari told AFP: ""The artist did his best effort, but accepts it doesn't resemble (Akram) a hundred percent.""
Akram is one of the country's most celebrated cricketers, having represented Pakistan in 104 Tests and 356 ODIs with 414 and 502 wickets respectively.
He was the leading wicket-taker in the 1992 World Cup when Pakistan claimed the trophy.
Mehidy Hasan Miraz to lead Bangladesh in ODIs
Bangladesh on Thursday named Mehidy Hasan Miraz as the new captain of the ODI team, with the 27-year-old all-rounder succeeding Najmul Hossain Shanto in white ball cricket.
Off-spinner Miraz will take up his post during Bangladesh's three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka, which begins in July, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said.
""Captaining the national team is a dream come true... this is a proud moment for me and my family,"" he said, according to a statement quoted by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
""I believe in this group — we have the skills and the mindset to play fearless cricket.""
Miraz, who has been skipper before for four ODIs as a stand in for Shanto, is ranked fourth in the world for ODI all-rounders, according to ICC rankings.
Bangladesh will also play two Tests in Sri Lanka, with the first beginning in Galle on June 17 and the second in Colombo from June 25.
Miraz will be the vice-captain for the Tests — with Shanto leading the team — as the next World Test Championship cycle begins.
Pak pacer Khurram Shahzad to play for Worcestshire
Pakistan's budding fast bowler Khurram Shahzad is set to join Worcestershire County Cricket Club in July for the remainder of the county season. The right-arm pacer will be available to play in all three formats for the Pears till the end of this season.
Hailing from district Mandi Bahuddin of Punjab, 25-year-old Khurram is often compared to South African great Dale Steyn because of similarities in bowling action and his ability to swing the ball - he made his Test debut in 2023 and so far has claimed 20 wickets in six Tests, including career-best figures of 6 for 90 against Bangladesh.
Reportedly, the former captain of Pakistan Azhar Ali played a pivotal role in the signing. Azhar Ali himself played for Worcestershire CCC in the 2022 & 2023 seasons where he briefly was part of the coaching staff too and has been instrumental in helping the club to sign cricketers from Pakistan. Previously, Pakistani leg spinner Usama Mir was also signed by Worcestershire CCC on Azhar's recommendations.
In a statement released by the club, head Coach Alan Richardson welcomed the signing, praising Shahzad's skill and international experience.
""Khurram is a fantastic signing for us,"" said Richardson. ""His ability to swing the ball and bowl consistently above 80mph adds depth to our bowling attack. Just as importantly, his presence will be invaluable for the development of our younger bowlers.""

265 perish in India's worst air disaster,"PK
Air India plane crashes on hostel in Ahmedabad; Lone survivor among 242; Dreamliner comes down seconds after takeoff
A London-bound passenger jet crashed in a residential area in the Indian city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, killing at least 265 people on board and on the ground — but one passenger is believed to have survived.
An AFP journalist saw bodies being recovered from the crash site, and the back of the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner — which had 242 passengers and crew on board— hanging over the edge of a building it hit around lunchtime.
The government opened a formal investigation into the cause of the crash, and rescue teams worked into Friday morning scouring the charred wreckage with sniffer dogs.
""The tragedy in Ahmedabad has stunned and saddened us,"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after Air India's flight 171 crashed following takeoff. ""It is heartbreaking beyond words"".
Deputy Commissioner of Police Kanan Desai told reporters said that ""265 bodies have reached the hospital"".
That suggests that at least 24 people died when the jet ploughed into a medical staff hostel in a blazing fireball — and that the toll may rise further as more bodies are located.
But while everyone aboard the flight was initially feared killed, state health official Dhananjay Dwivedi told AFP ""one survivor is confirmed"" and had been hospitalised.
The AFP journalist saw a building ablaze after the crash, with thick black smoke billowing into the air, and a section of the plane on the ground.
""One half of the plane crashed into the residential building where doctors lived with their families,"" said Krishna, a doctor who did not give his full name.
""The nose and front wheel landed on the canteen building where students were having lunch,"" he said.
Krishna said he saw ""about 15 to 20 burnt bodies"", while he and his colleagues rescued around 15 students.
India's civil aviation authority said two pilots and 10 cabin crew were among the 242 people on board. Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese, and a Canadian on board the flight bound for London's Gatwick airport.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the scenes from the crash were ""devastating"", while the country's King Charles III said he was ""desperately shocked"".
The survivor is believed to be 40-year-old Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, one of the British passengers.
India's Home Minister Amit Shah told reporters he had heard the ""good news of the survivor"" and was speaking to them ""after meeting him"".
The BBC and Britain's Press Association news agency spoke to the reported survivor's family members.
""He said, I have no idea how I exited the plane"", his brother Nayan Kumar Ramesh, 27, told PA in the British city of Leicester.
The plane issued a mayday call and ""crashed immediately after takeoff"", the Directorate General of Civil Aviation said.
Ahmedabad, the main city of India's Gujarat state, is home to around eight million people and the busy airport is surrounded by densely packed residential areas.
""When we reached the spot, there were several bodies lying around and firefighters were dousing the flames,"" resident Poonam Patni told AFP.
""Many of the bodies were burned,"" she said.
The AFP journalist saw medics using a cart to load bodies into an ambulance, while a charred metal bed frame stood surrounded by burnt wreckage.
US planemaker Boeing said it was in touch with Air India and stood ""ready to support them"" over the incident, which a source close to the case said was the first crash for a 787 Dreamliner.
The UK and US air accident investigation agencies announced they were dispatching teams to support their Indian counterparts.
Tata Group, owners of Air India, offered financial aid of 10 million rupees ($117,000) to ""the families of each person who has lost their life in this tragedy"", as well as funds to cover medical expenses of those injured.
India has suffered a series of fatal air crashes, including a 1996 disaster when two jets collided mid-air over New Delhi, killing nearly 350 people.
In 2010, an Air India Express jet crashed and burst into flames at Mangalore airport in southwest India, killing 158 of the 166 passengers and crew on board.
Experts said it was too early to speculate on what may have caused Thursday's crash.
""It is very unlikely that the plane was overweight or carrying too much fuel,"" said Jason Knight, senior lecturer in fluid mechanics at the University of Portsmouth.
""The aircraft is designed to be able to fly on one engine, so the most likely cause of the crash is a double engine failure. The most likely cause of a double engine failure is a bird strike.""
India's airline industry has boomed in recent years with Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), last month calling it ""nothing short of phenomenal"".
The growth of its economy has made India and its 1.4 billion people the world's fourth-largest air marketdomestic and international — with IATA projecting it will become the third biggest within the decade.

122m forcibly displaced worldwide 'untenably high': UN,"US
More than 1.5 million Syrians have been able to return home
The number of people forcibly displaced from their homes worldwide has dropped slightly from a record peak but remains ""untenably high"", the United Nations said Thursday.
A record 123.2 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced from their homes at the end of 2024, said UNHCR, the UN refugee agency.
But that figure dropped to 122.1 million by the end of April this year, as Syrians began returning home after years of turmoil.
More than 1.5 million Syrians have been able to return home from abroad or from displacement within the war-ravaged country.
But the UNHCR warned that the course of major conflicts worldwide would determine whether the figure would rise again.
The agency said the number of people displaced by war, violence and persecution worldwide was ""untenably high"", particularly in a period when humanitarian funding is evaporating.
""We are living in a time of intense volatility in international relations, with modern warfare creating a fragile, harrowing landscape marked by acute human suffering,"" said Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
""We must redouble our efforts to search for peace and find long-lasting solutions for refugees and others forced to flee their homes.""
The main drivers of displacement remain sprawling conflicts like those in Sudan, Myanmar and Ukraine, UNHCR said in its flagship annual Global Trends Report.
Syria's brutal civil war erupted in 2011 but ruler Bashar al-Assad was finally overthrown in December 2024.
The report said rising numbers of Syrians have since been able to return to their homes.
As of mid-May, more than 500,000 Syrians are estimated to have crossed back into the country since the fall of Assad, while an estimated 1.2 million internally displaced people (IDPs) have returned to their areas of origin since the end of November.
UNHCR estimates that up to 1.5 million Syrians from abroad and two million IDPs may return by the end of 2025.
Sudan is now the world's largest forced displacement situation with 14.3 million refugees and IDPs, overtaking Syria (13.5 million), which is followed by Afghanistan (10.3 million) and Ukraine (8.8 million).
""During the remainder of 2025, much will depend on the dynamics in key situations,"" the annual report said, including whether peace or ceasefires can be reached in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and Ukraine.
It also depends on whether conditions for returns improve in Afghanistan and Syria.

Egypt detains over 200 activists ahead of Gaza aid march,"RO
The detainees included people from Algeria, Australia, France, Morocco, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United States
Egyptian authorities have detained more than 200 pro-Palestinian activists in Cairo ahead of an international march aiming to break Israel's blockade on Gaza, organisers said Thursday.
Thousands of people taking part in the Global March to Gaza planned to travel to Egypt's Rafah border crossing with the Palestinian territory on Friday to call for increased humanitarian aid access.
""Over 200 participants were detained at Cairo airport or questioned at hotels across Cairo,"" the march's spokesperson, Saif Abukeshek, told AFP.
The detainees included people from Algeria, Australia, France, Morocco, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States, he said.
Plainclothes officers entered Cairo hotels on Wednesday with lists of names, questioning activists, and in some cases, confiscating phones and searching personal belongings, said Abukeshek.
""After interrogations, some were arrested and others were released.""
At Cairo airport, some detainees were held for hours without explanation, Abukeshek said, adding others were deported, without specifying how many.
More than 20 French activists who had planned to join the march were held at Cairo airport for 18 hours, he said.
""What happened was completely unexpected,"" Abukeshek said.
Footage shared with AFP showed dozens of people with their luggage crammed inside a holding room at the airport.
""We're locked up here in this room with so many people -- some 30-40 people,"" a German national said in one video. ""I called the embassy and they told me their people are trying to figure things out,"" she said.
Another video obtained by AFP shows more than 30 people aboard a deportation flight from Cairo chanting in French: ""The world is with you... Gaza... Gaza"".

She stated in a message on the World Day Against Child Labour, ""The Punjab government is taking effective measures against child labour. Children are being freed from forced labour and driven towards attaining education.""
According to a statement, a team of experts in the virtual centre is tasked with carrying out search operations for missing children, getting in touch with their families and verifying their credentials. The centre has proven effective in bringing back home not only missing children but also elderly people. A helpline has been activated for missing children and citizens of other provinces as well.
At least 59,635 people have so far contacted the Virtual Safety Centre to complain about missing persons, of which 53,542 cases have been resolved.
The chief minister highlighted, ""Whether children belong to Punjab or any other province, they are all dear to us."" She maintained, ""In case of disappearance, we are determined to fulfill our responsibility of bringing every child home safe and sound. Every citizen of the country can benefit from Pakistan's first Virtual Centre for Child Safety."" She outlined, ""We are ready to utilise all available state resources for the safe return of missing children.""
On the other hand, only 37 per cent of the total 895 cases of child labour reported across the country in 2024 resulted in convictions. This was revealed in the Sustainable Social Development Organisation's (SSDO) annual report.
Punjab reported the highest number of cases at 450, followed closely by Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa with 426. In contrast, Sindh and Balochistan showed alarmingly low reporting rates.
SSDO Executive Director Syed Kausar Abbas said that child labour is not just a legal violation but a moral crisis that endangers the very fabric of the society. He said child labour is a crime that extinguishes the hopes and potential of future generations. ""It is a stain on our conscience and we cannot move forward as a nation while allowing our children to be trapped in cycles of exploitation.""
He emphasised the urgent need for the government to strengthen child protection institutions and implement a cohesive national strategy to address the root causes of child labour.
""We need a coordinated, inter-provincial policy framework, backed by modern technology to identify risks early and ensure timely intervention,"" he added. He also called for greater investment in education and social welfare to ensure that every child has the opportunity to grow in a safe and nurturing environment.
Meanwhile, the Dolphin Squad rescued a teenage girl who had been kidnapped from Ravi Road and arrested the suspected abductor.
According to a spokesperson, an operation was conducted in the Kot Kamboh area, where the squad rescued the girl and apprehended the suspect.
According to the police, the girl had been kidnapped on May 23 by 25-year-old Junaid from Sham Pura. The kidnapping case was registered at Ravi Road police station.
""The Dolphin Squad conducted a targeted operation based on intelligence reports and traced the victim to Kot Kamboh,"" said the spokesperson.
The team informed the girl's parents about her recovery and transferred her to Nawan Kot police station for legal proceedings regarding the case.
The arrested suspect will be presented before a magistrate and the investigation is ongoing.

JSM stages strike against lawlessness,"US
June 15 protest to push for action against bandits, kidnappers and drug traffickers
A shutter-down strike was observed in Kashmore-Kandhkot district on Thursday on the call of Jeay Sindh Mahaz (JSM), in response to the relentless kidnappings, robberies, and extortion crimes in Larkana and Sukkur.
JSM Chairman Riaz Ali Chandio also announced province-wide peaceful protests on June 15, in order to compel the government to take action against bandits and elements involved in the trade of narcotics. He lamented that a student of class three, Rohit Kumar, was kidnapped and killed on June 5 in Shikarpur while another child, Anas Kamran Thaeem, remains a hostage of dacoits.
The chairman deemed Kumar's murder a reason behind Thursday's strike, stating that outlaws fearlessly display weapons and convey their threats in recorded videos, but the province's policemen and rangers remain unable to hunt them.
Further, Chandio blamed the provincial government of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) for patronising the bandits of the province's riverbed and forest areas. He said the people of Sindh, especially those living in the Sukkur and Larkana divisions, retain the right to live peacefully in their abodes, neighbourhoods, towns and villages.

Eid and Gaza,"US
IPC Scale5 level means extreme food insecurity and nutritional deprivation
Every day when you open the news, Israel has killed 30, 40 or 50 more Palestinians in Gaza. The death toll has risen to 54,500. The UN has warned that as of now, Gaza is the ""hungriest place on Earth"" and its entire population is at risk of famine. WHO says, ""Three quarters of Gaza's population are at IPC Scale 5 level of food deprivation labelled 'Emergency' or 'Catastrophic'.""
IPC Scale5 level means extreme food insecurity and nutritional deprivation. It has been one year and eight months since the Gazans are being zigzagged from the north to the south and back again. No Gazan family has a roof on their heads, all are in make-shift tents. Food, that was always rationed to them by Israel, as they live in the world's biggest open-air prison, is now being used by Israel as a 'weapon of war'.
Trucks full of food stand across the borders, and when the least number of trucks are allowed in, the food reaches the Gazans via tight cage-ways where the desperate Palestinians scramble in only to face more abuse, more humiliation; only to return without any food; and only to be gunned down by the barbarian and brazen Israeli gunmen.
So, this was the Eid-ul-Azha celebration in Gaza; not a celebration of joy and festivity, but a celebration of pain, fear and terror. The pain of sickness and injuries, the fear of being dragged out of their tents once again, the fear of not returning to their homes ever, the fear of not having food for the children, and the terror of being bombed at from the air or their loved-ones being shot at by a sniper.
The question is, do 'we' share a responsibility? Responsibility as the Muslim Ummah, wherein Pakistan stands as the 12th most powerful military of the world and Turkey stands as the 7th; wherein Turkey, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Malaysia, Iran, Egypt and Pakistan fall in the riches top quarter of world nations by GDP.
Do we have a responsibility to reach the hungry with food, to reach the sick with medics, and to reach the terrorised with protection? Last month when Trump visited the Gulf states, everybody was expecting a breakthrough in the Gaza War. But in spite of all the peace talks in the background, what we saw was Trump securing deals totaling more than $2 trillion for the US; Qatar gifting him a $400 million luxury aircraft; and the UAE awarding him the country's highest civilian honour, the Order of Zayed.
Is that how you trophy the best friend and abettor of the nation that is inflicting apartheid, genocide and disproportional warfare, in real-time, upon the Palestinians? The Ummah is confused and anxious. Is this all a big face-saving with actually a huge plan for Palestine under the table; or is it vice versa?
And what about the rest of the humanity, what about the civilised, democratised, humanised West? Let alone their corrupt political elite that has exploited their own people and all of humanity, wherever their plundering hands could reach, what about those who raise the banner of genuine, candid, righteousness, the truth-tellers of their times, acclaimed by millions around the world!
Truth-tellers like Jordan Peterson, who tweeted on 7th Oct, 'give 'em hell @netanyahu, enough is enough'. When asked later, he made apologies about not have understood 'twitter' well enough. Imagine, a renowned psychologist and author, habitual of going into great lengths and complex depths to convince his audience upon his views, saying Twitter is complicated and difficult to use! And still after a year and a half, not being able to say that whatever atrocities were committed by Hamas, on Oct 7, were preceded by decades and decades of oppression that was being continuously inflicted upon the Palestinians by the Israelites.
Rather, later interviewing Netanyahu, he actually validated the insane Jewish narrative that in 1948 the Jews came into an empty land in which the Arabs were doing nothing, the Jews did something there, which created the ""valid legal claim to the property itself"". It's amazing that an avid reader and researcher, as Peterson, is unable to read through Palestinian history.
The Palestinians had started agitation against the Jewish Aliyah from the beginning in the 1880s; they were politically organised and kept writing to the Ottoman Sultan and the Arab Congress about how the Jews were buying out their lands and exploiting their situation, but the British and Jewish lobbies had penetrated the Sultan's court.
Later in 1919, they made their own Arab Palestine Congress, but the British simply did not recognise it, because they had conspired with the Jews to hand them over someone else's homeland. The Jews are habitual of lying, but what would force Peterson to do the same? Nothing could make Peterson lie! Except if he convinces himself that that lie is actually the truth!
Douglas Murray, another popular British political commentator, in a recent interview said, all the ""international critics of Israel, don't know what they're talking about"", and like the fanatic Zionists in Israel's cabinet, said in a repressive tone that ""100% Hamas has to be put out, and when that happens the citizens of Gaza may have the opportunity to rebuild!"" In spite of the interviewer's reminders of how the UN and other aid organisations are constantly pointing to a famine in Gaza, he insisted that Israel is so morally upright that it is providing more than required food into Gaza.
This was just to demonstrate that all the civil makeover and all the Oxford and Harvard degrees do not replace humanitarianism for barbarianism; nor do they change zealots into unbiased moderates.
The West has exploited and oppressed our people for centuries, and still today, their 'democratised' sages can pretend that the oppressed are the oppressors. It is time to stop looking towards the West for civilised models, rather it is time to find values in the real beacons of truth and justice.
""And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship, and whose affairs are a matter of counsel, and who spend of what We have bestowed on them. And those who, when great wrong is done to them, defend themselves,"" Ash-Shura, 42: 38, 39.
This is the true civility and moral high ground upon which the Muslim Ummah should focus. The leaders of the Ummah should reckon that progress and billion-dollar trade-deals come after justice and peace for their people not before them.

GDP figure based on old data,"AE
PBS assumed full PSDP utilisation despite actual spending falling short, NA told
Pakistan's Chief Statistician Dr Naeemuz Zafar said Thursday that the 2.7% economic growth estimate for this fiscal year is based on a 15-year-old livestock survey and assumes full utilisation of the Rs1.1 trillion development budget.
While responding to questions about the controversy over this year's economic growth figure along with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Dr Zafar claimed that there would be no major downward revision in the 2.7% figure for the outgoing fiscal year.
Iqbal also proposed a new formula for resource distribution under the National Finance Commission (NFC), moving away from the current population-centric model.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS)'s chief statistician called objections to the 2.7% growth rate ""unfortunate"" and said if a committee is formed to investigate, the PBS is ready to appear.
The government claims a 2.7% GDP growth this year, which independent economists have disputed, estimating it to be closer to 2%. A major objection concerns the 4.8% livestock sector growth.
The livestock sector's 4.8% growth was based on a survey conducted back in 2010, admitted Dr Zafar, adding that there was no deviation from the standard methodology.
When asked how the agriculture sector showed 0.6% growth despite a 14% output decline in major crops, Dr Zafar said the growth was driven by livestock, forestry and minor crops.
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth figure has been worked out in a transparent manner by following a methodology endorsed by the United Nations and the international financial institutions, he said.
He also confirmed a new agriculture and livestock census has been completed but awaits the planning minister's approval due to his budget commitments.
He added that the Household Integrated Economic Survey, Labour Force Survey, and agriculture census would be ready by October for the next National Accounts Committee (NAC) meeting.
Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan raised the disputed GDP issue during the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance meeting held on Thursday.
In a statement, the statistician also stated PBS used the full Rs1.1 trillion federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) figure for GDP calculationshighlighting a glaring methodological flaw.
However, Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal told the same committee that against the Rs1.1 trillion PSDP allocation, only Rs662 billion had been spent so far. He added that by June-end, spending would remain below the revised Rs967 billion figure.
When asked whether the GDP would be drastically revised in the next NAC meeting, Dr Zafar again said no major revision was expected.
Speaking at the meeting, the planning minister said the country was on a path to steady economic recovery with a goal of sustainable economic growth.
Iqbal added that Pakistan continues to face structural problems of fiscal constraints. Due to limited space, next year's federal PSDP will be just 0.8% of GDPdown from 2.6% seven years ago.
The planning minister noted that the federal government's Rs11 trillion net revenues were barely enough to cover defence and debt servicing.
""With limited tax contributions, people cannot hope for international standard facilities,"" said Iqbal.
He also called for reforming the NFC award by shifting away from the predominantly population-based distribution formula with broader indicators like education and forestation. Iqbal is the second federal minister after the finance minister to propose a shift in the NFC criteria this week.
Currently, 82% of total resources are allocated based on population, which Iqbal argued incentivises population growth, harming national interests.
He said the Planning Commission would recommend shifting to a broader formula that rewards education and forest preservation.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he added, has decided to constitute a Pakistan Population Council, comprising provincial chief ministers, to design strategies for population control.
Pakistan's annual population growth rate stands at 2.6% — nearly equal to this year's GDP growth rate.
Responding to a question whether the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) took him into confidence before imposing taxes on the digital economy, Iqbal said these were levied with the intent to create a level playing field for conventional retailers.
Commenting on the upcoming PSDP, Iqbal said Rs230 billion had been allocated for Balochistan projects from the Rs1 trillion envelope. Despite limited resources, the government would invest more in water reservoirs.
He said Diamer Basha Dam with 6 million acre-feet capacity and Mohmand Dam with 1 million acre-feet would be completed by 2030 to mitigate water shortages caused by potential Indian efforts to block Pakistan's share of water.
Iqbal added that construction of Diamer Basha Dam would be advanced by two years with increased investment, aiming for completion by 2030 in response to regional water developments.
Due to budget constraints, funding for the Higher Education Commission (HEC) has been reduced to Rs39.5 billion. Iqbal suggested provinces should bear the responsibility of funding universities.

Stoic Roman emperor subject of new exhibition,"US
Oft-quoted Marcus Aurelius sees new online popularity
How do you keep calm in times of crisis? What do people need to be happy? Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius is often quoted online for answers. This once-powerful man would have preferred to be a philosopher.
""Look within. Within is the fountain of good, and it will ever bubble up, if thou wilt ever dig.""
As reported by DW, wise statements like this can be found in the 'Meditations' of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE). He had never intended these reflections for publication, having written them purely for himself, but they have become some of the most widely read writings after the Bible and the Quran. A bestseller, so to speak, which has been translated into numerous languages worldwide.
Known today as a philosopher-king, Marcus Aurelius ruled at a time marked by crises and catastrophes. He ascended to the throne in 161 CE, just a few years before the Marcomannic Wars (166-180 CE) – the Marcomanni were Germanic tribes – which would shake the Roman Empire to its foundations.
Good governance
Archaeologist Marcus Reuter – director of the Rheinisches Landesmuseum – and historian Viola Skiba – director of the Stadtmuseum Simeonstift in Trier, Germany – have co-curated a joint exhibition, in each of their institutions, on Marcus Aurelius, set to run from June 15 to November 23, 2025. Skiba said the themes of the exhibition are more current than they had anticipated.
The question of what good leadership looks like has taken on a new urgency, especially in these crisis-ridden and polarised times. At the same time, the question is as old as human history itself, and was clearly a focus in the ancient world.
What, according to Marcus Aurelius, distinguishes good governance? ""Basically, it is guided by the cardinal virtues of antiquity,"" said Skiba. Those desirable virtues include wisdom, justice, prudence and moderation.
Reuter added that Marcus Aurelius would most likely have considered Donald Trump ""not a good leader, and certainly not a role model.""
But of course, Marcus Aurelius was a product of his time, who grew up within the social structures of antiquity, including acceptance of slavery, unequal rights and brutal wars. But ""... he always put the interests of the state first,"" added Reuter.
The construction of the Porta Nigra in Trier — today the city's famous landmark - can also be traced back to Marcus Aurelius. It was part of the city wall that Aurelius had built to protect its citizens.
Relevance
Aphorisms like the above can seem like mockery coming from a wealthy emperor, but they were meant sincerely. Indeed, Marcus Aurelius cultivated a rather modest lifestyle and even had imperial household items – his private assets – auctioned off when the state was in financial crisis.
""As far as I know, no Roman emperor before or after him did that,"" said Reuter.
Marcus Aurelius also apparently spent a lot of time pondering the meaning of life, which is presumably the reason so many young people nowadays are interested in him and his writings. In Reuter's estimation, ""his 'Meditations' are a little treasure trove containing something to address nearly every situation in life.""
Reuter pointed out that Marcus Aurelius' writings don't lend themselves to being read from front to back, but are well-suited to dipping into to find inspiration. They are, after all, the private musings of someone who spent time thinking about what was truly important in life. So it's small wonder that quotes by the Roman emperor can be found all over social media.
The exhibition in Trier builds on this contemporary interest in Marcus Aurelius and the topics that occupied him. It's designed to inspire visitors from all over the world to reflect on themselves, society and what a long-ago Roman emperor still has to say to us today.
Or, as Skiba put it, ""Every society is based on individuals, and if each and every individual asks themselves these philosophical and political questions, then it also works as a whole.""

Brian Wilson of Beach Boys dies aged 82,"US
Pop visionary had crafted the group's biggest hits
Brian Wilson, the Beach Boys co-founder who masterminded the group's wild popularity and soundtracked the California dream, has died, his family announced on Wednesday, as reported by AFP. He was 82.
The statement on Instagram did not give a cause. Wilson was placed under a legal conservatorship last year due to a ""major neurocognitive disorder.""
""We are at a loss for words right now,"" said his family. ""We realize that we are sharing our grief with the world.""
The pop visionary crafted hits whose success rivaled The Beatles throughout the 1960s, a seemingly inexhaustible string of feel-good tracks including Surfin' USA, I Get Around, Fun, Fun, Fun and Surfer Girl that made the Beach Boys into America's biggest selling band.
Wilson didn't surf, but his prodigious pen and genius ear allowed him to fashion a boundary-pushing soundscape of beachside paradise.
His lush productions were revered among his peers, with even Bob Dylan once saying, ""That ear – I mean, Jesus, he's got to will that to the Smithsonian!""
Dylan also paid tribute to Wilson on Wednesday, posting on X ""about all the years I've been listening to him and admiring his genius. Rest in peace dear Brian.""
After five years of extraordinary songwriting, in which he produced 200 odes to sun, surfing and suntanned girls, Wilson sank into a deep, drug-fuelled depression for decades.
He would emerge 35 years later to complete the Beach Boys' unfinished album, Smile – widely regarded as his masterpiece.
John Lennon said he considered Pet Sounds (1966) to be one of the best albums of all time, while Paul McCartney said Wilson was a ""genius"".
The musician's many accolades included a Kennedy Center Honor in 2007, when the committee dubbed him ""rock and roll's gentlest revolutionary.""
""There is real humanity in his body of work,"" they said, ""vulnerable and sincere, authentic and unmistakably American.""

K-P to unveil Rs21b health outlay,"US
Ongoing, new projects target dialysis, ICUs, oxygen plants, and child diabetes care
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has proposed an allocation of over Rs21.31 billion for the health sector in the upcoming Annual Development Program (ADP) for the fiscal year 2025-26.
According to official documents, Rs16.66 billion has been earmarked for ongoing health projects, while Rs4.65 billion is proposed for new development schemes in the health sector.
For settled districts, Rs13.5 billion has been proposed, while Rs3.48 billion is allocated for health projects in the merged districts. Additionally, Rs4.67 billion is proposed under the Accelerated Implementation Program (AIP) aimed at fast-tracking healthcare improvements in underdeveloped areas.
Key initiatives likely to be included in the new budget are the enhancement of dialysis services in designated hospitals, upgrades to ICU, HDU, and emergency services, and the installation of centralized oxygen-generating plants in hospitals across the merged districts.
A new initiative for hemophilia patients is also planned, wherein 50 per cent of treatment costs will be covered by the government and the remaining 50 per cent by non-governmental organisations (NGOs). For the first time, a diabetes control program targeting young children is being introduced in the development budget.
Furthermore, a performance-based payment scheme for human resource hiring in the health sector has also been proposed.
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government is set to present a Rs2,000 billion budget on Friday, with over Rs1,800 billion allocated for current expenditures. The budget will show a surplus of Rs180 billion and will not introduce any new taxes. However, the scope and rate of existing taxes will be expanded.
A total of Rs433 billion has been earmarked for development projects, including funds for the development of the newly merged tribal districts. The government will also announce the imposition of an ""education emergency"" in the new fiscal year. Under this initiative, furniture will be provided to 100 per cent of public schools.
To boost its own revenues, the province has set a 40 per cent higher target for provincial tax collection compared to the current fiscal year. The new budget includes the establishment of four additional cardiac centers in addition to the existing ones, as well as special funds for the merged districts.
Measures to support the province's vulnerable, marginalized, and low-income populations are also part of the budget. Funding has been allocated for key infrastructure and welfare projects including the Peshawar-DI Khan Motorway, a new electricity transmission line, the establishment of an insurance company, and the Chashma Right Bank Canal.
Safe City projects in Peshawar, Bannu, and DI Khan will receive financial support, and the education budget is being increased by 13 per cent. The monthly honorarium for artists will also be raised from Rs100,000 to Rs150,000.
A significant portion of the development budget will focus on completing ongoing projects. Priority will be given to projects that are 80 per cent or more complete, followed by those with 60 per cent completion. The number of new development projects has been capped at 500, with Rs195 billion to be immediately released, and up to Rs250 billion allocated as needed.
For the first time, a special committee will be formed to approve projects based on priority and necessity. The budget will continue to prioritize the education, health, and social welfare sectors. Additionally, the 13-year throw-forward period for the Annual Development Program (ADP) will be reduced to seven years. A safari park is also planned for Misri Banda in Nowshera as part of the new fiscal year's initiatives.

Beauty and brains are a lethal combination that can spark insecurity in others
Dear Dr Rahat,
Many congratulations on the successful reception of Beyond the Self. I have not seen any artist presenting self-portraits in such a number and variety recently. In our times, the rise of selfies and social media has led to increased scrutiny of self-portraits. Some may view these as a symptom of narcissism. The case worsens if the artist is a fair-skinned, tasteful lady.
I remember you sharing your experience of how looks and social standing may steal the credit for all the hard work and intellect in the eyes of the envious. Beauty and brains are a lethal combination that can spark insecurity in others.
The first two things the viewer of the collection, Beyond the Self, notices are the attractive personality of the sitter and the skillful hand of the painter. This impression fades away pretty quickly. The second glance makes one realise that the portraits do not do complete justice nor do they fully capture the warmth of your personality. Some works do not even look like representations of the same person. Such incongruity can be explained in many ways.
Firstly, as Gombrich would say, ""Making comes before matching, creation before reference."" Or maybe in terms of maturing and constantly evolving personalities and identities as a result of socio-cultural and political scenarios. Overall, the portraits reveal quiet reflections and evolving identities as the main subject. The title of the collection aptly suggests a similar mindset, making portraits the quintessential representation of the slogan, ""The personal is political"".
Iqbal said, ""Apne mann mein doob kar pa ja suragh-e zindagi"" meaning that everything you need is already inside you: you need to take a start. Studying oneself to understand the mysteries of nature is a phenomenon. Using oneself as a vessel to document and illustrate the surroundings and situations is courageous. This is what you have done daringly. The concept of self-exploration and its connection to the broader world has fascinated many.
Al-Ghazali's words resonate with the idea in the most poetic way. ""In a word, there is nothing closer to you than you. If you do not know yourself, how can you know anything else? ... You must seek out the truth about yourself: What sort of a thing are you? Where did you come from? Where are you going? Why have you come to this stopping place? For what purpose were you created? What is your happiness and what is your misery and where does that lie?""
In his book, The Alchemy of Happiness, he emphasises that true happiness is achieved through self-knowledge and spiritual purification. It suggests that understanding one's true nature as a spiritual being obscured by worldly desires is the key to unlocking lasting happiness. Purifying the heart through moral discipline and eliminating selfish desires ultimately lead to a deeper connection with divine guidance.
Such a cause elevates the status of art and creativity to a spiritual practice. In this context, painting becomes a form of meditation. This is how your portraits differ from the mindless duplication and random capture of camera selfies.
In the history of art, artists have approached self-portraiture in unique ways. My favourites, before you, have been Rembrandt and Munch. The conviction towards creativity and artmaking sets Rembrandt apart from Munch, with over 40 known self-portraits attributed to the first and around 80 to the latter. Rembrandt seems to be preoccupied with experimentation in painting techniques, developing the illustrious 'Rembrandt Patch'.
Munch's work is a direct reflection of his personality, biographical events and different stages of his mental trajectory. Munch sought to feel validated through his art with an ambition of seeing his work exhibited in every important room and museum. Your aesthetic ideals are somewhere in between the two extremes. They are closer to reality.
They signify the compact realities of our times. Along with the inherent quest for divine connection and mastering representational techniques, there is a reflection of inner-state inkling with the socio-political integer. In this course of action, celebration and validation come naturally as one of the major concerns of portraiture.
Sincerely,
Bano

Death toll in S Africa floods rises to 78,"US
The worst-hit area was around the city of Mthatha
South Africa rescue teams recovered more bodies Thursday, days after heavy rains and strong winds battered the Eastern Cape province, as the death toll rose to at least 78.
The bitterly cold winter storm struck the largely rural and underdeveloped province on Monday, causing a river to burst its banks and submerge homes, with several make-shift dwellings toppled.
The worst-hit area was around the city of Mthatha, about 800 kilometres (500 miles) south of Johannesburg, where residents picked through the mud three days later to salvage what they could from their destroyed homes.
AFP journalists saw a rescue team pull four bodies, some of them children, from a one-roomed house in the late afternoon as locals watched.
Houses, trees and cars were covered in mud and fields were strewn with debris.
""As the water subsides, more bodies are being discovered,"" said Caroline Gallant, Eastern Cape manager at the South African Red Cross Society, which has sent assistance to the disaster zone.

PHC seeks answers on Hayatabad crime surge,"US
Petition cites daily robberies, poor policing and Safe City delays
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has issued notices to the Chief Secretary, Inspector General of Police, Commissioner Peshawar, and other relevant officials in response to a petition highlighting the worsening law and order situation in the upscale Hayatabad locality.
The case was heard by a two-member bench comprising Justice Sahibzada Asadullah and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal.
During the proceedings, petitioner Advocate Muhammad Hamdan informed the court that serious crimes, including street robberies, burglaries, extortion, theft, and armed muggings, have become a daily occurrence in Hayatabad. He noted that with a population exceeding one million, the area is served by only two police stations.
The petitioner further stated that criminals often escape by crossing the boundary wall into Khyber district, complicating police efforts due to jurisdictional challenges. He also pointed out that the Safe City Project has not yet been completed, leaving the area increasingly vulnerable.
Advocate Hamdan urged the court to order the establishment of additional police stations in Hayatabad and to direct authorities to take concrete steps to restore law and order.
In response, the court issued notices to the Chief Secretary, IG Police, Commissioner Peshawar, and other stakeholders, demanding a detailed reply.

Tuchel wants Bellingham to inspire England,"US
He suffered his first defeat in four games as England boss against Senegal
England manager Thomas Tuchel is determined to harness Jude Bellingham's ""fire"" to his side's advantage rather than the Real Madrid star intimidating team-mates or raging at referees.
Tuchel suffered his first defeat in four games as England boss on Tuesday when Senegal became the first African side to ever beat the Three Lions in a 3-1 friendly win.
Bellingham thought he had made it 2-2 late on at Nottingham Forest's City Ground only for the goal to be controversially disallowed before Senegal broke away for a third in stoppage time.
Tuchel had to restrain Bellingham's protests at the decision at full-time and said it is a balancing act to retain the 21-year-old's fight without it bubbling over.
""He has a certain something and brings an edge. It's needed if we want to achieve big things,"" Tuchel told talkSPORT.
""It needs to be channelled towards the opponent and towards our goal, and not to intimidate team-mates or be aggressive towards team-mates or referees but always on winning.
""He has the fire — I don't want to dim that, he should play with that as that's his strength.
""But the fire comes also with some attribute that can intimidate team-mates. Sometimes you see the explosion towards referees and the anger in his game.
""If he can channel this in the right way he has something that we need and that edge is hard to find.""
Tuchel, who won the Champions League at Chelsea and league titles with Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, was hired with the task of ending England's wait for a major tournament victory since 1966.
Under Gareth Southgate they reached the final of each of the last two Euros, plus a quarter-final and semi-final of the past two World Cups.
Tuchel has a richly talented squad to choose from but has so far failed to find the right blend in three underwhelming World Cup qualifying wins over Albania, Latvia and Andorra before the Senegal defeat.
""I already have an idea of what to do,"" he added with one year to go till the 2026 World Cup begins.
""We did some experiments in the second camp, not everything was bad, we did some good things but the two games were not good enough.
""It was a good learning and it brings clarity. Each game is a learning situation and helps us mould the team and find solutions.""

US lawmakers approve $9b of Elon Musk's federal cuts,"PL
Legislation to grab back money already approved by Congress
US lawmakers on Thursday approved a White House request to claw back $9.4 billion from funding already allocated by Congress in a victory for President Donald Trump as he pushes to lock in spending cuts spearheaded by tech billionaire Elon Musk.
The vote in the Republican-led US House of Representatives was seen as the first test of how easily Congress could usher into law savings sought by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — just days after his acrimonious exit from the government.
But the saved funds — targeting public broadcasting and foreign aid -- were unpopular in some sections of both parties, and Republicans in the House of Representatives shoehorned the bill through a razor-thin 214-212 vote. ""Under President Trump's leadership, your taxpayer dollars are no longer being wasted,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement.
""Instead, they are being directed toward priorities that truly benefit the American people.""
Legislation to grab back money already approved by Congress — known as a ""rescissions package"" —  is extremely rare and no such measure had passed in decades.
The vote was the first in what Johnson has touted as a potential series of packages codifying the cuts made by DOGE.
Musk was tasked by Trump with leading the task force after spending $290 million helping the Republican get elected.

Who raised parliament custodians' salaries,"US
Shehbaz Sharif takes notice, orders an inquiry
The country's defense minister, Khawaja Asif, started the controversy on Wednesday as he decried a phenomenal raise in the salaries and allowances of the custodians of the upper and lower houses of parliament.
""The massive increase in the salaries and financial perks of the (National Assembly) speaker, deputy speaker, Senate chairperson and deputy chairperson falls under the category of financial obscenity,"" Asif said in a post on X.
""Please keep the life of the common man in mind - our honour and dignity are all owed to him (the common man),"" the minister who belongs to the ruling PML-N added.
A report citing sources said Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani, who belongs to the PPP, presided over a meeting of the House Finance Committee a few months back to approve a phenomenal raise in his own salary as well as that of the deputy chairman, Sardar Syedaal Khan Nasar, who belong to the PML-N
Similarly, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq of the PML-N chaired a meeting of the NA's House Finance Committee to ""quietly"" greenlight a raise in his own salary and that of the NA deputy speaker, a post held by PPP's Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah.
After these approvals, the salary and allowances received by each of the parliamentary officials increased from a little more than Rs200,000 to around Rs2 million. This controversy whipped up a storm with the prime minister taking notice and ordering an inquiry.
The National Assembly and Senate secretariat, however, later denied reports that the custodians of the upper and lower houses approved this increase on their own, claiming that only the PM and his cabinet have the authority to approve such raises and the government approved this raise.
A gazette notification issued by the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on May 29 for the increase in salaries of the NA speaker and the deputy speaker and the Senate chairman and deputy chairman also came to the fore on Thursday.
According to this notification, amendments had been made to the Salaries and Allowances Act of the Speaker and Senate Chairman, while discretionary allowances had also been increased by 50%.
Interestingly, the government has also proposed an increase in salaries for members of parliament and the federal cabinet in the new budget. According to the budget documents, an allocation of Rs16.29 billion has been proposed for the National Assembly and Rs9.05 billion for the Senate.
According to the details obtained by The Express Tribune, the Chief Justice of Pakistan's gross salary is Rs2,815,387 while the gross salary of each Supreme Court judge is Rs2,747,361.
The chief justices of high courts receive a gross salary of Rs2,653,418 while the total salary of each of the high court judges is Rs2,606,000.
The gross salary of a federal secretary is Rs818,000, while a chief secretary gets Rs1,401,000. The salary of an inspector general of police is Rs1,045,000 while each member of the National Assembly and Senate receives a gross salary of Rs705,000.
In the proposed budget, Rs5.08 billion has been allocated for salaries and allowances of the MNAs — Rs2.58 billion specifically for salaries, Rs2.5 billion for travel expenses, Rs1.24 billion for the allowances of standing committee chairpersons, and Rs393.4 million for salaries and allowances of the NA speaker and deputy speaker.

Govt urged to take back harsh tax steps,"US
FPCCI says country needs investment-friendly, growth-oriented fiscal framework
The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has called on the government to withdraw what it says are harsh and anti-business taxation proposals from the Finance Bill 2025 before they are passed by parliament.
Speaking on behalf of the business, industrial and trade community, FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh emphasised that the country needed a pro-business, investment-friendly and growth-oriented fiscal policy framework as the economy had stabilised and was poised for growth.
He was of the view that the tax collection target could only be achieved if industrialists and exporters were taken on board through a comprehensive consultation process. However, the budget missed the measures required to enable the business community to fulfil the prime minister's vision of an export-led growth, according to a press statement issued on Thursday.
He cautioned that sweeping discretionary powers given to taxmen would be detrimental to the business and investor confidence and would lead to harassment, corruption and maladministration. ""It is a globally established fact that more a tax collector is allowed to intervene or interact directly with the taxpayer, the more it is likely to undermine the principles of fairness, transparency and impartiality primarily due to the increased role of human judgement,"" he remarked.
He, however, appreciated the reduction in super tax, rationalisation of tax slabs for salaried individuals and simplification of the income tax return form for salaried persons and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which had been among longstanding demands of the business community. He also welcomed the increase in defence spending to ensure the geo-economic, trade route, supply line and geostrategic security.
In his remarks, FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon sought the restoration of fixed tax regime for exporters in its original form for the long term to bring clarity, certainty and consistency in taxation policies. ""We can only attract foreign direct investment and domestic investment if we remain competitive,"" he said.
Magoon highlighted that instead of expanding the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) by including local manufacturers, as recommended by all sectors and industries, the government imposed 18% sales tax on raw material, which would raise production costs, disrupt supply chains and hurt the competitiveness of Pakistani products in global markets.

China shoppers swap luxury for pre-loved,"US
Price wars rage as supply outweighs demand
Chinese energy sector worker Mandy Li likes to treat herself to a luxury brand handbag once in a while. But since her state-owned employer cut her wage by 10 per cent and the properties her family owns lost half their value, she only buys second-hand ones.
""I'm cutting down on large expenditures. The economy is definitely in a downturn,"" said 28-year-old Li, adding her family's wealth has shrunk due to the property crisis in China since 2021.
As deflationary pressures mount in the world's second-largest economy, consumer behaviour is changing in ways that could lead to further downward pressure on prices, raising concerns that deflation could become entrenched, posing more headaches for China's policymakers.
Data showed on Monday that consumer prices fell 0.1 per cent in May from a year earlier, with price wars raging in a number of sectors, from autos to e-commerce to coffee amid concerns about oversupply and sluggish household demand.
New businesses are seeking success by targeting penny-pinchers. But this trend is worrying economists who see price wars as ultimately unsustainable as losing firms may have to close and people may lose their jobs, fuelling further deflation.
Consumer price sensitivities have accelerated growth in the Chinese second-hand luxury market since the pandemic, with annual growth rates surpassing 20% in 2023, according to an industry report by Zhiyan Consulting from last year.
But that growth has also led to a spike in the volumes of such items, which is noticeable in the level of discounts on offer – up to 90 per cent.
""In the current economic environment we are seeing more existing luxury consumers shifting to the second-hand market,"" said Lisa Zhang, an expert with Daxue Consulting, a market research and strategy firm focusing on China.
""The middle class – their salary has really decreased. The economy is the number one reason we're seeing these trends.""

India tell Reddy to be ready,"US
He has five wickets from five Tests — all in Australia
India's bowling attack will need regular contributions from all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy on the tour of England with Mohammed Shami absent due to fitness concerns and Jasprit Bumrah's workload to be managed, bowling coach Morne Morkel said.
Team management have said pace spearhead Bumrah is likely to play only three of the five Tests in the series, which begins on June 20 in Leeds, with seam-bowling all-rounders Reddy and Shardul Thakur on standby to fill any gaps.
Morkel said he had challenged Reddy to bowl a bit more.
""He's a guy that can bowl that magical ball, so for him it's about creating that consistency, it's something we want to work on, it's important for his game as well,"" he said after India's practice session in Beckenham on Wednesday.
""I want to see the ball more in his hands, we all know what he can do with the bat.
""For a team, if we can have the bowling options especially in these conditions, I think he'll be exciting and can complement this bowling attack.""
Reddy has five wickets from five Tests — all in Australia.
Bumrah, whenever fit, and Mohammed Siraj are the only automatic picks in the pace attack, while India can also turn to seamers Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh and Prasidh Krishna.
Against an England side renowned for their ultra-aggressive batting, India bowlers will have to make an immediate impact and Morkel was pleased with their level of preparedness.
""England, the brand of cricket they play, we need to be on top of our game,"" the former South Africa quick said.
""We can't afford (time) to find our feet in this series. That's one of the things that has impressed me so much in the two days, the few sessions we've had.
""The guys have stepped up by themselves, they've taken the ownership and responsibility, they've realised it's going to be a tough tour.""

"Murree, Talagang granted autonomy","US
Move gives autonomy to five districts, seven tehsils created over the past three years
In the new provincial budget, Murree and Talagang have been included as independent autonomous districts within the Rawalpindi division. The government has decided to grant full autonomy to all five districts and seven tehsils created over the past three years, with separate development budgets allocated for each.
Earlier, these new districts were operating in an inconsistent manner, often described as being run on a ""half partridge-half quail"" basis, reflecting administrative incompatibility.
To date, all the government departments in any of the new districts are neither autonomous nor do they have district and sessions judges. Separate special districts were not included for these new districts in the budget for the current financial year 2024-25. This decision was formally communicated to the deputy commissioners of all the new districts and the commissioner of the new Gujarat Division.
This decision has also sparked a wave of joy among the elected members of the new districts. With one new division, five new districts and seven new tehsils, Punjab now consists of 10 divisions, 41 districts and 156 tehsils. The Rawalpindi division consists of 24 tehsils of six districts, Rawalpindi, Murree, Chakwal, Attock, Jhelum, Talagang. In terms of the number of districts and tehsils, Rawalpindi has become the largest division in Punjab, surpassing Lahore, which now ranks second.
Lahore Division has four districts, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib and 22 tehsils. Gujranwala Division has three districts, Gujranwala, Sialkot, and Narowal and has 11 tehsils. Gujarat Division (this new division has been created) has four districts, Gujrat, Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad and 12 tehsils. Multan Division has four districts, Multan, Lodhran, Vehari, Khanewal and 14 tehsils.
Sahiwal Division consists of seven tehsils of three districts Sahiwal, Pakpattan, Okara. Bahawalpur Division consists of 15 tehsils of three districts Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rahim Yar Khan. Dera Ghazi Khan Division consists of 16 tehsils of six districts Dera Ghazi Khan, Taunsa, Rajanpur, Layyah, Muzaffargarh, Kot Addu. Faisalabad Division consists of 17 tehsils of four districts Faisalabad, Jhang, Chiniot and Toba Tek Singh.
Sargodha Division consists of 18 tehsils of four districts Sargodha, Khushab, Mianwali, Bhakkar. The largest number of districts is in the Rawalpindi Division and Dera Ghazi Khan Division. The largest number of tehsils is in the Rawalpindi Division and the Lahore Division. The new districts will receive a special grant, including the annual development budget. Their members of the National and Provincial Assembly will receive development funds of Rs100 million.

Are Ibn Khaldun's ideas still relevant for countries like Pakistan?,"PK
The essence of Ibn Khaldun's ideas proposes a humanist and participatory approach to governance
The dangerous skirmish with our hostile larger neighbour has sparked a rare moment of national solidarity within Pakistan — a welcome feeling given the immense political polarisation we have been experiencing in recent years. However, major ethnic, regional and socio-economic rifts remain a dominant feature within Pakistani society, and it would be wishful thinking to assume that these serious problems will melt away just because we scored an apparent short-term win over India.
Carving out a new nation from colonial India, using the two-nation theory which aimed to unite diverse ethnic groups using a common religious identity, was an impressive feat. Yet, the way this rationale was operationalised through a hurried partition plan resulted in a truncated nation separated by nearly 1000 miles. A sizeable number of Muslims remained in India fearing displacement and believing that the transnational nature of their faith did not necessitate residing in a separate nation.
Those who migrated to the eastern wing of Pakistan also soon discovered that a shared religious identity was not an excuse to continue tolerating hegemony by more powerful ethnic groups. The traumatic separation of Bengalis from the rest of Pakistan did not result in other ethnic groups overcoming their differences either. Not only the Balochs or Pathans, but also the Sindhis and Saraikis have their own reasons for feeling disgruntled in the sort of Pakistan we have managed to create over these past several decades.
Ethnic disgruntlement is not the only problem corroding a common sense of national identity. Sectarianism and the extremist violence resulting from it remain another source of perpetual consternation.
One cannot oversimplify the root causes of such ruptures and blame the Punjabis as the cause of all discord. The proxy contestation between the Soviets and the US, alongside rivalries within the Muslim world, has certainly exacerbated religious tensions in Pakistan. Suspected Indian support to militants and insurgents has added fuel to the fire.
However, while these external factors exacerbated societal rifts, they cannot be blamed for creating them out of thin air. The way our post-colonial establishment has relied on top-down, patronage-based and unrepresentative models of governance must shoulder much of the blame for the glaring social tensions evident in our midst today.
Perhaps it is time for our leaders and decision-makers to revisit some of the ideas put forth by thinkers closer to our own cultural roots.
For instance, the work of a 14th century seminal Muslim sociologist, Ibn Khaldun, still offers relevant insights for addressing the growing polarisation in our contemporary society. Ibn Khaldun's concept of asabiyyah, or social cohesion, is particularly worthy of greater attention. Asabiyyah helps unite people and can foster solidarity through shared values which, in turn, remains essential for effective governance and the overall stability of any state.
The essence of Ibn Khaldun's ideas proposes a humanist and participatory approach to governance, wherein the well-being of a given society is a paramount goal. He aptly noted how inequality leads to social fragmentation and instability, and warned about the dangers of relying solely on military strength.
Ibn Khaldun certainly offers a more compelling basis for national building than the warped ideologies put forth by populist and divisive leaders who suppress dissenting voices to build hierarchical systems allowing accumulation by the few at the cost of marginalising the many. Even if the traditional characteristics identified by Ibn Khaldun to enable cohesion may be less relevant in our increasingly complex world of fluid identities, the notion of asabiyyah can be reinterpreted to prioritise universal values such as freedom, social justice and respect for differences.
If our leaders can honestly embrace such ideas, we may move closer to actualising the notion of Pakistan, which is supposed to be an acronym representing all the regions that comprise this nation.

The federal government has additionally spent Rs344.66 billion during the current fiscal year in the shape of grants.
The government doled out Rs115 billion to IPPs, Rs30 billion to flood victims in Sindh, and Rs6 billion to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR).
Similarly, it spent Rs14 billion on solarization, Rs23 billion on anti-terrorism initiatives, and Rs2 billion on technology upgrades.
Likewise, the government also released Rs3.7 billion for the Reko Diq project, Rs520 million for Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and Rs7 billion for parliamentarians' schemes.

"President, PM urge efforts to end child labour","US
.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday urged parents and employers to make joint efforts to eliminate child labour, as the country observed World Day Against Child Labour.
Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are involved in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement (CRM) National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employed a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation (ILO). According to a provincial survey, working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of K-P's child population.
According to a statement from the President's House, President Zardari, in his message, called for efforts to protect children from exploitation, expressing hope for a future where children could ""learn, play, and grow in a safe and dignified environment"".
Stressing the need for collective action by governments, the president urged employers to ""strictly follow child labour laws and ensure that their workplaces are free from exploitation.""
He also called on parents and guardians to prioritise their children's education over ""short-term gains"". ""I urge schools and teachers to identify children at risk of dropping out and keep them in classrooms.""
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz, while reaffirming the government's commitment to ending child labour, highlighted the role of ""the federal and provincial governments, the private sector, educational institutions, media, and civil society"" in preventing child labour, the APP reported.
""Children subjected to child labour not only face sexual and psychological abuse but they are also deprived of their fundamental right to education. They are robbed of their childhood,"" he said.
PM Shehbaz also noted that children from ""developing countries are the most affected by the scourge of child labour."" ""Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with the global community in its fight against child labour,"" he added. He said that this year's theme, ""Progress is clear, but there's more to do: let's speed up efforts!"" highlights that while progress has been made, much more remains to be done.

Iqbal highlights development priorities,"US

Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday acknowledged that tight fiscal space, driven by structural constraints, has reduced its ability to fund development projects under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
At a news conference, he said the development budget has declined from 2.6% of GDP in 2017-18 to just 0.8% — a trend described as a serious structural concern for national development.
He said the government aims to meet development and other expenditures through domestic resources, however, achieving this goal requires raising Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio to at least 16% — a level already maintained by regional peers.

Trump boasts troops making Los Angeles 'safe',"US
The Republican credited the arrival of troops for ensuring a quiet night in Los Angeles
US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Los Angeles is ""safe and sound"" after he ordered troops into the streets but critics accused him of an authoritarian power grab and a judge was set to review the deployments' legality.
Protests erupted last week in the second biggest US city over aggressive new immigration raids targeting migrants at workplaces, courthouses and gathering places for day laborers seeking work.
Anger at Trump's crackdown and the use of masked, armed immigration agents, backed by uniformed soldiers, is spreading to other cities. Nationwide protests were planned for Saturday.
Trump has repeatedly exaggerated the scale of the unrest, which has been largely peaceful, despite isolated clashes, vandalism and burning of cars.
The Republican credited the arrival of troops for ensuring a quiet night in Los Angeles, where the mayor had ordered a nighttime curfew.
Nearly 4,000 National Guard soldiers have been sent to Los Angeles, as well as 700 members of the US Marines — an elite force trained to fight in foreign wars and only very rarely deployed on US soil.
""Our great National Guard, with a little help from the Marines, put the L.A. Police in a position to effectively do their job,"" Trump said on Truth Social, adding that without the military the city ""would be a crime scene like we haven't seen in years.""
A federal judge in San Francisco was set to hear arguments on whether use of the troops is constitutional, with California Governor Gavin Newsom alleging the president ""is creating fear and terror.""
Newsom accused Trump of aiming a ""wrecking ball"" at US democracy and urged Americans ""not to give in.""
Trump on Thursday said Newsom — seen as a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028 — had ""totally lost control of the situation"" and should thank him for ""saving his ass.""
Trump was elected last year in part on his promises to expel people who enter the country illegally, then commit serious crimes.
But his immigration crackdown is far broader, targeting mostly Latin American migrants who may have entered illegally but form the backbone of farming, construction and other manual industries in many parts of the country.

The corridor that redrew the map,"US
CPEC undermines New Delhi's vision of South Asia as its backyard
Power, once loud and territorial, now moves silently. It flows through undersea cables, over smart rail, beneath oil pipelines, and into the bloodstream of emerging economies. It wears no uniform, flies no flag. And today, it speaks Mandarin.
The latest flashpoint between India and Pakistan carried the weight of a message far beyond a routine skirmish; it signaled a shift. Because the real confrontation unfolded on a deeper plane, where commerce, infrastructure and digital routes now redraw the map of influence. And at the centre of that new cartography stands China.
When Indian Rafales took to the skies over contested territory, Pakistan answered with something unfamiliar: Chinese-made J-10Cs, armed with PL-15E missiles, long-range, radar-guided, and built for reach. Pakistan returned fire with precision, moving in concert with China, whose exported military ecosystem entered the arena, marking its arrival as a force rewriting the rules of engagement. Precision. Deterrence. Performance under pressure.
Analysts worldwide watched for what worked. The J-10C, long dismissed as a second-tier platform in defence circles, performed with surgical accuracy. Beijing's quiet confidence in its defence hardware was suddenly matched by proof. Pakistan had emerged as China's strategic partner as well as its showroom. Yet this confrontation in the clouds was only the surface of something deeper. The real battleground lies underfoot.
Beneath the dust of Balochistan and the waves off Gwadar, China is etching a new route into global power. The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) begins as a network of roads and ports, yet unfolds as China's bold reply to Western naval dominance. It provides Beijing direct access to the Arabian Sea, bypassing US-patrolled chokepoints. It allows Chinese goods to flow south through the Karakoram instead of east through contested straits.
It is Beijing's pivot from containment to connectivity.
And for India, this is the real incursion.
CPEC undermines New Delhi's vision of South Asia as its backyard. It rearranges the chessboard. And more dangerously, it proposes an alternative architecture, where power comes through partnership, not subjugation; through trade, not tanks.
This is the rise of China as a civilisational strategist.
Just as the West once built empires on railroads and gunboats, China builds corridors of steel, fiber, and credit. Where others sow dependence, it offers interdependence. Where others export chaos, it brings roads and routers. To many, especially those weary of IMF prescriptions, this is a different kind of proposition, one that doesn't ask for regime change, only right-of-way.
So when the Indian attacks came wrapped in counter-terror narratives, their true purpose was to stall this momentum. Disrupt logistics. Spook investors. Cloud the promise of a Pakistan aligned with China, rather than circling in the margins of colonial memory.
Rahul Gandhi said the quiet part aloud: that Pakistan-China alignment is a ""crime"" against India. But beneath the bluster was the real fear - that CPEC could work; that it could anchor Pakistan's economic autonomy; that it could succeed where Western partnerships had mostly produced crisis.
This is China's most subversive act: offering peace as power.
It doesn't march into capitals. It funds metros, ports, power plants. It embeds supply chains. Its method is quiet, its scale planetary.
CPEC is where that vision takes form. China's imprint achieved through connection rather than conquest. It signals Pakistan's shift toward Beijing's multipolar world. In this alignment, Pakistan emerges as a sovereign bridge between regions, no longer defined by subservience but by strategic geography, activated with intent and positioned for relevance.
And that logic is difficult to ignore.
China builds with choreography, each project a move in a larger, deliberate design. Its vision for Pakistan reaches beyond asphalt and steel. CPEC has already delivered energy projects that lit up once-dark cities, coal plants in Sahiwal and Port Qasim, hydropower stations in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, and solar fields in Bahawalpur. It connects Hazara through the Havelian-Thakot motorway, threads rail from Karachi to Peshawar, and transforms Gwadar with a deep-sea port, international airport and free trade zone. Plans include special economic zones in Rashakai and Dhabeji, industrial hubs meant to attract regional manufacturing. With fiber-optic cables stretching from Khunjerab to Rawalpindi, and a digital corridor in the making, China envisions a Pakistan that shapes flows of data, power, and influence.
China needs stable partners. And Pakistan, if it plays its cards right, can transform from periphery to pivot, so long as it chooses coherence over crisis.
But that choice demands a shift within.
Pakistan faces a reckoning with its addiction to short-termism. The time has come to align policy with vision, and governance with lasting continuity. Curricula need to evolve from rote memorisation to bold innovation. Universities should forge ties with Central Asian peers, creating networks of shared ambition. Trade diplomacy deserves its rightful place, as the spearhead of a new foreign policy. And youth must become more than an audience. They must be equipped as agents.
This is where China's model speaks loudest: think in decades, plan in corridors, build for permanence.
If Pakistan mirrors that thinking, offering venture capital for student start-ups, technical training in forgotten districts, fellowships in trade and climate, it builds more than infrastructure. It builds belief.
Of course, none of this will be smooth. Global volatility will test resolve. Delays will tempt despair. China's rise emerged through turbulence, carved in resilience, shaped by strategy, and driven with unrelenting purpose.
Pakistan, too, can choose that arc.
The old order will resist. It always does. CPEC moves cargo, and with it, ideas. It suggests that autonomy isn't the privilege of the powerful, but the prize of the prepared. It declares that smaller states can shape maps if they hold their course.
Today's sharpest borders are etched not in terrain, but in worldview. On one side: collaboration, connectivity, self-determined futures. On the other: coercion, chaos and manufactured instability.
Pakistan now stands at that border.
And how it steps forward will shape far more than its own map.

Punjab held back Rs2b sugarcane fund,"US
.
An audit report has revealed that Punjab's finance department did not release over Rs2 billion fund earmarked for the development of sugarcane sector in the last provincial budget in violation of the Punjab Sugarcane (Development) Cess Rules, 1964.
As per the rules, a fund — the Sugarcane Development Fund — is created in each district of the province. The fund of each district is operated by the concerned DCO.
The Finance Department releases funds to the respective DCO after deduction of 10% of the total collection of the cess for the Sugarcane Research and Development Board and deduction of 2% collection charges.
According to the Auditor General of Pakistan report, it transpired during the audit of the finance department's civil accounts of June, 2023 that there existed a liability of Rs20,335,026,047 under ""G-11212-Deposits on Sugarcane Development Cess Fund"". ""The Cane Commissioner of Punjab had deposited an amount of Rs5,090,152,163 in Account-I for the purpose of subsequent distribution of funds.
""Although the Finance Department had not released the authority for payment, the DAO Faisalabad and Vehari made payments of 55,286,766 and Rs. 28,682,577 respectively.""
Additionally, 2% collection charges were also not incorporated in the budget. The auditor said it is of the view that lapse occurred due to weak administrative and financial controls. It said the matter was further reported to the Administrative Department and during a departmental account committee (DAC) meeting held on January 30, 2025, it was decided that the para should be kept pending until the SOPS/policy are formulated in consultation with stakeholders.
""As regards the remaining paras, neither any reply was received nor a DAC meeting convened till the finalization of this report despite issuance of reminders in November and December 2024.""
The audit recommended proper allocation and utilization of the Sugarcane Development Cess Fund, in accordance with the specified rules. ""[These allocations and utilizations] are imperative to ensure the intended developmental projects are carried out efficiently and transparently,"" it added.

Reserves hit 3-year high at $16.9b,"US
No rate cut expected by analysts but survey sees inflation at 6-8%
Pakistan's total liquid foreign exchange reserves have surged to $16.88 billion — the highest level in 163 weeks, last recorded on April 16, 2022.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Limited (AHL), Ali Najib said, ""Of this, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) holds $11.68 billion, marking a 20-week high last seen on January 20, 2025, while commercial banks maintain reserves of $5.20 billion.""
The SBP's foreign exchange reserves rose by $167 million during the week ended June 6, 2025, according to data released by the central bank on Thursday. This represents a weekly increase of $277 million and a fiscal year-to-date (FYTD) rise of $2.88 billion, he said in his commentary. As a result, the country's import cover has improved to 1.94 months, up from 1.91 months previously.
The surge in reserves is attributed to stronger export performance, robust remittance inflows, and financial support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as well as bilateral partners.
""This boosts investor confidence, strengthens the rupee, and enhances the country's ability to pay for imports and service debt,"" said Najib. This improvement also lowers default risk and supports inflation stability, contributing positively to the overall macroeconomic environment.
The central bank announced that the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of SBP will meet on Monday, June 16, 2025, to decide about the monetary policy.
In a poll conducted by Topline Securities, 56% of market participants expect the central bank to maintain the current policy rate in the upcoming meeting, a notable increase from 31% in the previous poll. Meanwhile, 44% anticipate a policy rate cut of at least 50 basis points (bps). Within this group, 19% foresee a 50bps reduction, while 25% expect a more aggressive cut of 100bps.
Despite the market's mixed expectations, Topline Research believes that the central bank has room for a further cut of around 100bps, considering that average inflation for FY26 is projected to remain between 6-7%. This would translate into a real interest rate of 400-500bps — well above the historical range of 200-300bps — assuming a policy rate of 11%.
However, the SBP is widely expected to maintain a status quo in its upcoming monetary policy meeting amid persisting uncertainties on both domestic and global fronts. A key concern influencing this cautious stance is the recent rebound in international crude oil prices, which have surged to the $68-70 per barrel range due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and the possibility of a US-China trade agreement.
Given that global oil prices have historically played a significant role in driving domestic inflation, this development is likely to compel the central bank to adopt a wait-and-see approach. Moreover, the potential inflationary impact of upcoming domestic adjustments — such as anticipated notifications regarding gas and electricity tariff hikes — remains unassessed and yet to be absorbed by the market. These factors, combined, support the likelihood of the SBP keeping its policy rate unchanged in the near term.
Minutes from the last MPC meeting held on May 5, 2025, revealed that eight out of nine members favoured a 100-basis points rate cut. However, since that easing, yields on the six-month Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (KIBOR) and six-month T-bills have increased by 88-99 basis points. Currently, the six-month KIBOR and T-bills stand at 11.09% and 10.95%, respectively.
As per the Topline survey, inflation is expected by most respondents to average 6-8%, with the rupee projected to settle between Rs280-290 per US dollar by year-end. Meanwhile, the rupee depreciated for a second straight session, closing at 282.67 per dollar, while domestic gold prices jumped by Rs4,000 per tola to Rs356,900, following international gains.

Pindi sears at 45°C,"US
Authorities have urged residents to avoid direct sunlight between 11am and 4pm
The intense heatwave continued in the city, with temperatures touched 45°C on Thursday. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned that the extreme heat will persist till Friday, with daytime temperatures 5-7°C above normal in central and upper Punjab, including Rawalpindi.
Authorities have urged residents to avoid direct sunlight between 11am and 4pm and to stay hydrated to prevent heatstroke and dehydration. The intense heat poses serious health risks, particularly for children, the elderly, and outdoor workers.
According to the MET Office, the high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere is trapping hot continental air over most parts of the country, coupled with shallow westerly trough may bring dust storms, rain, or thunderstorms to parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), South Punjab, and Kashmir by evening, but Rawalpindi is expected to remain hot and dry.
The MET predicted the extreme heat would continue on Friday, with partly cloudy conditions and possible dust storms in nearby regions. However, Rawalpindi is likely to experience persistent hot and dry weather, with no immediate relief in sight.
Residents are advised to take precautions, including avoiding unnecessary outdoor activities during peak heat hours, drinking plenty of water, wearing light and loose clothing, and watching for signs of heatstroke such as dizziness, nausea, or high body temperature.

Traders seek urgent consultation,"US
LCCI urges govt to revise proposals, warns of missing growth target
The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has urged the government to ensure immediate consultations with the business community to address their concerns before the National Assembly finalises the federal budget for 2025-26.
LCCI President Mian Abuzar Shad, Senior Vice President Engineer Khalid Usman and Vice President Shahid Nazir Chaudhry in a statement called for urgent revisions.
They said that the government has projected GDP growth at 4.2%, up from the current 2.7%, adding that the budget overlooks systemic flaws. The growth estimates ignore ground realities, high cost of doing business, energy shortages and inconsistent policies which are affecting industrial output. ""The government must revisit these projections to avoid fiscal shortfalls later.""
The LCCI office-bearers said that debt servicing still consumes a significant portion of the budget and the IMF-mandated subsidy cuts will hurt low-income groups.
The imposition of 18% sales tax on imported solar panels has also drawn sharp criticism. They said that this move contradicts Pakistan's renewable energy goals. Instead of taxing solar imports, the government should incentivise local manufacturing and R&D activity to reduce dependence on foreign products.
Mian Abuzar Shad said that below-the-mark allocations would affect healthcare, education and infrastructure. Apart from that, slashing social sector funding for short-term fiscal adjustments will harm long-term growth. ""The government must rebalance allocations to prioritise human development.""

Harvey Weinstein found guilty,"US
Producer was retried for offences against two women
Disgraced Hollywood titan Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of one sexual assault at his retrial Wednesday and not guilty of another, with jurors still considering a rape charge after hearing graphic testimony from his alleged victims, as reported by AFP.
Weinstein was retried for offences against two women, Jessica Mann whom he is alleged to have raped, and Miriam Haley whom he was found to have sexually assaulted, alongside new charges of assaulting ex-model Kaja Sokola.
He was found not guilty of those new charges at the tense proceeding in a Manhattan court on Wednesday.
Delivering the verdict of the seven women and five men of the jury on the Haley count, the foreman said: ""Guilty.""
He shook his head when he was asked for a verdict on the rape of Mann, and said ""not guilty"" on the Sokola count.
Weinstein looked on impassively, seated in a wheelchair and wearing a dark suit as he has done throughout the six weeks of hearings.
But later, the 73-year-old appeared to mutter ""Not true"" as he was wheeled out of court.
Post-verdict
Following the verdict, Haley told reporters that the defence's ""victim shaming and deliberate attempts to distort the truth was exhausting and at times dehumanising.""
""But today's verdict gives me hope, hope that there is new awareness around sexual violence and that the myth of the 'perfect victim' is fading.""
The verdicts came after a dramatic morning in which tensions in the jury deliberation room spilled into the open.
The foreman had told the judge Curtis Farber he could not continue after facing threats.
""One other juror made comments to the effect 'I'll meet you outside one day',"" the judge said, quoting the foreman, adding there was yelling between jurors.
After Weinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala heatedly demanded a mistrial over the jury rupture, Weinstein himself addressed the court, deploying a commanding voice reminiscent of the heyday of his Hollywood power.
""We've heard threats, violence, intimidation - this is not right for me... the person who is on trial here,"" he said.
""My lawyers, the District Attorney's lawyers, can fight all they want, (but) this is my life that's on the line and it's not fair.""
""It's time, it's time, it's time your honor, to say this trial is over,"" Weinstein added.
The judge responded that while unusual, disputes between jurors were not unheard of, before pressing on to hear the jury's partial verdict.
Genesis of 'MeToo'
The Oscar-winner's conviction is a vindication for Haley, whose complaint in part led to the initial guilty verdict in 2020, and helped spur the ""MeToo"" movement that saw an outpouring of allegations from prominent women who were abused by men.
Weinstein underwent a spectacular fall from his position astride the world of Hollywood and show business in 2017 when the first allegations against him exploded into public view.
The movement upended the film industry, exposing the systemic exploitation of young women seeking to work in entertainment, and provoking a reckoning on how to end the toxic culture.
More than 80 women accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct in the wake of the global backlash against men abusing positions of power.
Weinstein's original 2020 conviction, and the resulting 23-year prison term, was thrown out last year after an appeals court found irregularities in the way witnesses were presented.
Throughout the trial that began on April 15, Weinstein's sharp-suited attorney argued that the context had shifted since the first proceedings.
While the ""MeToo"" movement was ""the most important thing in society"" back then, ""I think people's heads are in a different place right now,"" Aidala said.
Any sentence will be in addition to the 16-year term Winstein is already serving after being convicted in California of raping a European actress over a decade ago.
Weinstein, the producer of box office hits like Pulp Fiction and Shakespeare in Love, did not take the stand during his retrial, but did acknowledge in an interview he acted ""immorally.""
The retrial played out with far less public attention than the initial proceedings, when daily protests against sexual violence were staged outside the court.
This time, the case was eclipsed by the blockbuster trial of hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs taking place at an adjacent courthouse.

Sizzling Punjab,"PK
The severe heatwaves, coupled with dry weather, are expected to be followed by gusty winds and light rain soon
One of many crucial factors that define a liveable country is its climate and weather patterns. A gentle breeze with a slightly cloudy sky brings people out of their homes and into city centres, where they partake in the public sphere. But the flip side of the coin, one that Punjab is currently witnessing, becomes a possible death sentence for many. Bhakkar just recorded the country's highest temperature at 50°C on Tuesday, while the rest of the region has been experiencing temperatures up to 49°C, including Lahore of 46°C.
The severe heatwaves, coupled with dry weather, are expected to be followed by gusty winds and light rain soon, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. Citizens are hoping this will bring some form of relief to the city which is presently ablaze by the scorching sun. While citizens have been advised to stay hydrated and avoid outdoor activities unless necessary, the country's blue-collar workers have no choice but to peddle through deserted streets in afternoons.
Rickshaw drivers, street cart vendors, construction workers and security guards amongst others who earn a living outdoors are helplessly suffering through these unbearable temperatures, which puts them at heightened risk of a heat stroke, and in some cases, even death. Alongside cool drinking water, which is being provided by authorities in public spaces, it is also critical for the government to disallow uniforms stitched from blended fabric that might keep costs low but endangers employee health and safety.
The extent to which temperatures are currently soaring makes the weather more than merely uncomfortable; it is a threat to public health. The government must enhance its efforts to mitigate health risks by reinforcing hydration and shade. Additionally, hospitals should be consistently supported with adequate medical supplies and facilities to effectively manage heat-related illnesses.

Traders call federal budget 'cruel and inflationary',"US
.
The Grocery Merchants Association has rejected the newly announced federal budget, calling it cruel, a manipulation of words and a poison budget because it will bring a destructive storm of inflation on retailers.
Central Secretary General Rizwan Shaukat and President Saleem Pervez Butt said the budget lacks meaningful reforms and has many ambiguities. They claimed the burden of achieving the tax revenue target is being unfairly placed on retailers.
""Retailers are already being blackmailed under the pretence of the Point of Sale (POS) system, and now a new drama is unfolding in the name of digital invoicing,"" they said, describing the budget as nothing more than a manipulation of data. The absence of a uniform tax system, they said, is creating confusion and benefiting a privileged class under the guise of tax exemptions.
The officials said that requirements such as identity card verification, POS systems, and sales tax compliance are enforced mainly on grocery retailers, opening doors to exploitation. ""Rather than expanding the tax net, the government is overburdening existing taxpayers,"" they said, adding that sales tax evasion doesn't happen at the retailer level, but no action is taken to address it at its root.""
They also demanded a reduction in the base price of electricity and the implementation of a uniform rate across the board. Moreover, they called for the immediate withdrawal of the 18% general sales tax on solar panels.

"Solar net metering to add over 2,600 MW","PK
Number of such consumers will also grow in line with SDG target
Pakistan is likely to add 2,633 megawatts of energy to the system through solar net metering in the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26.
Despite having surplus installed power generation capacity, the country is expected to add a total of 2,800 MW to the national grid, including a major contribution of 2,633 MW from solar net metering.
According to the Annual Plan 2025-26, these additions will raise the installed generation capacity to 44,626 MW by the end of June 2026.
The number of net metering consumers is also expected to grow by 197,655, contributing to the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator through increasing the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption and supporting grid stability.
At that point, the generation mix is projected to comprise approximately 50.5% from renewable sources (including hydel, solar, solar net metering, wind and bagasse) and 49.5% from thermal sources (such as coal, gas, re-gasified liquefied natural gas, oil and nuclear).
The power sector will receive a public investment of Rs161,635 million from the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) of FY26, including government-budgeted/self-finance projects of power companies, excluding independent power producers (IPPs).
The government plans to execute 63 projects.
These investments will contribute directly to the achievement of SDGs through distribution and transmission projects aimed at increasing access to electricity and through power generation projects by enhancing the share of renewable energy.
By the end of June 2026, the transmission sector will be boosted by an additional capacity of 5,550, 4,710 and 1,300 MVA on 500-kilovolt, 220kV and high-voltage, direct-current (HVDC) grids, respectively.
These transmission lines will be extended by 170 km (500kV), 355 km (220kV) and 137 km (±660kV). Additionally, one new grid station will be established at the 765kV level and two at the 220kV level.
To increase the proportion of population having access to electricity, the targeted investment in power distribution will lead to the electrification of 15,352 villages and the addition of 1.861 million new consumer connections during FY26.
These efforts will directly expand electricity access across urban and rural areas.
In support of the objectives, the distribution network will be strengthened through the extension of 1,244 km of 132kV transmission lines while the capacity of 132kV grids will be enhanced by 2,490.7 MVA.
The government has launched several strategic initiatives under the Uraan Pakistan to enhance energy security, sustainability and efficiency.
These are closely aligned with the achievement of SDG targets, Pakistan's climate commitments, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and strategies for resilience and adaptation.
These key policies, reforms and programmes include the National Electricity Plan (2023-27), which focuses on six key objectives – diversification, resilience, self-sufficiency, affordability, financial viability and sustainability – supported by 20 priority areas with clear targets to ensure clean, reliable and affordable energy.
Similarly, green energy projects are in line with Uraan and the Alternative and Renewable Energy (ARE) Policy 2019, which has set the target of increasing the share of renewables to 30% by 2030.
The new initiatives comprise the deployment of battery energy storage systems and 400 MVAR reactive power compensation devices (including FACTS) within the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) network to improve grid flexibility and resilience.
This aligns with Uraan's priority of building resilient infrastructure as well as the National Electricity Plan, which puts emphasis on modernising infrastructure.

SA strikes back after Cummins' heroics,"US
WTC final tantalizingly poised as Aussies collapse
Australia captain Pat Cummins produced a sensational spell of four wickets for just one run in the World Test Championship final before Kagiso Rabada struck twice to keep South Africa in the game on Thursday.
South Africa were bowled out for 138 in reply to Australia's first innings total of 212 on the second day at Lord's.
Cummins finished with figures of 6-28 as he reached 300 career Test wickets.
South Africa lost their last five wickets for 12 runs, with a farcical run out not helping their cause, as Cummins ripped through the lower order on his way to a 14th five-wicket haul in 68 Tests and first at Lord's.
Only South Africa captain Temba Bavuma (36) and David Bedingham (45) offered meaningful resistance during a fifth-wicket stand of 64.
But fast bowler Rabada, who had taken an impressive 5-51 in the first innings on Wednesday, stuck twice in the 11th over of Australia's second innings.
He had opener Usman Khawaja caught behind for six and, two balls later, he removed Cameron Green for a duck as Australia wobbled.
Green's exit meant the number three had faced just five balls in the match for a total of four runs.
At tea, Australia were 32-2 — an overall lead of 106 — with Marnus Labuschagne, in his first Test as an opener, 16 not out and Steve Smith unbeaten on four.
The dominance of bowlers on both sides was reflected in a second session when the teams managed a combined total of just 49 runs for the loss of seven wickets between them.
After lunch, Australian skipper Cummins struck four times in just 17 balls of devastating pace bowling.
South Africa had resumed on Thursday at 43-4, battling to put enough runs on the board.
Bavuma, who had 37 balls for his overnight three not out, changed gears as he struck a superb lofted cover-drive off left-arm quick Mitchell Starc for four and later pulled Cummins for a six.
Cummins had his revenge when Bavuma's checked drive was brilliantly caught at cover by a diving Labuschagne.
In the last over before lunch, Bedingham struck two fours off Beau Webster to take South Africa to 121-5.
Wickets tumbled early in the second session, with Cummins claiming two scalps in an over in the third over after lunch.
Cummins had Kyle Verreynne lbw for 13 and, three balls later, he held a simple return catch as Marco Jansen fell for a duck, with South Africa reduced 126-7.
Cummins then had Bedingham caught behind by Alex Carey to end a 111-ball innings before Keshav Maharaj was needlessly run out.
Cummins ended the innings with his 300th Test wicket, Rabada well caught low down at deep square leg by Webster.
The bowler received a standing ovation as he led his side off the field.
That reception was a marked contrast to the boos that echoed round Lord's two years ago after Cummins refused to withdraw an appeal following Alex Carey's controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow during an Ashes Test when the England batsman thought the ball was dead.
His five-wicket haul on Thursday means Cummins will have a coveted place on the Lord's honours board in he famous Pavilion.

SC declares digital evidence admissible,"US
Detailed verdict calls Zahir Jaffar 'a ruthless killer'
The Supreme Court on Thursday issued its detailed judgment in the Noor Mukadam murder case, upholding the death sentence of convict Zahir Jaffar while commuting his separate death sentence for rape to life imprisonment.
In the 13-page verdict, the court described Jaffer as ""a ruthless killer"" undeserving of sympathy, and affirmed the correctness and unanimity of the lower courts' decisions.
The judgment also underscored the evidentiary value of video footage, stating that material obtained through a reliable system can serve as selft-sufficient testimony. It cited a back robbery case where video evidence was accepted without eyewitnesses and noted that US courts widely apply the 'silent witness' principle.
In Jaffer's case, the court noted that CCTV footage, the DVR, and the hard disk were all admissible forms of evidence. The court stated that there was no indication of tampering in the video recordings, the identification of the accused was accurate, and the DNA report confirmed the rape.
The murder weapon was also found to have the victim's blood on it. ""The convict failed to provide any explanation for Noor's presence. Digital evidence is now considered primary testimony. If CCTV footage meets the set standards, no further verification is necessary,"" the verdict stated.
Further, the court upheld Jaffer's death sentence for murder but converted his sentence for rape into life imprisonment. He was acquitted of the abduction charge, while his sentence for unlawfully confining Noor was maintained.
The Supreme Court also ruled that the punishments for co-accused Muhammad Iftikhar and Muhammad Jan would stand. However, in a show of leniency, it ordered their release on the grounds that they had already served sufficient time.
Previously, a three-member bench headed by Justice Hashim Kakar, and comprising Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Ali Baqar Najafi, had dismissed Jaffer's appeal. The judgment concluded with a note that Justice Najafi would add a supplementary note to the verdict.
Noor, 27, was murdered on July 20, 2021, at a house in Islamabad's F-7/4 sector. An FIR was lodged the same day, leading to the arrest of Jaffer at the crime scene. In February 2022, the district and sessions court handed Zahir the death penalty and 25-year jail term for murder and rape. Two domestic staff, Mohammad Iftikhar and Jan Mohammad were each awarded 10-year jail term for their involvement.
Zahir's parents, Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamjiboth prominent business figureswere indicted in October 2021 but later acquitted. Similarly, six employees of the Therapy Works, who arrived at the scene before the police, were also cleared of charges by the trial court.

LHC takes up case against circus cruelty,"SG
Advocate Saeed termed the court's action a watershed moment for animal rights in Pakistan.
The Lahore High Court has issued notices to the Punjab Wildlife Department and other authorities concerned over the alleged inhumane treatment of wild animals in private zoos and traveling circuses across Punjab.
The action follows a public interest petition filed by Environmental & Animal Rights Consultants (EARC), a legal and research organisation focused on animal and environmental protection.
The petition, led by EARC Director and senior lawyer Advocate Altmash Saeed, highlights the cruel captivity of wild animals such as lions, leopards, and bears in cramped iron cages, often placed in recreational parks and roadside circuses.
""These sentient creatures are held in degrading conditions, deprived of their natural behaviour and suffering in sweltering heat,"" the petition stated, adding that the practice violates both ethical standards and the Punjab Wildlife (Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management) Act.
Taking initial cognisance, Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh directed provincial authorities to conduct inspections of the identified facilities and submit comprehensive reports.
He emphasised that wild animals are not objects of entertainment but living beings entitled to humane treatment.
The petition demands a constitutional ban on the private captivity of wild animals and the relocation of all such animals to certified sanctuaries, where they can receive proper care and begin psychological recovery from prolonged mistreatment.
Advocate Saeed termed the court's action a watershed moment for animal rights in Pakistan.
""This is about enforcing the law and giving voiceless beings the dignity they deserve,"" he said.

'Over $100b needed for carbon-neutral energy sector',"US
Climate ministry says $50b required to hit 60% renewables target by 2030 despite 54% clean energy share last month
Pakistan is transitioning away from fossil fuels at a faster pace than many regional economies, with plans to generate 60% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030 to meet its emissions reduction targets.
According to global data compiled by the Energy Institute, the share of fossil fuels in Pakistan's total energy consumption declined by 4.8 percentage points from 86.7% in 2019 to 81.9% in 2023. In comparison, the average decline in fossil fuel usage among low- and middle-income countries during the same period was just 0.8 percentage points (from 90.8% to 90.0%).
Further, recent data released by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) reveals that clean energy sources, such as hydropower, nuclear, and other renewables, contributed approximately 54% to the country's energy mix last month. The government's move away from furnace oil, the most expensive source of power, is evident, as it accounted for only 1% of the energy mix in April.
These figures show that, despite macroeconomic challenges, Pakistan currently holds a relatively cleaner energy mix compared to other Asian and low- and middle-income countries. Neighbouring countries like China and India generate approximately 61% and 75% of their electricity from coal, respectively. In contrast, Thar coal contributes only 13% to Pakistan's energy mix and has played a key role in ensuring grid reliability and affordability.
""The energy baseload of Pakistan should be based on indigenous sources of Thar along with renewables to ensure affordability and mitigate geopolitical shocks. Developing economies, including Pakistan, require a balanced transition to renewable energy. Fossil fuels are crucial for short- to medium-term energy stability,"" said Asif Arslan Soomro, an independent economic and investment analyst.
He added that balancing environmental goals with economic stability is crucial, as an abrupt shift from fossil fuels could disrupt growth and strain an already fragile economy. The energy transition will involve enhancing or transforming the entire energy system, and this significant investment relates to the development and upgradation of infrastructure, such as hydropower plants and transmission systems, as well as the phase-out of existing fossil fuel-based power plants.
Pakistan requires over $100 billion in investment to transition to a carbon-neutral energy sector, with $50 billion needed to achieve its 60% renewable energy target by 2030, according to the climate ministry.
Soomro noted that Pakistan has been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in the Climate Risk Index (CRI) 2025 report, despite contributing less than 1% to global greenhouse gas emissions.
""Even though its climate impact remains negligible, Pakistan has committed to unconditionally reduce its overall projected emissions by 15% by 2030. We have also committed to reduce emissions by a further 35%, conditional on the availability of required external financing,"" he added.

Infant smuggling bid thwarted; two female doctors held,"US
The case, registered by the FIA's Anti-Human Trafficking Circle
The FIA has arrested five suspects, including two female doctors, for their alleged involvement in an attempt to smuggle a nine-month-old infant from Karachi to Mozambique, The Express Tribune learnt on Wednesday.
According to sources, FIA Immigration officials at Jinnah International Airport intercepted a female passenger, identified as Kiran Sohail, who was attempting to board a flight to Mozambique while carrying a nine-month-old baby under suspicious circumstances.
When questioned, the woman reportedly confessed that the infant had been handed over to her at the airport by a woman named Yasmeen. She further revealed that all travel arrangements had been facilitated by an agent identified as Shazi.
Kiran admitted that she was in contact with two men, Suhail and Sohail Ali, based in Mozambique, as well as Yasmeen and Lakshmi Mukesh in Karachi. She also disclosed that a group of four accomplices had arranged fake documents — including a passport, airline tickets, and forged papers declaring her the biological mother of the infant. Among those arrested are two female doctors — one running a private NGO in Karachi and the other operating a private clinic.
The case, registered by the FIA's Anti-Human Trafficking Circle, names Yasmeen as the prime accused, along with Mozambique-based Suhail and Sohail Ali, and the impersonating mother Kiran and her husband Sohail.

Israel kills 21 people waiting for aid in Gaza,"US
Deports six people detained aboard a boat
Israel charged on Thursday that Hamas was ""weaponising suffering in Gaza"" after a US and Israeli-backed charity accused the Palestinian group of killing eight of its aid workers in the territory.
The distribution of food and basic supplies in the blockaded and war-ravaged Gaza has become increasingly fraught and perilous, exacerbating the territory's deep hunger crisis.
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said a bus carrying its staff to a distribution site near the southern city of Khan Yunis was ""brutally attacked by Hamas"" around 10:00 pm (1900 GMT) on Wednesday.
The GHF said: ""As of now, we can confirm at least eight fatalities, multiple injuries, and we fear that some of our team members have been taken hostage.""
Israel's foreign ministry said ""Hamas is weaponising suffering in Gaza — denying food, targeting lifesavers and forsaking its own people"".
Asked to respond to the GHF accusation, the Hamas government media office in Gaza said GHF was a ""filthy tool"" of Israeli forces and was being used to ""lure civilians into death traps"".
It did not comment on the GHF's accusation.
Dozens of Palestinians have been killed while trying to reach GHF distribution points since they began operating in late May, according to Gaza's civil defence agency.
The agency said another 21 people were killed while waiting for aid on Thursday, adding they were among 29 people across the territory who were killed by Israeli fire.
Contacted by AFP about reports of a deadly incident near an aid distribution point close to the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, the Israeli military said it had ""conducted warning shots... hundreds of metres (yards) from the aid distribution site, prior to its opening hours.""
Israeli restrictions on media in Gaza and the difficulties of access on the ground mean AFP is unable to independently verify the casualty tolls provided by the civil defence agency or the deaths reported by the GHF.
Gaza medics have said hospitals are being inundated with people wounded while trying to obtain food.
At Gaza City's Al-Shifa Hospital on Wednesday, the emergency department said it had received dozens of people who had been killed or wounded while waiting for aid in recent days, including 200 in a single day.
""Many Gazans went to the Nabulsi and Netzarim areas to receive aid and were shot at and shelled with tanks,"" said Mutaz Harara, head of Al-Shifa's emergency department.
Meanwhile, Israel's foreign ministry said six people detained aboard a boat attempting to breach Israel's Gaza blockade were put in a plane for deportation Thursday afternoon.
They included European parliamentarian Rima Hassan, it said.
""Bye-bye — and don't forget to take a selfie before you leave,"" the ministry wrote on X.
Egyptian authorities meanwhile detained more than 200 pro-Palestinian activists in Cairo ahead of a planned march to the Gaza border, the organisers said.
Egypt said while it backs efforts to put ""pressure on Israel"" to lift its Gaza blockade, any foreign delegations seeking to visit the border area must obtain prior approval.
The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel.
Israel said late on Wednesday that its forces had retrieved the bodies of two hostages from southern Gaza.
Prior to the latest announcement, out of 251 taken hostage during the Hamas attack, 54 were still held in Gaza, including 32 the Israeli military has said are dead.

Man hacks wife to death,"PK
Victim's family walked in as suspect was dismembering body
Green Town Investigation police claimed to have arrested a man for hacking his wife to death with a cleaver.
DIG Investigation Syed Zeeshan Raza formed a team led by SP Investigation Sadar Moazzam Ali to arrest the suspect.
Police said the suspect, Muhammad Hayyat, a resident of Bahawalnagar, killed his wife, Nabila Bibi, on May 30 with repeated cleaver blows at his residence in Sher Chowk, Green Town, allegedly over suspicions of infidelity.
The couple, married since 2008, had three children and had been living separately due to ongoing disputes.
Nabila had moved in with her brother, Muhammad Ashfaq. As per the FIR registered at Green Town Police Station, Hayyat approached Nabila's family on the day of the incident, claiming reconciliation and requesting custody of the children to resume family life.
Trusting his words, Nabila and her three children went with him. Hours later, he called her brother, Muhammad Ashfaq, asking him to visit his home to ""settle the matter once and for all.""
What Ashfaq and other family members found upon arrival was a horrifying scene: Hayyat was allegedly dismembering Nabila's body with a cleaver. The accused openly admitted to the murder and threatened the family with violence.
Police say preliminary investigations suggest the motive behind the murder was Hayyat's suspicion that his wife had developed an illicit relationship with a man named Saleem.
The level of violence and premeditation in the crime has drawn condemnation from civil society and women's rights activists.
DIG Investigation Syed Zeeshan Raza vowed that the accused would be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. ""This case is a grim reminder of the brutality domestic violence can escalate into. There will be no leniency,"" he stated.

Pakistan sinks to bottom of GGGI,"PK
Report says educational attainment rises by increase in female literacy rates
Pakistan hit the rock bottom in the latest Global Gender Gap Index compiled in the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Gender Gap Report 2025 on Thursday, with its overall parity score declining from last year's 57% to 56.7%.
The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) annually benchmarks the current state and evolution of gender parity in 148 countries across four key dimensions - Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.
This year's Global Gender Gap Report comes at a time when the world is in flux, as technological breakthroughs, geopolitical conflicts and economic uncertainties are creating unprecedented challenges as well as bringing new opportunities.
""Occupying the bottom rank of the index (148), Pakistan sees its overall parity score decline from last year's edition, from 57% to 56.7%. Overall Pakistan has closed +2.3 of its gender gap since 2006,"" the report said.
""However, this year's results are a second consecutive drop from the economy's best score of 57.7%, achieved in 2023. Parity in Economic Participation and Opportunity declines by 1.3 percentage points,"" it added.
While economic representation indicators have remained unchanged, according to the report, income disparity in Pakistan has slightly increased since the last edition (+.02 points), as has perceived wage inequality (+4 percentage points).
""The sole subindex advance registered by Pakistan in this year's edition is Educational Attainment, bumping educational parity upwards by +1.5 percentage points to reach 85.1%. Part of the shift is driven by an increase in female literacy rates (from 46.5% to 48.5%).""
The report noted that parity had also risen because male enrolment shares had dropped in tertiary education, increasing the relative balance between men and women but lowering the overall educational reach.
In economy, the report sees political parity dropping from 12.2% in 2024 to 11% in 2025. While parity in parliament increases by +1.2 percentage points, women's ministerial representation drops from 5.9% in 2024 to zero in 2025.

Israel appears ready to attack Iran,"US
US and Iranian officials will hold a sixth round of talks on Tehran's escalating uranium enrichment programme in Oman
US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that an Israeli strike on Iran ""could very well happen"" but he would not call it imminent and that he would prefer to avoid conflict with Tehran and reach a peaceful solution over its nuclear program.
Trump's comments came after the UN nuclear watchdog's board of governors declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations and Tehran announced counter-measures, as an Iranian official said a ""friendly country"" had warned it of a potential Israeli attack.
US and Iranian officials will hold a sixth round of talks on Tehran's escalating uranium enrichment programme in Oman on Sunday, according to US and Omani officials.
But security concerns have risen since Trump said on Wednesday American personnel were being moved out of the region because ""it could be a dangerous place"" and that Tehran would not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.
Washington is concerned that Israel could take military action against Iran in the coming days, US officials said on condition of anonymity, despite Trump's recent warning to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu against such a strike while US diplomacy continues with Tehran.
US intelligence indicates that Israel has been making preparations to hit Iran's nuclear installations. But one US official said there was no sign that Israel had made a final decision.
""I don't want to say imminent, but it looks like it's something that could very well happen,"" Trump told reporters at a White House event, adding Iran could not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. ""I'd love to avoid the conflict,"" he said.
""Iran's going to have to negotiate a little bit tougher, meaning they're going to have to give us something they're not willing to give us right now.""
Security in the Middle East has already been destabilised by spillover effects of the Gaza war between Israel and Hamas. Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if the nuclear talks do not yield a deal and said he has become less confident Tehran will agree to stop enriching uranium.
The Islamic Republic wants a lifting of US sanctions imposed on it since 2018. Earlier on Thursday, Trump expressed frustration that oil prices had risen amid supply concerns arising from potential conflict in the Middle East.
With Washington offering little explanation for its security concerns, some foreign diplomats suggested that the evacuation of personnel and US officials anonymously raising the spectre of an Israeli attack on Iran, could be a ploy to ratchet up pressure on Tehran for concessions at the negotiating table.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said that even if the country's nuclear facilities were destroyed by bombs they would be rebuilt, state media reported on Thursday. The International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years, raising the prospect of reporting it to the UN Security Council.
The step is the culmination of a series of stand-offs between the IAEA and Iran since Trump pulled the US out of a nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers in 2018 during his first term, after which that accord unravelled.
An IAEA official said Iran had responded to the 35-nation board's declaration by informing the UN watchdog that it plans to open a third uranium enrichment plant.

Demolition of illegal fourth floor in flats ordered,"US
SHC slams builder, SBCA for illegal construction, safety violations
Adding an extra but unapproved floor in a flat may take some months to build but getting that unauthorised construction demolished may take around nine or more years in this country, thanks to administrative and litigation delays. Such an instance, in which the Sindh High Court has ordered demolition of flats built on the fourth floor of a plaza in Latifabad's Kohsar housing scheme, has unfolded in Hyderabad.
The subject of the case, Oasis Apartments which was supposed to have 39 flats in its ground plus three-storey structure, though pertains to a particular building, the practice of raising unlawful structures is noticeably rampant in commercial buildings.
Through its order the Hyderabad Circuit Bench has not only laid bare violations of a builder in connivance with the government's regulatory arm, Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), the omissions of the subordinate courts have also been brought to light. The order given by justice Riazat Ali Sahar reads, ""I am of the deliberate opinion that the findings of the learned trial and appellate courts are a result of their failure to consider the facts and the law. This is a classic case of non-reading of evidence and gross misinterpretation and non-application of the otherwise clearly applicable law.""
In 2016 an inhabitant of Oasis Apartment in Kohsar, Muhammad Irfan, filed a two-pronged suit before civil judge and judicial magistrate IV. Its one part was related to his payment problems against the builder, M/S Hassan Construction Co, Builders and Developers, and the other was about the interests of all the buildings' residents as well as matters of regulatory compliance like fire safety and water supply.
The flat's possession was supposed to be handed over to the allottee by January 1, 2012. However, the builder honoured his commitment allegedly with a delay of 34 months by October, 2014, and that too with unfinished works whose expenses were borne by the allottees. The possession was given without issuance of the possession letter, Irfan claimed. ""[the builder] has constructed a fourth floor putting the lives of the inhabitants in danger,"" he contended.
The trial court had raised eight points which it wanted the litigants to answer. Seven of these points pertained to controversies concerning the plaintiff and the respondent builder. But point number five bore on the violations committed by the builder by raising the fourth floor. Nevertheless, the case was dismissed and the plaintiff's prayers remained unheard. The appellate court of additional district and session judge VIII also upheld the same judgment.
""The trial court was of the opinion that since the plaintiff or other residents of the building had not approached the SBCA regarding construction of the fourth floor, the matter was one among the residents, the builder and the SBCA,"" the SHC's judge underscored in his order. ""A reading of the trial and appeal judgments would show that the evidence led in respect of issue number five were not considered at all. The observations of the learned appellate court on the matter of fire extinguishers and other safety equipment are astonishing.""
Justice Sahar pointed out that the appellate court stated in its order that ""a glance at this document [agreement between builder and allottee] shows that no condition regarding fire extinguishing, electricity or water hydrant nor roof top is mentioned in such terms and conditions."" He added that the aspect of construction of an unapproved floor, fire extinguishers and hydrants which concerned all the residents as well as approval conditionalities of the SBCA was totally ignored.
During the trial, Assistant Director SBCA Jameelur Rehman had submitted that the builder was granted permission for construction of the ground plus three floors with nine flats on the ground and 10 each on the first, second and third floors. He said the roof was to be handed over to the building's residents. Similar observations came from Azeemuddin Ansari, an associate engineer who was appointed by the trial court as the commissioner on July 15, 2019. Interestingly, both the lower courts did not touch upon such submissions.
""I find it rather strange — in all honesty, I find it sad — that the learned appellate court didn't differentiate between personal and public obligations of the builder and as a result, whoever enters into that premises to the grave risk of fire and lack of water supply,"" justice Sahar stated. The SHC ordered the SBCA to demolish the fourth floor but after ensuring that any third party interests created by the builder are compensated.
The authority has also been directed to initiate action against the builder for their violations besides taking action against the concerned officers of the SBCA for their connivance. Mukhtiarkar Latifabad will have to convey the judgment to the residents of the fourth floor and to advise them to seek compensation from the builder.

Ukrainians beg for news of missing soldiers,"US
Denys Nepotribna could not hear his tearful 26-year-old wife in the din
Amid the screaming sirens of ambulances bringing Ukrainian prisoners back from Russia on Thursday, Yana Nepotribna struggled to make her voice heard as she yelled out to her husband.
Denys Nepotribna could not hear his tearful 26-year-old wife in the din.
And he was among the soldiers surprised to see the woman climb onto a two metre (6.5 feet) high wall to get a better view.
Nepotribna fell into the arms of her husband and the other former prisoners surrounded them as though forming a protective shield around their reunion. She was then carried in the crowd having nearly lost conscious in the emotion of the moment.
""I held on to him like a vulture,"" she told AFP. ""He says he said something, but I don't remember what it was.""
The couple had one of the rare happy endings from the latest return of Ukrainians from Russian captivity.
At least one other woman emerged from the crowd in tears, unable to find the soldier she had been looking for in the crowd.
Russia and Ukraine agreed at talks in Istanbul last week to each free more than 1,000 prisoners of war and to send back the bodies of war dead. All of those freed were wounded or aged under 25.
The first stages of the swap took place on Monday and Tuesday, with Russia on Wednesday also handing back the bodies of 1,212 Ukrainian soldiers killed since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022.
The oldest Ukrainian soldier freed on Thursday was 59, the youngest 22. They included some who had been listed as ""missing in action,"" Ukrainian ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said.
The freed soldiers were besieged by distraught families looking for news of missing fighters.
Under the window of the building where the soldiers were taken, people held up banners with the pictures of missing soldiers. Dozens of identity pictures are also stuck to the walls. Families begged the returning troops to look at the images and shouted their names and brigade numbers hoping for news.
Wounded soldiers, some without legs and other limbs, were pushed in wheelchairs. One looked at the pictures as he moved through the crowd. ""That one is alive,"" he said after seeing one photo.
One soldier walked through with a Ukrainian flag around his shoulders. ""Mum, I am in Ukraine and I will soon be home,"" he shouted, in Russian, into a mobile phone.
Cries of joy and tears of sadness were passed through other phones as other soldiers made their presence known.
Iryna Melnyk said she found out during an exchange on Tuesday that her son, missing for the past two years, was alive.
""Two men told me that he was alive and in captivity,"" said the 44-year-old.
""I recorded them by video to show that my son is alive and that he must be saved,"" she added.
""I showed a photo of my son. I said: 'Look. 57th Brigade. Melnik.' And he looked at me and and recognised my son,"" she said.
The prisoner exchanges are one of the rare areas where the war rivals have been able to agree after more than three years of conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Ukrainian officials said more exchanges were expected in the coming days despite wrangling between the two sides.
Russian state media showed Moscow's troops in camouflage chanting ""Russia, Russia"" with national flags around their shoulders as they returned on Thursday.
According to a Ukrainian interior ministry estimate given in December, about 60,000 Ukrainian civilians and soldiers are considered missing in the chaos of the war.

Pakistan's first open data portal launched,"US
Platform will provide public access to vital govt datasets, promote innovation
In a pivotal moment for Pakistan's digital transformation, the federal minister for planning on Thursday officially launched the National Open Data Portal, which would serve as a central platform for public access to government datasets across vital sectors such as healthcare, education, economy, environment, infrastructure and demographics.
The portal was unveiled at the Pakistan Open Data Conference 2025, hosted by the National Centre in Big Data and Cloud Computing (NCBC), Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives.
This first-of-its-kind portal, developed by NCBC, is aimed at promoting transparency, empowering researchers and civil society and enabling data-driven policymaking and innovation.
Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal commended the NCBC's achievement for making this national platform a reality. He stressed that it was a great privilege to be part of the journey that led to the establishment of NCBC, which had played a pivotal role in building local capacity in artificial intelligence and machine learning.
""Pakistan's development narrative will now be written in codes and understood through data,"" the minister said, adding that leveraging digital tools was no longer optional but an urgent national priority.
He called the launch of the National Open Data Portal another major milestone that would empower policymakers, researchers and the public by providing access to valuable, structured datasets across key sectors and would support better decision-making, innovation and transparency for a stronger, more data-informed Pakistan.
Ahsan Iqbal concluded his speech with the message: ""In a rapidly digitising world, it is no longer enough to make declarations; we must deliver results. Let's unite – the government, academia, industry and our youth – to build a data-smart, cloud-enabled, globally competitive Pakistan. The launch of the National Open Data Portal is not the conclusion; it is the beginning of a new era.""
The event featured live demonstrations of the portal and a high-level panel discussion titled ""Harnessing the Power of Open Data"" with insights from industry experts.

US anti-immigrant crackdowns,"US
Organisers have called the raids unconstitutional and dehumanising
Anti-immigrant protests and crackdowns in the US have seen a significant uptick recently, as the country reels from an aggressive new wave of immigration enforcement. What began as isolated demonstrations in Los Angeles following sweeping ICE raids has rapidly morphed into a nationwide outcry, with protests erupting in at least 35 cities.
Organisers have called the raids unconstitutional and dehumanising — and with over 1,800 protests expected this weekend, the unrest is a clear signal that millions of Americans refuse to stay silent as their country drifts further into the grip of far-right authoritarianism.
At the centre of this crisis is President Donald Trump whose return to power has emboldened a hardline approach to immigration that blurs the line between civil enforcement and military intervention. In a controversial move, Trump has authorised the deployment of US Marines to assist ICE operations. While the Pentagon insists that the Marines are only providing logistical support, the symbolism being drawn is that immigrants are a national security threat.
This escalation does not exist in a vacuum. It comes amid a broader global shift toward anti-immigrant sentiment, stoked further by the ongoing Israel-Palestine war. As images of displacement and violence flood global media, political leaders in the West are increasingly positioning migrants — especially those from Muslim-majority countries — as potential threats to justify harsher border controls and mass deportations.
Trump's policies also reflect this dangerous ideology. His playbook is built on division, targeting the vulnerable to rally a loyal, nationalist base. In doing so, he is redefining the American identity in exclusionary terms.
However, the surge in protests shows that many Americans see through the fear-mongering. They understand that what's at stake is far greater than immigration policy. If the US normalises military-backed crackdowns on migrants, it will send a dangerous message to other democracies already leaning toward authoritarianism.

Trump repeats offer of mediation on Kashmir,"US
Trump said he made personal calls to both Indian and Pakistani leaders at the height of tensions
US President Donald Trump on Thursday again claimed credit for easing recent India-Pakistan tensions, saying he prevented a potential nuclear war by using trade pressure and direct diplomacy.
""I stopped a war between India and Pakistan, and I stopped it with trade,"" Trump told reporters after a bill signing event. ""Pakistan, now, it was their turn to hit, and eventually they're going to go nuclear.""
Trump said he made personal calls to both Indian and Pakistani leaders at the height of tensions. ""I called each leader, I respect them greatly. I talked about trade. I said, but you're not trading with us if you're going to go to war, if you're going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.""
""They understood it exactly. They stopped,"" he added. He praised his is role in preventing casualties, saying: ""I stopped that war with phone calls and trade."" ""And India is here right now negotiating a trade deal, and Pakistan is coming, I think, next week,"" he added.
In response to a question, Trump said, ""We're going to get them together. I told them, India and Pakistan  they have a longtime rivalry over Kashmir. I told them 'I can solve anything.' ""I will be your arbitrator. I will be your arbitrator. I can solve anything.""

After the last word,"US
When private writing outlives its author, who owns the story?
On April 22, nearly two and a half years after Joan Didion's death, a slim but arresting volume titled Notes to John appeared on shelves. Published by Knopf, the collection comprises fragments: personal memos, tender jottings, reminders to herself, and letters addressed to her late husband, John Gregory Dunne, after his death in 2003. In true Didion style, even her unfinished, offhand scraps shimmer with clarity and literary precision. But reading Notes to John is a disquieting experience: you are tugged in close, into the bone of her grief, and yet held at arm's length. It is as if you've found someone's diary under their pillow and, despite knowing better, can't stop turning the pages.
That tug-of-war between public and private, between a writer's legacy and their consent, is the central tension in publishing a dead person's notebooks. It's a literary act and a voyeuristic one. Notes to John may be the catalyst, but the phenomenon is hardly new. From the exhaustive curation of Virginia Woolf's diaries to the belated release of Franz Kafka's letters (which he explicitly asked to be destroyed), publishing posthumous writing has become a well-oiled machine. The ethics, however, remain as blurry as a half-erased pencil note in the margin of a draft.
The author is absent
There is something particularly vulnerable about the genre of the note. Unlike novels or essays, letters and diaries are not written with an audience in mind; at least, not a public one. And yet, perhaps paradoxically, they often reveal more than an entire memoir. In Didion's Notes to John, her sentences are brief, sharp, sometimes halting. ""I never feel guilty about working,"" she writes, somewhere between dream and discipline. It's devastating in its casualness. But should we be reading this?
When you hold a writer's diary, you are confronted with the illusion of intimacy. But the writer is gone. They cannot clarify, redact, or resist. Their editor is often a family member, a literary executor, or a publisher with contractual rights but not always moral ones. Shaun Usher's Lists of Note and More Lists of Note anthologise lists written by the famous and the long-dead: Da Vinci's shopping notes, Marilyn Monroe's acting prep, Isaac Newton's sins, presented with curatorial glee. They're fascinating, yes, but they also decontextualise deeply personal documents into coffee-table curiosities.
Dead men do tell tales
In Kafka's case, the betrayal was flagrant. He instructed his friend Max Brod to burn all of his unpublished manuscripts. Brod didn't, and the result is that much of Kafka's genius, The Trial, The Castle, his heartbreaking letters to Milena and Felice, came to light only after his death. Without that breach of trust, there would be no Kafka in the canon. So was Brod wrong? Legally, no. Literarily, certainly not. Ethically? Well.
Virginia Woolf's diaries and letters were curated posthumously first by her husband Leonard Woolf, and then by his nephew, Quentin Bell. Leonard admitted to cutting large swathes of material. Her personality, her flirtations, her frustrations with the Bloomsbury crowd, these only surfaced in later, more complete editions. Each round of publication brought her closer to her readers and arguably farther from the version of herself she wanted to project.
We are reading a Woolf curated by Leonard, filtered through edits and omissions; we are mourning a Didion arranged by her editor, not by Didion herself. The issue at hand is not just literary but legal. The ownership of the ""self"" after death falls into ambiguous hands, sometimes the estate, sometimes the publisher, sometimes the reader's projection. In Didion's case, her longtime editor Shelley Wanger helped assemble the notes, presumably with care and intention. But Didion, famously in control of her image and language, is no longer here to confirm whether she wanted these fragments to be seen.
The romance of rawness
There's something addictive about the ""raw"" version of a writer. We crave the uncut, the messy, the bloodied first draft. That desire is partly what fuels the publication of these private documents. They allow us to feel like we've accessed something real, beyond performance. The literary world, in turn, benefits from this hunger. Editors gain prestige for unearthing unpublished material. Publishers reap sales from both completists and the newly curious. Fans post screenshots of notes that feel like confessions. Everyone wins, except maybe the person who wrote them.
This urge isn't limited to literary estates. Think of how Anne Frank's diary was originally edited by her father to remove parts about her sexuality and frustration with her mother. Later, full editions emerged, richer and more complicated. Readers rejoiced, but the diary's shift from personal record to historical document carries a cost. Somewhere, the lines blur between honouring a voice and exploiting it.
Afterlife in the internet age
Today, we all keep fragments: Google Docs with no title, iPhone notes about dreams or shopping or shame. If we're writers, perhaps we think some of these might be useful for a future essay, a novel, a letter we mean to write but never do. But what if, after we die, someone else decides what deserves to be seen?
The politics of posthumous publication are not just about famous authors; they are about all of us. In the digital age, where drafts and thoughts live forever in clouds and caches, anyone's notes might outlive them. The desire to know a person more ""authentically"" can too easily become a desire to know them without their permission.
Copyright adds another layer of complexity. A note never meant for publication occupies a murky legal space; its ownership is uncertain. Grief, nostalgia, even a stray sentence from a dead woman to her dead husband all become subject to claims, though they resist easy commodification.
In The Year of Magical Thinking, Didion wrote about keeping John's shoes after he died, irrationally believing he might need them. Notes to John feels like an extension of that magical thinking, a belief that speaking to the dead can somehow keep them present, or that reading their words might bring them back. Yet publishing such words transforms a private ritual into a public spectacle.
The dynamics of posthumous publication often benefit publishers, estates, and readers, while consent from the author remains absent. As readers, we inherit both the privilege and the burden of that imbalance. We are owed nothing, and yet we often take everything. To read Notes to John is to be moved, but also to be implicated. The dead may not speak for themselves, but they wrote. That, sometimes, must be enough.

Water cutoff could spark war: Bilawal,"US
Pakistan delegation urges EU to help resolve Kashmir issue
The head of a high-level parliamentary delegation and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Thursday urged the European Union (EU) to guide the South Asian region back to a diplomatic path, calling for a comprehensive dialogue that included Kashmir, water disputes, and trade.
The delegation members addressed a roundtable titled ""South Asia at a Crossroads: Navigating Security Dynamics in a Changing Geopolitical Landscape"" at the prestigious Egmont Institute in Brussels, as they arrived in EU headquarters in the third leg of their visit.
The delegation reached Brussels on Wednesday, following their successful visits to the United Nations, Washington, and London. The visit is aimed at highlighting Pakistan's stance and countering Indian propaganda in the wake of recent tensions between the two countries.
Bilawal, also the Chairman of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), delivered a compelling overview of the evolving strategic balance in South Asia, highlighting the region's growing fragility in the face of an increasingly assertive power with revisionist ambitions.
He said that India's recent acts of military provocation based on unsubstantiated allegations, unprovoked strikes on civilian targets, and a troubling disregard for international law, were aimed at reshaping the regional order through unilateralism and coercion.
The delegation members also raised concern over the weaponisation of water, condemning the move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). They stressed that this step endangered ecosystems and livelihoods across the region.
They said that India's unilateral action undermined one of the world's most successful water sharing frameworks, warning that manipulating the shared natural resources for political leverage set a dangerous precedent and eroded principles of international cooperation.
Underscoring the imperative of peace, the delegation reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to regional stability, constructive dialogue, and multilateralism. They emphasised that lasting peace in South Asia required a peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
Meanwhile, in a meeting with Vice Chair of the Belgian Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, Katleen Depoorter, Bilawal shared Pakistan's grave concerns over India's attitude and stressed that dialogue remained the only path forward to regional stability.
We have a ceasefire, but not peace. India's threats to weaponise water, its rejection of dialogue, and refusal to uphold UNSC resolutions have dangerously lowered the threshold for nuclear conflict in South Asia,"" he said. ""Peace must not be partisan,"" he said, acknowledging the EU's stance on diplomacy.
Earlier, speaking to the media in Brussels, after a meeting with Bernd Lange, Chair of the European Parliament's Committee on International Trade, Bilawal highlighted the importance of dialogue in addressing these longstanding conflicts.
He conveyed Pakistan's deep concerns over Indian aggression, including threats to weaponise wateran act violation of the UN Charter that risked war. ""War cannot be a solution to any issue. All matters, including Kashmir and water, must be resolved through dialogue,"" he said.
Earlier, in an exclusive interview with the BBC, Bilawal warned that any attempt by India to block Pakistan's water supply would lead to war. India has made a major announcement regarding the Indus Waters Treaty, and if they follow through, there will be war,"" said Bilawal.
""If India stops our water supply, it will lead to war,"" he continued. He warned that actions like the use of water as a weapon in the international relations would set a dangerous precedent. ""If you allow water to be used as a weapon in the context of Pakistan, then tomorrow it can be used against anyone else.""
He also pointed to Pakistan's successful efforts in getting off the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List. ""We completed the entire FATF process, and the US was part of it. They saw first-hand how Pakistan acted against these [terrorist] groups,"" he said.
The PPP leader also spoke about his recent diplomatic visits to the US and the UK, calling them a success. ""Our position is based on truth, and we have come with a message of peace. We want to engage in dialogue, especially considering the looming nuclear risk.
