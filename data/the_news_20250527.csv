Imran to give call for ‘big movement’: Aleema,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315744-imran-to-give-call-for-big-movement-aleema,"ISLAMABAD: Aleema Khan Monday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder chairman Imran Khan had called on the party workers to roll up their sleeves for a big movement for which he will announce a date, as the times had changed.
“I will not call people to Islamabad. Rather, we will launch a movement throughout Pakistan,” she quoted the party supremo as telling her during their meeting at the Adiala Jail. However, she noted that Imran had made it clear that there was no place in the party for those playing on both sides of the wicket, and that they should decide on their own.
She regretted that the rights of ordinary prisoners were not being given to her brother and even the court orders were being repeatedly flouted. She said Imran was allowed to talk to his children once in eight months. She further said the party founder complained that the authorities were not allowing his sisters to meet him.
According to Aleema, Imran said, “Even if I am put in jail for the rest of my life, I will not bow down. They can do whatever they want”.
The party founder, she pointed out, also said a close eye was being kept on everyone in the party. Imran recently asked the party president of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter Junaid Akbar to step down as chairman Public Accounts Committee in order to focus on the party and its movement.
However, the very next day, he sent him a message to decide whether to continue as the PAC chairman and the party’s provincial chapter president.
Junaid had replaced Khyber Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur as KP PTI president a few months back.  Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan Monday claimed that the party founder Imran Khan’s petition will be fixed before Eid and advised the workers to keep their emotions under control for his release.
Talking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, he explained that there was hope that the case will be fixed before Eid.
“Our people are tired of enduring, as no one can even imagine why Imran Khan spent two years in jail,” he remarked. Gohar emphasised that the workers should trust the leadership and maintained that every possible effort was being made for the release of their leader.
He also pointed out that Imran himself was aware of ‘our efforts and we are doing everything with his advice’. Gohar said it was right of the party workers to raise questions for Imran Khan’s release.
Meanwhile, Senator Syed Shibli Faraz said the PPP and PMLN government will end as soon as the party founder was released. Talking to the media at the Islamabad High Court, Shibli said the petitioners come to the court to seek justice and ‘we believe in the Constitution and the law’.  He said everyone was watching the current situation, and wondered who will do investment in Pakistan.

Judges’ transfer involves opinions from four judicial forums: Justice Mazhar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315745-judges-transfer-involves-opinions-from-four-judicial-forums-justice-mazhar,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court adjourned for today (Tuesday) hearing in the identical petitions, challenging the transfer of judges to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) from other provinces and seniority of judges.A five-member constitutional bench — headed by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar — heard a set of identical petitions filed by six IHC judges against the transfer of judges.
The other members of the bench included Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar and Justice Shakeel Ahmed. The issue was also challenged by the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) as well as Lahore Bar Association.
The petitioners include Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kiyani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Justice Saman Riffat Imtiaz. They had filed identical petitions with the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, challenging the transfer of Justice Sarfaraz Dogar from the Lahore High Court, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court, and Justice Muhammad Asif from the Balochistan High Court.
On Monday, continuing his arguments, Faisal Siddiqui, counsel for the Karachi Bar Association, submitted that the Islamabad High Court was established under Article 175 of the Constitution. He said that while the law allowed for the appointment of judges from other provinces, it did not permit transfers.
Justice Mazhar questioned whether Siddiqui was asserting that judges from the other high courts could not be transferred to the Islamabad High Court. The lawyer replied that even if the transfer occurred, it would not be permanent. A judge returning after transfer does not need to retake oath, and even if he does, it would be a continuation of the previous oath, he said.
Justice Mazhar asked Siddiqui what will happen if, like in India, there was a unified seniority list for the high court judges.
Siddiqui argued that a unified seniority list will keep all judges informed of outcomes, and making a permanent transfer of a judge will amount to taking away powers from the Judicial Commission.
Justice Mazhar asked whether Article 200 had been nullified due to Article 175A and whether a judge’s transfer could no longer occur.  The judge pointed out that in India, judges were transferred without their consent.
Siddiqui replied that India had a unified seniority list and such lists take decades to establish. Changing seniority lists overnight through an executive action is authoritarian,” Siddiqui contended.
Justice Mazhar reiterated that judges’ transfer involved opinions from four judicial forums including the chief justices concerned and the Chief Justice of Pakistan. “If any of them disapproves, the transfer doesn’t happen,” Justice Mazhar said, adding that the judiciary’s opinion was obtained at all four levels.
Siddiqui argued that the process was carried out with mala fide intent, and the judiciary was kept in dark about the seniority issue. Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan submitted that under Article 200 of the Constitution, a judge’s transfers could be permanent or temporary adding that temporary transfers were mentioned in notifications and came with additional benefits, while permanent transfers included official accommodation.
The attorney general submitted that in time-bound transfers, judges return to their original high courts adding that if the transfer was permanent, the seat in the original high court became vacant.
The attorney general further submitted that judges transferred to Islamabad High Court were given official residences, but no additional allowances and their term of service remained intact.
He said no new oath was required upon transfer, as it was only needed at the time of appointment. The AG added that nothing was mentioned in the Third Schedule of the Constitution regarding a separate oath of Islamabad High Court judges but only high courts was mentioned.
Justice Naeem asked whether a new oath was required under Article 200. The Attorney General replied that no such thing was mentioned. Asked why the final transfer summary noted no need for a new oath and why seniority and oath issues were omitted from the initial summaries, the attorney general cited a Supreme Court ruling on seniority.
The attorney general submitted that out of five petitioner judges, only Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani was in the running for chief justice.
Justice Shakeel Ahmed asked the attorney general whether seniority and oath matters were to be decided by secretary law and asked if anyone had sought the secretary’s opinion. The court sought a response from the attorney general regarding the law secretary’s role.
Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan asked how many contractual terms the law secretary had enjoyed. The attorney general replied that the summary sent to the prime minister for advice was of administrative nature and said he would respond to the court’s queries. The court then adjourned the hearing until Tuesday.

BISP allocation set to rise by 20% to Rs716bn in budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315746-bisp-allocation-set-to-rise-by-20pc-to-rs716bn-in-budget,"ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Finance has proposed an allocation of Rs 716 billion for the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) in the upcoming budget against Rs 592.48 billion allocated in the outgoing fiscal year.
It indicates a 20 percent increase in the proposed allocation for the BISP programme. Top officials in the Finance Division confirmed to The News on Monday that the expenditure side remained one of the major stumbling blocks in the way of striking an agreement on the budgetary figures for the next fiscal year. However, the funding for the BISP is all set to be increased by almost 20 percent. The bill of debt servicing has not yet been reconciled between the IMF and Pakistani negotiators.
Increased allocation of the BISP will allow an increase in Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) Kafaalat programme benefits to adjust for anticipated annual inflation in 2025, allowing an increase in the quarterly benefit from Rs 13,500 to Rs 14,500 beginning in January 2026 under the agreed condition of the IMF.
It will also allow BISP to maintain the total number of enrolled households at 10 million. Ministry of Finance made commit to the IMF for continued annual inflation adjustments for UCT benefits to ensure that the most vulnerable households’ purchasing power remains at a minimum constant in real terms in coming years; and (ii) readjust UCT benefits upon the release of any new household surveys to continue transfers equivalent to 15 percent of the bottom quintile’s consumption once this threshold is reached.
The BISP is working closely with the World Bank to enhance education and health and nutrition conditional cash transfer (CCT) programmes, and with provinces to avoid overlap of BISP and provincial CCT programmes; the FY26 budget will keep spending on these programmes constant as a share of GDP.
From July to February FY25, the BISP disbursed Rs 347 billion, representing an 82.6 percent increase over the previous year, against a full-year allocation of Rs 592.5 billion.
Energy subsidies have been restructured to target the bottom 40 percent of the population, thereby ensuring fiscal savings without compromising social equity. Meanwhile, comprehensive rationalisation of public administration is underway, involving streamlining of over 43 ministries and 400 departments
The World Bank is engaging with the Power Ministry and BISP to develop (1) a method to identify electricity consumers by income rather than consumption level and a transfer mechanism that could replace the current energy subsidy frameworks.
The BISP is working closely with the World Bank to refine BISP administrative systems. Efforts are underway for keeping the NSER live and covering all of Pakistan’s poor; keeping BISP enrollment open; and administering the regular re-declaration of BISP beneficiaries’ status on the intended three-year cycle.
The BISP will continue to gradually expand the new electronic payment model, which will allow greater choice for beneficiaries. They will have bank accounts, which will enable beneficiaries to build savings, in place in pilot districts by the first quarter of FY26.
The BISP is continuing its efforts to enroll interested UCT Kafaalat families into the two CCT programmes, as it exceeded the FY25 education CCT enrollment target of 10.4 million by 400,000, and is on track to achieve its nutrition CCT target of 2.1 million.

Modi marks 11 years in power with threats to Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315747-modi-marks-11-years-in-power-with-threats-to-pakistan,"KARACHI: In a speech marked by inflammatory rhetoric and provocative threats, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday issued a chilling warning to Pakistan, stating that to end terrorism in the country, its citizens must choose peace -- or face his “bullet”.
Speaking at a rally in Bhuj in his home state of Gujarat on the day he completed 11 years in office, Modi declared: “To end terrorism in Pakistan, the people of Pakistan need to step forward. Live peacefully and eat your bread, or else my bullet is ready”.
Touting his government’s economic achievements, Modi stated that India has “surpassed Japan” to become the world’s fourth-largest economy. The Indian prime minister chose to juxtapose this with an attack on Pakistan: “While India believes in tourism, Pakistan considers terrorism as tourism, which is very dangerous for the world. I want to ask the people of Pakistan, what have you achieved?”
Modi also claimed credit for retaliatory strikes, alleging that India “destroyed their air bases” following provocations, and further added: “On the night of May 9, when Pakistan tried to target civilians, our military retaliated with double the force…
In Dahod (Gujarat), where he inaugurated several development projects, Modi continued to spin the narrative of military might as a reflection of national pride. He celebrated Operation Sindoor’s alleged destruction of nine “terror bases” in 22 minutes as an “expression of India’s emotion”.
The Indian prime minister’s continued trying to point out what he said was Pakistan’s obsession with “enmity and hatred” -- “The sole aim of this country (Pakistan), born out of the partition, is to continue enmity with India”, Modi said.
Meanwhile, another attraction at Modi’s Gujarat roadshow was Indian Colonel Sofiya Qureshi’s family, which was showcased as a symbol of India’s military narrative.
Pakistan, meanwhile, took note of remarks by Modi delivered in Gujarat with the theatrical flourish of a campaign rally rather than the sobriety expected of the leader of a nuclear-armed state.
The spokesperson for the ministry of foreign affairs said, “The hate-driven invocation of violence in his remarks is deeply disturbing, not only for its content but for the dangerous precedent it sets in a region already burdened by volatility. We regret the continued erosion of maturity and decorum in Indian statecraft.”
The spokesperson stated, “Such statements blatantly violate the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, which obliges member states to resolve disputes peacefully and to refrain from the threat or use of force against the sovereignty or political independence of other states.”
The spokesperson maintained, “Pakistan views these remarks as a reckless provocation, intended to distract from the ongoing human rights abuses and demographic engineering in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir.”
The spokesperson said, “Pakistan’s record as a leading contributor to UN peacekeeping and its consistent cooperation in global counter-terrorism efforts speak louder than any hostile soundbite. If extremism is indeed a concern for the Indian government, it would do well to turn inward—toward the alarming rise of majoritarianism, religious intolerance, and the systematic disenfranchisement of minorities under the increasingly brutal Hindutva ideology.”
“Pakistan remains committed to peace based on mutual respect and sovereign equality. However, any threat to its security or territorial integrity will be met with firm and proportionate measures, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. The international community must take serious note of India’s escalating rhetoric, which undermines regional stability and the prospects for lasting peace,” the spokesperson concluded.

Future of 80 GIK students at risk,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315748-future-of-80-gik-students-at-risk,"PESHAWAR: The future of around 80 students from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) enrolled at the prestigious Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIK Institute) hangs in balance due to a six-year-long delay in the provincial government’s disbursement of scholarship funds.
Credible sources within the institute confirm that the total outstanding amount under the KP Chief Minister’s Scholarship Programme has ballooned to nearly Rs356 million, covering the period from 2019 to 2025. These scholarships were meant to support talented students from across KP, many of whom hail from underprivileged families and cannot afford GIK’s full tuition without government assistance.
The GIK Institute, a renowned private not-for-profit university, does not receive any financial aid from federal or provincial governments. It relies heavily on student tuition and timely scholarship reimbursements to sustain its operations. The continuing delay has placed immense strain not only on the students but also on the institution’s ability to plan and manage its finances.
“Unless the pending scholarships are released, the institute may be forced to admit KP students only on a self-finance basis,” a senior GIK official stated. “This would effectively shut the doors of one of Pakistan’s top engineering universities on brilliant but financially struggling students from KP.”
The scholarship programme had functioned smoothly during the tenure of then-chief minister Pervez Khattak (2013–2018). The latest MOU was signed in May 2017, which is still valid. However, sources say that with the change in leadership under CM Mahmood Khan, the disbursements halted, despite repeated requests. Ironically, even the then finance minister Taimur Jhagra, himself a GIK alumnus, was unable to reverse the freeze — allegedly due to the CM’s direct control over all scholarship-related releases. Current strength of awardees is 78 with an amount of Rs66 million. Each year, 20 new scholarships are awarded, and the strength remains around 78 to 80 students every year.
Now, students, families, and GIK authorities are pinning their hopes on the Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, urging him to resolve the crisis and rescue these students from academic uncertainty.
“We’ve been living with anxiety for months,” said one final-year student, requesting anonymity. Despite severe financial constraints, GIK has been absorbing part of the unpaid costs to prevent students from dropping out. But university officials warn that this temporary measure is unsustainable.
Parents of affected students have now stepped in, appealing directly to the KP government to prioritise education and unlock the funds. “This is not just about our children — it’s about the credibility of public scholarship programmes and the principle of equal access to higher education,” said one father, a school teacher from Bannu.
As pressure builds and time runs out, observers warn that failure to act swiftly will not only derail promising careers but could also damage the reputation of KP’s commitment to supporting education.
The ball is now in the provincial government’s court—whether it chooses to invest in the future of its youth or let them slip through the cracks remains to be seen.
Secretary of Higher Education Kamran Afridi told this correspondent that funds for scholarships are not available during the current fiscal year, and the institute did not establish contact at the beginning of the financial year. Therefore, no funds can be provided for scholarships this year. However, the case will be presented to the provincial cabinet for the next fiscal year, and after the cabinet’s approval, funds may be released in the upcoming year.
He further stated that for the release of funds, the Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute will have to be registered with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Higher Education Regulatory Authority (KP HERA), and, like other private institutions, it must provide free admission to 10 percent of its students in accordance with the law.

"Technology to make justice faster, fairer: CJP",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315749-technology-to-make-justice-faster-fairer-cjp,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Monday said that the integration of technology into the justice system was not simply a matter of modernisation—it is essential to making courts more accessible, transparent and efficient for the people they serve.
The CJP was addressing a symposium, “Use of Technology in Judicial System in Pakistan: Prospects and Promises”, held here in the Supreme Court, convened by Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan.
The symposium brought together members of the judiciary, international experts and senior government officials to explore the future of judicial reforms through digital transformation.
Addressing the gathering, the chief justice described the symposium as timely and forward-looking, aligning with the reform agenda to be deliberated by the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) in its forthcoming meeting.
Similarly, the CJP acknowledged the contributions of Supreme Court judges Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, and the National Judicial Automation Committee and Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan chairmen and members for taking the initiative.
He also extended a warm welcome to international guests and expressed gratitude to China Supreme People’s Court Chief Justice Zhang Jun and Türkiye Constitutional Court Chief Justice Kadir Ozkaya for their continued support and commitment to judicial cooperation.
Reflecting on the reforms underway, Justice Yahya highlighted the key digital innovations recently implemented by the Supreme Court, including e-filing, QR codes on judgements, expanded video-link hearings, launch of a citizen feedback portal, and the use of data analytics for case management.
However, he also acknowledged ongoing challenges such as the digital divide, evolving legal frameworks, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
The CJP reaffirmed that the technology is a powerful tool to build institutional trust, eliminate barriers to access, and enhance the quality of justice. He called upon all stakeholders to move forward with unity and resolve to shape a judicial system that meets the needs of the present and earns the confidence of future generations.
Earlier, Justice Shahid Waheed presented an overview of the progress and evolution of IT within Pakistan’s judicial system, highlighting the milestones achieved and the structural challenges that remain.
The symposium featured perspectives from international experts. Supreme People’s Court expert Ms Li Xiaohui shared China’s digital journey in judicial reforms. Istanbul Technical University Rector Prof Dr Hasan Mandal presented a global view on how courts are adopting technology, and Türkiye’s Gazi University Prof Dr Çetin Elmas discussed the growing role of AI in shaping the future of justice delivery.
Similarly, Information Technology and Telecom Federal Secretary Zarrar Hasham Khan outlined Pakistan’s digital infrastructure plans and emphasised inter-institutional collaboration to support justice sector transformation.

"Police teargas, baton charge PPP’s ‘KP Bachao’ rally",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315750-police-teargas-baton-charge-ppp-s-kp-bachao-rally,"PESHAWAR: Police fired tear gas shells and resorted to baton charge as a large number of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) workers tried to enter the Red Zone while staging a “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bachao” rally outside the provincial assembly on Monday.
Some angry protesters, following the tear gas shelling, set fire to an abandoned camp that had been set up by workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) for a sit-in demanding the release of the party founder Imran Khan.
Several PPP workers, led by provincial leaders, including former federal minister Najmuddin Khan, former provincial minister Humayun Khan, Benazir Income Support Programme Chairperson Rubina Khalid, and others, participated in the “Save KP” rally outside the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.
Carrying party flags and chanting slogans, the protesters alleged that the provincial government was involved in unprecedented corruption and that the province was on the verge of collapse.
Heavy contingents of police had been deployed for the security of the Red Zone during the rally. Police fired tear gas shells and resorted to a baton charge when workers attempted to enter the Red Zone by breaking the iron gate installed on Khyber Road months earlier.
The condition of several workers and some leaders deteriorated due to the intense shelling. Former federal minister Najmuddin Khan was rushed to the hospital. The protesters later set fire to the PTI camp near the KP Assembly, which had been abandoned. The camp was originally established to press the federal government for Imran Khan’s release.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and other party leaders condemned the use of force against the protesters.
KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, in a statement, termed the provincial government’s action against the PPP demonstration in Peshawar as undemocratic and a clear sign of the government’s panic.
The governor said the strong public participation in the “Save the Province” campaign sent a clear message to the provincial government. He praised the PPP workers for turning out in large numbers to protest against what he called a corrupt regime.
PPP General Secretary Humayun Khan, Rubina Khalid, and other leaders also condemned the police action and tear gas on PPP workers.

"Bilal made SAPM to lead Pakistan’s  blockchain, crypto future",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315751-bilal-made-sapm-to-lead-pakistan-s-blockchain-crypto-future,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has appointed Bilal Bin Saqib as the Special Assistant to the PM (SAPM) on Blockchain and Crypto, with the status of state minister.
This groundbreaking decision positions Pakistan among an elite group of 7-9 nations, including the United States, El Salvador, and the UAE, with dedicated leadership for cryptocurrency and blockchain, signalling a bold commitment to leading the global digital economy. Saqib also serves as the Chief Executive Officer of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) and Chief Advisor to the Finance Minister.
As CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council, Bilal has spearheaded strategic collaborations and built critical bridges between Pakistan and global technology stakeholders. Under his leadership, the Council signed a landmark partnership with World Liberty Financial (WLF)  a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump  to help drive blockchain innovation and stablecoin adoption in Pakistan.
He also invited Changpeng Zhao (CZ), founder of Binance, and appointed him as Strategic Advisor to the PCC to help shape regulatory development, infrastructure expansion, and education programs for crypto in Pakistan.
A graduate of the London School of Economics (LSE) with a Master	s in Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship, he has been featured in Forbes Asia 30 Under 30 for his work in social impact.
Saqib has also been honoured with the prestigious MBE (Member of the Order of the British Empire) from King Charles III.
As SAPM, Bilal will be responsible for:  Developing a comprehensive, FATF-compliant regulatory framework for digital assets  Launching Bitcoin mining initiatives  Overseeing blockchain integration in governance, finance, and land records  Facilitating licensing and oversight of virtual asset service providers (VASPs)
Championing investor protection and Web3 ecosystem growth in Pakistan This appointment reflects Pakistan	s commitment to aligning with global trends. Just as the United States has brought leaders like David Sacks  appointed by Trump as the White House AI and Crypto Czar  into its digital policy framework, Pakistan is taking a forward-thinking approach by empowering a youth leader to help steer national strategy in emerging technologies.
Pakistan stands at a critical digital crossroads. The country consistently ranks in the top 10 globally for crypto adoption, according to the 2023 Chainalysis Global Crypto Adoption Index, with approximately 40 million crypto users and an annual crypto trading volume exceeding $300 billion. The nation produces around 40,000 IT graduates annually and boasts the 4th largest freelancer market worldwide.
This rapid uptake of emerging technologies, combined with a youthful population where over 60% of citizens are under the age of 30, positions Pakistan to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of blockchain and crypto advancements in the coming decade.
Strategic policymaking in these fields is not just an opportunity but a national imperative. According to Saqib: 	Pakistan	s unique demographic and digital landscape offers an unprecedented opportunity to leapfrog into the future of technologywhere blockchain and crypto will drive economic growth, innovation, and global competitiveness.

NA panel rejects bill on filing power theft FIRs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315753-na-panel-rejects-bill-on-filing-power-theft-firs,"ISLAMABAD: The Standing Committee of the National Assembly on Interior and Narcotics has rejected the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2024 Section 462 (O) regarding filing of cases for electricity theft by a majority vote.
The ruling party also voted against the bill while the bill was also rejected by members of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in the Standing committee. During the meeting, the committee unanimously recommended the passage of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) (Amendment) Bill, 2025, proposed by Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, MNA. The bill aims to establish child courts in every district, city, or jurisdiction, exclusively tasked with hearing cases of child abuse, including physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect.
The Standing Committee meeting was held with its Chairman Raja Khurram Shahzad Nawaz in the chair, here at Parliament House on Monday.
The committee examined in detail the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2024 Section 462 (O), a government bill, regarding filing of cases for electricity theft and placed it before the members for voting.
A majority of members opposed the bill, expressing concerns over the excessive powers it would grant to local police and power distribution companies, potentially leading to misuse. The members were of the opinion that the public would be humiliated through the new bill.
PTI’s Zartaj Gul said that action should be taken against the big thieves first. “We oppose this cruel bill, the public should not be handcuffed without reason,” she said.
PPP’s Abdul Qadir Patel said that meters in Karachi are not in the name of one person. He said electricity companies should fix themselves first as there is no system, there is no check and balance. “We will not pass it under any circumstances, we will not let anyone be handcuffed,” he said.
PPP’s Nabil Gabol said that a watchman was arrested for electricity theft. “You do not provide electricity and there is load-shedding for 18 hours in Karachi,” he said.
He said two people steal electricity but K-Electric cuts off the electricity of the entire area. The Standing Committee Chairman Raja Khurram Nawaz said that if a person is not living in this house, how can a case be registered against him.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said that “electricity is being stolen, we have to stop the theft”. “There should be no point scoring on this issue,” he said.
In defence of the bill, the Special Secretary from the Ministry of Power Division explained that the bill aimed to simplify the FIR process and ensure accountability for individuals who assist in power theft under Sections 182, 185, and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
However, a majority of members opposed the bill and the bill stands rejected and not recommended for the passage from the National Assembly.
The committee unanimously recommended the passage of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) (Amendment) Bill, 2025, proposed by Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, MNA.
The bill aims to establish child courts in every district, city, or jurisdiction, exclusively tasked with hearing cases of child abuse, including physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect.
These specialised courts will ensure that child victims receive justice through a legal process that is both efficient and sensitive to their needs. By establishing specialised courts introducing expedited trial processes, and prioritising victim protection, this bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for the protection of children and ensure that child abuse cases are addressed swiftly and sensitively, with the best interests of the child at the forefront.
The committee also considered the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2024 Section 498AA, moved by Ms. Sofia Saeed Shah, MNA. The bill was deferred with a directive to the mover to consult with the Ministry of Law and Justice and introduce amendments if necessary.
Additionally, three bills proposed by Ms. Sharmila Faruqui Hashaam, MNA—namely, the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024 (Schedule-II), the Corrosive Substances Assault (Prevention and Protection) Bill, 2024, and the Islamabad Capital Territory Dowry Restraint Bill, 2025—were also deferred to the next meeting on the request of the mover.
A comprehensive review of the implementation status of previous recommendations was conducted. The committee recommended summoning concerned officers of the Pakistan Coast Guard (PCG) to address issues regarding the construction of over 100 wedding halls in Malir, Karachi. However, the Director General of PCG was not present at the meeting.
The committee also discussed FIR No. 117/2024 registered against Jamshaid Ahmed, MNA, and decided that the District Police Officer (DPO) and Regional Police Officer (RPO) of Muzaffargarh should attend the next meeting to brief the committee on the matter.
The committee pointed out that a development package had been announced by the Prime Minister for the construction of roads in Islamabad, and although the work had commenced, attention must be given to projects nearing completion.
The chairman CDA informed the committee that funds had been released and work had begun, with priority to be given to projects already 80 per cent completed.
The committee further directed the Chairman CDA to initiate an inquiry into the poor condition of the Parliament Lodges and provide details of the work completed so far and the remaining work and the officials involved in corruption therein.
Furthermore, the committee directed the Chairman CDA to submit details regarding the total number of Union Councils, Secretaries of Union Councils, and the funds generated and utilised by the Union Councils in Islamabad.
The Chairman CDA apprised the committee that the required information would be presented in the next meeting. He also stated that no recruitments had taken place in the Union Councils over the past five years and that there were currently no vacant positions. The committee directed the Chairman, CDA to present a detail report on Senate Secretariat Employees Cooperative Housing Society (SSECHS) in the next meeting.
The report of the sub-committee concerning the murder case of Mustafa Amir in Karachi was presented before the Standing Committee for further consideration and recommendations.

Maryam launches first-ever free insulin programme for diabetic children,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315754-maryam-launches-first-ever-free-insulin-programme-for-diabetic-children,"LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Monday launched the “CM insulin for diabetes” programme, a first-of-its-kind initiative for young children suffering from congenital type-I diabetes.
As part of the launch, she personally delivered ‘CM Insulin Cards’ to children at their homes, accompanied by Pakistan Post riders. She visited the residence of Wasay Adnan, a five-year-old from Sabzazar Q-Block, and also met Zainab Waheed and Zain Shahzad in Jamil Town. Along with the insulin cards, she handed over insulin kits, glucometers, BSR strips, and needle boxes to the children.
She interacted warmly with children, and promised to send a toy car to young Wasay. She also ordered for immediate arrangements for Zain Shahzad’s eye check-up and treatment.
The CM’s arrival in these localities was met with a warm reception — residents gathered on rooftops and streets, girls showered flower petals, and elderly women offered prayers for her well-being. She also took selfies with young girls on request, engaging with families in a deeply personal manner.
Speaking to families, Maryam said, “I understand the anxiety of parents whose children suffer from diabetes. This free insulin programme was launched in response to the urgent needs of underprivileged families. Under our Sehatmand Punjab vision, no child will be left behind due to unaffordable medical care.”
She stressed the importance of children’s health as a government priority: “For the first time, glucometers and test strips are being provided along with insulin to children. The alarming rise in diabetes among children is a national concern, and we are determined to act decisively.”
According to a detailed briefing, in the first phase, 1,500 children will receive insulin at their doorsteps through a secure delivery system managed by Pakistan Post. Post riders will verify insulin cards via a dedicated mobile app, ensuring secure and timely delivery.
Each delivery will provide a three-month supply of insulin, with patients required to attend quarterly check-ups at their nearest district or sub-district hospital.
Registration for the programme is available at: NCD Clinics, Maryam Nawaz Health Clinics and Healthline app (1033). The programme operates under a Cold Chain System to maintain insulin quality during delivery. By combining digital verification with doorstep service, the initiative represents a major leap forward in equitable, child-focused healthcare in Punjab.
Meanwhile, a PMLN delegation from PP-52 constituency called on Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz in Lahore on Monday.
According to a TV channel report, the PML-N delegation was headed by Hina Arshad Warraich. On the occasion fateha was also offered for the late Javed Arshad Warraich. Nawaz Sharif paid tributes to the late Warraich. Maryam Nawaz also lauded services of Hina Javed Warraich.

"‘K-Electric loses Rs44bn to theft, billing flaws in 2024’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315755-k-electric-loses-rs44bn-to-theft-billing-flaws-in-2024,"ISLAMABAD: Karachi Electric has racked up a huge Rs44 billion in losses during 2024 alone due to unpaid bills, rampant electricity theft through the “kunda” system, and non-metered usage, the utility’s top officials told a parliamentary committee on Monday.
The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Government Assurances, chaired by MNA Nuzhat Sadiq, slammed KESC for compounding public misery with unannounced load-shedding and average-based billing, despite its failure to curb systemic inefficiencies. The panel directed the company to immediately end unscheduled outages and coordinate with local representatives to bring more consumers into the metered billing network. Lawmakers emphasized that paying consumers must not be penalized for the company’s inability to control power theft or recover dues. The committee vowed to revisit KESC’s compliance with its recommendations after one month.
Notably, in its recent petition before the NEPRA, the utility has reported recovery losses of huge Rs122.77 billion (2017-23), and now in 2024, the official of the utility reported additional Rs44 billion losses. Since 2006, KE consumers have received Rs804billion in federal tariff differential subsidies (TDS) to bridge the gap between the high cost of KE’s power generation and the uniform national tariff. It is still struggling with recoveries.
The NA committee also ordered the Ministry of Communications and NationalHighway Authority (NHA) to expedite rehabilitation of highways damaged by floods in Sindh and the dilapidated Chakdara–Upper Dir Road in KP. With monsoon season approaching, it called for a strategic maintenance plan and demanded a full breakdown of the NHA’s routine repair budget.
On another issue, the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis informed the committee that instead of Mansehra, the promised Protectorate of Emigrants office will be established in Abbottabad — just 24 kilometers away — to serve the Hazara Division. Lawmakers accepted the revision but demanded prompt execution.
Regarding overbilling of gas in Balochistan, officials from SSGCL said a special tariff — enforced by a Balochistan High Court directive — is now under review in the Supreme Court. They assured that billing will be adjusted in accordance with the court’s final ruling.
The meeting was attended by a cross-section of MNAs, including Shahida Rehmani, Aasia Ishaque Siddiqui, Sardar Nabil Gabol, and others, reflecting growing political pressure for accountability in key public service sectors.

Memoir discloses Gen Kayani’s role in facilitating Musharraf’s removal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315756-memoir-discloses-gen-kayani-s-role-in-facilitating-musharraf-s-removal,"ISLAMABAD: Asif Ali Zardari compelled Gen Pervez Musharraf to resign after securing the consent of his successor, Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, reveals Farhatullah Babar in his memoir.
The book also uncovers how pressure was mounted for the restoration of Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry through the deployment of the Triple One Brigade outside the presidency.
Titled ‘The Zardari Presidency,’ the book offers Babar’s firsthand account of events he witnessed as spokesperson to President Zardari during his first term (2008–2013). Regarding Musharraf’s removal, Zardari gauged Kayani’s reaction to the potential ousting of Musharraf, to which Kayani did not object and even suggested Aftab Shaban Mirani as the next president. Zardari then instructed his trusted party members to move resolutions in provincial assemblies demanding Musharraf’s impeachment and conveyed a message through Maj Gen (R) Mahmud Ali Durrani, urging Musharraf to resign or face impeachment. Initially dismissive, Musharraf eventually resigned weeks later.
The book reveals that Nawaz Sharif also aspired to the presidency during the PMLN and PPP alliance. In an informal conversation, Sharif remarked to Zardari, “My party thinks that I should become the President.” Zardari replied with a laugh, “My party also thinks that I should become the President.” The discussion ended there.
Divided into eight sections, the book’s fourth part delves into Zardari’s confrontation with the judiciary. According to Babar, neither Benazir Bhutto nor Zardari held favorable views of Justice Chaudhry, whom Zardari believed operated under the guise of independence while serving other interests. During the long march from Lahore advocating for Chaudhry’s restoration, Zardari faced pressure from his ministers and even the prime minister. However, he initially remained steadfast. A significant deployment of the Triple One Brigade occurred inside the presidency on the night the march approached Islamabad. Babar writes, “The maneuver may have created a perception of a military takeover, but it was not. It was optics for exerting pressure on Zardari to reinstate Chaudhry.”
While internal pressure mounted for Chaudhry’s reinstatement, Zardari urged caution. He told his advisers, “I know him inside and out. You people don’t. He will accept anything as long as he knows that he will be reinstated. He has been sending me messages. I know it. None of you knows about it.”
According to Babar, the message was conveyed through Latif Khosa. Justice Chaudhry visited Khosa, then attorney general residing in the Minister’s Enclave, on March 1, 2009. Babar notes that Chaudhry even offered a signed resignation letter in advance should he renege on his commitment. Chaudhry’s primary concern was his own reinstatement; he appeared indifferent to the reinstatement of other sacked judges.
Zardari played a pivotal role in initiating the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Pakistan had an agreement with Singapore for the development of Gwadar Port, which saw no progress for five years. The Chinese were reluctant to intervene and advised Pakistan to negotiate directly with Singapore.
Terminating the agreement posed risks. Zardari assigned the task to his principal secretary, Salman Faruqui, who successfully persuaded Singapore to amicably end the agreement. Additionally, various legal issues concerning Gwadar Port were entangled in court cases with numerous stay orders halting work. Zardari tasked then foreign secretary Jalil Abbas Jilani, a close relative of Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani, to resolve these issues.
Once accomplished, Zardari called Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, exclaiming, “Didn’t I tell you that I would do it in my own way,” thus paving the way for CPEC. A few months later, as his term ended and a military guard of honor saw him off from the presidency, the jewel of CPEC was part of his legacy.
Zardari also endeavored to mediate between Iran and Saudi Arabia. “When I met the Rahbar, I told him that I would sit in his office and not leave until he agreed… Pakistan can’t afford a war between Iran and Saudi Arabia,” Babar quotes Zardari after his meeting with Iran’s spiritual leader. He also attempted to involve China in these efforts. A decade later, in April 2023, the foreign ministers of both countries met in Beijing for the first time in seven years and agreed to reopen embassies and consulates.
Zardari supported Saudi Arabia in its war against Yemen’s Houthis. His rationale was that the triumph of rebels and militants anywhere signified a triumph of militants in Pakistan as well.
He also announced a ‘no first use’ policy regarding nuclear weapons against India in an interview with Karan Thapar. However, ironically, the Mumbai attacks occurred four days after this interview.

Kuwait reopens visas for Pakistanis after 19 years,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315757-kuwait-reopens-visas-for-pakistanis-after-19-years,"KARACHI: Kuwaiti government has officially resumed issuing a wide range of visas to Pakistani nationals, in a significant step towards bolstering bilateral relations and addressing critical labour needs, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Kuwait, Dr. Zaffar Iqbal, announced, Gulf News reported.
The Pakistani Ambassador also announced plans to bring 1,200 Pakistani nurses to Kuwait’s healthcare sector, which faces rising demand. An initial group of 125 nurses was slated to arrive last week but faced delays due to housing challenges. “Special teams are actively resolving the issue, and we expect the nurses to arrive in the coming days,” Dr. Iqbal said.
Starting this May, Pakistani citizens have begun receiving approvals for various visas, including work, family visit, dependent, tourist, and commercial categories, restoring a vital channel for travel and employment between the two countries.
Dr. Iqbal also revealed that Pakistan and Kuwait are in the final stages of signing a new labour memorandum of understanding (MoU), designed to streamline worker mobility and cooperation. “Some provisions are already being implemented ahead of the formal signing,” he noted.
With over 93,000 Pakistanis residing in Kuwait, the community plays a vital role in healthcare, education, and other sectors. “Our citizens are exemplary and respected contributors,” Dr. Iqbal said.

"‘Just joking’: Macron denies dispute with wife, blames disinformation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315758-just-joking-macron-denies-dispute-with-wife-blames-disinformation,"HANOI: French President Emmanuel Macron denied Monday having a domestic dispute with his wife Brigitte after a video appeared to show her shoving his face away when they touched down for a visit to Vietnam, blaming disinformation campaigns for trying to put false meaning on the footage.
The Elysee had been hoping that the visit to Vietnam would showcase France’s reach into the Indo-Pacific, but it has been shadowed by the incident which occurred as the doors of the presidential plane swung open after landing in Hanoi Sunday.
This is the third time this month that Macron has been the subject of viral video footage at a time when France says it is being targeted by repeated disinformation campaigns as Russia steps up attacks on Ukraine.
It was falsely claimed Macron took cocaine on a trip to Kyiv alongside British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and images also emerged purporting to show Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dominate the French leader in a handshake.
In Hanoi, Brigitte sticks out both her hands and gives her husband’s face a shove, according to footage shot by the Associated Press news agency. The French president appears startled but quickly recovers and turns to wave through the open door. But with most of her body hidden by the aircraft, it is impossible to see his wife’s facial expression or body language.
“My wife and I were squabbling, we were rather joking, and I was taken by surprise,” he said.Now it’s “become a kind of planetary catastrophe, and some are even coming up with theories,” Macron told reporters.Macron testily referred to the other incidents, including the images shot on the train to Kyiv where some accounts falsely claimed he shared cocaine.
But the object Macron removed from the table when the media entered was a tissue.Erdogan, meanwhile, was filmed holding the president’s finger at a summit.
“None of these are true,” Macron said of the videos.“Everyone needs to calm down,” he added.After the incident in Hanoi, the couple proceeded down the staircase for the official welcome by Vietnamese officials, though Brigitte Macron did not take her husband’s arm when he offered it.
The video circulated online, promoted particularly by accounts that are habitually hostile to the French leader.Macron’s office initially denied the authenticity of the images, evoking the possible use of artificial intelligence, before they were confirmed as genuine and Macron responded.
“In these three videos I took a tissue, shook someone’s hand and just joked with my wife, as we do quite often. Nothing more,” Macron said.He blamed manipulations on “networks that are quite well-traceable,” specifically pointing the finger at “the Russians” and “the extremists in France”.
He emphasised that all three videos were “completely authentic” but the meanings attached to them were not.Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, who had actively promoted the cocaine disinformation earlier this month, wrote on Telegram that Macron had received “a right hook from his wife”.She said Macron’s advisers would try to explain away the gesture by blaming Russia. “Maybe it was the ‘hand of the Kremlin’?” she said, with heavy sarcasm.

Pakistan outmaneuvers India in digital and information warfare,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315710-pakistan-outmaneuvers-india-in-digital-and-information-warfare,"The recent four-day military confrontation between India and Pakistan revealed a decisive victory for Islamabad on an often-overlooked battlefield: information warfare. While military tactics and diplomatic maneuvers played their part, the stark contrast in media strategies between the two nuclear-armed neighbors shaped both domestic and international perceptions of the conflict. Both countries engaged in military operations, but their digital and media strategies diverged sharply.
Pakistan made a strategic decision to lift social media restrictions as soon as hostilities began. Those restrictions arguably shouldn’t have existed in the first place—but that is a discussion for another time. Twitter and other platforms, previously subject to limitations, were made fully accessible to the public. In contrast, India imposed an information blackout by blocking thousands of social media accounts and websites, including international news outlets. This contrast revealed two fundamentally different approaches to managing wartime narratives.
Pakistan appeared committed to transparency, using open communication to counter Indian propaganda. The government also capitalised on the online presence of opposition supporters—particularly those affiliated with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Despite internal political divisions, the public remained largely united behind Pakistan’s stance during the conflict. India’s actions, on the other hand, reflected an unwillingness to allow its citizens access to independent or foreign information. By blocking Pakistani digital media and international coverage, the Indian government inadvertently exposed its intent to control the narrative and suppress unfavorable truths—particularly about civilian casualties, battlefield setbacks, and behind-the-scenes efforts to de-escalate.
While Indian media outlets engaged in aggressive and often blatantly false reporting, neither the Indian government nor its military conducted any high-level press briefings. Their silence and apparent arrogance suggested a belief that the international community would not question their narrative. But in today’s digital age, that overconfidence backfired. The absence of verifiable information and a deluge of disinformation damaged India’s credibility. Meanwhile, the information vacuum was quickly filled by sensationalist and irresponsible media coverage.
Indian broadcast news descended into a spectacle of unverified claims and outright fabrications. Reports of events that never occurred—such as Indian naval strikes on Karachi’s port, ground forces crossing the international border, Pakistan’s prime minister fleeing to a bunker, and even a coup against Pakistan’s army chief—were presented as fact. Television screens lit up with blaring sirens and animated fighter jets while anchors issued outlandish calls like, “Set fire to Karachi! Blow up the entire city!” This hyper-nationalism directly contradicted the Indian government’s more measured messaging, which sought to portray India’s strikes as “non-escalatory” and “proportional” responses to alleged terrorism. Officials attempted to frame India as a restrained actor, while television networks painted a picture of a country on the brink of annihilating Pakistan.
In contrast, Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) and government spokespeople delivered regular, composed briefings to both domestic and international media. These updates—evidence-based and grounded in international law—shaped global perception. The professionalism of the Pakistani military stood in stark contrast to the chaotic, misleading, or absent messaging from across the border. In a particularly symbolic moment, as India attempted to project strength through Bollywood-style propaganda, Pakistan responded with facts, clarity, and strategic media engagement. The result was a decisive win in the information war: Pakistan’s narrative dominated international news, and key global broadcasters acknowledged its claims—including the downing of six Indian fighter jets.
By May 8 or 9, many Indian citizens began to question the credibility of their national media. Reports indicated that large numbers resorted to VPNs to access Pakistani digital news platforms in search of a clearer, more accurate picture of events. Even the Indian government’s suspected false-flag attempts—such as targeting its own Sikh community to discredit their support for Pakistan—were widely disbelieved. Although Indian newspapers remained relatively credible, the nocturnal nature of cross-border attacks meant print media was often outdated by the time it reached readers.
The era in which governments could mislead their citizens during wartime without scrutiny is over. Information now flows freely, and the public demands honesty. This reality widened India’s credibility gap when U.S. President Donald Trump unexpectedly announced a ceasefire on May 10, creating a sense of anticlimax and confusion among an Indian public that had been primed for total victory. Opposition parties began demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi convene a parliamentary session to explain the abrupt shift in tone, especially after repeated claims of military success. Calls for Modi’s resignation have been gaining traction. Further adding to India’s embarrassment, CNN correspondent Nick Robertson later revealed that it was actually India that sought U.S. intervention to halt the conflict—after enduring significant setbacks at the hands of Pakistani forces.
India’s media strategy ultimately backfired on multiple fronts. Internationally, it emerged looking more like an aggressor than a victim of terrorism. Domestically, its government faced a credibility crisis when claims of victory failed to align with the facts on the ground.
While Pakistan may have won the information war, this episode offers valuable lessons for all governments. It illustrates that effective communication strategies must strike a balance between patriotism and credibility. When media abandon fact-checking in favor of jingoism, they damage national interests and erode public trust. It also underscores the risk of allowing state-aligned media to dominate the landscape—such channels quickly lose credibility in times of crisis. Had Pakistan’s mainstream media not been perceived as government mouthpieces, it might not have needed to rely so heavily on reopening Twitter and mobilizing citizen voices.
In a world where digital communication now shapes public opinion and international diplomacy, freedom of expression is not just a democratic value—it is a strategic asset. Transparency often proves more effective than censorship. And with a figure like Narendra Modi—once dubbed “The Butcher of Gujarat”—at the helm next door, Pakistan’s ability to present its case through diverse and independent voices became not only beneficial, but essential.
Ultimately, no government can wage modern information warfare alone. It requires an engaged public and a credible media. That’s a lesson Pakistan would do well to remember long after the guns fall silent.

Pakistan forces stand tall against all odds Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos: A legacy etched in fire and glory,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315711-pakistan-forces-stand-tall-against-all-odds-operation-bunyan-um-marsoos-a-legacy-etched-in-fire-and-glory,"CEO, GFS Builders and Developers
In the shifting sands of South Asian geopolitics, rarely has a single military operation changed the narrative as decisively as Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos. Launched by Pakistan in the early hours of May 7, this operation was more than just a retaliatory strike — it was a symbol of calculated resolve, unparalleled precision, and unwavering national strength.
Triggered by a series of unprovoked Indian missile attacks targeting civilian areas in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, which left at least 51 martyrs including women and children, Pakistan’s armed forces had no option but to respond with the full might of their strategic capability. But what followed was not mere retaliation — it was a masterclass in 21st-century warfare.
The ISPR confirmed that 11 brave members of Pakistan’s military were martyred during India’s cowardly strikes. Their martyrdom was not in vain. It fortified the resolve of a nation, humbled an aggressor, and reminded the world that Pakistan will never compromise on its sovereignty or dignity.
India’s belligerence, prompted by its own internal political crisis after the Pahalgam incident, lacked both credible evidence as well as international support. The Modi administration’s move to close borders, suspend treaties, and violate sovereign airspace was rightly labelled by Pakistan as an “act of war”. Yet, it was not Pakistan that chose war — it was forced upon us.
Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos targeted key Indian military installations, including the Pathankot and Adampur airbases — previously seen as impenetrable. Pakistan’s missile command and Air Force, operating in unison, exposed the hollow bravado behind India’s billion-dollar Russian-imported S-400 systems. Not only did Pakistan dominate the skies, but its drones hovered unchallenged over the very heart of India’s defence infrastructure — Delhi, Gujarat, and even military cantonments in Rajasthan.
In a daring extension of hybrid warfare, Pakistan’s cyber command disabled nearly 70% of India’s power grid, plunging major cities into darkness and disrupting communications nationwide. The world watched in awe. Civilian casualties were deliberately avoided. The message was loud but honourable: we are not aggressors, but we will never be subdued.
A ceasefire brokered, but a belligerent remains.
A ceasefire was brokered through intensive efforts by the United States, Turkey, China, and Saudi Arabia. President Donald Trump publicly endorsed Pakistan’s call for peace and strategic restraint, while President Erdogan of Turkey hailed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s measured leadership.
China, ever the trusted ally, remained firmly supportive of Pakistan’s territorial sovereignty, calling for calm and urging India to refrain from further provocation. Riyadh too, emphasised the importance of regional peace and expressed deep concern over India’s reckless adventurism.
However, in a baffling reversal, India has refused to honour the ceasefire agreement. It recalled its ambassador, expelled Pakistani diplomats, and reignited hostile rhetoric. In response, Pakistan’s Foreign Office declared a senior Indian High Commission officer persona non grata, reiterating that “any attempt to challenge Pakistan’s sovereignty shall be met with a swift, full-spectrum, and decisive response.”
The Indian PM Narendra Modi had hoped to distract a restless electorate with a manufactured external enemy. His government’s failures on human rights, and internal security had already frayed his political capital. But with this misadventure, he not only endangered regional stability but exposed his military’s unpreparedness. Internationally isolated, internally criticised, and diplomatically cornered, Modi’s gamble has backfired.
General Asim Munir: A leader forged in fire
At the heart of Pakistan’s resolute response stands Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir — a soldier’s soldier, a statesman in uniform, and a strategist of rare calibre. Under his leadership, the Pakistan Army has transformed into a seamless force capable of executing both conventional and hybrid operations with impeccable coordination.
General Munir’s decisions throughout the crisis have won praise not only from military analysts but from the nation at large. His insistence on precise retaliation, his avoidance of civilian casualties, and his firm yet composed tone in national security briefings have elevated Pakistan’s military posture globally.
As news of Pakistan’s successful operation flooded the airwaves, the response from its people was resounding. Social media turned into a digital battlefield of patriotism. Scholars, journalists, politicians, and even citizens from across the globe saluted Pakistan’s armed forces.
Today, Pakistan stands tall not merely because of its military achievements, but because of the moral clarity with which it confronted aggression.
In honouring our forces — Army, Air Force, Navy, and cyber divisions — we honour the very essence of our identity. And in the legacy of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, we find a new chapter in Pakistan’s story: not of victimhood, but of victorious resilience.
“I pay the highest tribute to our brave Armed Forces of Pakistan for their exemplary courage, sharp intelligence, and swift, decisive response to Indian aggression. Their heroic defence of our motherland inspires the entire nation with pride and gratitude. As a proud Pakistani, I salute their unwavering dedication to safeguarding our sovereignty and honour. May Allah continue to protect our defenders and bless Pakistan with lasting peace and strength.”

Deconstructing Indian navy’s combat capability - Post Pahalgam,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315712-deconstructing-indian-navy-s-combat-capability-post-pahalgam,"May 10, 2025, will go down in the annals of modern history as a case study of war between two nuclear powers. It will be extensively examined worldwide by present and future scholars, nuclear and military strategists, as well as war practitioners for decades to come. It will cast an impression on existing nuclear doctrines of states and prompt rethinking on the concept of a limited conventional war under a nuclear overhang. Never in the contemporary living memory of mankind have two nuclear powers tested such lethal weapons backed by cutting-edge technology and platforms. It was an ultimate test of opposing “wills” to dominate the escalation ladder.
As Pakistan launched its offensive response, ‘Bunyan-um-Marsoos’, in the early hours of May 10, it was clear that the nuclear-armed state was determined not to allow its conventionally superior adversary to establish the new normal it desired. Encouraged and pampered by the U.S. and the West for decades, Pakistan’s offensive strikes on 20 military sites across multiple regions in India were no less than a thunderbolt from the sky for New Delhi.
As war clouds dissipate for now and the toxic but pulverised Akhand Bharat mindset of Modi and his cabal struggles to recover, it is abundantly clear that it was India that panicked and approached Washington, Riyadh, and Ankara pleading for intervention and a ceasefire settlement. At no stage did Pakistan ever seek a ceasefire but did exercise strategic restraint even against repeated attempts of unprovoked aggression.
In their groundbreaking work, Arming without Aiming: India’s Military Modernization, published several years back, renowned authors Stephen Cohen and Sunil Dasgupta brilliantly argue, ‘India’s military modernisation lacks strategic planning. Thus, despite having resources to modernise, the country’s efforts are hindered by a lack of strategic military planning resulting in haphazard military change.’ The account clearly indicts India for its pursuit of technology without clearly defined military-strategic objectives. Delays and cost overruns affecting the Indian Navy’s operational preparedness, besides technical issues impinging on operational effectiveness, are examined and underlined in the narrative. It seems no lessons were drawn by strategic minds in the Indian Navy.
In late 2015, the Indian Navy published its apex document, titled the Indian Maritime Security Strategy (IMSS). It importantly lays down, among other things, India’s maritime security imperatives and influences, strategy for deterrence, and strategy for conflict. Interestingly, the Indian Navy also crowns itself with the title of “Net Security Provider” (NSP) for the Indian Ocean region. Under the ‘Principles of Net Security’, it says, ‘The principles of net maritime security will guide the broad methodology to reduce common threats and challenges, and build conditions whereby these will be monitored, contained, and countered’. The foreword recognises a change in the national outlook towards the seas and the maritime domain, and a clearer recognition of maritime security being a vital element of national progress and international engagement. ‘More than 90 percent of India’s international trade by volume and 70 percent by value is carried over the seas,’ according to IMSS.
Fast forward to 2025. In the press release issued by the White House earlier this year following a meeting between President Trump and PM Modi in Washington, India’s position as a “Net Security Provider” is treasured in the following words: ‘The US appreciates India’s role as a developmental, humanitarian assistance, and net security provider in the Indian Ocean region.’
In the days following the incident at Pahalgam and the events unfolding thereafter, the Indian Navy received a reality check. It found itself to be far less combat-capable or competent to dominate than what it has been professing to the world. The reverberations of the consequential developments in the North Arabian Sea have now gone beyond the Indo-Pacific-more importantly, to Washington and perhaps other world capitals as well.
A new chapter has been written in the waters of the North Arabian Sea of the Indian Ocean. It is authored by a small, networked, well-integrated, and resolute Pakistan Navy. Despite towering claims and years of partnership in mega naval drills with the United States Navy, besides navies of QUAD member countries, the self-importance and hubris of the Indian Navy lies in ruin.
As one of the few world navies operating aircraft carriers, the conflict was an ideal opportunity for the Indian Navy to showcase these mega platforms. Fundamentally, a powerful instrument for power projection, sea control, and maritime dominance, the aircraft carrier is meant to create deterrence, awe, and fear. Its defensive employment runs counter to the raison d’être of an aircraft carrier in the first place. Here, the Indian Navy was found placing a carrier almost 700 km (over 380 nm) south of Pakistan’s coast. Putting a carrier battle group at such a distant location from the coast of Pakistan clearly indicated the protective (defensive) and wary nature of its employment. This was a safe sanctuary away from the main battle theatre. And here was a navy claiming to be a ‘Net Security Provider’ for the region and aspiring for global ambitions.
To be fair, however, the Indian aircraft carrier faced numerous threats. It lacked enough fighter aircraft on board for the concurrent conduct of defensive (protective) operations as well as offensive operations. The threat of Pakistan Navy’s long-range maritime patrol aircraft carrying air-to-surface missiles posed a challenge. The submarines of the Pakistan Navy, armed with sub-surface-to-surface missiles, presented yet another formidable threat. This is not to mention the long-range carrier-killer missiles on the coast of Pakistan, capped with robust air defence systems.
Pakistan Navy’s strategy of Anti-Access and Area Denial (A2/AD), with compelling employment of platforms and weapons systems, instilled enough fear and fright in opposing ranks. Thus, despite being several times larger and holding intimidating platforms, the Indian Navy blinked.
War, according to the widely read Prussian general Clausewitz, is a clash of wills. The side that shatters the enemy’s will to fight gains significant advantage-a lesson that was perhaps ignored by the Indian Navy at its own peril when it set sail to take on the Pakistan Navy.
With “will” depleted, the Indian Navy had little choice except to settle for keeping assets in safe haven, fearing Pakistan Navy. Satellite images clearly showed INS Vikrant, earlier stationed at sea, only to be suddenly withdrawn and berthed inside the Indian port of Karwar. Whither I.N. strategy for deterrence and strategy for conflict?
Far from establishing dominance, the Indian Navy made all attempts to stay out of harm’s way in the North Arabian Sea, outclassed by the Pakistan Navy. The massive disinformation and blatant lies about targeting and damaging Karachi port, blockade of Karachi, etc., now lie fully exposed. Truth reminds us one of the Sanskrit and national motto
of India: “Satyameva Jayate” truth alone triumphs.” Indeed, this time, however, it certainly did not hold true for India. It seems the Pakistan Navy has turned the Indian Navy’s self-proclaimed title and national motto on its head. The key takeaways of the just-concluded war in the North Arabian Sea are:
a). Pakistan Navy’s A2/AD strategy stands verified and established
b). The myth of Indian Navy’s invincibility and ‘Net Security Provider’ status stands broken
c). Indian Navy’s carrier task group proved an abject failure in establishing conditions for local sea control, let alone dominating the North Arabian Sea
d). Indian Navy’s fleet of carriers, battleships, and modern submarines failed to dent the resolve and deterrence potential of the Pakistan Navy
e). The operational and other aspects of capacity building of the Indian Navy by the U.S. Navy and partner navies, vis-a-vis its recently demonstrated combat capability, raises serious questions on such investments
Will this trigger a rethinking in Washington-whether or not to outsource its strategic responsibilities in an important region to a partner navy that, despite huge investments, hardware, and operational support, stands outclassed by a tiny Pakistan Navy? This verdict can be safely left to time-and perhaps to the next round. However, India’s fallacy of being a regional policeman and Net Security Provider stands knocked down and completely fractured.

After Pahalgam: Pakistan’s tactical gains and the imperative for peace,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315713-after-pahalgam-pakistan-s-tactical-gains-and-the-imperative-for-peace,"Undoubtedly, Pakistan emerged stronger both on the war as well as diplomatic front following the April 22nd Pahalgam incident in Indian-held Kashmir. While war rarely brings joy, when a country faces aggression and responds decisively, it can offer a momentary sense of relief and national pride.
As always, truth is the first casualty in any conflict. Objectivity is compromised, and narratives are shaped by emotions and agendas. But the way Pakistan handled the crisis-militarily, diplomatically, and through the media-led many to believe that India committed a strategic blunder. It not only suffered losses on the battlefield but also found its leadership, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under political pressure unless he attempts another “misadventure.”
War brings suffering, economic strain, and human loss. Still, in its immediate aftermath, unity emerges. Yet this unity is fragile and doesn’t always reflect long-term political trends.
Pakistan gained an edge for several reasons. India reportedly lost six aircrafts, including a Rafale, while Pakistan’s Air Force remained intact. Diplomatically, India failed to garner the international support it once enjoyed-particularly compared to the Kargil conflict. On the media front, Pakistani outlets appeared more restrained and objective, in contrast to India’s sensationalist, sometimes irresponsible media coverage. As a result, national morale in Pakistan surged, echoing a unity not seen in years.
Modi’s political narrative has long revolved around hostility towards Pakistan and internal minorities, particularly Muslims. This strategy has worked electorally, but it may be reaching its limits. Following the Pahalgam episode, India’s global isolation was evident. Questions need to be asked-why did India fail to win international support this time? Why take such a confrontational path now, when it had avoided war after more severe provocations like the Mumbai attacks or the assault on its Parliament?
Wartime unity is often fleeting. It is up to leadership to channel it into long-term national cohesion.
Despite India’s democratic edge-where elections are more transparent and generally unquestioned-Pakistan can learn from this by strengthening its own electoral credibility. Unlike the unprovoked Kargil war, where Pakistan faced immense pressure, especially from the United States and President Clinton, the current situation played out more favourably for Islamabad. That war resulted in political fallout and the eventual ouster of Nawaz Sharif by General Musharraf.
In contrast, the recent confrontation saw broad public backing and even a rare political ceasefire between government and opposition. Though it’s too early for a definitive assessment, international responses-especially from the U.S. and President Trump, who acknowledged the Kashmir issue-marked a shift from the usual diplomatic climate.
Modi now finds himself in a bind. The war hysteria he created has backfired. His series of missteps could haunt him politically, as it did in 2001 when BJP lost crucial elections after similar aggression. Pakistan’s swift and measured military response contrasted sharply with India’s overreach, including an inability to substantiate its accusations over the Pahalgam incident.
From my own memories-being a child during the 1965 war and a student during 1971-I’ve witnessed how war initially unites but later gives way to division and blame. After 1971, when Pakistan lost its eastern wing not because India won, but due to internal political failings, national unity evaporated quickly. That loss was a product of political mismanagement following the 1970 elections, not merely a military failure.
The lessons of 1971 remain relevant. Unity forged in battle is unsustainable without smart governance and reconciliation. Even as Pakistan celebrated its recent military and diplomatic performance, leaders must avoid triumphalism. Shahbaz Sharif’s claim that Pakistan “took revenge for 1971” was both inaccurate and unhelpful. Pakistan didn’t lose 1971 to India; it lost it to itself.
Today’s media landscape-especially in India-is driven by ratings and sensationalism. The spread of fake news and war propaganda has poisoned public discourse. There’s an urgent need to rethink this financial and editorial model, or we risk being hostages to hysteria, not truth.
Ultimately, war is not a solution. Peace is. The current ceasefire should be a stepping stone to dialogue-perhaps beginning with backchannel diplomacy or Track-II initiatives. Both Pakistan and India need to wage a different kind of war: against poverty, illiteracy, and extremism. The question is: can we rise to the challenge?

The data-link divide in modern warfare: Pakistan vs India,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315714-the-data-link-divide-in-modern-warfare-pakistan-vs-india,"Modern warfare is no longer just about who has the most advanced jets or the biggest missiles. The real game-changer lies in information dominance-the ability to share real-time battlefield data across fighters, airborne early warning systems (AWACS), and surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries. In this new era of combat, Pakistan and India present a stark contrast - one has embraced seamless digital integration, while the other struggles with technological fragmentation.
What is a data-link, and why does it matter?
A data-link is a secure, high-speed communication system that allows military assets to exchange critical information in real time. Think of it as a battlefield group chat - jets share enemy positions, missile warnings, and targeting coordinates instantly. For example, the U.S. military’s Link-16 allows an F-35 stealth fighter to transmit target data to a naval destroyer, which can then launch a missile without delay. Without such systems, pilots and ground forces operate in isolation-effectively blind in a high-speed, high-stakes environment.
The security risks behind the divide
Why don’t all militaries use the same data-links? Because sharing them means exposing vulnerabilities. Different military ecosystems speak different data-link “languages.” NATO’s Link-16, Russia’s TKS-2, and China’s proprietary systems are incompatible by design - to prevent adversaries from reverse-engineering stealth technology or electronic warfare capabilities.
Turkey, a NATO member, purchased Russia’s S-400 missile system, which operates on the TKS-2 data-link. The problem? NATO’s F-35 stealth jets use Link-16. The S-400’s radars could have collected F-35 stealth signatures, potentially exposing them to Russia. The U.S. kicked Turkey out of the F-35 program, costing Ankara billions. This clash underscores the risks of mixing rival defense ecosystems.
India’s Rafale jets (French) are among the most advanced in the region, equipped with: AESA radars (superior detection), Meteor missiles (200 km range, beyond-visual-range lethality), but they cannot digitally communicate with: Su-30MKIs (Russian, using TKS-2), S-400 missile systems (Russian), and Netra AWACS (Indian, custom data-link). France refuses to share the Rafale’s source code, preventing India from integrating it with Russian or indigenous systems.
What are the consequences?
No real-time data-sharing between Rafales and Su-30s, S-400 missiles cannot receive instant targeting updates from Rafales, manual radio relays slow down response times (10-30 seconds vs. milliseconds), and in a dogfight where jets move at 1 km per second, these delays are fatal.
In contrast, Pakistan has developed Link-17, a homemade, encrypted data-link that connects: JF-17 & 35 Thunder fighters, ZDK-03 AWACS (Chinese), HQ-9 SAMs (Chinese equivalent of S-300), and PL-15 (Chinese). During the Balakot crisis, Pakistan’s integrated network proved decisive: AWACS tracked Indian jets and relayed data to JF-17s, JF-17s launched SD-10 missiles, while SAMs stood ready, no friendly fire incidents - everything was synchronized. This real-time coordination allowed Pakistan to execute surgical strikes with precision.
Why fighters must talk to SAMs (Like the S-400)?
India’s S-400 is a formidable system (400 km range, tracks 80 targets). But without data-link integration, its potential is crippled. Rafale spots an enemy at 200 km - but cannot digitally transmit coordinates to the S-400. S-400 must wait for its own radar (600 km range) to detect the threat - wasting precious seconds.
Can’t they just use radio?
Yes, but: Voice relays take 10-30 seconds - manual inputs introduce errors. Data-links transmit in milliseconds, error-free. In modern combat, those seconds decide victory or defeat.
The deadly cost of fragmentation: India’s Mi-17 friendly fire (2019).
During the 2019 Balakot tensions, India’s own SPYDER missile system shot down an Mi-17 helicopter, a deadly fratricide killing six. Why? No data-link integration between IAF fighters and air defense. SPYDER operators misidentified the helicopter as hostile. This tragic incident highlights the dangers of a disconnected military.
In a hypothetical battle scenario: Pakistan vs. India
Let’s imagine a future clash: Pakistan’s Networked Approach: AWACS detects Indian jets 300 km away. Data instantly shared via Link-17 to JF-17s and HQ-9 SAMs. JF-17s fire SD-10 missiles; SAMs finish the job. India’s Disjointed Response: Rafale spots Pakistani jets but cannot digitally alert Su-30s or S-400. Su-30s rely on voice radio - delays, confusion. S-400 fires late - enemy escapes or strikes first.
Integration wins over raw firepower.
Who’s ahead?
Pakistan’s Link-17 provides a unified, real-time kill chain. India’s Rafales and S-400s are superior individually, but fragmentation weakens them. India lacks a universal data-link (like Link-17) to bridge French, Russian, and Indian systems. India would request France or Russia for source-code access - or risk obsolescence- which the French would never accept.
In the age of information warfare, network cohesion trumps standalone superiority. Pakistan has adapted better to this reality. India is struggling with fixing its data-link divide; and its risks of losing the next battle before it even begins continue.

Rafales shot down: A geopolitical and financial shockwave,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315715-rafales-shot-down-a-geopolitical-and-financial-shockwave,"In a dramatic escalation that has jolted South Asia and unsettled global markets, the Pakistan Air Force’s downing of five Indian jets-including two Rafales worth over $200 million-has reshaped the strategic and financial calculus of the region. With more than 100 Rafales ordered by the Indian Air Force as part of a $9.4 billion modernisation program, the loss has sparked global debate on the vulnerability of high-end defence systems in active conflict zones.
Tensions soared between nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan following a deadly attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir, on April 22, 2025. In response to Indian missile strikes along the Line of Control and in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the Pakistan Air Force shot down five Indian fighter jets on May 7. The escalation claimed the lives of several civilians, including children. Among the downed aircraft were high-value assets: Frence-made Rafales, Russian-origin Su-30MKIs, and MiG-29s.
The destruction of the Rafale jets, widely regarded as the pride of India’s air force modernisation, captured immediate global media attention and sent ripples through international financial markets. Beyond the military dimension, this incident marked a significant geopolitical and symbolic moment, elevating Indo-Pakistani tensions to their highest point since the Balakot strikes in 2019.
Crucially, Pakistan’s successful use of Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets and PL-15 air-to-air missiles has drawn international attention. The Pakistan Air Force’s swift and precise response in intercepting and neutralising the incoming threat demonstrated remarkable operational readiness and tactical excellence. By successfully downing multiple Indian fighter jets-including advanced Rafales and Su-30MKIs, the Pakistan Air Force not only safeguarded key strategic assets but also averted what could have been a much larger humanitarian and infrastructural loss. Their use of cutting-edge J-10C jets and PL-15 missiles highlighted both technological capability and effective military training. In the face of escalation, the PAF’s measured but firm action reinforced Pakistan’s deterrence posture and underscored its commitment to national defence without provoking a wider conflict.
Global markets react: Stock shock amid geopolitical heat
The announcement that Pakistan had shot down at least two Rafale jets triggered a sharp response in global defense, energy, and equity markets. Investor confidence was rattled, and the incident reignited debates on regional stability, deterrence, and the risks of advanced arms diplomacy.
The downing of the Rafale aircraft was more than just a tactical event-it was a symbolic blow to India’s air superiority narrative. Featuring cutting-edge radar systems, electronic warfare capabilities, and long-range missile capacity, the Rafale was seen as a game-changer for the Indian Air Force.
With India having spent approximately $9.4 billion on its Rafale fleet from France’s Dassault Aviation, questions are now being raised about the cost-effectiveness and survivability of such high-value assets in modern warfare. Videos of the Rafale wreckage circulated widely on social media, generating backlash against Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and raising uncomfortable questions about the effectiveness of expensive foreign military imports.
Dassault under pressure: Strategic blow and market reaction
The financial fallout was immediate. Shares of Dassault Aviation, the manufacturer of the Rafale, fell nearly 6% on May 8 amid fears over reputational damage and potential disruptions to export deals. Trading floors in Paris, Mumbai, New York, and Beijing witnessed volatility as defense stocks came under pressure.
Despite efforts by French authorities to manage the narrative, viral footage and global media coverage made damage control difficult. The incident also cast a shadow on Dassault’s ongoing negotiations with countries like Indonesia and the UAE, while future Indian contracts may now face increased scrutiny. On May 8, Dassault’s shares dropped by 1.64% to EUR 324 on the Paris Stock Exchange.
Pakistan’s market response: Volatility then recovery
Pakistan’s stock market, too, saw initial turbulence. The KSE-100 index fell 3.1% on May 8 amid broader uncertainty. However, nationalist sentiment following the air force’s successful operations helped stabilise investor confidence. Compounding the positive momentum was the announcement of the next tranche of the IMF program, which sent reassuring signals to investors and helped restore a degree of market stability.
According to the State Bank of Pakistan, foreign exchange reserves also rose by $412 million in the same week, adding to the market’s rebound.
The future of Rafale: Symbolism and sales at stake
While the Rafale jets have not been written off, the incident raises difficult questions for Dassault and India. To retain current and potential buyers, Dassault will need to invest not only in combat system improvements but also enhanced after-sales service, pilot training, and technology upgrades.
The perception damage, however, is real. The downing of Rafale jets by Pakistan air force has momentarily shaken global defense market confidence, particularly in the South Asian context, and exposed fault lines in arms diplomacy. Though markets have shown resilience, the long-term effects on Rafale’s image and India’s defense posture remain uncertain.
In both perception and reality, the downing of India’s Rafale jets has been a strategic setback with tangible market consequences. It highlights the fragile interplay between military hardware, national pride, and global finance. As regional tensions persist, the real test lies ahead: restoring confidence-military, political, and financial-in a highly volatile geopolitical neighborhood.

Balochistan PA condemns Khuzdar school bus suicide attack as inhumane and cowardly,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315719-balochistan-pa-condemns-khuzdar-school-bus-suicide-attack-as-inhumane-and-cowardly,"QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Monday unanimously passed a resolution condemning the suicide attack on the Army Public School bus in Khuzdar as a cowardly, brutal, and inhumane act. The resolution described the attack as a savage assault on the future of the nation and a deliberate attempt to sabotage peace and education in Pakistan.
The resolution was jointly presented by National Party MPA Mir Rehmat Saleh Baloch and Opposition Leader Mir Younis Aziz Zehri, strongly denouncing the May 21 attack, which claimed the lives of eight innocent students and several other civilians, while leaving many injured.
“This barbaric act was not only an atrocity against unarmed children but also a malicious conspiracy targeting Pakistan’s youth, national integrity, and the pursuit of knowledge and peace,” the resolution stated. The assembly demanded immediate action from the provincial government to bring the perpetrators and their facilitators to justice.
During the debate, Opposition Leader Younis Aziz Zehri urged authorities to arrest those behind the attack on the schoolchildren and Levies personnel. He criticised the prime minister’s brief visit to the province, calling it inadequate in the wake of such a grave tragedy.
Engineer Zamrak Khan Achakzai of the Awami National Party lamented the lack of implementation of the National Action Plan across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and stressed that peace, not weapons, was the real solution. He called for an in-camera briefing on law and order.
Kulsoom Baloch of the National Party said the attack exposed the absence of state writ and the worsening security situation across the province. Adviser to the Chief Minister Meena Majid stated that schoolchildren were deliberately targeted and presented evidence alleging Indian support to terrorist networks operating in Balochistan.
Provincial Minister for Planning and Development Mir Zahoor Buledi said terrorism has no religion or ideology and claimed the attack’s roots could be traced to India, accusing it of trying to derail Pakistan’s development. He praised the role of the security forces and vowed continued resistance against terrorism.
PMLN MPA Zarak Khan Mandokhail said that targeting children was a failed attempt to destabilise Balochistan, and called for unity against those misleading the people. Farah Azeem Shah of the BAP said the Khuzdar attack proved that Indian-backed terrorists were active in the province. She urged the government to present Pakistan’s case globally and called for India to be declared a threat to regional peace.
PMLN Parliamentary Leader and Provincial Minister Mir Saleem Khosa described the attack as one of the most heartbreaking incidents in Balochistan’s history. He said the children’s martyrdom had exposed the hollow narratives of separatist elements and reaffirmed that terrorists have no faith or humanity.
PPP MPA Haji Ali Madad Jatak stated that the world now knows Pakistan’s enemies have moved from attacking borders to targeting children. He said those funded by India will not be able to shake the nation’s resolve.
Haq Do Tehreek’s MPA Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman stressed that protecting citizens is a constitutional obligation, while Provincial Education Minister Raheela Hameed Durrani, who visited the injured students at CMH, said their condition was deeply distressing and hoped this would be the last such incident.
JUI’s Shahida Rauf called the attackers cowardly enemies who deliberately targeted children. The House concluded by unanimously adopting the condemnation resolution, praying for the martyrs, speedy recovery of the injured, and long-lasting peace in the province.

"PTA chief clears ‘misunderstanding’ with Aimal Wali, visits Bacha Khan Markaz",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315721-pta-chief-clears-misunderstanding-with-aimal-wali,"PESHAWAR: Chairman of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Major-General (R) Hafeezur Rehman, on Monday ended the “misunderstanding” with the Awami National Party President Aimal Wali Khan after visiting the Bacha Khan Markaz.
A statement on the Facebook account of the ANP chief stated that the PTA head visited Bacha Khan Markaz, where he was warmly received by Senator Aimal Wali Khan. Speaking on the occasion, the PTA chairman said the incident that had occurred earlier was due to a misunderstanding. “I had expressed my regrets the same day, and today I have come to Bacha Khan Markaz to clear any remaining grievances,” he said. Major-General (R) Hafeez-ur Rehman added that he held Senator Aimal Wali Khan and his family in the highest regard. Senator Aimal Wali Khan responded by saying that Bacha Khan Markaz was the home to all the oppressed and of all Pakhtuns. “Here, issues are resolved through jirgas, and following Pakhtun traditions, I accept the jirga of the PTA chairman,” he stated. It may be mentioned here that the recent tension between the PTA chairman and the ANP chief arose from an incident during a Senate committee meeting. During the meeting, the PTA
chief allegedly made a sarcastic remark. The senator deemed the remark disrespectful and unacceptable. Although the PTA chief later expressed regret over the incident, attributing it to a misunderstanding, the senator rejected the apology, stating that the matter was too serious to be resolved so easily. Subsequently, Aimal Wali Khan moved a privilege motion in the Senate against the PTA chairman, which was supported by the Leader of the House Ishaq Dar. Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani referred the matter to the Privileges Committee for further deliberation.

IHC seeks details from NHA regarding allocation of funds for Bhong Interchange,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315725-ihc-seeks-details-from-nha-regarding-allocation-of-funds-for-bhong-interchange,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday sought details from National Highway Authority (NHA) regarding issuance of funds for Bhong Interchange project on Multan-Sukkur motorway.
Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz heard the case regarding the completion of the project as per the direction of the Supreme Court. During hearing, the NHA officials assured the court that the construction work would be completed timely as per the orders. At this, the court inquired that as to what funds the NHA is proposing in the budget for the project in the next financial year. During the hearing, petitioner Raees Munir Ahmed appeared in the court along with his lawyer Waqar Rana and took the stand that the work on the project has not yet started. The contract award was made on December 6, 2023, it is now May 2025, what the NHA is doing to complete this project on time.
He prayed to the court that the NHA be asked about the time frame of this project. This project is also a flash point in the context of the security situation in Sindh and Punjab, he argued.
NHA officials told the court that the process of the land acquisition for the project is underway. The case related to the acquisition calculator is pending in court, they said. The petitioners lawyer said that there is no stay order regarding land acquisition at this time. The petitioners lawyer said that the NHA can contact the Punjab government for this process.
The NHA officials said that an application has been moved to the Land Acquisition Collector since November but there was no response yet. The lawyer for the petitioner said that the court should pass an order that the NHA should implement the Supreme Courts decision and that the NHA should be ordered to complete the work on the project expeditiously. The court adjourned the further hearing of the case until the third week of June.

"May 9 riots cases: Court allows police to conduct photogrammetric, polygraphic tests on Imran",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315726-may-9-riots-cases-court-allows-police-to-conduct-photogrammetric-polygraphic-tests-on-imran,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Monday granted police another opportunity to conduct photogrammetric and polygraphic tests on Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in connection with 12 cases related to the May 9 riots.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill approved the Lahore police request during a hearing after law enforcement officials submitted that the PTI founder had refused to undergo the tests on three separate occasions, twice in writing and once verbally.
DSP Legal Javed Asif informed the court that Imran Khan’s lack of cooperation was obstructing the progress of the investigation. He requested the court’s permission to carry out the tests once more in an effort to move the probe forward.
Opposing the request, the PTI founder’s counsel urged the court to dismiss the application. After hearing arguments from both sides, the court accepted the police plea and directed the Adiala Jail superintendent to ensure the incarcerated PTI founder is made available for testing in a designated room within the prison.
It is worth noting that the court had earlier, on May 15, authorised the police to carry out these tests and complete the process within 12 days. The cases under investigation include attacks on Jinnah House and Askari Tower, along with incidents involving the Shadman Police station and PMLN party offices.

NA body mulls over local govts powers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315728-na-body-mulls-over-local-govts-powers,"ISLAMABAD: The Standing Committee of National Assembly on Law and Justice, while discussing “The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2025” (Article 140-A), moved by MNA Jawed Hanif Khan, deliberated on the proposal to grant effective powers to local governments.
While members supported the bill’s intent in principle, the committee recommended issuing a fresh reminder through the Ministry of Law and Justice and the committee itself to urge political leaders to submit their opinions, enabling further progress on the matter. The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2025 aims to ensure a meaningful devolution of political, administrative, and financial authority, making local government institutions more viable and effective in line with the aspirations of the people of Pakistan.
The committee meeting was held on Monday at the Old PIPS Hall, Parliamentary Lodges, under the chairmanship of Mahmood Bashir Virk. During deliberations, the mover emphasized that although the 18th Amendment intended to devolve powers to the grassroots level, the absence of a functional local government system hinders the achievement of this objective.
The members agreed that while the bill’s goals were commendable, its success hinges on political will and consensus across party lines. The committee was informed that despite an earlier formal request to all parliamentary leaders for their input on the proposed amendment, no responses had been received. Consequently, the committee decided to issue a renewed call for feedback through the ministry and the committee to facilitate legislative progress.
The committee also considered several other bills. The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2024 (Articles 175-A and 215), moved by Asad Qaiser, seeks to ensure the appointment of High Court judges based on merit through a competitive examination system. The objective is to promote meritocracy and curb favouritism in judicial appointments. Additionally, the bill proposes that the term of the chief election commissioner be limited to one year. Upon completion of the term, a member of the election commission from each province  following alphabetical order  would be appointed as the next chief election commissioner.
The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2025 (Article 59), moved by Naveed Arif, aims to enhance representation of non-Muslim communities in the Senate. The Constitution (Amendment) Bill, 2024 (Articles 51 and 106), moved by Naveed Aamir, proposes increased representation for minorities in the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies.
The committee noted with concern that, despite repeated inclusion on the agenda, the movers of these minority-related bills consistently failed to attend the meetings. Accordingly, the committee unanimously recommended that these bills should not be passed by the assembly. The committee also took up “The Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024” (Section 54-A), moved by Sofia Saeed Shah. However, discussion was deferred due to the mover’s illness.
During deliberations, it was also recalled that the Ministry of Law and Justice had previously committed itself to sharing a draft of related amendments to the Land Revenue Act. The ministry cited a short notice as the reason for the delay but assured the committee that the draft would be provided before the next meeting.
In conclusion, the committee condemned recent terrorist attacks in Balochistan, particularly the tragic school bus incident, and expressed sorrow over the loss of innocent lives. The committee extended condolences to the bereaved families.

Sharjeel sees foreign involvement in Moro violence,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315662-sharjeel-sees-foreign-involvement-in-moro-violence,"Sindh Senior Minister for Information and Transport Sharjeel Inam Memon on Monday said that proxies have been activated in recent days as part of conspiracies against Pakistan.
Addressing a media briefing in Karachi, he said police personnel were subjected to violence in a recent protest, in which some individuals were seen carrying explosive materials on their backs. Using these incendiary substances, they set an oil tanker on fire and also torched the residence of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, he explained, adding that the material was so inflammable that even the walls of the house caught fire.
He said there were videos showing individuals calling for reaching Lanjar’s House. Among them were people who were speaking neither Sindhi nor Saraiki, but another language, Memon said, adding that the protesters were armed with modern weapons, giving the impression that they were not locals, but foreigners.
The information minister showed the media footage of the interior minister’s house being set on fire, and stated that such a blaze could not have occurred without the use of flammable chemicals.
He added that when the protesters opened fire, two participants in the procession were injured. Chaos erupted at the hospital and police personnel were also subjected to violence, he said.
Memon said police requested the protesters to hand over the bodies of the deceased to their families, but the protesters refused and instead spread false claims on social media, alleging that police had taken the bodies.
Despite repeated appeals from the police to collect the bodies, they continued to refuse, the information minister claimed. Even leaders of nationalist parties urged them to proceed with the burials, but they did not comply, he added.
The information minister said the violent elements also approached nationalist leader Dr Niaz Kalani to gain his support, but Dr Kalani refused to side with them because of their violent ways.
Memon said a false narrative was being spread on social media, claiming that the government was refusing to hand over the bodies. When a delegation of lawyers visited the protesters, they were told that the bodies would not be buried, even if it took a month, until their demands were met.
The protesters began blackmailing the government, insisting that they would not proceed with the burials unless the IG and DIG were removed and their other demands were accepted. A delegation of religious scholars also attempted to intervene, but the protesters still refused to bury the bodies, Memon maintained.
Later, the same protesters approached the court, falsely alleging that the police had hidden the bodies. After completing all legal procedures, the court ruled that if the legal heirs refused to claim the bodies, the Naushahro Feroze SSP was authorised to arrange the burials through a social welfare organisation.
He said that following the court orders, the body was kept for 10 to 12 hours. After the post-mortem, the medico-legal officer recommended that the body be buried without delay, upon which the burial was carried out through social arrangements.
The entire incident received significant attention in India, where the media prominently reported that the Sindh home minister’s house had been set on fire, Memon said. He remarked that the Pakistan Peoples Party was a political party that respected all other political parties, despite past differences. However, he said, the group involved in such violent actions was not a political party and it was misleading the youth, arming them, and using them for its own agenda.
Commenting on a call for protest by Shafi Burfat, the leader of a banned organization, the information minister said if Burfat was sincere with his people, he should return to Pakistan. The government would not tolerate any attempts to mislead the country’s youth or to incite chaos and violence, he said urging the young people to remain cautious of such elements that wanted to lead them astray.
In response to a question, Memon said one leader of the protesters even claimed that the government had burned the house of its own minister. He asked why then there was an outcry over arrests because if the claim was true, the people being arrested must also be the government’s own.
He added that violating someone’s Chadar aur Chaar Deewari (privacy and sanctity of the home) was not part of Sindh’s traditions. He said the purpose of the Moro violence was to attract international attention. He emphasised that the people of Sindh were inherently peaceful and followers of Shah Bhittai and Sachal Sarmast.
In response to another question, he said that one leader of the protesters was residing in European countries and misusing his influence to manipulate the minds of innocent youth. He emphasised that problems were solved through dialogue, not violent actions.
He said Dr Qadir Magsi was an experienced politician who had likely called a protest due to social media reports claiming the police were withholding the bodies. He urged Dr Magsi to reconsider his protest call and withdraw it.

Civil society activists hail appointment of Prof Noman Ahmed as acting NED VC,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315664-civil-society-activists-hail-appointment-of-prof-noman-ahmed-as-acting-ned-vc,"Civil society activists and human rights advocates from across Karachi gathered at a hotel on Saturday to honour Prof Dr Noman Ahmed on his recent appointment as the acting vice chancellor of the NED University of Engineering and Technology.
The reception, hosted by The Knowledge Forum, brought together prominent activists, academics and community leaders who paid glowing tribute to Dr Ahmed for his contributions to urban development and his longstanding support for civil society.
Speakers at the event underscored the urgent need for collective and sustained action to tackle Karachi’s deteriorating civic conditions and the growing climate crisis. “NED is a prestigious university that has played a pivotal role in shaping Karachi’s development—both through the technical expertise of its faculty and by creating opportunities for research and dialogue,” said a speaker. “It is critically important that such an institution is led by someone who not only understands the city’s complex realities, such as climate change and exclusionary development, but is also committed to action.”
The speaker added that with Prof Dr Ahmed, the NED University had a leadership that was deeply committed, nuanced and capable of nudging institutions towards a more pro-rights, pro-community and pro-environment direction.
Veteran human rights activist Anis Haroon, also a member from Sindh of the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), painted a grim picture of the city’s current state, citing prolonged power outages, skyrocketing inflation and worsening living standards.
“People who once ate a full loaf of bread now eat only a half. No city can prosper when its citizens are deprived of basic necessities,” she warned, adding that such economic strain could lead to further violence and instability.
Uzma Noorani, member of the Women’s Action Forum, reflected on the civil society’s legacy in Karachi, citing milestones such as the People's Resistance movement during the lawyers’ movement in 2007 and the Sahil Bachao Tehreek, which successfully challenged environmentally destructive development projects.
Amber Alibhai of the Shehri-CBE emphasised the importance of utilising technology and data to address urban challenges. “Civil society has built a robust body of data on Karachi’s issues over the past two decades. This is our strength. We must use this data to hold institutions accountable and push for citizen-centred reforms,” she said, criticising the government’s efforts to convert public parks into commercial spaces through public-private partnerships and limit public access to open spaces.
Environmental journalist Zofeen Ebrahim echoed the need for evidence-based approaches, noting that ""Karachi's problems must be understood systematically — not dealt with haphazardly.""
Kazi Khizar, vice chairperson of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, presented alarming statistics from Sindh’s education sector. He revealed that of 49,300 schools, 7,000 were without shelter, 18,000 operated in single rooms, and 10,000 had only two rooms.
Dr Raza Gardezi called out the fragmentation within the non-profit sector and urged the NGOs to unite and revisit their collective agenda. Yasir Hussain of the Climate Action Centre raised concerns over climate change impacts, particularly sea intrusion threatening agricultural land. He emphasised the need for monitoring the Climate Action Plan, particularly the design of its projects and how resources were allocated.
In his response, Dr Ahmed expressed gratitude to pioneering urban planners, including Dr Akhtar Hameed Khan, Arif Hasan, Tasneem Siddiqui and Perween Rehman. He emphasised the need for a permanent civil society platform beyond issue-specific initiatives to facilitate dialogue and catalyse civil society action on the city’s development challenges.
He recalled multiple initiatives by the civil society in the past, including collectives on the Lyari Expressway and others that facilitated the community’s voice in development plans. “It is important that civil society works in a coherent, long-term way so that it can use the capacities built over time for effective intervention in the city’s development.”
Pointing to the need for youth involvement in civil society’s work on the city’s development challenges, he stressed the need for civil society to broaden its approach towards youth and devise an engagement strategy for students.
“Students from not only social sciences department, but those from information technology also have meaningful solutions to contribute to the city’s challenges. Karachi’s civil society must think of ways to use their creative expressions and technical skills which are most certainly beneficial for civil society’s advocacy and resistance for the city development.”
The gathering highlighted both the challenges facing Karachi and the potential for unified civil society action to address the metropolitan area's complex urban problems through data-driven research, community and youth mobilisation.

Aseefa Bhutto underscores Pakistan’s commitment to deepen ties with Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315665-aseefa-bhutto-underscores-pakistan-s-commitment-to-deepen-ties-with-iran,"The first lady of Pakistan, Aseefa Bhutto Zardari, on Monday met a high-level Iranian delegation at the Bilawal House, underscoring the continued commitment of Pakistan and the Islamic Republic of Iran to deepening bilateral relations and regional cooperation.
The delegation was led by Dr. Reyhaneh Sadat Raeisi, the daughter of the late Iranian president Shaheed Ebrahim Raisi. She was accompanied by senior Iranian officials, including Dr. Vahed Asghari, chargé d’affaires at the Consulate General of Iran, Dr Saeid Talebi Nia, director general and cultural attaché at Khanae Farhang Iran, Karachi; Ms. Sedigheh, Dr. Parisa Safamanesh, and Mr. Mohammad Ismail, interpreter.
Senator Saleem Mandviwalla and Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho were also present at the meeting. During the meeting, both sides discussed avenues for enhancing cooperation, particularly in the fields of health care, culture, and mutual diplomatic support. The first lady highlighted the strong historical and cultural ties that bind the two nations, expressing appreciation for Iran’s steadfast solidarity with Pakistan.
“We value Iran’s unwavering support throughout the years. Our countries share a brotherly bond based on mutual respect, cultural affinity, and shared aspirations,” said Aseefa Bhutto Zardari. She also commended Iran’s advancements in health care, referencing consistent praise from Health Minister Dr. Azra Pechuho following her visits to Iranian medical institutions.
Dr Raeisi conveyed gratitude on behalf of the Iranian leadership for Pakistan’s continued friendship and support. She extended a message of thanks to President Asif Ali Zardari for the condolences and solidarity shown following the tragic death of her father, President Raisi. In a moment of shared remembrance and reverence, special prayers and Fateha were offered not only for Shaheed President Ebrahim Raisi, but also for Shaheed Benazir Bhutto. The gathering reflected on their legacies of leadership, courage, and service to their people.
The first lady recalled the late President Raisi’s historic visit to Pakistan: “When your father visited Pakistan, the warmth and love shown by the people reflected the deep respect he commanded. Shaheeds never die; they continue to live in our hearts.” The meeting concluded with a reaffirmation of both countries’ commitment to strengthening bilateral relations and working together for regional peace, stability, and development.

SIU arrests two suspects for killing citizen in Orangi mugging bid last year,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315666-siu-arrests-two-suspects-for-killing-citizen-in-orangi-mugging-bid-last-year,"The Special Investigation Unit of the Karachi police on Monday claimed to have arrested two men allegedly involved in the killing of a citizen during a mugging bid in Orangi Town last year.
According to the SIU spokesperson, acting on directives from SIU SSP Shoaib Memon, a special police team was formed to curb the menace of growing incidents of armed robberies and street crime. The team arrested two suspects, namely Shoaib and Kashif, during a raid conducted in the Khyber Chowk area of the SITE locality.

"Two robbers killed by police, citizen in separate incidents",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315667-two-robbers-killed-by-police-citizen-in-separate-incidents,"In separate incidents on Monday, two suspected robbers were killed — one by a citizen during a robbery attempt, and another in a police encounter. According to the Ferozabad police, a robber was shot dead by a citizen after a mugging incident near the Naheed Supermarket on Shaheed-e-Millat Road.
Following the incident, police and rescuers reached the scene. The body was shifted to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) and later moved to a morgue for want of identification. Police said the incident took place when three robbers had robbed some citizens outside the store and were attempting to flee on a motorcycle when a car driver, identified as Anas, pursued them and shot them from behind at a short distance.
The gunfire struck the robber sitting on the rear seat of the motorcycle, killing him on the spot. The deceased suspect was identified as 27-year-old Irfan. Police said they were looking for his fleeing companions.
In another incident, an exchange of fire took place between police and robbers near the Shershah Bridge within the limits of the Site B Section police station. Police intercepted two robbers. One of them was identified as Bilal, son of Noor Islam, who was shot dead during the encounter. The other suspect, Arshad, was arrested. Police recovered a pistol, live rounds and a motorcycle from the suspects’ possession. The body of the killed suspect was shifted to a hospital.

SHC maintains life imprisonment of convict in sexual assault case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315668-shc-maintains-life-imprisonment-of-convict-in-sexual-assault-case,"The Sindh High Court on Monday dismissed the appeal of a man against his conviction in a juvenile sexual assault case.
The appellant, Umar Farooq, was sentenced to life imprisonment sentence for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in Baldia Town. According to the prosecution, the complainant alleged that his nieces were residing with his sister’s house for about three years and one of the juvenile girls was sexually assaulted by his brother-in-law.
A counsel for the appellant submitted that the prosecution failed to produce direct or circumstantial evidence connecting the appellant with the commission of the offence as there was unexplained delay of 68 days in the registration of the FIR casting serious doubts on the veracity of the complaint.
The counsel submitted that the medical and DNA evidence was inconclusive and failed to corroborate the charge while the victim's medical report showed no evidence of physical trauma or injury consistent with repeated rape.
He said that no eyewitness supported the prosecution’s narrative, and there were improvements and contradictions in the victim’s statements under the sections 161 and 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
An additional prosecutor general and the complainant’s counsel submitted that the appellant was specifically nominated in the FIR as well as mentioned in the statements of the victim recorded under the sections 161 and 164 of the CrPC.
They said the victim consistently implicated the appellant during her examination before the trial court and expressly denied the suggestion of no sexual assault during cross-examination. They maintained that the victim’s version was credible, coherent and worthy of reliance, further corroborated by the medico-legal officer’s opinion indicating that the victim was subjected to sexual intercourse.
A single bench of the high court comprising Justice Khalid Hussain Shahani after hearing the arguments of the counsel observed that the victim’s use of the colloquial term badtamizi (misconduct) — in her Section 164 statement, rather than legally precise terminology such as rape or assault, was neither exculpatory nor indicative of fabrication.
The SHC observed that the victim’s explicit elaboration of the sexual assault during her courtroom testimony dispelled any ambiguity, rendering the appellant’s semantic critique a pedantic distraction.
The high court observed that the victim’s delayed disclosure, predicated on the appellant’s continuous threats of lethal retaliation against her sibling, constituted a compelling and legally cognisable justification under the doctrine of coercive control, a paradigm recognised in modern jurisprudence to account for the psychological dynamics of abuse.
The SHC observed that the trial court’s verdict was grounded in a holistic appraisal of testimonial, medical and circumstantial evidence, and adhered to the golden thread of justice enshrined in the Article 10-A of the Constitution (right to a fair trial) and Article 35 (protection of children).
The bench observed that the imposition of rigorous life imprisonment under the Section 376(3) of the Pakistan Penal Code, coupled with a fine and the benefit of the Section 382-B of the CrPC (sentence adjustment for pre-trial detention) reflected a calibrated balance between retribution, deterrence and societal condemnation of custodial sexual violence.
The SHC observed that the trial court had meticulously appreciated the evidence on record, properly applied the settled principles of law, and reached a just and well-reasoned conclusion. The SHC observed that the appellant’s failed to point out any material irregularity, misreading or non-reading of evidence warranting interference.
The high court observed that cumulative effect of the prosecution evidence established the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. The SHC dismissed the appeal and maintained the appellant’s conviction.

IGP assures goods transporters of better safety steps on highways,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315669-igp-assures-goods-transporters-of-better-safety-steps-on-highways,"Sindh Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon chaired a high-level meeting on Monday with representatives of various goods transport associations at the Central Police Office (CPO).
The meeting was attended by Additional IG Karachi Javed Alam Odho, along with DIGs from the Sindh Police Highway Patrol, Establishment, Headquarters, Divisional, and Karachi Ranges. Representatives from major transport associations also participated, including President of the Karachi Goods Association Malik Sher Khan, Malik Transporter K Shahzad Awan, Yasin Khan Niazi from the United Goods Transport Association, Imdad Naqvi of the Karachi Goods Carrier Association, Malik Shabbar, Ghulam Muhammad Afridi, Nizar Jafri of Pakistan Goods, and Rana Asim Shakoor of the Fleet Operator Association of Pakistan.
During the meeting, the DIG Sindh police highway patrol provided a briefing on police deployment and security measures along major highways. He said the Sindh government had established a dedicated unit—the Sindh Police Highway Patrol—for highway security. As part of this initiative, 88 police baton units and 90 vehicles had been deployed across 42 toll plazas and 13 key highways in Sindh. The patrol unit operated around the clock. A centralised control center and a universal helpline number were also set to be launched soon. Transport representatives expressed gratitude to the police for their cooperation during recent protests, road blockades, and demonstrations. They noted that miscreants often target goods vehicles during such events and urged the authorities to discourage the practice of road blockages.
The transporters also proposed connecting security cameras installed at petrol pumps and nearby buildings to a central control room for enhanced surveillance. Furthermore, they recommended establishing a joint helpline through cooperation between the police and relevant agencies.
Memon assured participants that orders had already been issued to district officers and DIGs to register cases against those involved in road blockages. He encouraged transporters to install surveillance cameras in their vehicles to assist in identifying attackers. Memon also instructed all district officers to increase police presence on highways and maintain open communication with transporters during emergencies.

DIG Security and Emergency Services Division Dr Maqsood Ahmed attended the event as the chief guest. In his address, he underscored the growing need for such awareness programs in today’s security climate. He noted that HEAT and self-defence training were crucial not only for law enforcement agencies but also for civilians—particularly students—enabling them to respond confidently and effectively during emergencies.
Dr Ahmed praised the students' enthusiastic participation and reaffirmed the Security and Emergency Services Division’s dedication to public safety through professional training and community outreach. The event was organised through the efforts of Dr Sahar Afshan, Senior Assistant Professor and Head of the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, Dr Sumra Ashfaq, and Dr Sidra Ahmed, assistant professors at Bahria University, who played a pivotal role in coordinating the session and ensuring its smooth execution. The event concluded with an exchange of souvenirs between Dr Ahmed and senior officials of Bahria University.

He stated strict measures, including fines, license suspensions, and cancellation of route permits, will be taken against transporters who overcharge passengers.

India’s false allegations against Pakistan a violation of int’l laws: PA Speaker,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315621-india-s-false-allegations-against-pakistan-a-violation-of-int-l-laws-pa-speaker,"LAHORE:Speaker of the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan while addressing a ceremony at a local hotel stated that the false allegations of terrorism leveled by India against Pakistan are a blatant violation of international laws.
India targeted civilian populations in Pakistan without any evidence; despite this, the world acknowledged Pakistan's military capability and diplomatic foresight. Expressing his firm belief in democracy, PA Speaker said that he is a part of the democratic process and has faced both success and failure in this journey.
He further said that the Pakistan armed forces and public achieved exemplary success in this brief war and they deserve greetings for it. PA Speaker said war is not a solution to any issue, but India's Hindutva-driven ideology has become a threat to the peace of the entire region.
Pakistan is not willing to accept anyone’s hegemony in the region and has always promoted peace. The Speaker rejected the Indian PM's accusations regarding the Pahalgam incident, stating that Pakistan has sacrificed more than 80,000 precious lives in the war against terrorism, yet no one tells the world who the killers are.
Referring to the Indus Waters Treaty, Malik Ahmad Khan said that India's threats to cut off water supplies are unserious. This treaty has remained intact despite wars between Pakistan and India and is internationally recognised.
It cannot be suspended unilaterally. The Speaker said that the freedom of expression is the soul of democracy; however, this freedom should not be used against national security and the integrity of the country.
Only by strengthening the Parliament and elected representatives can the system be fortified. He emphasised that he strongly opposed restrictions on journalists and called for open debate on the matter.
He remarked that during the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, he critically observed Indian media. Pakistani journalists performed exceptionally well under challenging circumstances, whereas Indian journalists, in their pursuit of sensationalism, destroyed the essence of journalism. Pakistani journalists displayed great composure and wisdom during this war.
He said no political party should be allowed to gain popularity by criticising the armed forces.

He highlighted that advanced diagnostic and treatment technologies, such as PET-CT, Linear Accelerators, and CyberKnife, are available at several flagship PAEC hospitals. He expressed gratitude to the IAEA for the opportunity to host this regional training course. With reference to PAEC’s contributions to Pakistan’s cancer health sector, he also mentioned that PAEC is producing radioisotopes at PINSTECH, Islamabad which are used for cancer diagnosis and treatment.
He also thanked the international participants for visiting Pakistan and expressed hope that the knowledge gained would be shared in their respective countries. He said that the participants would serve as ambassadors of goodwill, carrying back memories and experiences of their stay in Pakistan.
Dr Arzoo Fatima Saleem, co-director of the course, introduced the contents and learning objectives of the RTC. Course Director, Dr Irfan Ullah Khan, presented details of Project RAS 6105 and explained the rationale behind this IAEA initiative. He shared that out of the four RTCs to be organised under this project, the second is currently in progress. He also elaborated significant developments in expert mission visits and participation in TC-sponsored international symposia.
Dr Amira Shami, Director INMOL, welcomed the participants and expressed pride in hosting the training course under the IAEA umbrella. She said, ‘We are proud to be a partner in this collaboration with IAEA.’ Dr Amira emphasised that INMOL has been a pioneer in PET and Theranostics not only in Pakistan but also in the region. She appreciated the IAEA's valuable role in promoting regional collaboration, particularly through its Technical Cooperation Programme, which has greatly contributed to INMOL's growth. She emphasised the accomplishments of the Atomic Energy Cancer Hospital (AECH) INMOL and the 19 cancer care hospitals operated by PAEC across Pakistan.

In his address, Prof Dr M Ali said that farmers in Pakistan were growing grains by investing a lot of capital, but they were sold at a low price in the market. ‘If this situation remains and the problems of farmers are not solved, then wheat will also have to be imported in the future,’ he cautioned, adding that farmers do the work of production, which Allah loves, and we should respect them and provide them with facilities.
He said that agriculture is an important sector along with industrialisation, artificial intelligence, data science and technology while more profits can be earned by promoting corporate farming. He said that honey is the best food which also cures many diseases. He said that due to lack of facilities in villages, cities are expanding and agricultural land is shrinking.
He said that it is necessary to provide awareness for kitchen gardening so that natural products can be promoted. He congratulated the organisers on the successful workshop. He said that students will get an opportunity to learn from the experiences of farmers, researchers, experts and teachers participating in this workshop. Asif Bilal Lodhi said that the government was playing its role in solving the problems faced by universities and farmers and providing legal support. He said that Pakistan is a talented and resource-rich country, for its development and progress everyone has to work together.
Socrat Aman Rana said that steps are being taken to promote industries in the country according to the vision of the PM. He said that they are also providing facilities to increase the production capacity of honey. He said that they are trying to provide modern facilities to farmers and promote entrepreneurship.

Crime control challenges highlighted,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315631-crime-control-challenges-highlighted,"LAHORE:SP Aftab Ahmad Phularwan, the Regional Officer of the newly-established Crime Control Department (CCD) in Lahore, Monday revealed that victims of crimes against honour, such as those occurring during dacoities or robberies, rarely file First Information Reports (FIRs) against the accused.
Addressing a session titled Guarding Society Against Crimes, organised by the National Vision Think Tank (NVTT), the SP said this lack of reporting undermines deterrence against such heinous crimes. ""Almost 100 percent of families who suffer horrific crimes against honour during dacoity, robbery, or similar incidents do not file complaints for FIR registration, which emboldens perpetrators."" The session was attended by NVTT members, including M Ahsan, M Mansoor, Bilal Butt, M Ashraf, Hamza Naveed, M Amer, Nadeem Chaudhry, Ishaq Gujjar, Jamshed Khan, and Muhammad Noman.
The SP highlighted that fraud cases, particularly those involving amounts below Rs 600 million, which fall outside the jurisdiction of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), often see perpetrators released on bail the next day.

Scholarship initiative for coastal communities,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315640-scholarship-initiative-for-coastal-communities,"Islamabad:Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced the launch of Maritime Educational Endowment Fund (MEEF) to provide scholarships to deserving and talented children of coastal communities.
In a statement here, the Minister stated that the MEEF aims at promoting inclusive development by enabling access to quality education for youth from over 70 coastal and fishing communities, particularly in the provinces of Sindh and Balochistan. This initiative will help cultivate a skilled maritime workforce essential for the country’s future, he noted.
He said the creation of the fund is based on recommendations of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Maritime Affairs, reflecting the government’s broader commitment to education-driven empowerment in coastal regions.
The Maritime said that by investing in coastal youth today, we are laying the foundation for a resilient and prosperous maritime sector tomorrow. To finance the MEEF, the Ministry will restructure Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) contributions from organisations operating under its jurisdiction. This redirection of CSR resources aims to create a centralised and sustainable funding mechanism to support long-term educational opportunities.
The Minister also announced the formation of a dedicated oversight committee, responsible for ensuring transparency, equitable scholarship distribution and strong monitoring and evaluation frameworks.
In its initial phase, the MEEF will target students of coastal regions, with plans to expand nationally, enabling more students across the country to benefit from the initiative The MEEF is more than just a scholarship programme. Rather, it is a strategic investment in the future of Pakistan’s maritime sector, he said, symbolising our enduring commitment to ensuring that no capable student is left behind due to economic hardship.

SDPI calls for 33pc women's quota in political party decision-making bodies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315641-sdpi-calls-for-33pc-women-s-quota-in-political-party-decision-making-bodies,"Islamabad:Experts on Monday demanded that all the political parties of the country should ensure 33 per cent women’s quota in political party’s decision making bodies along with increase in political participation of the women under the Constitutional Amendment of Election Act 2017.
The Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) hosted a seminar today titled ""Why We Need Women's Representation in Political Parties at all Levels,"" bringing together election experts and policymakers to address the critical issue of women's underrepresentation in Pakistan's political party structure in line with the SDPI's discussion paper ""Raising Her Voice in Political Parties.""
Former Secretary of the Election Commission of Pakistan, Kanwar Muhammad Dilshad, focused on constitutional and legislative reforms necessary to bridge the gender gap in political representation, stating, ""The current 5% quota for women candidates on general seats is weakly enforced across parties, with no penalties for non-compliance. Parties often place women in unwinnable constituencies, undermining the intent of the quota.""
Zafarullah Khan, Former Executive Director of the Pakistan Institute for Parliamentary Services (PIPS), stated, ""Women's wings focus on social issues but have minimal say in decision-making. Even when women hold leadership roles, their influence remains limited."" Khan's research demonstrated that among the 16 political parties represented in Parliament, very few have reserved quotas for women in their apex decision-making forums. Progressive parties like Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan People's Party-Parliamentarian, while have women's wings, provide limited information about women's representation in central decision-making bodies.
Shabir Ahmed from the International Foundation for Electoral Systems warned that ""democracy can bend or break,"" emphasizing that ""without internal democratic practices that genuinely include women, quotas become mere numerical exercises.""
Dr. Alia Amir from QAU's Centre of Excellence for Gender Studies called for ‘systematic capacity development of political parties’ and ‘targeted programs for women's inclusion from grassroots to leadership.’
Speaking at the event, Deputy Executive Director SDPI Qasim Shah emphasized ""While women constitute nearly 49% of Pakistan's population, they hold merely 20% of legislative seats and 9.4% of ministerial positions. We are calling for immediate amendments to Sections 207 and 208 of the Election Act 2017 to establish a mandatory 33% quota for women in all political party decision-making bodies.""
He further emphasised the need to reform party enlisting requirements, noting that ""the current requirement of minimum 2,000 members for party enlistment with the Election Commission should be amended to include a mandatory 33% women membership requirement, reflecting their proportionate share in Pakistan's population.""
The event, attended by representatives from several organisations including CPDI, FES, QAU and ECP, concluded with calls for immediate legislative action to ensure women's meaningful political participation.

CDA conducts operation against illegal constructions in housing societies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315642-cda-conducts-operation-against-illegal-constructions-in-housing-societies,"Islamabad:The Capital Development Authority (CDA), with the support of the Islamabad administration and Islamabad Police, conducted a massive operation against illegal constructions and buildings in housing societies within the limits of Islamabad. About 30 units and shops were sealed during the first phase of the sealing operation in Pak PWD Employees Cooperative Housing Society, Lohi Bher Zone-V, Islamabad.
The operation is considered just the tip of the iceberg, as the housing society had encroached upon playgrounds and parks over the last two decades, converting them into commercial areas with multi-storey shopping plazas in glaring violation of the layout plan.
Following the directions of the Minister of Interior, Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi, and the Chairman CDA and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, the CDA has launched a strict campaign against illegal and unauthorized societies and buildings within the limits of the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), according to a CDA spokesman.
During the operation, various sites in Pak PWD Employees Cooperative Housing Society, Lohi Bher Zone-V, Islamabad, were targeted. The first phase of the operation was conducted in accordance with the provisions of the CDA Ordinance, 1960, and the Building Control Regulations, 2020 (as amended in 2023).
The sealed buildings were found to be in violation due to non-approval of building plans, unauthorized commercial use, and illegal occupancy without completion certificates, as well as non-payment of applicable penalties and fees. The joint enforcement operation aimed to ensure regulatory compliance and uphold the sanctity of Islamabad's building regulations.
All units sealed were found non-compliant despite prior notices. Further legal action will be initiated against repeated violators, as per CDA bylaws. All stakeholders are advised to obtain proper approvals and certificates from the concerned wing of the CDA before initiating any illegal construction or occupancy within the limits of the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).

Experts stress long-term economic planning over annual budget fixation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315643-experts-stress-long-term-economic-planning-over-annual-budget-fixation,"Islamabad: Economic policy and academic experts in a seminar on Monday urged the government to closely align provisions of the upcoming federal budget with the long-term objectives set out in the five-year Uraan Pakistan plan and said the budget should reflect well-considered strategies that ensure inclusive and equitable economic development.
They also emphasised that political stability was essential not only for sustainable economic growth but also for building investor confidence and striving for structural reforms. The experts said in light of the Indo-Pak tensions, it was equally critical that budgetary priorities incorporate related measures such as addressing water management challenges, particularly the Indus Waters Treaty issue.
The seminar, titled Federal Budget 2025-26: Strategic Priorities under Uraan Pakistan and the Shadow of Pakistan-India Tensions, was organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) here.
IPS chairman Khalid Rahman said the challenge facing the country was not merely economic but rooted in political economy issues and the lack of stability in policy formulation. He underscored the importance of policy continuity across successive governments to foster a stable and trustworthy business environment.
""Recent improvements in economic indicators are commendable. However, short-term economic growth must be translated into long-term development to genuinely address the needs of the broader population,"" he said. Mr Rahman also highlighted the vital role of the private social sector in contributing to the country’s economic and social well-being.
The other speakers, included former federal finance secretary Dr Waqar Masood Khan, former principal economic adviser to the federal government Sakib Sherani and former joint chief economist Zafarul Hassan Almas, noted that Pakistan was engaged in an IMF programme, the fourteenth since 1988. They said while each arrangement had provided temporary economic stability, translating the short-term relief into sustainable, long-term growth was the fundamental challenge. The warned that without comprehensive structural reforms, the country would remain trapped in the recurring cycle.
The experts said excessive focus on annual budgets undermined strategic economic planning. Crafting a budget without a five- to 10-year vision fails to provide a coherent roadmap for development. In the current geopolitical context, particularly heightened tensions with India, the budget will likely be skewed toward immediate needs rather than long-term priorities, according to them.
While acknowledging recent improvements in the economic outlook, such as lower inflation, a stable balance of payments, a stronger currency, and a rebound in the stock market, the experts warned that those positive indicators stemmed largely from ad hoc measures rather than structural policy shifts.
They said key reforms, including pension system overhauls, must be comprehensive, inclusive and institutionalised. The experts said economic stability, rather than high growth, was the immediate priority.
They, however, said a 4–5% growth rate remained achievable and desirable, even within the constraints of the ongoing IMF program. To reach this goal, the government must significantly enhance export performance by offering targeted incentives and creating a more business-friendly regulatory environment, according to them.
The experts acknowledged Uraan Pakistan as a remarkable strategic initiative on paper but noted that it has yet to show meaningful implementation or visibility in government actions or on the ground. The upcoming budget offers a crucial opportunity to operationalize the plan’s vision. The experts concluded that positioning budgetary decisions with the strategic direction of Uraan Pakistan is essential to boost the export-to-GDP ratio, strengthen the IT sector, promote environmental sustainability and climate resilience, and support a transition to greener energy.

Pakistan and ADB discuss strategic collaboration for climate resilience,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315644-pakistan-and-adb-discuss-strategic-collaboration-for-climate-resilience,"Islamabad:Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Dr. Musadik Malik, held a high-level meeting today with Bruno Carrasco, Director General of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and his delegation to discuss Pakistan’s climate resilience and environmental sustainability agenda.
During the meeting, both parties emphasised the importance of a comprehensive and forward-looking approach to tackle the pressing challenges of climate change. They agreed to jointly develop a country strategy and climate policy framework aimed at enhancing environmental resilience and climate adaptability in Pakistan.
A key focus of the discussion was to empower youth-led climate initiatives by providing necessary support in terms of incubation, mentorship, and funding. Both sides recognised the potential of such initiatives to not only contribute meaningfully to climate solutions but also position themselves competitively on the global innovation landscape.
The meeting also explored avenues for joint ventures in climate financing and investments, with the goal of mobilising substantial resources towards sustainable development. Minister Malik stressed the need to transition from planning to implementation, assuring ADB of his full cooperation and commitment throughout all stages to ensure that agreed outcomes are achieved effectively.
The potential for partnerships in carbon credit markets was also deliberated, with both sides agreeing to explore viable mechanisms for monetising environmental performance and emissions reductions.
Moreover, discussions were held on launching collaborative knowledge projects, policy-based climate loans, and capacity-building workshops aimed at increasing institutional effectiveness and public awareness regarding climate issues.

Chitral elders want Kalash Development Authority abolished,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315697-chitral-elders-want-kalash-development-authority-abolished,"CHITRAL: The elders of Kalash and Muslim communities in Bamburet, Rambur and Birir on Monday asked the government to abolish the Kalash Development Authority (KDA) for its failure to carry out a single uplift project in the three valleys.
Speaking at a press conference at the Chitral Press Club, the elders, including Saifullah Kalash, Noor Shah Ali, Sarawat Shah, Malik Shahi, ex-nazim Khurshid Ahmad, Dordan Khan advocate, Muhammad Rafi and others said that people of Kalash and Muslim communities were living in extremely deplorable condition in the three valleys.
They said that the KDA had imposed various taxes but was doing nothing for the welfare of the people. The elders said that it was an injustice to the local poor people to collect taxes from them on one pretext or the other, but provide them no facilities.
To a question, they said that the authority had not carried out a single developmental project in the valleys in the past three years. They added that it was now going to impose more taxes and fines.“It has already collected hundreds of thousands of rupees in taxes from tourists, but there is no transparency regarding how or where that money was spent,” an elder complained.

Nepra issues licenses to Hazesco for power distribution,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315699-nepra-issues-licenses-to-hazesco-for-power-distribution,"MANSEHRA: The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has issued licenses to the Hazara Electricity Supply Company (Hazesco) to purchase, transmit, and distribute electricity to consumers within its jurisdiction.
“We welcome the license issuance by Nepra, even though it came after a delay of nearly two and a half years. However, key issues like electricity quota allocation, the establishment of operational divisions and sub-divisions and appointment of operational staff remain unresolved,” said Jamil Tanoli, Chairman of the WAPDA Hydro Electric Union, told reporters on Monday.
He said the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) had notified the creation of Hazesco on January 18, 2023, following approval by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.Later that year, in October, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan issued a certificate of incorporation for Hazesco under the Companies Act, 2017, registering it as a limited company.
“Nepra has now issued two separate licenses, one for power procurement (generation) and the other for transmission and distribution to consumers,” Tanoli said.He added that Nepra had yet to determine the power quota for Hazesco.
“We required over 1,000 megawatt quota, but only 600 megawatt has been allocated so far, resulting in a shortfall that has been causing widespread power outages across the Hazara division,” he said.
Tanoli also emphasised the need for administrative structuring. “Mansehra should be declared a power division, and Battagram, along with the three districts of Kohistan, should be made subdivisions under Hazesco,” he said.
He said that although the company was now going to be fully functional, Nepra has approved only 110 executive positions so far, while approximately 5,000 technical and clerical posts remain to be sanctioned.
Tanoli urged the federal government to notify the executive board of Hazesco for the Hazara division and resolve pending issues immediately so that it could take off without any further delay.
He appealed to Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Mohammad Yusuf, former deputy speaker of the National Assembly Murtaza Javed Abbasi, and the former MNA retired Captain Mohammad Safdar Awan, the son-in-law of PMLN chief Nawaz Sharif, to take up these concerns with Premier Shehbaz Sharif, as they had done in the past.

End of an era: Tourism icon Zahoor Durrani passes away,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315700-end-of-an-era-tourism-icon-zahoor-durrani-passes-away,"PESHAWAR: Zahoor Ahmad Durrani, an icon of the tourism industry and a prominent figure on Peshawar’s social scene, passed away after a brief illness and was laid to rest on Monday.
He was 81.
Durrani sahib had been dividing his time between Peshawar and Lahore in recent years. After suffering a heart attack two weeks earlier in Lahore, he spent time in the Intensive Care Unit before peacefully departing this world. He was laid to rest in Lahore today.
Born in Peshawar in 1944, he attended Edwardes College in the 1960s, where he was groomed under the guidance of Phil and Belle Edmond, who played a formative role in shaping his outlook. He obtained a master’s degree from the University of Peshawar.
In 1970, he joined the family tourism business, Sehrai Travels and Tours, established by his maternal uncle, the legendary. Abdul Qadir Sehrai, a prominent personality in Pakistan’s tourism industry post-independence.
Durrani sahib was known for his pioneering work in promoting travel and tourism with devotion, warmth, and a welcoming smile that won over everyone who met him.
In 1971, he embarked on a transformative road journey to the UK, travelling through Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, and Europe. This travel exposure to the wider world deepened his appreciation for cultural and historical tourism. His early career included a stint with the renowned tour operator Thomas Cook in London, which laid the foundation for his expertise in the field.
“Durrani sahib will be remembered not just for his professional achievements, such as promotion of rail heritage tours and revival of the legendary Khyber Steam Railway Safari, but more so for his personal qualities, his refinement, “shaistegee”, courtesy, warmth, and genuine affection for people from all walks of life. Those who knew him speak of his simple lifestyle, unwavering graciousness, his jovial nature, and a generosity of spirit that made him a true, sincere friend to many,” said Dr Ali Jan, a cultural historian, while paying him rich tributes.
He said Durrani sahib devoted his life to enhancing Pakistan’s image internationally by hosting countless international dignitaries and celebrities, including novelist M.M. Kaye of ‘The Far Pavilions’ fame and Michael Wood, among others.
Michael Palin featured the Khyber Steam Safari in his acclaimed BBC documentary series ‘Himalayas’. The journey was recognised by Time magazine as one of the world’s top five railway adventures.
Durrani sahib fondly recalled, at one time, hosting fifty Royal Air Force Squadron members who arrived in Peshawar on private planes to embark on his safari.
Dr Ali Jan said that throughout his life, Durrani sahib’s positive outlook and heartfelt hospitality drew admirers from all corners: tourists, government officials, fellow entrepreneurs, and ordinary citizens alike. “His welcoming nature made every visitor feel at home and inspired generations of young tourism professionals,” said the cultural enthusiast adding despite his many contributions and international acclaim as a tourism ambassador, it is a bittersweet reality that Durrani sahib never received any national award in recognition of his lifelong service to Pakistan’s tourism and cultural heritage.
Yet, those who met him know that his greatest accolade was the genuine respect he earned from countless hearts. His legacy lives on not only in the iconic journeys he pioneered and the heritage he helped preserve, but the countless lives he touched in his professional and private life with his sincerity and grace.
Durrani sahib remained actively engaged in social activism focused on the preservation of cultural heritage, nature, and the environment. Shocked and saddened by the demolition of the historic Dean’s Hotel, he reached out to other concerned citizens and became one of the founding members of the Sarhad Conservation Network (SCN), which he co-founded with the late Dr Murad Ali. He also helped establish the Frontier Heritage Trust (FHT) with late Ms Maureen Lines.
Flipping through old brochures of ‘Jashn-e-Khyber’ and various art and cultural exhibitions held in Peshawar during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, one often comes across advertisements by Sehrai Travels & Tours.
“These recurring ads reflect his personal commitment to promoting the arts, crafts, and cultural image of the province. By supporting such local publications through his ads, he played a quiet yet consistent role in championing local arts,” pointed out Dr Ali Jan.
After 9/11, the tourism industry in KP was severely impacted by deteriorating law and order and ongoing unrest. Like many others whose livelihoods depended on tourism, Durrani sahib bore the brunt of this decline.
He was forced to scale down Sehrai Travels’ operations, the tour company he had built with such passion. Flashfloods in the Khyber district compounded the crisis, damaging the rail track and bringing the iconic Khyber Steam Safari to a halt. With tourism in sharp decline, he had no choice but to downsize, taking up consultancy roles with various private and public sector organisations to stay afloat.
November 2, this year, will mark the 100 years centenary of the formal inauguration of the Khyber Railway from Peshawar to Landikotal, a milestone Durrani sahib had long dreamed of commemorating.
He envisioned running the vintage Khyber Steam Train for tourists between Jamrud and Shagai stations in the Khyber Pass, a plan he believed was entirely feasible.
“In his final days, he remained actively engaged, reaching out to a wide network of contacts to make this vision a reality. Will anybody help realise his dream? Who will step forward to honour his legacy and bring the steam whistle back to life in the heart of Khyber Pass?” asked Dr Ali Jan.

Deputy Commissioner of Upper South Waziristan, Saleem Jan Marwat, issued a letter to the heads of all government departments in Upper South Waziristan, instructing them to immediately relocate their offices from Tank and Dera Ismail Khan to the district headquarters in Ladha.
According to letter No. 682-96/DC SWU, dated Ladha 26/05/2025, issued by the deputy commissioner, the heads of various government departments of Upper South Waziristan, including district education officers (male and female), district health officer, executive engineers Communication and Works, Irrigation and Public Health, divisional wildlife officer, divisional forest officer, tehsil municipal officer Ladha/Sawakai, assistant director Local Government and Rural Development Department, district sports officer and district youth Affairs officer were directed to relocate their offices to Ladha.
The letter said that the district administration had already moved its offices to the new district headquarters, therefore, all heads of government departments must open their offices in the new district headquarters.Tribal elders have complained that heads of many departments are still working in Tank and Dera Ismail Khan.
They said that officers, who were reluctant to move to the new district headquarters in Ladha, should be replaced with active and committed officers.The tribal elders added that some officers were using their political influence to delay or avoid the transfer of offices. They demanded strict action against those officers who were using delaying tactics or political clout to continue working from Tank and Dera Ismail Khan.

KP seeks transfer of funds for merged districts,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315707-kp-seeks-transfer-of-funds-for-merged-districts,"PESHAWAR: Adviser to the Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif on Monday called for the immediate transfer of the funds meant for the merged districts to the provincial government in light of the current situation.
“The law and order in the merged districts is a serious concern, yet the federal government has unlawfully withheld the funds allocated for these areas,” he said in a statement.Saif asserted that following the merger, the funds for the merged districts constitutionally and legally belong to the province.
Withholding these funds is a violation of both the Constitution and the law. He urged the federal government to rise above political bias and cooperate with the province on critical issues like security, rather than politicizing them.
The adviser added that the provincial government is making effective efforts to maintain peace and order in the merged districts within its available resources.To this end, billions of rupees have been allocated to enhance the capabilities of the police and the Counter Terrorism Department.
However, he stressed that the federal government must stop treating the province unfairly and fulfill its constitutional obligations.Saif said that the purpose of the merger was to bring the merged districts on a par with the rest of the province and to accelerate development in these areas. “Unfortunately, the federal government has retained the funds and failed to transfer them to the province, thereby hampering the development process,” he added.

BYD beats Tesla in Europe for first time with 169% sales surge,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315573-byd-beats-tesla-in-europe-for-first-time-with-169pc-sales-surge,"BYD Co sold more electric vehicles in Europe than Tesla Inc for the first time, overtaking the American brand that’s long led the continent’s EV segment, reports Bloomberg.
China’s leading automaker registered 7,231 new battery-electric vehicles in April, according to market researcher Jato Dynamics. That was up 169 per cent from a year earlier, vaulting BYD into the top 10 brands by EV sales. Tesla placed one spot back as its registrations plunged 49 per cent.
“Although the difference between the two car brands’ monthly sales totals may be small, the implications are enormous,” Jato Dynamics analyst Felipe Munoz said in an emailed statement. “This is a watershed moment for Europe’s car market.”
Tesla continued to slump despite accelerating growth in Europe’s EV segment. Registrations rose 28 per cent industrywide, with market leader Volkswagen selling 61 per cent more battery-electric cars in April than a year earlier. Volkswagen AG’s Skoda brand more than tripled its EV registrations.BYD outsold Tesla by an even wider margin when including the carmaker’s plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. The Chinese company’s total sales soared 359 per cent, Jato said.

Foreign investors pull net $42m from T-bills,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315574-foreign-investors-pull-net-42m-from-t-bills,"KARACHI: The decline in interest rates has made Pakistan’s short-term local government bonds unattractive to foreign investors, resulting in a withdrawal of a net $42.2 million from treasury bills (T-bills) as of May 2.
Foreign investors invested $9.998 million in T-bills but divested $52.208 million, leading to a net outflow of $42.2 million, according to the latest data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
In April, T-bills experienced net outflows of $187.9 million, while March saw outflows of $197.4 million. Between July 1, 2024 and May 2, 2025, investors purchased $1.183 billion in T-bills but withdrew $1.433 billion, resulting in a total net outflow of $250 million.
Analysts attribute the persistent outflows of foreign investment in fixed income to the reduction in interest rates, which has diminished the appeal of T-bills. Additionally, overseas investors are concerned about the gradual depreciation of the local currency.
Earlier this month, the SBP lowered its benchmark interest rate by 100 basis points (bps) to 11 per cent. This reduction is part of a series of rate cuts that have brought the rate down from a record high of 22 per cent, with a brief hold in March. As a result, the policy rate has reached its lowest point in three years, with a total cut of 11 percentage points since June 2024.
Moreover, rising geopolitical uncertainty following a brief military conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this month has negatively impacted foreign investors’ perceptions of Pakistan’s economy. Tensions escalated after a deadly attack on tourists in Indian-occupied Kashmir in April, ultimately leading to the worst military conflict in nearly three decades between the two nuclear-armed rivals. The two countries agreed to a ceasefire on May 10.
In the second week of this month, Pakistan received the second tranche of $1.02 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as part of a $7 billion loan programme. Consequently, the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves rose to a four-month high of $11.45 billion. The IMF expects the next funding review for Pakistan to take place in the second half of 2025 and will continue discussions with Pakistani authorities to agree on terms for the budget for the 2026 fiscal year.

"Experts call for budget to align with Uraan plan, long-term reforms",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315575-experts-call-for-budget-to-align-with-uraan-plan-long-term-reforms,"ISLAMABAD: The upcoming Federal Budget 2025-26 must align closely with the long-term goals outlined in the Uraan Pakistan five-year plan, ensuring inclusive and equitable economic development, experts urged at a seminar on Monday. They also emphasised that political stability remains essential for sustained economic growth, investor confidence and effective structural reforms.
In the context of ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India, speakers also called for the budget to address related challenges -- particularly in water management and issues concerning the Indus Waters Treaty.
These views were shared during a seminar titled ‘Federal Budget 2025-26: Strategic Priorities under Uraan Pakistan and the Shadow of Pakistan-India Tensions’, organised by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), Islamabad.
The panel of speakers included Dr Waqar Masood Khan, former federal secretary of finance; Sakib Sherani, former principal economic adviser to the government of Pakistan; Zafar ul Hassan Almas, former joint chief economist at the Ministry of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives; and Khalid Rahman, chairman of IPS.
They noted that Pakistan is currently undergoing its 14th IMF programme since 1988. While each has offered temporary economic stability, the core challenge lies in translating these gains into sustainable, long-term growth. Without comprehensive structural reforms, they warned, the country risks remaining trapped in a cycle of recurring bailouts.
The speakers argued that an overreliance on annual budget-making undermines strategic planning. A coherent roadmap for development requires a five- to ten-year vision. Given the current geopolitical climate -- especially heightened tensions with India -- there is concern that the forthcoming budget may prioritise immediate concerns at the expense of long-term strategy.
While recent improvements in macroeconomic indicators, such as declining inflation, a stable balance of payments, a stronger rupee and a stock market rebound, were acknowledged, the experts cautioned that these gains have largely resulted from temporary or ad hoc measures rather than structural policy changes. They stressed the need for institutionalised reforms, particularly in areas like the pension system.
The panellists agreed that economic stability, rather than rapid growth, should be the government’s primary objective in the short term. However, they maintained that a 4-5 per cent growth rate is both achievable and desirable, even within the constraints of the ongoing IMF programme. Enhancing exports through targeted incentives and a more business-friendly regulatory framework was identified as a critical step toward this goal.
The Uraan Pakistan plan was described as a promising strategic blueprint, but experts noted that it has yet to be meaningfully implemented or reflected in actual policy decisions. The upcoming budget, they said, offers a vital opportunity to translate the plan’s vision into action.
Aligning budgetary allocations with Uraan Pakistan’s strategic priorities will be key to increasing the export-to-GDP ratio, strengthening the IT sector, promoting environmental sustainability and climate resilience, and supporting the transition to green energy.
In his concluding remarks, Khalid Rahman said that Pakistan’s challenges are not solely economic but also deeply rooted in the political economy and lack of policy continuity. He stressed that consistency across successive governments is essential to build a stable and credible business environment. While the recent uptick in economic indicators is commendable, he said, these short-term gains must be leveraged into long-term development that addresses the broader population’s needs. He also highlighted the important role the private social sector can play in the country’s socio-economic progress.

"Stocks, euro jump on Trump EU tariff delays",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315576-stocks-euro-jump-on-trump-eu-tariff-delays,"LONDON/SINGAPORE: Global markets climbed on Monday and the euro rallied after US President Donald Trump kicked his threat to slap 50 per cent tariffs on European Union goods into July, marking another temporary trade policy reprieve.
MSCI’s broadest index of world shares rose 0.2 per cent. The pan-European stocks index last up .9 per cent, recovered to where it was trading before Trump on Friday unexpectedly called for 50 per cent tariffs on European goods, saying negotiations with the region had become too sluggish.
On Sunday, Trump reversed course, pushing the deadline for tariffs to July 9 from June 1, after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the 27-nation bloc needed more time to produce a deal.
Trump’s latest policy moves were a reminder to investors how quickly circumstances could change. Analysts have pointed out that investors are shifting their money out of US markets to Europe and Asia as they price in a possible US recession and a consequent global slowdown.
Last Friday’s comments were a reminder of Trump and his administration’s unpredictable and seemingly incoherent policies and decision-making, Commerzbank said in a note.“Now, a really toxic cocktail is mixed for the US consisting of (1) rising risk premium to hold US assets, (2) global investors’ move towards increased portfolio diversification, and (3) an increased homeland focus,” said a note from SEB Research, adding that they expected the dollar to lose value while US interest rates could rise further.
EURO GAINS
The dollar fell 0.1 per cent against a basket of currencies on Monday. The euro appreciated 0.23 per cent to $1.138 - its highest since late April, while the pound ticked almost 0.2 per cent upwards to 1.3567.“It still is largely a ‘sell dollar story’,” said Christopher Wong, currency strategist at OCBC.
“The policy unpredictability surrounding Trump’s tariffs and of course, the erosion of the US exceptionalism, this could potentially still undermine sentiment and the confidence in the medium term.”
Trading volumes on Monday were expected to be thinner than usual, given that markets in the United States and Britain were closed due to public holidays.Ballooning debt levels in developed economies were also brought back into focus following Moody’s credit rating downgrade of the United States and weak debt auctions in the US and Japan last week.
Inflation reports come from Japan and Germany later this week, along with price data on US goods and services.China and Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Monday as automobile shares slid on price war concerns, and Apple suppliers dropped on potential US tariffs.
At the close, the Shanghai Composite index weakened 0.1 per cent while the blue-chip CSI300 index dropped 0.6 per cent.In Japan, Nikkei 225 closed 1.0 per cent higher, its sharpest one-day advance in almost two weeks, after Trump appeared to give his blessing to Nippon Steel’s takeover of US Steel.
Japanese government bonds also rallied, following a dramatic week in which super-long yields hit record levels.Super-long Japanese bonds will be in focus, with inflation data expected later in the week as investors try to gauge the Bank of Japan's monetary policy outlook.
On the commodities front, Brent and US crude prices LCOc1, CLc1 both traded 23 cents lower, to $64.54 and $61.28 respectively, while gold eased from a two-week high to $3,339 an ounce.

Foreign investors urge crackdown on illegal cigarette trade,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315577-foreign-investors-urge-crackdown-on-illegal-cigarette-trade,"KARACHI: Foreign investors operating in Pakistan have raised serious concerns over the rapidly growing illegal cigarette market.In its budget proposals for the fiscal year 2025-26, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) -- which represents a major portion of foreign investment in the country -- urged the government to adopt immediate measures to tackle the issue.
According to the OICCI, illicit cigarette trade is costing the national exchequer more than Rs300 billion annually. The illegal market not only undermines legitimate businesses but also significantly impairs the government’s ability to meet its revenue targets.
To counter this, the OICCI recommended a comprehensive crackdown on tax evasion within the tobacco sector. Key proposals include full enforcement of the track and trace system, stronger coordination among regulatory authorities, and tougher penalties for those involved in illicit activities.
The chamber also stressed the importance of implementing SRO 96(I)/2021 to regulate the movement of taxable goods from non-tariff areas -- such as Azad Jammu and Kashmir -- into the federally taxed market. In addition, the recommendations advocated for public awareness campaigns to educate consumers about the health risks associated with illegal cigarettes and to promote responsible consumption by supporting legitimate brands.
The OICCI’s proposals underscored the urgent need for policy reforms that prioritise transparency, enforcement, and equitable taxation in the upcoming federal budget. Tackling the illegal tobacco trade, it said, must be a top priority to support economic stability, safeguard public health and ensure a level playing field for all businesses.

Stocks close lower on pre-budget uncertainty,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315578-stocks-close-lower-on-pre-budget-uncertainty,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed lower on Monday, as investors adopted a cautious stance amid uncertainty ahead of the federal budget.
The benchmark KSE-100 index dropped by 881.55 points, or 0.74 per cent, to 118,221.12 points, down from 119,102.67 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 119,290.94 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 118,150.28 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Ltd attributed the decline in stocks to “pre-budget session” pressure. Reports of higher petroleum levies; concerns over pending IMF approval on resolving circular debt plan; and delays over Budget FY26, now to be presented on June 10, impacted the sentiments.
He said that rupee instability and geopolitical tensions played a catalytic role in the bearish activity. The KSE-30 index decreased by 346.55 points or 0.95 per cent to 35,955.2 points from 36,301.75 points.
Traded shares rose by 297 million shares to 635.535 million shares from 338.003 million shares. The trading value increased to Rs18.576 billion from Rs18.511 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs14.325 trillion against Rs14.385 trillion. Of the 467 companies active in the session, 188 closed in green, 235 in red and 44 remained unchanged.
Maaz Mulla, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the local bourse witnessed a profit-taking session on Monday as uncertainty continued to weigh on investor sentiment. He said the bearish trend was primarily driven by concerns over the delay in the federal budget announcement and the lack of clarity regarding the IMF conditions tied to it. In the absence of positive triggers, investors chose to trim their positions and adopt a cautious stance.
K-Electric Ltd led the volume chart, closing at its upper circuit, following news that KE has secured a dollar-linked tariff for its transmission and distribution business.Energy stocks came under pressure amid rumours of a potential delay in the clearance of circular debt, with PPL, OGDC and PSO emerging as major losers.
On the downside, key index heavyweights including ENGROH, SYS, PSO, FFC and OGDC collectively contributed to a 452-point decline in the benchmark index.The highest increase was recorded in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which rose by Rs2,006.32 to Rs22,069.53 per share, followed by Khyber Textile Mills Limited, which increased by Rs190.61 to Rs2,096.7 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs72.36 to Rs10,755.23 per share; Sazgar Engineering Works Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs36.29 to Rs1,216.17 per share.
Analyst Mohammed Hasan Ather at JS Global said the KSE index fell, as investor sentiment weakened due to the government’s delay in presenting the federal budget and ongoing uncertainty surrounding IMF fiscal targets. “The postponement of Budget 2025-26 and unresolved negotiations with the IMF are driving the risk-off behaviour,” he said.
He added that market direction remains contingent on clarity from upcoming IMF discussions and the budget announcement; volatility is likely to persist until fiscal policy details are finalised.
KE remained the volume leader with 246.932 million shares, which closed higher by Re1.0 to Rs5.72 per share. WorldCall Telecom, with 36.720 million shares, followed it, which closed higher by 2 paisas to Rs1.27 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included Telecard Limited, PTCL, Kohinoor Spining, Big Bird Foods Ltd, Hira Textile, Cnergyico PK, Siddiqsons Tin and Fauji Foods Ltd.In the futures market, 318 companies recorded trading, 95 of which increased, 217 decreased and 6 remained unchanged.

Rupee ends weaker as increased dollar demand exerts pressure,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315579-rupee-ends-weaker-as-increased-dollar-demand-exerts-pressure,"KARACHI: The rupee lowered on Monday, pressured by dollar demand from importers and exporters’ sluggish greenback sales.
The rupee closed at 282.06 against the US dollar, down 0.03 per cent from the previous session.Foreign exchange traders attribute the rupee’s weakness to a mismatch between the demand and supply of dollars in the market.
“This situation has arisen due to increasing import payments, a lack of dollar sales from exporters, and a slowdown in remittances,” the trader said.“The local currency is depreciating, even though there are less than two weeks until Eidul Azha. However, we are optimistic that remittance flows related to Eid will soon pick up momentum,” he added.
According to a note by Tresmark last week, several factors are contributing to the recent weakness of the rupee. These include a surge in defence-related spending, outflows related to Haj, and backlog clearance following the reopening of the Afghan border.
Furthermore, the central bank’s decision to allow some swaps to mature without rolling them over through sell-buy arrangements is weakening both spot rates and swap premiums, adding further pressure on the local currency. The disparity between dollar inflows and outflows resulted in banks being deficient in their net open positions, delaying the retirement of letters of credit, and elevating the open market rate to 284 per dollar.The rupee traded at 284.29 per dollar in the open market, compared with 284.15 in the previous session.

ECB’s Lagarde pitches euro alternative to dollar in ‘fracturing’ world,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315580-ecb-s-lagarde-pitches-euro-alternative-to-dollar-in-fracturing-world,"BERLIN: European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde on Monday said the global economic order backed by the US dollar was “fracturing” and made a pitch for the euro as a global reserve currency.
“The global economy thrived on a foundation of openness and multilateralism underpinned by US leadership,” Lagarde said in a speech at the Hertie School in Berlin.Washington’s support for a rules-based international system and the dollar as a reserve currency had “set the stage for trade to flourish and finance to expand”.
The persistence of that US-led economic order over the past 80 years had “proved immensely beneficial to the European Union”.“But today it is fracturing,” she said in an apparent reference to global trade tensions fuelled by US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose sweeping tariffs on key partners.
“Multilateral cooperation is being replaced by zero-sum thinking and bilateral power plays. Openness is giving way to protectionism.”The recent upheaval was also threatening “the dominant role of the US dollar”, she said.
The disintegration of the global economic order would “pose risks for Europe”, Lagarde said.“Any change in the international order that leads to lower world trade or fragmentation into economic blocs will be detrimental to our economy,” she said.
But the retreat of the US dollar could also “open the door for the euro to play a greater international role”.Increasing the international role of the euro would lower borrowing costs for EU member states, insulate the bloc from exchange rate fluctuations and would “allow Europe to better control its own destiny”, Lagarde said.
For that to happen, the European Union would need a “steadfast commitment to open trade” and to underpin its position with sufficient security capabilities. It would also need to strengthen its economy and defend the rule of law, she said.“This is not a privilege that will simply be given to us. We have to earn it.”

SECP conducts mutual fund focus group session,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315581-secp-conducts-mutual-fund-focus-group-session,"KARACHI: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) wrapped up the first day of its Mutual Fund Focus Group Sessions 2025 at a local hotel in Karachi.
The closed-door session brought together a diverse range of stakeholders from across Pakistan’s capital markets for in-depth discussions on critical issues shaping the mutual fund industry. The event, structured into four thematic segments, facilitated expert-led deliberations on mutual fund reforms, product innovation, digital transformation, investor inclusion, governance frameworks and market development, addressing both domestic challenges and global best practices.
During his opening remarks, SECP Chairperson Akif Saeed underscored the strategic importance of mutual funds in broadening access to formal investment opportunities, particularly for retail investors.
He stated, “Mutual funds have the potential to democratise investing by offering professionally managed, transparent, and regulated options to a wider investor base. The SECP remains fully committed to strengthening the mutual fund ecosystem by fostering innovation, simplifying accessibility and enhancing regulatory oversight to ensure long-term and inclusive growth.”
The sessions featured discussions on emerging global trends, including the rise of ESG-focused, thematic and infrastructure-linked funds, as well as the expanding market for Sharia-compliant investment products.
A key focus was also placed on women’s financial inclusion, with participants exploring how mutual funds can serve as an effective tool to enhance female participation in the economy. The latter half of the event centred on digital transformation and governance, with stakeholders examining the role of technologies such as Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) and Centralised Gateway Portals (CGPs) in improving investor onboarding and operational efficiency.
The discussions also emphasised the need for strong governance frameworks, transparent disclosure practices and risk management protocols to bolster investor confidence and safeguard market integrity.
In his closing address, SECP Commissioner Abdul Rehman Warraich highlighted the significance of stakeholder input in shaping future regulatory policies. “We are grateful for the candid and constructive engagement from our industry partners. The insights gathered today will play a crucial role in informing our upcoming reforms. A transparent, well-regulated, and inclusive mutual fund industry is vital for deepening Pakistan’s capital markets and advancing financial inclusion,” he remarked.

Path to peace runs through economic resolve,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315582-path-to-peace-runs-through-economic-resolve,"LAHORE: In its pursuit of becoming the undisputed regional power in South Asia, India has deliberately maintained heightened tensions with Pakistan -- seeking to further strain Pakistan’s economy at a time when the country is striving for recovery.
India’s strategic interests have often been served by internal instability within Pakistan. Militant groups operating inside the country have periodically turned against the state, forcing the Pakistani military and security apparatus to divert resources inward.
Under the illusion that Pakistan, preoccupied with internal threats, lacked the bandwidth for strategic engagement, India underestimated its neighbour’s military capacity. That illusion was shattered during the most recent conflict, when Pakistan retaliated with precision, demonstrating technological prowess and operational capability.
Pakistan continues to express a desire for peaceful relations with India -- but on terms defined by strength. The core of this stance lies in the economic wellbeing of its population.
Destabilising a nuclear-armed neighbour is rarely in any country’s long-term interest. Despite internal threats, Pakistan’s military has preserved its ability to project strength, particularly on its eastern front. India has never had the luxury of overlooking this reality. Attacks targeting Pakistani civilians and military personnel -- especially children -- have galvanised public support for the armed forces, consolidating their influence over both domestic and foreign policy, including the country’s stance on India.
Pakistan has conducted multiple operations to dismantle militant networks and reclaim internal stability. Some analysts argue that this has enabled the military to re-engage externally, including with India.
While India may have enjoyed short-term strategic reprieve during Pakistan’s internal fight against terrorism, long-term regional peace and economic integration hinge on a stable and moderate Pakistan.
Given this context, Pakistan’s political parties must unite to prioritise economic recovery. Indian media has already urged its government to keep Pakistan engaged in border skirmishes to exert continued economic pressure. The current economic climate demands focused governance and constructive opposition. Pakistanis should remain vigilant, but not be provoked by Indian sabre-rattling.
The country’s economic challenges can largely be addressed through better resource allocation. This is no time for political gamesmanship. The government must remove individuals with compromised reputations -- regardless of whether allegations have been proven -- and assemble a clean, competent team of local experts. With a sound economic foundation, the political leadership would be better positioned to counter India’s diplomatic manoeuvres.
Pakistan’s industrial sector has been severely constrained by flawed government policies. It now requires facilitation and support to regain competitiveness. A capable and honest economic team must lead efforts to revitalise industry. However, businesses should not expect undue concessions or subsidies.
With inflation at record lows, interest rates halved over the past six months, and a stable rupee, the government has a favourable macroeconomic environment to enact reforms. One pressing issue is the anomaly in yarn imports: exporters are exempt from sales tax on imported yarn, but face the tax when purchasing domestically produced yarn. This has led to a decline in local yarn sales, with imports now making up nearly 50 per cent of total fabric production.
Moreover, some unscrupulous exporters are exploiting this loophole -- buying cheaper local yarn while claiming to use higher-priced imported yarn, thereby distorting the market. Since there is no mechanism to verify the origin of the yarn used, this practice goes unchallenged. The only viable solution is to impose a sales tax on imported yarn as well, ensuring a level playing field.

Trump considers redirecting $3bn in Harvard grants to US trade schools,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315583-trump-considers-redirecting-3bn-in-harvard-grants-to-us-trade-schools,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Monday he is considering taking $3 billion of previously awarded grant money for scientific and engineering research away from Harvard University and giving it to trade schools.
His comments on his social media platform Truth Social come less than a week after his administration sought to block the Ivy League school from enrolling foreign students as part of Trump’s extraordinary effort to seize some government control of US academia.
Trump, a Republican, has frozen some $3 billion in federal grants to Harvard in recent weeks, complaining that it has hired Democrats, “Radical Left idiots and ‘bird brains’” as professors. Harvard, a private university, has sued to restore the funding, saying the cuts are an unconstitutional attack on its free speech rights and unlawful.
Most of that grant money is appropriated by Congress for the National Institutes of Health to disburse to fund biomedical research after a lengthy application process by individual scientists, work that is not typically done at trade schools.
It was not clear whether Trump was referring to Harvard grants his administration has already frozen. Harvard has said it was told that virtually all of its federal grant awards were revoked earlier in May, in a series of letters by the NIH, the US Forest Service, the Department of Energy, the Department of Defence and other agencies.
The letters each said the grants were being suspended because they “no longer effectuate agency priorities”. Harvard did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. The White House did not respond to questions about the specific funds Trump wants to repurpose or how it could be reallocated to trade schools under the law.
On Friday, a US judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students, a policy the university said was part of Trump’s broader effort to retaliate against it for refusing to “surrender its academic independence”.
The order provides temporary relief to thousands of international students, who were faced with potentially having to transfer under a policy that the university in Cambridge, Massachusetts called a “blatant violation” of the US constitution and other federal laws.
It said the move would have an “immediate and devastating effect” on the university and more than 7,000 visa holders.Harvard enrolled nearly 6,800 international students in its current school year, representing 27 per cent of total enrolment and a significant chunk of its revenue from tuition fees.
The move was the latest escalation in a broader battle between Harvard and the White House, as Trump seeks to compel universities, law firms, news media, courts and other institutions to align with his agenda. Trump and fellow Republicans have long accused elite universities of left-wing bias.
In recent weeks, the administration has proposed ending Harvard's tax-exempt status and hiking taxes on its endowment, and opened an investigation into whether it violated civil rights laws by discriminating against “white, Asian, male, or straight employees” or job or training program applicants.Harvard has said its hiring and admissions are compliant with the law.

"Russia’s cooling economy facing ‘hypothermia’ risks, minister warns",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315584-russia-s-cooling-economy-facing-hypothermia-risks-minister-warns,"MOSCOW: Russia’s economy is facing “hypothermia” risks, Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov said on Monday as he urged the central bank to take slowing inflation into account when it meets to set interest rates next week.
Grappling with stubbornly high inflation, Russia’s central bank has kept its key interest rate at 21 per cent since October, a stance that has stifled investment just as the economic support provided by soaring military spending starts to decline.
Russian authorities usually present a united front on policy matters, but high interest rates, hefty budget spending and the efficacy of capital controls have all led to public disagreements in the last few years.
Sometimes the Kremlin gets involved.
In August 2023, the central bank made an unscheduled, 350-basis-point rate hike the day after receiving a public rebuke from President Vladimir Putin’s then economic adviser Maxim Oreshkin, blaming what he called its soft monetary policy for weakening the rouble.
Then in March this year Putin urged his economic officials not to freeze the Russian economy as if it were in a “cryotherapy chamber” with high borrowing costs, which many analysts interpreted as a call to start an easing cycle.
Reshetnikov, speaking on Monday in the State Duma, Russia’s lower house of parliament, said that inflation in recent weeks had been in the 3-4 per cent range when recalculated in annual terms.
“We expect that May data will consolidate this trend and we of course expect that the central bank will duly take this into account when taking decisions because we also see risks of economic hypothermia in the current regime,” Reshetnikov said.
The ministry forecasts annual inflation for 2025 at 7.6 per cent, an estimate that Reshetnikov described as “realistic”.
Major Russian exporters including Rusal and Gazpromneft have cut the planned volume of commodities such as metal and oil products they send by rail, a Russian Railways document seen by Reuters showed last week, demonstrating the real-world impact of subdued demand as the country’s economy slows.
Many businesses in the industrial sector have complained of prohibitive borrowing costs and some have scaled back investment plans. The economy ministry forecasts economic growth of 2.5 per cent this year, compared with a central bank prediction of 1-2 per cent. The central bank’s next rate-setting meeting is scheduled for June 6.

Sporting beat Benfica in cup final to complete double,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315600-sporting-beat-benfica-in-cup-final-to-complete-double,"LISBON: Sporting Lisbon defeated rivals Benfica 3-1 to claim the Portuguese Cup on Sunday and complete an impressive double after edging out the same opponent on the final day of the league season.
Rui Borges´ side forced extra-time with in-form striker Viktor Gyokeres´ penalty in the 11th minute of stoppage time after Orkun Kokcu sent Benfica ahead in the 47th minute. Conrad Harder fired Sporting in front after 99 minutes and Francisco Trincao wrapped up the win at the death against their Lisbon rivals.
Sporting´s season was almost derailed when coach Ruben Amorim left to join Manchester United in November and his successor Joao Pereira struggled to get the team firing. Little over a month later Borges came in and steadied the ship, taking the team to a second successive Portuguese crown before making it a double.
“We almost lost but in the last minute (we saved it), only a great team can do this,” Sporting midfielder Morten Hjulmand told Sport TV. “It´s an honour to be part of this team, I really enjoy it.”
In the 2024 final, Sporting were beaten by Porto and Hjulmand was happy to rectify that this time around. “We weren´t completely satisfied last year, we were left with a bit of an empty feeling but now the cup is ours and we want to celebrate,” he said.
It may be the last game Gyokeres plays for the club, with the 26-year-old striker in-demand among Europe´s top clubs after an excellent season, in which he scored 54 goals across all competitions. “You have to ask him (about his future), he has a contract -- if it were up to me he would stay,” added Hjulmand.

Naqvi full of praise for efforts behind successful PSL-10,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315601-naqvi-full-of-praise-for-efforts-behind-successful-psl-10,"LAHORE: Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10 concluded successfully on Sunday, marking a significant achievement for Pakistan cricket. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi expressed deep gratitude for the collective efforts that made the tournament a success.

Caesar stuns rivals to clinch Islamabad Cup at LRC,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315602-caesar-stuns-rivals-to-clinch-islamabad-cup-at-lrc,"LAHORE: In a thrilling day of unexpected finishes, Caesar, a relatively unknown contender, delivered a stunning upset to claim victory in the Islamabad Cup, the featured race of the six-event card of the 39th Day Winter Meeting 2024-25 at the Lahore Race Club Sunday evening.
The highly anticipated Islamabad Cup witnessed seasoned favourites faltering under pressure as Caesar galloped past top-rated contenders, including the favourite Luna Afzaal, to clinch the title. While Redrock met expectations by securing the second position, Luna Afzaal had to settle for third place, completing an unanticipated top-three lineup that left the pundits in awe.
Aside from Rafah’s emphatic victory in the final race, the day was largely defined by surprising results, with upsets occurring in nearly every race. The afternoon kicked off with Chika Riska stealing the spotlight in the opening Samasatta Plate (Class-VII Division-VI & VII). Entering as a place contender, Chika Riska surged ahead of Leo Star, another surprise performer, while the fluke entry Noon Princess claimed third place. Pre-race favourites struggled to find form, setting the tone for the rest of the card.
The trend continued in the second race (Class-VII Division-V), where Naveed-e-Sahar defied odds to register an upset victory. Jahanbaz, a widely expected place contender, lived up to expectations by finishing second, while Thunder Man (KRC) surprised the field by grabbing third.
In the third race (Class-VII Division-III & II), it was Kit Kat who emerged as the unexpected winner, outpacing the favourite Elizabeth, who could only manage a second-place finish. The third spot was taken by Thunder Boy, another underdog who stunned more seasoned runners.
The fourth race (Class-VII Division-I) added further drama to the day, as Black Tiger, a fluke entry, galloped to a remarkable win against the odds. Top pick Zuza, who was heavily backed to win, was forced to settle for second, while Sultan Prince, who was expected to fight for a place, rounded off the top three.
The final race of the day, Class-VII Division-IV & V, brought a aspect of normalcy as Rafah, the firm favourite, justified the punters’ prediction by cruising to victory. Luckvir, considered a fluke entrant, surprised many by taking second, and Azaad, a relatively unknown participant, completed the top three, highlighting the unpredictable nature of the evening’s events.

Raza jets in 10 minutes before toss to lead Lahore to PSL title,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315603-raza-jets-in-10-minutes-before-toss-to-lead-lahore-to-psl-title,"LAHORE: Sikandar Raza hit the winning runs to seal the Pakistan Super League title for Lahore Qalandars on Sunday, having landed just 10 minutes before the toss after a mad dash from England.
The 39-year-old was carried off the field on the shoulders of his celebrating teammates after having jumped on a plane to Pakistan straight after Zimbabwe´s innings defeat in the Nottingham Test on Saturday.
Raza hit 22 not out with two sixes and two fours to give the home team a thrilling six-wicket victory over Quetta Gladiators with one ball to spare. “Had dinner in Birmingham, breakfast in Dubai, drove to Abu Dhabi for lunch, took a flight and had dinner in Pakistan,” said Raza, who scored a half-century in his country´s heavy defeat to England.
“I guess this is the life of a professional cricketer, and I´m truly humbled and blessed to have that life.” Needing 13 off the last over to complete a 202-run chase, Raza struck a six and a four to help seal the title.
Sri Lankan Kusal Perera led the chase with an undefeated 31-ball 62 studded with five boundaries and four sixes, adding 59 runs during the unbroken fifth-wicket stand. Opener Mohammad Naeem scored 46, with half a dozen sixes and one boundary, and Abdullah Shafique hit 41 to set Lahore on course to make the highest successful chase in a PSL final.
Lahore sealed their third title following triumphs in 2022 and 2023. Hasan Nawaz scored a brilliant 76 to lift Quetta to 201-9 after they won the toss and batted. Coming in at 21-2, Nawaz added 67 for the fourth wicket with Avishka Fernando (29) and 46 with Dinesh Chandimal (22).

Ramiz hails Sikandar Raza’s heroics and commitment to Lahore,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315605-ramiz-hails-sikandar-raza-s-heroics-and-commitment-to-lahore,"LAHORE: Former PCB chairman Ramiz Raja lavished praise on Sikandar Raza for his match-winning performance and remarkable commitment that played a crucial role in Lahore Qalandars’ triumph in the PSL 10 final.
Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ramiz revealed behind-the-scenes details, highlighting Raza’s determination to make it to Lahore in time for the final. “The way Sikandar showed commitment is truly admirable. He not only managed to reach Pakistan against the odds but also played and led his team to victory,” Ramiz said.
Raza changed multiple flights just to ensure he could take the field for Qalandars. He arrived in Lahore just minutes  before the final, landing at 6.50pm, warmed up for only a few deliveries and went straight onto the field.
While calling the win a team effort, Ramiz emphasised that Raza’s performance stood out alongside Kusal Perera’s contributions. “Sikandar Raza played a phenomenal innings in the final. Every player contributed, but he added the winning spark. Perera also played a fantastic knock,” Ramiz added.
Ramiz revealed that Lahore Qalandars had prepared two squad lists—one with Raza and another with Shakib Al Hasan, in case Raza was unable to arrive on time. His commitment and loyalty to Lahore Qalandars were praised, with Ramiz noting that the franchise takes great care of its players, fostering a strong bond between the team and its stars.
Looking ahead, Ramiz expressed optimism about the next PSL season, hinting that two new teams may be added to the league. “Next season, the league could become even more thrilling as two new teams are expected to join. But we must assess whether we have the talent pool to support this expansion and what strategies will be in place,” he stressed.
Raza’s incredible journey to PSL-10 glory with Lahore QalandarsZimbabwean allrounder Sikandar Raza’s journey with Lahore Qalandars played a pivotal role in securing the PSL- 10 title.
Arriving in Pakistan just minutes before the final and delivering a match-winning knock in a thrilling last-over finish, remained one of the incredible players of the PSL-10. After competing in a one-off Test match between Zimbabwe and England at Trent Bridge, Raza took a whirlwind journey across multiple cities before landing in Lahore only ten minutes before the toss.
“I had dinner in Birmingham, breakfast in Dubai, lunch in Abu Dhabi and flew straight to Lahore for the PSL final. This is the life of a professional cricketer, and I am truly blessed to have this life,” Raza shared during post-match celebrations.
Despite this physically demanding schedule, he remained composed, scoring 22 off just seven balls, sealing the six-wicket victory for Lahore Qalandars as they successfully chased 202 runs. Speaking about Lahore Qalandars’ experience in tense matches, Raza referenced their nail-biting one-run victory against Multan Sultans two years ago: “No other team is more prepared than us, given the do-or-die games we had to face this time around to get here.”
Despite injuries and concussions in the squad, he described this final as even more memorable than the 2023 title win: “We had concussions; Naeem wasn’t fit. There was so much drama in this game. I pick this final over the one two years ago.”
The Qalandars had prepared two squad lists—one featuring Sikandar Raza and another with Shakib Al Hasan, in case Raza didn’t arrive on time. However, the Zimbabwean star made it just in time, proving his commitment to the franchise and the game itself. “If I told you how I got here, it is unbelievable. And to have a victory like this, I just have no words,” Raza concluded, describing the moment as one of the most surreal experiences of his career.

"PTF imposes fine, ban on top tennis player over misconduct",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315606-ptf-imposes-fine-ban-on-top-tennis-player-over-misconduct,"KARACHI: Just a day after winning prestigious Federal Cup, the country’s number one tennis player received 25% cut in match fee, a six-month ban, 1.5 lac rupees fine and warnings over misconduct.
It has been learnt that Pakistan Tennis Federation imposed a ban of six months on Muhammad Shoaib along with fine of Rs 1.5 lac, no entry in the premises of PTF, anger management course, and severe disciplinary actions in future.
A letter of PTF, copy of which is available with ‘The News’, addressed to M Shoaib issued on Monday stated that “The Management of the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) has taken serious notice of the unfortunate incident that took place on 21st May, 2025 during the Federal Cup National Ranking Tennis Championship at the PTF tennis courts.
“It was established through multiple eyewitnesses including players, parents, coaches, and tournament organizers, that you were involved in a serious act of misconduct. This included hurling abusive language, using obscene and obnoxious words, and physically assaulting Mr. Amjad Niazi (parent of Talha and Huzaifa) with your racket, causing him multiple injuries.
“Given the gravity of this incident. the Disciplinary Committee of the Islamabad Tennis Association (ITA) conducted a detailed inquiry. Testimonies were recorded from Mr. Amjad Niazi, Talha Khan, Yousaf Khalil, and yourself.
“Based on the findings of the inquiry committee of ITA, the President PTF convened the PTF Disciplinary Committee on 25th May, 2025 to further probe/investigate and recommend appropriate action. It also came to light during the inquiry that this is not the first instance of such unbecoming behavior on your part.
“Previous incidents have already caused significant embarrassment to the management of the PTF. In this particular case, your decision to get involved and escalate the situation is beyond comprehension and entirely uncalled for.”
In the light of the said observation the PTF Disciplinary Committee recommended a number of actions against M Shoaib which included Rs. 1.5 lacs fine on misconduct, six-month ban on participation in national and international tournaments, and no entry in the PTF premises during the ban period.
Also, the PTF stated that in case of default of fine the ban for one year will be imposed while anger management course should be undertaken by the player and certificate to this effect should be submitted to PTF before the end of ban period.
“The ban period will start w.e.f May 25, 2025. This letter is being forwarded for strict compliance, and it must be clearly understood that any future misconduct - whether directly or indirectly - will result in more severe disciplinary actions. This is issued with the approval of the President PTF,” stated Secretary PTF Zia Tufail in the said letter.
When contacted, M Shoaib stated that this ban was highly disappointing and completely unjustified. “The person [Amjad Niazi] I had fight with according to PTF was actually the one who slapped me in the first place when I asked him to control one of his sons who scuffled with two of my fellow players one day before the incident.
“But instead of chiding his son the man slapped me and then we had a brief fight. Even then I apologised to that person in the evening and the referee was aware of all this,” said Shoaib, adding that the referee then told me that 25% of my match fee will be deducted and I agreed, hence the issue got settled.
“Yet, the president PTF went further with this case and formed a committee which imposed such harsh punishment on me. At the time when I am at my career’s peak, this restriction of not featuring in national and international events is very harsh.
“It is not justified to ban the country’s top player who had already faced a cut of 25% match fee. This ban is a double blow to me because I will be the top contender for the national team that is to play Davis Cup against Paraguay in the coming months and we have good chances of winning that tie,” said Shoaib.
He said that the PTF should have banned that person and his sons who were twice involved in scuffle with the country’s best players during that event, but the PTF president had different perception on this issue.
“I will now have discussion with my family and coaches to decide what to do against this unjustified ban. I hope better sense prevails and PTF takes back this very damaging decision,” concluded Shoaib.

Sahir Associates take control of PT semi-final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315607-sahir-associates-take-control-of-pt-semi-final,"ISLAMABAD: Sahir Associates took firm control of their President’s Trophy (PT) Grade-II semi-final against JDW at the Shoaib Akhtar Stadium on Monday.
As only 15 overs were possible on each of the first two days due to bad weather, Sahir Associates resumed their first innings on the third morning at 65-2 and were eventually bowled out for 257 in 75 overs. Their bowlers then backed up the efforts by leaving JDW struggling at 162-8 in 50 overs by the close of play.
JDW still trail by 95 runs on the first innings, with No.8 batter Mohammad Junaid (12) and No.10 batter Irfan Elahi (3) at the crease. Mohammad Bilawal (3-38), Mohammad Saleem (2-18), and Shahid Ali (2-44) were the pick of the bowlers for Sahir Associates, applying early pressure to leave the Multan Sultans’ development squad reeling at 62-5.
At that point, Jahanzaib Sultan (60) and Mohammad Zulkifal (14) steadied the innings with a 67-run stand for the sixth wicket. However, both fell with the score at 129, triggering another collapse as JDW slumped to 129-7 and then 151-8 shortly before stumps.
Earlier, Ahmer Ashfaq top-scored with 53 for Sahir Associates, receiving useful support from Asim Ali Nasir (38), Mohsin Khan (32), and Fahad Usman (23). From 96-4 and then 135-5, the last five wickets added 122 valuable runs to lift them to 257.
For JDW, Majid Ali was the most effective bowler, taking 3-28, while Fayyaz Khan and Irfan Elahi picked up two wickets each. An extra day has been added to the originally three-day fixture in accordance with the event’s playing conditions, ensuring both the teams have the opportunity to complete at least one innings. Only 30 overs of play were possible across the first two days.
Scores in brief: Sahir Associates 257 all-out, 75 overs (Ahmer Ashfaq 53, Asim Ali Nasir 38, Mohsin Khan 32, Fahad Usman 23; Mohammad Irfan 3-31, Majid Ali 2-28, Fayyaz Khan 2-31, Irfan Elahi 2-58). JDW 162-8, 50 overs (Jahanzaib Sultan 60, Haroon Arshad 20; Mohammad Bilawal 3-38, Mohammad Saleem 2-18, Shahid Ali 2-44).

Liverpool already ‘busy’ getting better for next season,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315608-liverpool-already-busy-getting-better-for-next-season,"LIVERPOOL: Liverpool chairman Tom Werner said he is already busy working on improving the team for next season despite romping to the Premier League title.
The Reds will parade the Premier League trophy through Liverpool city centre on Monday with tens of thousands expected to line the streets. But attention has already turned to defending the trophy with the 20-time English champions reportedly close to a triple swoop costing around Â£200 million ($271 million).
Jeremie Frimpong is finalising his move from Bayer Leverkusen as a replacement for the departing Trent Alexander-Arnold. Florian Wirtz has also chosen Anfield as his preferred destination, according to German media, should he move on from Leverkusen.
Wirtz, 22, could smash the Premier League transfer record of Â£115 million set by Chelsea´s capture of Moises Caicedo. Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez is also reportedly keen on a Â£50 million move to Liverpool.
“It´s already busy,” said Werner. “We go again. It never gets old, winning. We owe it to all of our supporters to bring back a team even better next season.” Arne Slot´s success in his first season as manager was even more remarkable as he was given little money to work with in the transfer market 12 months ago.
Federico Chiesa, who struggled to make an impact in his few first-team opportunities, remains the club´s only signing of the Slot era. “It´s extraordinary. We obviously had high hopes for this season but he has been an extraordinary coach,” added Werner. “I think there have been three coaches who have won the Premier League in their first season and Arne is one of them. He is just an extraordinary leader. “He´s authentic, he´s not trying to be anyone else. The team was an extraordinarily good team but he brought the best out of them.”

Mbappe adds a little lustre to Real season with Golden Shoe,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315609-mbappe-adds-a-little-lustre-to-real-season-with-golden-shoe,"MADRID: Real Madrid may have won no trophies, but their French Galactico Kylian Mbappe ended his first season in Spain by collecting two individual scoring awards: the European Golden Shoe and the award for top scorer in La Liga.
Mbappe scored twice in Real Madrid´s final league game on Saturday to overtake Viktor Gyokeres, whose league season at Sporting Lisbon ended the previous week, at the top of the weighted table which counts only league goals.
Mbappe ended with 31 league goals as he became the third Real Madrid player to win the award, after Mexicans Hugo Sanchez (1989-1990) and Cristiano Ronaldo (2010-2011, 2013-2014, 2014-2015).
The last Frenchman to collect the Golden Shoe was Thierry Henry, who won it in 2004 and 2005 with Arsenal. Mbappe could have been caught on Sunday, while he was in Monaco watching the Formula One Grand Prix.
Mohammed Salah, who needed a hat-trick in English champions Liverpool´s last league game, scored once to finish third with 29 goals.
Barcelona´s Robert Lewandowski, already certain to finish ahead of Real Madrid in the race for the Spanish league title, scored twice at Bilbao. He totalled 27 goals, for fourth place in Europe and second in the Pichichi, the award for the top scorer in La Liga. The Pole won the Golden Shoe twice with Bayern and claimed the Pichichi in 2023.

Exciting showdown on cards as PFF to elect new president today,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315614-exciting-showdown-on-cards-as-pff-to-elect-new-president-today,"ISLAMABAD: A thrilling showdown is set to unfold in Lahore today (Tuesday) as the race for presidency of the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) entered its decisive phase.
In what promises to be one of the most hotly contested elections in recent memory, razor-thin margins could determine the next head of Pakistan’s football governing body -- with just a single vote likely to tip the balance. According to well-placed sources, the PFF Congress is bracing for a nail-biting election day, as two formidable factions lock horns in a high-stakes battle for supremacy.
On one side stands Taha Ali Zai, spearheading Zahir Shah group, which has consolidated significant backing, including unanimous support from all departmental teams, two members from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the full bloc of three from Balochistan, and a key vote from Punjab.
Ali Zai’s strategic acumen was on full display during a recent gathering in Islamabad, where he paraded 13 out of the 24 total votes -- a show of force sealed with a united group photograph of his loyalists.
Challenging this formidable front is an emerging alliance between Syed Mohsin Gilani and Hafiz Zakaullah, who have pooled their resources in a last-minute push to shift the electoral tide.
Banking on votes from Sindh, female members of the Congress, representatives from the women’s champion team, referees, and a couple of crucial Punjab votes, Gilani has stepped into the fray as the chief rival to Ali Zai. His camp remains hopeful that with just two defections from the opposing bloc, the tide could turn dramatically in their favor.
Rumours have swirled around the Gilani-Zakaullah pact, suggesting a power-sharing arrangement in which Gilani might only serve the first year as president, paving the way for Zakaullah to take over for the remaining three years.
However, insiders close to Gilani dismissed such speculation, indicating that should he succeed, he intends to complete the full four-year term. Despite the optimism, overcoming Ali Zai’s entrenched position will be a herculean task. With the backing of powerful departments and institutional forces, his campaign has emerged as the more structured and disciplined of the two -- a fact that has not gone unnoticed within football circles.
Adding to the intrigue is the unusual structure of the elections. While there is no official position of senior vice president, one of the elected vice presidents is expected to assume the role informally. The House of 24 will also vote to elect three vice presidents, three services representatives, and two executive members from each province, rounding out the 14 key positions up for grabs.
For over a decade, the PFF has remained mired in controversy, internal divisions, and repeated foreign intervention. The FIFA has stepped in on multiple occasions, appointing three separate normalization committees to bring order to the federation. Years of instability, legal wrangling, and administrative limbo have left Pakistani football languishing on the sidelines of regional and international competition.
Tuesday’s election represents not only a potential changing of the guard but also a rare opportunity to restore credibility to the sport’s highest office in the country. As Lahore prepares for this pivotal vote, football fans, stakeholders, and observers await with bated breath -- hoping that a new chapter in Pakistan’s football history is finally about to be written.

India races to contain oil spill after container ship sinks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315675-india-races-to-contain-oil-spill-after-container-ship-sinks,"BENGALURU, India: India´s coastguard raced on Monday to contain an oil spill from a container ship with hazardous cargo that sank off the southern coast a day earlier, Kerala´s state government said.
The Liberian-flagged MSC ELSA 3, listed as a 184-metre freight ship, went down off the coast of Kerala on Sunday, with all 24 crew members rescued. It was carrying 640 containers, including 13 with hazardous cargo and 12 containing calcium carbide, a chemical used for fertiliser production and steelmaking. The vessel also contained some 370 tonnes of fuel and oil.
“The Coast Guard is taking action to prevent the spread of oil using two ships,” Kerala´s government said in a statement. “The work of spraying dust to destroy the oil is in progress using a Dornier aircraft”.
India´s defence ministry said the ship sank “due to flooding” some 38 nautical miles southwest of Kochi, raising concerns for the “sensitive marine ecosystem along Kerala´s coast”.
The government has put coastal areas on high alert and warned people not to touch or approach any containers -- some of which have already washed up along the coast. The ship was sailing between the Indian ports of Vizhinjam and Kochi when it ran into trouble on Saturday and issued a distress call.

Protests grip BD as pressure mounts on Yunus-led government,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315676-protests-grip-bd-as-pressure-mounts-on-yunus-led-government,"DHAKA: Primary school teachers in Bangladesh joined public sector workers in protests against the interim government on Monday amid growing discontent and political uncertainty in the South Asian country.
Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, 84, took over as interim head of the country of 173 million last August after deadly student-led protests forced then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to flee to India.
Yunus’ administration has faced pressure from civil servants, teachers, political parties and the military as the caretaker government attempts to guide the country through a fragile transition before holding a general election. The government issued an ordinance on Sunday allowing the Ministry of Public Administration to dismiss public servants for misconduct without lengthy procedures, sparking outrage across the bureaucracy.
Government employees continued their demonstrations for a third consecutive day on Monday, calling the ordinance “repressive” and demanding its immediate withdrawal. In the face of protests by the employees of National Board of Revenue, the interim government was forced on Sunday to withdraw an order to dissolve the tax body and replace it with two divisions under the finance ministry.

Putin threatens to ‘throttle’ Western firms remaining in Russia,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315679-putin-threatens-to-throttle-western-firms-remaining-in-russia,"MOSCOW: Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday threatened to “throttle” Western firms remaining in Russia and acting against its interests, as part of Moscow´s effort to beef up domestic software development.
“We need to throttle them. I completely agree, and I say this without hesitation,” he said in response to a businessman´s call to curb the activities of US tech companies Zoom and Microsoft, which currently provide only limited services in Russia.
Many Western firms left Russia or significantly wound down their activities in the country after Moscow launched its military offensive on Ukraine, prompting a barrage of economic sanctions from Ukraine´s allies.
“We haven´t kicked anyone out...we have provided the most favourable conditions for them to work in our market, and they are trying to throttle us,” the Russian president said at a meeting with entrepreneurs, without providing details on how the Western companies were damaging Russia.
“We must respond in kind, mirror their actions,” added the Russian president, who has significantly tightened exit conditions for companies seeking to leave Russia, forcing many to sell their assets at steep discounts.
There has been growing media speculation that some companies might consider a comeback amid US President Donald Trump´s efforts to reset relations with Russia and achieve a fast peace in Ukraine.

"India, Canada move to mend diplomatic ties",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315680-india-canada-move-to-mend-diplomatic-ties,"NEW DELHI: India´s foreign minister said he had spoken to his Canadian counterpart as the two sides seek to ease fraught relations.
The telephone call, which took place late on Sunday, is the highest diplomatic contact between Ottawa and New Delhi since Mark Carney became Canadian prime minster in March.Ties between Canada and India were strained following accusations of New Delhi´s involvement in the 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh, claims India denied.
India´s Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he had “discussed the prospects of India-Canada ties” with newly appointed Foreign Minister Anita Anand and he had “wished her a very successful tenure”.
Anand, whose parents hailed from India, said on X she looked forward “strengthening Canada-India ties, deepening our economic cooperation, and advancing shared priorities”.
Canada is home to the largest Sikh community outside of India and includes activists for “Khalistan”, a fringe separatist movement seeking an independent state for the religious minority carved out of Indian territory.Ottawa previously accused India of orchestrating the 2023 killing in Vancouver of 45-year-old naturalised Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a prominent Khalistan campaigner, and targeting other Sikh activists connected to the movement.India has repeatedly dismissed the allegations, which sent diplomatic relations into freefall, with both nations last year expelling a string of top diplomats.

"EU, UK should not use Balkans as migrant ‘warehouse’: rights group",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315681-eu-uk-should-not-use-balkans-as-migrant-warehouse-rights-group,"BELGRADE: Britain and the European Union should stop trying to use the Balkans as a “warehouse for migrants”, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Monday, adding to debate over the use of third-country “return hubs” for asylum seekers.
The EU and UK have both made moves toward processing would-be immigrants outside their borders, seeking to deal with a surge in arrivals that has become a hot-button political issue. The EU moved in March to allow members to process migrants outside the 27-nation bloc´s borders, and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced his government had opened talks with multiple countries on setting up “return hubs” for rejected asylum seekers to await deportation.
He did not name the countries, but the Balkans look like a probable partner. Starmer made the announcement during a visit to Albania -- which already hosts migrant return centres for Italy -- and his government has recently unveiled a six-billion-euro investment package in North Macedonia. “Instead of treating the Balkans as a warehouse for migrants, the EU and the UK could play an important role in supporting the development of functioning asylum systems and better frameworks for the protection of the rights of migrants,” HRW said.

Austria deports Chechens who risk recruitment in Ukraine war,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315682-austria-deports-chechens-who-risk-recruitment-in-ukraine-war,"VIENNA: Austria is deporting Chechen asylum seekers on security grounds back to Russia, where they risk being forcibly recruited to fight in the Ukraine war, court documents seen by AFP show.
Authorities say they pose a “state security” threat but rights groups say their deportation is a violation of international law. Amnesty International has repeatedly urged European countries to halt the expulsion of asylum seekers and refugees from the Muslim-majority republic in Russia, saying it “violates international human rights obligations”.
Chechen exiles say they are unfairly associated with religious extremism. Austria this year expelled two Chechens who had applied for asylum after receiving summons to report to the Russian military for conscription.
Vienna argued that they were not under a “credible” threat of being drafted. According to Austrian authorities, both applicants are too old to be conscripted, which they say only applies to Russian men aged 18-30 -- a claim disputed by rights groups.
Officials also claimed that they could “escape mobilisation... by settling in Moscow”. Based on “the results of police investigations into terrorism” and religious extremism, the Chechens “would undoubtedly threaten national security” if they remain on Austrian soil, authorities argued, without providing details.
Since commercial flights between the EU and Russia were cut by sanctions over Russia´s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the expulsions are being carried out by aeroplane via Serbia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
Austria does not publish detailed statistics on the expulsions of Chechens, who are either Russian citizens or stateless. The Austrian interior ministry did not respond to queries by AFP. While there has been no cooperation with Russia since its invasion of Ukraine, Austria “takes Moscow´s lack of response to its deportation notices as silent approval”, according to the documents.
To many Austrians, “Chechen automatically means terrorist”, complained Rosa Dunaeva, a Chechen activist based in Vienna. She said Chechens are also targeted because they “rarely have the means to pay for a lawyer” to defend themselves.
But “authorities are well aware, throughout Europe, that those who are deported can be recruited to fight in Ukraine” if their families do not pay a large sum of money, Dunaeva claimed, “whether they are 18 or 60 years old”.
In 2006, the EU concluded an agreement with Russia facilitating the return of convicted suspects. Despite Brussels´s opposition to Moscow´s invasion of Ukraine, Austria has never called the accord into question.
Following the murder of a schoolteacher in France by a Chechen refugee in 2020, Austria set up a special police unit to monitor its Chechen community. Extraditions were speeded up after Austria suffered its first jihadist attack, also in 2020.
In 2024, Amnesty International called on Europe to stop returning people to states in the North Caucasus such as Chechnya due to “the new threat of mobilisation in the armed forces”.
The human rights situation in Chechnya is so severe “that the families are afraid to make those cases public”, Natalia Prilutskaya, a specialist on Russia at the NGO, told AFP.
“There is no safe space for returnees anywhere in Russia,” she said. Mobilisation concerns all men “considered to be in reserve, aged up to 70 years old”. The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) condemned France in 2022 for deporting Chechens to Russia, citing article three of the European Convention, which prohibits torture.
Protection under that treaty cannot be waived “even in the event of public danger” or “links with a terrorist organisation”, it said. Some 250,000 Chechen exiles live in Europe. Austria -- a country of 9.2 million -- is home to between 30,000 and 40,000 of them, according to official statistics: the largest Chechen diaspora community per capita. The small North Caucasus republic was ravaged by wars from the 1990s and is now controlled by Kremlin loyalist Ramzan Kadyrov, who has suppressed all opposition.

India’s monsoon lashes Mumbai as rains arrive early,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315683-india-s-monsoon-lashes-mumbai-as-rains-arrive-early,"MUMBAI: Lashing rains swamped India´s financial capital Mumbai on Monday as the annual monsoon arrived some two weeks earlier than usual, according to weather forecasters.
Heavy rains cooling temperatures -- welcomed by farmers for their crops but which cause havoc each year in cities by flooding transport infrastructure -- are normally expected in the southwestern state of Maharashtra in early June.
The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) warned of “extremely heavy rainfall” in Mumbai and the city authorities said a red alert had been issued until Tuesday. “All citizens are advised to stay indoors and avoid travel unless necessary” the city authorities said in a statement, urging people to “kindly cooperate”.
The IMD said in a statement that the rains had advanced to Mumbai on Monday, “16 days earlier than usual”, with rains usually expected around June 11, the earliest for nearly a quarter century. “This marks the earliest monsoon advancement over Mumbai during the period 2001-2025”, it said.
Across the wider state of Maharashtra, IMD weather chief in the region Shubhangi Bhute said it was the earliest the rains had arrived for 14 years. South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting the highly complex monsoon. The southwest monsoon is a colossal sea breeze that brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall between June and September every year.

"Trump says US wants to make tanks, not T-shirts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315684-trump-says-us-wants-to-make-tanks-not-t-shirts,"MORRISTOWN, New Jersey: US President Donald Trump said on Monday his tariff policy was aimed at promoting the domestic manufacturing of tanks and technology products, not sneakers and T-shirts.
Speaking to reporters before boarding Air Force One in New Jersey, Trump said he agreed with comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on April 29 that the US does not necessarily need a “booming textile industry” - comments that drew criticism from the National Council of Textile Organisations.
“We’re not looking to make sneakers and T-shirts. We want to make military equipment. We want to make big things. We want to make, do the AI thing,” Trump said. “I’m not looking to make T-shirts, to be honest. I’m not looking to make socks. We can do that very well in other locations. We are looking to do chips and computers and lots of other things, and tanks and ships,” Trump said. The American Apparel & Footwear Association said in response to Trump’s remarks that tariffs were not good for the industry.
“With 97 percent of the clothes and shoes we wear being imported, and with clothes and shoes already the most highly tariffed industry in the US, we need to focus on common sense solutions that can move the needle,” AAFA President Steve Lamar said in a statement. “More tariffs will only mean higher input costs for US manufacturers and higher prices that will hurt lower income consumers.” Trump, who has upended world markets with the broad imposition of tariffs, revived his harsh trade rhetoric on Friday when he pushed for a 50 percent tariff on European Union goods starting June 1 and warned Apple AAPL.O he may impose a 25 percent levy on all imported iPhones bought by US consumers.

Wilders threatens to torpedo Dutch govt over asylum rules,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315685-wilders-threatens-to-torpedo-dutch-govt-over-asylum-rules,"THE HAGUE: Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders threatened on Monday to bring down the shaky coalition governing the Netherlands if his demands for tougher immigration measures were not met “within a few weeks”.
After running out clear winner in November 2023 elections, the far-right Freedom Party (PVV) led by Wilders has the most MPs in the coalition and could force a political crisis and fresh election if it withdrew.
At a hastily arranged news conference, Wilders told reporters: “Our patience has now run out. The voters who made the PVV the largest party have the right to a cabinet that delivers.” He set out a series of demands he said should be implemented “within a few weeks at most”.
If the changes were insufficient in his view or if nothing changed “then we are off”, he warned. “So something has to change quickly in our country,” he said. Summarising his demands, he said: “Close the borders for asylum seekers and family reunifications. No more asylum centres opened. Close them.”
“Tens of thousands of Syrians should go back to their own country. And if you as a foreigner seriously overstep the mark here and misbehave, then you should leave the country.” He set out a 10-point plan, including border closures for asylum-seekers, tougher border controls, and deporting dual nationals convicted of a crime.
“The PVV has been very reasonable and patient over the past year but as of today, the gloves are off.” He acknowledged that some measures would take more than a few weeks to implement fully but he called for the necessary decisions to be taken within that timeframe.
Wilders has frequently brandished the threat to pull out from the coalition but the government led by Prime Minister Dick Schoof has survived until now. The PVV won 37 seats in the 150-seat parliament in elections, by far the largest party.

Nordic nations ‘in solidarity’ with Greenland after US threats,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315686-nordic-nations-in-solidarity-with-greenland-after-us-threats,"TURKU, Finland: Nordic nations stand “in solidarity” with Denmark and Greenland amid US President Donald Trump´s threats to seize the autonomous Danish territory, Norway´s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said on Monday.
Trump has repeatedly said the US needs the strategically located, resource-rich Arctic island for security reasons, and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it. “You can be fully certain that we stand by you and by Denmark in solidarity,” Store told Greenland´s prime minister at a meeting of Nordic prime ministers in Turku, Finland.
“We will say this message everywhere, if it´s asked in Washington or Brussels or Beijing or everywhere else,” he said. “The Arctic is a regulated area. The Law of the Sea applies, the responsibility of coastal states applies, and we will stand by any community that is feeling pressure on those values,” Store said.
Danish and Greenlandic leaders have insisted that the autonomous territory, where a majority are in favour of independence in the long term, must decide its own future, and have repeatedly said Washington “will never get Greenland”.

Sweden mulls revoking citizenship of dual national gang members,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315687-sweden-mulls-revoking-citizenship-of-dual-national-gang-members,"STOCKHOLM: Sweden´s government said on Monday it was looking into ways of revoking citizenship of dual nationals convicted in organised crime and gang cases.
“It should be possible to withdraw citizenship over crimes that occur within the framework of criminal networks and which seriously harm the state´s vital interests,” Migration Minister Johan Forssell told reporters.
The Scandinavian country, once known for its low crime rates, has struggled for years to rein in organised crime. Criminal networks are involved in drug trafficking, human smuggling, weapons trade and welfare fraud, with regular shootings and bombings across the country in recent years.
The gangs are also reported to have infiltrated Sweden´s welfare sector, local politics, legal and education system and juvenile detention care. The government said around 1,100 people linked to criminal gangs in Sweden hold dual nationality, citing data from the police.
The centre-right government, backed in parliament by the far-right Sweden Democrats, previously launched a review to see if it would be possible to revoke citizenship and expel people under certain specific circumstances.
A first review presented on January 15 concluded that Sweden should be able to withdraw citizenship from a dual national if the person obtained it by fraudulent means, such as providing false or incomplete information.
