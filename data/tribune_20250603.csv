Iran poised to dismiss US nuclear proposal,"US
Washington demands Tehran scrap uranium enrichment and ship stockpile abroad
Iran is poised to reject a US proposal to end a decades-old nuclear dispute, an Iranian diplomat said on Monday, dismissing it as a ""non-starter"" that fails to address Tehran's interests or soften Washington's stance on uranium enrichment.
""Iran is drafting a negative response to the US proposal, which could be interpreted as a rejection of the US offer"", the senior diplomat, who is close to Iran's negotiating team, told Reuters.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was on a short visit to Tehran and has been mediating talks between Tehran and Washington.
After five rounds of discussions between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, several obstacles remain.
Among them are Iran's rejection of a US demand that it commit to scrapping uranium enrichment and its refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium -- possible raw material for nuclear bombs.
Tehran says it wants to master nuclear technology for peaceful purposes and has long denied accusations by Western powers that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
""In this proposal, the US stance on enrichment on Iranian soil remains unchanged, and there is no clear explanation regarding the lifting of sanctions,"" said the diplomat, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Araqchi said Tehran would formally respond to the proposal soon. The US State Department declined to comment. Tehran demands the immediate removal of all US-imposed curbs that impair its oil-based economy. But the US says nuclear-related sanctions should be removed in phases.
Dozens of institutions vital to Iran's economy, including its central bank and national oil company, have been blacklisted since 2018 for, according to Washington, ""supporting terrorism or weapons proliferation"".
Trump's revival of ""maximum pressure"" against Tehran since his return to the White House in January has included tightening sanctions and threatening to bomb Iran if the negotiations yield no deal.
During his first term in 2018, Trump ditched Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy. Iran responded by escalating enrichment far beyond the pact's limits. Reuters

"Pakistan eyes 8,000MW target with Chashma-5 project","PK
Work progressing rapidly on 1,200MW plant; PAEC, CNNC joint effort underway
The under-construction Chashma-5 Nuclear Power Plant is expected to contribute 1,200 megawatts (MW) of clean, safe, and low-cost electricity to the national grid.
Chashma Nuclear Power Complex General Manager Engineer Habibur Rehman made these remarks while briefing a group of journalists at the Chashma Nuclear Complex.
Informing that the project was advancing swiftly, he said that Pakistan was working towards enhancing its nuclear power generation capacity to 8,000MW, aiming to make nuclear energy a dependable component of the country's sustainable and affordable energy mix.
On the occasion, media representatives toured several operational and under-construction units of the facility, where they were briefed on plant performance, safety protocols, technical systems, and environmental standards.
Engineer Habibur Rehman noted that Pakistan currently ranked among the top 20 nuclear power-producing countries globally, operating six nuclear reactors with a combined generation capacity of 3,530MW.
The figure is projected to rise to 4,730 MW following the completion of Chashma-5, he added.
He explained that the Chashma-5 project was based on the advanced Hualong One (HPR1000) design, a third-generation pressurised water reactor.
The plant was being developed in collaboration with the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC). The project's first concrete was poured on December 30, 2024.
Highlighting global trends, he noted that nuclear power was regaining international attention.
Several developed nations, including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, and South Korea, which had previously scaled back or planned to phase out nuclear power, were now re-engaging with the sector and actively building new nuclear plants.
The general manager said that nuclear energy offered a cost-effective, safe, and environmentally friendly electricity source. In calendar year 2024, nuclear power accounted for roughly 13% of Pakistan's total electricity supply. In December 2024 alone, its share peaked at around 26.5%.

Luari Sharif shrine dispute echoes in Badin,"RO
The armed men wanted to stop the press conference.
A group of men, allegedly associated with one of the contested custodians of the Luari Sharif shrine in Badin district, reportedly assaulted journalists by attacking Badin Press Club on Monday.
The club's president stated that armed men forcefully entered the club at a time when some people belonging to an opposing group of the custodians were addressing a press conference. The armed men wanted to stop the press conference.
He said that the armed men climbed the club's walls to enter the place. He, however, felt relieved that the attackers could not get close to Mir Tariq Talpur and others who were speaking at the press conference.
Talpur's group is said to be at loggerheads with Pir Muhammad Sadiq Qureshi's group. Memon lamented that though the police promptly reached the club on their complaint, they stood as spectators instead of trying to control the situation.
Separately, a meeting of journalists at the club denounced the attack and demanded immediate action against the attackers by arresting them and charging them in an FIR under provisions of the Anti Terrorism Act.
Though the incident's FIR could not be registered by the evening, police detained at least seven people who have been blamed for the assault.

England beat West Indies to clinch ODI series,"US
Joe Root registered career-best 166 not out
Joe Root scored his 18th One-Day International century and became England's leading run-scorer in the format when the hosts beat West Indies by three wickets on Sunday to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match ODI series.
Root's masterly 166 off 139 balls helped England, who won the first ODI by 238 runs at Edgbaston, chase down a target of 309 at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff.
Root, 34, overtook Eoin Morgan to become England's leading ODI run-scorer and also the first Englishman to score more than 7,000 runs in the format.
The victory also ensured England's new era under Harry Brook began on a flying note. He succeeded Jos Buttler after the wicketkeeper-batter stepped down following their group stage exit from the ICC Champions Trophy.
""As long as I have the motivation, want to get better every day, want to be there at the end, you are always adding to the group,"" Root said.
""If I keep contributing, I will keep putting myself forward.""
After winning the toss and electing to bowl, England made an early breakthrough to make it 6-1 by claiming the wicket of 18-year-old opener Jewel Andrew (0), before Brandon King and Keacy Carty put on a run-a-ball 141-run stand to calm West Indies' nerves.
Spinner Adil Rashid broke the partnership when King (59) holed out to long-off, and all-rounder Will Jacks struck to end Carty's fluent knock of 103 off 105 balls, reducing West Indies to 205-3.
Carty was dropped twice - on one and 41 - and also survived a few run-out chances, before going on to punish the England bowlers by notching his fourth ODI century.
But Rashid continued to shine with the ball, trapping Shimron Hetmyer (4) lbw and finishing with figures of 4-63 to become England's highest wicket-taking spinner across formats.
'Fell away'
West Indies lost wickets at regular intervals, but captain and wicketkeeper-batter Shai Hope (78) and Justin Greaves (22) came to their rescue, helping the visitors to a total of 308 all out in 47.4 overs.
England opened their run chase in disastrous fashion, reduced to 2-2 after both openers, Jamie Smith and Ben Duckett, were dismissed for ducks.
Dropped on 30 by Hope off the bowling of Jayden Seales, Brook went on to make 47 as he tried to stabilise their innings before falling to Alzarri Joseph, who ended with figures of 4-31.
With Buttler out for a duck and Jacob Bethell trapped lbw, Root anchored the innings, putting together a 143-run partnership with Jacks (49).
But after Brydon Carse (2) was dismissed, Rashid (10) provided Root help on the other end as England chased down the target with seven balls to spare.
""We certainly did (lose our way),"" Hope said. ""With the position we were in around that 35-over mark, we should have put on 30 to 40 more runs at least.
""But we just fell away at the end and didn't give ourselves the best chance of dominating the game with the bat.
""I have to commend the bowlers for the fight they showed to keep us in the game. They fought until the end."" The final ODI will be played at The Oval in London on Tuesday.

UK judge convicts man over blasphemy,"US
State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book.
A Turkish-born man who desecrated the holy Quran in London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.
Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted blasphemous remarks as he desecrated the holy Quran outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13.
District Judge John McGarva at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour ""within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress"".
He was motivated by ""hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam"", said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.
""Your actions in burning the Koran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,"" said the judge.
State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book. AFP

Polish nationalist wins presidency,"US
In a victory for European conservatives inspired by US President Donald Trump
Nationalist opposition candidate Karol Nawrocki narrowly won Poland's presidential election, results showed on Monday, delivering a big blow to the centrist government's efforts to cement Warsaw's pro-European orientation.
In a victory for European conservatives inspired by US President Donald Trump, Nawrocki secured 50.89% of the vote, election commission data showed. The outcome presages more political gridlock as he is likely to use his presidential veto to thwart Prime Minister Donald Tusk's liberal policy agenda.
Nawrocki's rival, Rafal Trzaskowski, Tusk's ruling Civic Coalition (KO) candidate, had declared victory immediately after the publication of an exit poll late on Sunday that showed the result would be very close. ""I'm sorry that I didn't manage to convince the majority of citizens of my vision of Poland,"" Trzaskowski said on X. ""I congratulate Karol Nawrocki on
winning the presidential election."" Reuters

Immediate resumption of cellular services ordered,"US
DC, SSP warned of legal action against non-compliance of court orders
The Civil Judge and Judicial Magistrate I, Moro, Madad Ali Khoso, while taking exception to non-compliance with his May 31 order, directed the government to immediately resume the cellular network services.
The services were suspended in Moro taluka after May 20 clash between the police and the nationalist workers in Noushehero Feroze district, which claimed lives of two young men.
""The respondents (government) are directed to remove public nuisance and immediately restore all mobile networks,"" the order reads. The authorities had suspended mobile networks in Moro; surrounded Bijarani-Laghari village whose two residents were killed in the clash and also recently enforced section 144 to ban gatherings of people in Moro.
The measures were taken to prevent people from organising protests or road blockades, according to the officials. The judge warned the deputy commissioner, SSP and other officers in the district that disobedience will entail legal action against them.
The order has been given in a petition filed by five residents of Moro including Qadir Bux Korai, Pir Andal, Abdul Karim Kalhoro, Majid Hussain Zardari and Jam Shahnawaz Korejo.
The same court had on May 31 passed an identical order even though the SSP in his report had contended that the law and order situation in Moro necessitated suspension of the cellular phone services.
The judge noted that around a million people in Moro taluka and its surrounding areas and villages suffered due to the suspension of the service. Students, people earning from online trades, banks and other businesses were also immensely suffering. ""The respondents haven't brought any substantial proof regarding the law and order situation,"" the judge observed.
On May 20 the nationalist workers tried to block the national highway by staging a sit-in protest against construction of six new canals on the Indus River and the corporate farming.
The police, however, tried to prevent the blockage of the highway. The authorities alleged that the workers in reaction attacked the house of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar in protest and set it partially on fire.
The protesters alleged that the police opened fire on them killing Zahid Laghari and Irfan Ali Laghari, who died in a hospital in Hyderabad after fighting for life for four days.

Biker assaulted in front of sister; influential tormentor held,"US
The boy's bike had put a scratch on the luxury car of the media mogul.
In another incident of lawlessness in the metropolis, siblings from the impoverished Marwari Lane area of Ranchhore Lines were subjected to violence by an influential businessman, Salman Farooq, and his guards after a minor traffic accident.
The attack was caught on video and went viral on social media leading to Farooqi's arrest in DHA by the Gizri police.
The incident unfolded following a collision between a motorcycle and a car.
The boy's bike had put a scratch on the luxury car of the media mogul.
In viral footage, Salman Farooqi, owner of Bionic Films, is seen holding the hands of a young man named Dhun Raj while his bodyguards, inside the vehicle, violently slapping him.
Dhun Raj's sister, Kalpana, is seen and heard pleading for mercy with folded hands, begging Farooqi to stop the beating and humiliation l. Her pleas were ignored, and the man intoxicated with power continued to pound the boy from the vulnerable minority community.
Kalpana reportedly works at a nearby beauty parlour and was being picked up by her brother on Saturday night when the incident occurred. The video, filmed on a mobile phone, triggered public outrage online, forcing law enforcement to act.
DIG South confirmed that Farooqi was arrested in connection with the public assault near Ittehad Commercial in DHA Phase VI. An FIR was registered at the Gizri police station under case number 25/278, based on the complaint of eyewitness Muhammad Saleem.
The FIR includes charges of issuing death threats, physical assault, harassment of a woman, and verbal abuse.
According to the FIR, Saleem had gone to Ittehad Commercial on May 31, where he witnessed a minor accident between a Land Cruiser and a motorcycle. Farooqi, identified by onlookers, allegedly ordered his armed guard and driver to trap the motorcyclist inside the vehicle at gunpoint, beat him, and hurl threats and abuse.
The altercation reportedly stemmed from the motorcyclist braking suddenly. Bystanders filmed the disturbing scene, and the footage quickly spread across social media platforms.
The complaint accuses Farooqi and his associates of violating the dignity of the motorcyclist and his sister through physical and verbal abuse and demands strict legal action.

Alizeh Shah is not letting criticism slide,"IE
Actor defends her wardrobe against trolls
In a recent Instagram Story, Alizeh Shah hit back at netizens who criticise her dressing. ""Let's get one thing clear. I've worn sleeveless clothes, shorts, and skirts since I was a child. It's how I was raised,"" she said.
The actor added that her mother never forced her to follow ""outdated ideas"" of how a girl should dress. ""[My mother] never imposed tradition on me. She raised me with love, not limitations. She saw me for the child I was, and the emotional, expressive woman I was becoming,"" Alizeh said.
The Taqdeer actor questioned the recent upsurge of outrage directed at her, expressing confusion over why it is happening now. She wondered if these reactions were prompted by her being honest about her dressing and not complying with someone else's standards of who she must be.
""This isn't about clothes. It's about control,"" she said. ""I'm not here to be anyone's idea of 'acceptable'. I've worked for everything I have, and I don't need your permission. What's truly disturbing isn't my appearance - it's the obsession with tearing someone down just because they're visible. If my confidence bothers you, maybe ask yourself why.""
Slamming double standards, Alizeh asserted that those who point out faults in women online must stop engaging with content from actors and influencers overall.
""Islam teaches us to reflect on our own actions before judging others. Telling a woman she must wear a burqa or leave her profession is not your role,"" she said. ""Everyone is accountable to Allah, not to public opinion. Let people work and live with dignity. This world is hard enough - especially for women - so instead of policing them, focus on your own path.""

'Nursing hospitals not meeting standards',"PK
Minister claims 15 medical colleges were registered during PTI's rule without inspection
A parliamentary panel was told on Monday that fifteen medical colleges were registered without any inspection during the PTI's rule while none of the 55 nursing colleges recently visited by the health secretary were eligible for accreditation.
Minister of State for National Health Services Dr Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on National Health that 55 nursing colleges were recently visited.
""According to the report [submitted by the health secretary], not a single college was found eligible for accreditation. A detailed report is being prepared by the Pakistan Nursing Council,"" he added. During the committee meeting, chaired by Mahesh Malani, Abdul Qadir Patel authorized Dr Shazia Sobia to discuss the Pharmacy Bill on his behalf. Patel said as soon as the PPP came into power, it transferred the authority related to the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) to the provinces so they could conduct their own tests.
""However, the provinces were not prepared at the time, which is why tests could not be conducted immediately. We want the provinces to carry out their own enlistments,"" he said.
The committee chairman referred to the complaints from students of Al-Nafees Medical College regarding non-registration. Dr Bharath reiterated that 15 medical colleges were registered during the PTI's term without inspection, and their cases have been sent to the Federal Investigation Agency.
The executive director of the National Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine (NIRM) told the panel that the institute had now started surgeries for correcting clubfoot in children.
""NIRM has a medical budget of Rs40 million, which is very low. Due to this, patients often have to purchase medicines. However, we ensure that epilepsy medications are never out of stock,"" he said. The committee expressed concerns over the inadequate medicine budget and emphasized that it should be increased. It announced plans to visit the institute and make recommendations to the government.
In Punjab, medicines are provided free of charge through the health cards system but even poor patients in some areas are forced to purchase them. It was suggested that Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal should be used to provide medicines to deserving patients.RAYZA KHAN

As Arshad Nadeem bags another gold medal, stars and fans celebrate online
Remember a time when your happiness was directly linked to cricket? Fortunately for those whose mood is entirely dependent on the sporting achievements of others, cricket no longer has to bear that burden alone. Now, thanks to Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem, Pakistani glory and joy is best channelled through the man's right arm, as the athlete spearheaded his way to another gold medal in the men's javelin final with an 86.40m throw at the Asian Athletics Championship in Gumi, South Korea on Saturday.
As Arshad proved in spades during the Paris 2024 Olympics, powering his way to golden glory following an epic 92.7m toss of his javelin, he has become a mascot for national pride. With an inevitable rendition of Dil Dil Pakistan (our de facto shot of joy) echoing through the stadium as South Korea's small Pakistani community cheered him on, the wave of tears and celebrations spreading throughout Arshad's hometown of Mian Channu showcased his already cemented heroic status. Arshad has done what few other Pakistani sportsmen have managed: he has proved that the Olympic victory that catapulted him to global fame last year was no shot-in-the-dark fluke.
Becoming the first Pakistani in 50 years to win a gold medal at the Asian Asian Athletics Championship, Arshad's latest achievement has spread a warm glow of contentment in its wake as the rest of the country shares in the vicarious joys of one man. It will come as little surprise that a handful of celebrities, too, have entered the fray as they ping congratulatory messages for Pakistan's athlete of the hour on social media.
Celebs say well done
Barzakh star Sanam Saeed took to her Instagram Stories to post a screenshot of Arshad's winning shot, tagging in the athlete and adding just one word: ""Hero"". Not to be outdone, Sanam's husband, actor and director Mohib Mirza, also registered his praise, taking to IG Stories to offer his own congratulations in Urdu as he penned, ""Salaam hai, Bhai."" Continuing in Urdu, he added, ""Amazing!""
With IG Stories clearly being the preferred medium of choice and short and sweet being the motto, actor-singer Azaan Sami Khan posted a similar victorious photo of Arshad socials. Unlike Sanam and Mohib, Azaan did not use words; instead, he relied on a simple crown emoji underneath as he, along with the rest of the nation, metaphorically labelled Arshad the undisputed king of javelin. If a picture says a thousand words, so can an emoji.
Proving that the javelin has well and truly entered the popular consciousness, possibly overtaking cricket for however long Arshad's career continues, singer-songwriter Farhan Saeed also turned to IG Stories to publicly mark his pride at the sportsman's latest milestone. Pasting a screenshot of a sports headline, Farhan's post read, ""Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem wins gold at [the] Asian Athletics Championship, defeating Indian competitor in [the] men's javelin final."" The musician sealed his post with just one more word that summed it all up: ""Congratulations."" As the icing on the cake, the Maula singer added a Pakistani flag emoji.
Everyone else joins in
Before the 2024 Paris Olympics, you would have been hard pressed to find a bystander knowing or caring enough about the javelin beyond the fact that it is a large, heavy pointy stick – but of course, Arshad changed all that with one mighty throw and awakened a frenzy in a country where frenzy was typically reserved for team sports, and not track and field. Now, of course, all it takes is one post from Arshad himself for a newfound crew of javelin lovers to flood social media with their words of praise.
Taking to X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, Arshad himself posted a reel of his performance and wrote, ""This victory belongs to the Almighty first - His blessings, His will. Without His grace, none of this would be possible.""
Remembering to thank his crew and loved ones not unlike any athlete would in a post-victory press conference (for social media has surely become an extension of press conferences for any successful athlete), Arshad remembered to add, ""To my coaches, my team, my family, and every Pakistani who prayed for methis medal is yours. Your support fuels my journey. Let's keep rising for our beloved nation! Insha'Allah, more to come.""
Racking up over 114,000 likes in just a day on Instagram (and over 19,000 hearts on X), the comments section of Arshad's posts are now replete with messages of congratulations from his followers.
""Pakistan's Ronaldo,"" penned one fan fondly, as another wrote on X, ""What a legend. Congratulations."" Pinning all hopes for the country on Arshad's capable shoulders (or rather, his right arm), yet another fan on Instagram noted, ""King never disappoints us. You are inspiring multiple generations with the accolades you bring to your nation.""
A dig at India
With Arshad's direct opponent, Sachin Yadav of India, walking away with a silver medal, it would be inconceivable that no one would bring up this irresistibly juicy fact in the comments section – although the highlight should go to one refreshingly un-salty Indian fan intent on spreading positivity.
""Arshad Nadeem is number 1, with love from India!"" wrote the fan alongside an Indian flag emoji.
""Finally Indians have admitted that they lost the war,"" added another fan, unable to resist bringing up the events of May still fresh in everyone's minds.
Predictably, Pakistani fans, with their expertise in using memes to extract maximum hilarity in any situation, rose to the occasion – yes, even here where no humour was needed to act as a bandaid. The ""disappointed cricket fan"" meme (featuring the infamously appalled man in a chequered shirt and gilet turning away in disgust) made its usual appearance in Arshad's comments section, with a fan added the explanatory caption (in case you missed it), ""The entire Indian community right now.""
Is it fair to hold one man – Arshad – responsible for collective national happiness? As any cricketer will tell you, there is only one answer here (and it is not ""yes""). But what nobody can dispute is that king of javelin throwers that he is, Arshad aims for the heart of the nation. And so far, he hasn't missed.

JAC demands Rs50b for university revival,"US
UoP staff warns of protest if higher education ignored
The Joint Action Committee (JAC) of Peshawar University has voiced strong concerns over the provincial government's persistent neglect of public universities.
During an emergency meeting chaired by JAC President Dr Zakirullah Jan, the committee demanded that the 2025-26 provincial budget allocate at least Rs50 billion for higher education.
This funding, the JAC stated, is critical for timely payment of salaries and pensions, restoration of research and academic activities, and ensuring universities progress on a developmental trajectory.
The meeting also included presidents and general secretaries of Class III, IV, and Sanitation Staff Associations. They warned that failure to meet these demands would result in a province-wide protest movement.
Under the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, the provincial government is responsible for adequate funding of the higher education sector. JAC leaders pointed out that provinces such as Punjab and Sindh have already taken this responsibility seriously and continue to provide consistent financial support to their universities.
However, K-P's government has neglected this constitutional duty.
Universities across the province face a severe financial crisis, causing administrative, academic, and financial challenges. Delays in salaries and pensions, halted research and development, and declining academic standards have become daily realities.
The JAC also urged newly appointed vice chancellors to break their silence and demand appropriate funding from the government, warning that their silence risks the future of higher education in the province.
Dr Zakirullah Jan concluded, ""We will not remain silent spectators while our educational institutions are being destroyed. The time for decisive action is now, and the ball is in the provincial government's court.""

Imran again refuses lie detector tests,"US
After Imran's refusal to cooperate in the investigation process, the teams had to return after a long wait.
Incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan on Monday refused to undergo lie detector test for the fourth time and a team comprising policemen and members of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency (PFSA) returned after waiting at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail for four hours.
An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore had allowed police to conduct the text on Imran in connection with cases filed against him and a number of PTI leaders after unprecedented incidents of vandalism in which dozens of army installations were attacked on May 9 and May 10 or 2023.
According to sources, a Lahore police investigation team led by DSP Asif Javed arrived at Adiala Jail at 12:45 pm to conduct a polygraph test, photogrammetric and voice matching tests.
Members of the PFSA were also part of the investigation team, including inspectors Muhammad Aslam, Tasaddaq, Saleem, and Naveed as well technical expert Abid Ayub.
Upon their arrival, the prison authorities informed the PTI founder, but he refused for the fourth time to join the investigation. Sources said Imran was informed that the investigation team had come with a court order, yet he again declined to undergo the tests.
After Imran's refusal to cooperate in the investigation process, the teams had to return after a long wait.
Earlier, Imran Khan had stipulated that he would only participate in the investigation and undergo the tests in the presence of his lawyers.
However, when the investigators returned with his legal counsel present, he provided a written response stating that Article 13 grants him protection from being compelled to become a witness against himself or assist in producing evidence that may be used against him.
Lahore ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill on May 14 allowed the police to conduct polygraphlie detectionand photogrammetricfacial and voice analysistests of Imran Khan in twelve May 9 cases.
The judge had ordered completion of the tests within 12 days, saying the prosecution might meet the PTI founder in Adiala Jail during that period.
Meanwhile, addressing a press conference in Lahore, PTI leadersSalman Akram Raja and Malik Ahmed Khansaid there is no restriction on Imran Khan's sons to return to Pakistan and participate in politics.
The PTI founder's sonsKasim and Suleimanhave remained throughout their lives in the United Kingdom with their mother--Imran's first wife Jemima Goldsmith
In a rare interview released on social media on May 13, Kasim and Sulaiman spoke about the alleged ""suppression of democracy"" in Pakistan and a lack of basic facilities for Imran Khan in his prison cell. They said their father was being kept in prison on ""trumped up charges.""
They also urged US President Donald Trump and the international community to help free their father from prison, appealing to ""people of influence"" around the world to press for his release. WITH INPUT FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT IN LAHORE

HSY keeps an open mind on Fawad, Hania criticism
In an interview with Ambreen Fatima, fashion designer Hassan Sheheryar Yasin (HSY) shared his views on the vitriol that actors like Fawad Khan and Hania Aamir received for not condemning India's war crimes as strongly as their fans hoped they would.
""The eyes are the windows to a man's soul. One must dig deep to figure out what someone's actual mindset and intentions are,"" HSY said. ""I know Fawad very well, and I know how much of a die-hard Pakistani he truly is. He's my friend.""
The designer also added Mahira Khan to his observation. ""Mahira, another friend of mine, is devoted to Pakistan. I know how much she works to promote the Pakistani sentiment and does what she can for those who cannot raise their own voices.""
Bringing up yet another showbiz friend, he continued, ""Hania is a relatively recent entry in the industry. I've seen her since the beginning of her career. I've also worked with her. We're friends and we share mutuals. Hania is very pro-Pakistan.""
HSY reckoned that the criticism was fuelled by a collective anger or passion that netizens have for showbiz. ""Those watching must believe that they are a part of a celebrity's life, and rightfully so because they are involved in everything, be it the movies or the promotions,"" he acknowledged.
HSY reasoned that, perhaps, the mentioned stars weren't able to express themselves as strongly as their fans were hoping they would. ""I can't say anything about that because your opinions are valid,"" he said. ""But I can vouch for my friends and safely say that they didn't intend to cause any hurt.""
The designer added that everyone can speculate as much as they want, but they won't have the answers to everything. In the same way, he can speak about Fawad at a friend's capacity, nothing less or more.
""I am aware of the public's disapproval of his statement,"" HSY said. ""Because he is my friend, I'll share my perception of him. But neither has anyone paid me to do so nor is this benefitting me in any way. HSY is going to remain HSY. But I can uplift someone else's truth because that's the right thing to do.""
He, however, reiterated that public criticisms weren't misplaced. ""Yes, the public's belief that celebrities should confidently speak out is valid. And we are the ones who should be taking that stand because every drop counts and makes one Pakistan, which is not a small thing. So wherever I am qualified to talk about Pakistan, I try to do so to the best of my abilities,"" he vowed.
What the stars said
Following India's aerial attack on Pakistani civilians last month, multiple local celebrities took to social media to condemn the aggression, stand in solidarity with the victims, and call out Indian celebrities who celebrated the loss of lives in Pakistan.
This included Mahira, who decried India's ""war and hate rhetoric"" and asserted that the Indian entertainment industry was claiming victory in fear-induced silence. ""To me, that silence is your greatest defeat. You attack cities in the middle of the night and call it a victory? Shame on you,"" she said.
Fawad, meanwhile, offered his deepest condolences to those injured and killed in ""this shameful attack"". Adding a prayer for the deceased and the bereaved, he said, ""A respectful request to all: stop stoking the flames with rabble-rousing words. It's not worth the lives of innocent people. May better sense prevail, InshaAllah. Pakistan Zindabad!""
Joining the chorus, Hania rued India's aggression with a heavy heart. ""A child is gone. Families are shattered. And for what? This is not how you protect anyone. This is cruelty - plain and simple. You don't get to bomb innocent people and call it a strategy. This isn't strength. This is shameful. This is cowardly. And we see you.""
Netizens criticised some of the artists for not outright naming India as the aggressor and upholding peaceful sentiments while Indian artists stood by their war-mongering narrative.

Punjab needs 19k new govt schools,"US
Report blames lack of access for dropout rate
Punjab is facing a shortage of government schools with 38,000 institutions available for a population of 130 million. According to a report of a non-governmental organisation, the Population Council, lack of infrastructure in the government schools and their unavailability are the top reasons of a high dropout rate.
The report declared that the province needs about 19,000 new schools during the coming 15 years and stressed that the Punjab government should allocate maximum funds in the coming budget to construct more schools.
While the increase in the population of Punjab has created many problems for the government, shortage of public sector schools has become a big issue that is hampering efforts to increase the literacy rate in the province.
The Population Council stated in its latest report that the shortage of government schools coupled with the population growth in the province is a matter of concern.
It highlighted the need of 19,000 new schools in the next 15 years to educate the millions of children.
While releasing the report, the council lamented a low budget for the children and demanded that the government should release ample funds for constructing schools and hospitals for them.
According to the report, there are 10 million children in the age group of five to 15 years out of school.
The population growth rate of the province is more than 2.5 per cent and the ratio demands that 19,000 more schools should be constructed in the next 15 years.
The teaching community is facing hurdles in bringing the out of school children to the government schools mainly because of the shortage of the institutions and lack of facilities.
A senior official of the Punjab School Education Department said there are about 38,000 government schools in the 36 districts of Punjab. Of them, 21,702 are primary, 7,200 middle, 8,000 high and 800 higher secondary schools. The official said the schools are facing a shortage of funds and facilities. Construction of new schools has not been a priority in a long period. The last new school in Lahore had been built in 2011.
He said there are many housing societies in Lahore and other cities where no government school is operating.
He said the government was pursuing the outsourcing of the government schools while ignoring the opposition to the policy by the teachers.
The official said the destitute people were suffering the most as there were 10 million children out of school who wanted to study but the government policies were not supportive for them.
Punjab Teachers Union Secretary General Rana Liaqat Ali, ""It is evident that there is a need for more public sector schools and this is the reason that we took to the roads to oppose the outsourcing, but the government did not considered our concerns.""
He added, ""Now international NGOs have also highlighted the issue and demanded more government schools, so we request the government to consider the matter in the interest of the future generations.
He said not only schools but new government colleges and universities were also needed in Punjab.
The teachers' leader expressed hope that the government would give priority to school projects in the coming budget for Punjab.

The polio paradox,"US
The armed assault on polio workers occurred on the final day of the year's third nationwide polio vaccination campaign
Even in 2025, the polio eradication campaign in Pakistan continues to struggle against rising cases and security threats as Northern Pakistan, specifically Gilgit-Baltistan, reports its first case of the wild poliovirus in almost 7 years. This was closely accompanied by news of an incident involving unknown armed men opening fire on a polio team in Diamer district. The proximity of these two reports does well to capture the country's fight against this virus that has been going on for over 30 years now. On one hand, you have a public health crisis worsening by the year. While on the other, you have a misinformed public actively resisting alleviation for all sorts of regressively traditional reasons.
The armed assault on polio workers occurred on the final day of the year's third nationwide polio vaccination campaign. Before opening fire, the men threatened the team against further attempts at vaccination campaigns. They opposed it as it was ""bringing [unveiled] women from Gilgit in the name of the polio campaign"" and ""ruining the environment"". Ostensibly, attacking a medical team working to provide basic humanitarian care for children does not fall under a 'ruined environment'.
Polio vaccination campaigns in Pakistan have long been under fire, both literally and figuratively, by various pseudo-scientific and religious groups. These groups claim that the vaccinations cause fatal medical problems and are a 'Western conspiracy'. Time and again, these claims have been officially refuted. The recent case of wild poliovirus has been identified in a 23-month-old child with a medical record of administered polio drops. But the child was not provided with post-birth vaccines.
This highlights the urgency for a deeply meticulous approach that leaves no ends untied. Pakistan needs not only sustained vaccination efforts, but also an approach that suppresses violent and misinformed actions. Without that, the lives of our nation's children remain at stake.

PTI decries Sialkot by-polls as rigged,"US
.
Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub and NA former speaker Asad Qaiser have criticized the ruling party for stealing a by-election held in the Sambrial area of Sialkot on Sunday in ""broad daylight"".
Addressing the media at the Parliament House on Monday, the PTI leaders claimed that the ""overwhelming victory"" of the PTI was a proof of the unshaken public support it enjoyed. Despite full federal and provincial backing, PML-N failed to win the seat, clearly reflecting their waning popularity, they added.
On Sunday, PML-N's Hina Arshad Warraich remained far ahead of the other candidates by securing 78,702 votes at PP-52 Sialkot by-elections, according to unofficial and incomplete results.
Both the PTI and the PPP later accused the PML-N of using coercive tactics to secure the victory.
Talking with reference to the by-elections, Omar said if the PML-N had truly been in a winning position, there would have been no need for the returning officers (ROs) to flee with ballot boxes.
He congratulated PTI Punjab's leadership and voters for their ""courageous stand"".
He denounced the ""shameful events"" in Sambrial, highlighting incidents of ballot boxes allegedly being stolen in broad daylight and policemen caught stamping ballots. Omar claimed that polling agents were denied access to polling stations and RO offices were sealed with containers.
Separately, Punjab Assembly Opposition Leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar and PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja held a joint press conference in Lahore in which they alleged that PTI polling agents were forcibly removed from several polling stations during the Sialkot by-polls.
""This election was not just an attack on the voters of Sambrial; it was an assault on the integrity of Pakistan's democratic process,"" Raja said. ""The relationship between the people and the state, as established by our Constitution, has been brokenfirst on February 8, 2024 and now again.""

Gunmen attack polio team in G-B
A polio validation survey team was attacked in Gilgit-Baltistan's Tangir district on Monday by armed men allegedly objecting to the presence of female staffers.
The team, deployed in Tangir, was returning after completing a two-day verification exercise for vaccination coverage when it was intercepted near Ric Bridge at approximately 2:45pm.
According to a FIR, two armed individuals blocked the team's vehicle and hurled verbal threats, accusing them of disturbing the region's ""cultural environment"" by bringing ""unveiled women from Gilgit"".
Earlier, the first case of wild poliovirus was reported in Diamer. The case, verified by the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at the National Institute of Health (NIH), is the eleventh confirmed case of wild poliovirus in the country so far in 2025.

PM orders third-party validation of reforms,"US
Shehbaz vows to lead Pakistan toward a stable economy
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed for third-party validation of ongoing initiatives and reforms in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) by internationally renowned companies, stressing that the government was determined to lead the country toward a stable economy through institutional reforms.
Chairing a review meeting of the FBR affairs, the prime minister noted that institutional reforms were progressing rapidly across all sectors and that all the government institutions were working tirelessly to eliminate corruption and addressing other deficiencies, such as a lack of transparency.
""The recent positive economic indicators are clear proof of the correct government policies,"" the prime minister told the meeting, attended by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, the FBR chairman, and senior officials from the relevant institutions.
Expressing satisfaction over the recent performance of the faceless customs assessment system, the prime minister highlighted that reforms such as the faceless customs assessment system were yielding promising results in maintaining transparency.
The prime minister received a briefing about the performance of the faceless customs assessment system and progress in the reforms in the Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited (PRAL). Officials said that a simplified digital tax return system for the general public would be implemented soon.
The implementation of the faceless customs assessment system has led to an overall increase in revenue and a significant reduction in customs clearance time, while the reform process in the PRAL is progressing rapidly, the meeting was informed.
The officials stated that efforts were under way to introduce the digital tax return system in Urdu and other local languages for the convenience of ordinary users. ""God willing, we will succeed in our struggle to make Pakistan economically stable,"" Prime Minister Shehbaz said, after the briefing.

Butchers in high demand ahead of Eid,"US
Many residents struggle to book skilled butchers, consider seasonal alternatives
With Eidul Azha less than a week away, the demand for skilled butchers in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) has surged significantly, driven by the spike in sacrificial animal slaughter during the Islamic festival.
While some residents have already purchased sacrificial animals, many are still in search of suitable livestock. In this scenario, the role of butchers is considered to be vital for chopping the meat. Keeping in view their importance and demand, professional butchers have also increased rates of preparing meat as compared to last year.
Khawar Shehzad, a butcher who also runs a meat shop in Islamabad's sector I-10, said that Eidul Azha is a special Islamic festival following the slaughtering of animals at a mass level, highlighting that everyone looked for professional butchers to chop their meat, which sparked high demand.
""On Eidul Azha everyone looks for a professional and skilled butcher for cutting their meat in a quality way; it is our peak season,"" he said.
Shehzad shared his slaughtering rates for this year, noting that cow slaughtering on the first day of Eid is priced at Rs25,000, while the rate drops to Rs20,000 on the second day.
By the third day, the cost ranges between Rs15,000 to Rs18,000, depending on demand.
The charges for goat and sheep sacrifices range from Rs6,000 to Rs7,000, he added. Other butchers, like Asmat Ullah, also quoted these same prices, emphasising high demand.
While the residents of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) are excited regarding the upcoming Eidul Azha festival, but they have also voiced concerns about rising animal prices and the steep charges for butchers.
Tariq Mahmood, a resident of the same sector who purchased his animal for slaughtering on Eid, said that he was trying to get the booking of a professional butcher for his meat preparation, who has high rates and high demand, adding, ""If I can't book one, I'll go with a seasonal one.""
According to Tariq, the seasonal butchers are more or less equally efficient and skilled, sharing his previous year's experience. Despite the facts that the demand for professional and skilled butchers is notably high, people somehow managed to find the suitable person to sacrifice their animal.
To help meet the growing demand, many butchers from across the country also travel to Islamabad during Eid. These visiting butchers often charge slightly lower rates and offer a practical solution to the shortage of skilled labour in the city during the Eid.
Their presence also provided them an opportunity to enhance their earning more than they typically have in their hometowns.

Call for action on marine turtle conservation,"US
WWF-Pakistan highlights issue on World Turtle Day
""Despite being recognised globally, marine turtles still struggle to receive the attention, funding, and space they deserve in broader marine policy and planning. Turtle conservation is most effective when it builds on what is already working on the ground, not when it imposes top-down models disconnected from reality"".
WWF-Pakistan stated this in its press release issued on World Turtle Day observed on May 23. The organisation also called for coordinated efforts and actions across the political and geographic borders to conserve the migratory turtle species. The organisation urged that many conservation programmes continue to prioritise nesting beaches, often neglecting foraging areas, migratory corridors, and offshore hotspots, even though these are often the sites of greatest threat. WWF-Pakistan also urged the transnational coordination and integration of local and indigenous knowledge into governance systems to protect marine turtles.
According to WWF-Pakistan, the migratory nature of the marine turtle makes them inherently a shared species, not in ownership, but in responsibility. What happens to a turtle in one country's waters (e.g., bycatch, habitat loss, pollution, climate change) affects the population across the region. In Pakistan, turtles are facing several threats, including habitat degradation, anthropogenic and shoreline development activities, which hinder the nesting activities of turtles.

Facing a severe financial crisis, the Murree Municipal Corporation has increased public toilet usage fees across the hill station.
The charge has risen from Rs20 to Rs50 per person.
Parking fees for vehicles and charges at the local slaughterhouse have also been increased.
These service contracts will be auctioned off to private contractors on June 12.
Despite the fee hikes, there is no guarantee of basic amenities like water, soap, or towels in the washrooms.
According to the chief officer of the municipal corporation, seven major public toilets are located along key tourist routes and picnic points.
The minimum collective bid for these washroom contracts is set at Rs1.18. Among them, three are in high-traffic areas such as Pindi Point, Kashmir Point, and the General Bus Stand, with a combined contract value of Rs0.92.
Four others in less frequented areas like Guldana, Lower Topa, and Jhika Gali have a total value of Rs0.25. Contractors will be authorised to charge visitors Rs50 per use.

"Quarantine issue halts import of giraffes, rhinos","US
Wildlife dept's Rs5b zoo project faces delays over disease risk
The Punjab Wildlife Department's ambitious plan to import exotic animals for the Lahore Zoo and Safari Park has encountered a major obstacle, as the Animal Quarantine Department has withheld clearance for the arrival of giraffes, rhinos, and a hippopotamus from South Africa. The delay marks another setback in the department's broader revamping initiative, which has already seen the suspension of a separate elephant import project.
Although several birds and animals have already been procured from domestic and international sources, the import of larger, high-profile species - including 12 giraffes (nine for the Safari Park and three for the Zoo), three rhinos (a pair for the Safari and one for the Zoo), and a male hippopotamus - remains in limbo.
Director of the Revamping Project, Mudassar Hassan, confirmed that the federal Ministry of Climate Change has already issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) for the import of various species, including giraffes, rhinos, hippos, nyala antelopes, and zebras. However, the Animal Quarantine Department has withheld final approval, citing disease control concerns - particularly the risk of introducing the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) virus into Pakistan.
Officials from the Animal Quarantine Department explained that health certificates accompanying the animals are under close scrutiny. ""We must ensure full compliance with Pakistan's import health standards,"" one official said. ""If the documentation falls short, additional verification will be requested. This is a routine precaution to protect the country's livestock from foreign diseases.""
The department's concern stems from the ongoing presence of the FMD virus in several African countries, including South Africa. While the virus has not been reported in Pakistan, authorities are wary of the potential for an outbreak if infected animals are imported.
As a precautionary measure, a temporary ban has reportedly been imposed on the import of large animals from South Africa. The Quarantine Department has also advised Punjab Wildlife officials to consider alternate sourcing from countries certified free of FMD - an option project leaders say is difficult to implement.
""These species are not readily available in other countries, nor are there sufficient surplus animals,"" Mudassar Hassan explained. ""In addition, only South Africa currently has the specialized cargo infrastructure necessary to transport such large animals.""
Hassan further noted that a comprehensive quarantine protocol has been proposed: animals would first undergo health monitoring in South Africa, followed by a 15- to 30-day quarantine upon arrival in Pakistan.
He also emphasised that the specific FMD strain in question has never been reported in rhinos or hippos and that these animals would be housed in isolated zoo and safari environments, far from livestock.
Meanwhile, WWF Pakistan's Dr Uzma Khan raised ethical concerns, urging the government to ensure that imported animals come from captive breeding programs and not the wild.
""Animals caught from the wild often suffer in captivity,"" she warned. ""It is crucial to source from certified breeding farms or zoos in disease-free countries to ensure their wellbeing and ease of adaptation.""

Australia gifts patrol boat to strategic Maldives,"US
The promised craft is under construction and would be ready by next year.
Australia's defence minister announced Monday the gifting of a naval patrol boat to the Maldives to ""maintain regional security"", during a visit to the strategically-located Indian Ocean archipelago.
Global east-west shipping lanes pass the nation's chain of 1,192 tiny coral islands, stretching around 800 kilometres (500 miles) across the equator.
Australia is part of the Quad grouping -- alongside the United States, Japan and India -- seen as a bolster against China's growing presence in the wider Indian Ocean.
""In line with our national defence strategy, Australia is working with partners across the Northeast Indian Ocean to maintain regional security and stability"", Richard Marles said in Male.
""As Indian Ocean countries, Australia and the Maldives share a vision of our region that is peaceful, stable and prosperous,"" Marles said in a statement following talks with his counterpart, Mohamed Ghassan Maumoon.
The 39.5-metre long (129-foot) Guardian-class boat, a type of craft which Australia uses to patrol Pacific island nations, possesses a 3,000 nautical mile range, and can accommodate 23 people.
The promised craft is under construction and would be ready by next year.
Australia is also providing hydrographic equipment to help the Maldives map its ocean floor, to increase maritime safety and unlock economic development, Marles said.
Better known as a luxury holiday destination with pristine white sand beaches and secluded resorts, the Maldives has also become a geopolitical hotspot.
Neighbouring India and China have jostled for influence in Male, whose pro-Beijing president came to power in 2023 on a promise to evict dozens of Indian troops based there. AFP

Oil gains as wildfires threaten Canada supply,"US
US West Texas Intermediate crude was up $1.63, or 2.68%, at $62.42.
Oil prices rose by over 2% on Monday, despite producer group OPEC+ sticking with output hike plans, as wildfires burning in Canada's oil-producing province threatened supply and President Donald Trump's new tariff threats weighed on the US dollar.
Brent crude futures climbed by $1.76, or 2.8%, to $64.54 a barrel by 1814 GMT. US West Texas Intermediate crude was up $1.63, or 2.68%, at $62.42.
Wildfires burning in Canada's oil-producing province of Alberta have affected about 7% of the country's overall crude oil output as of Monday, according to Reuters calculations.
At least two thermal oil sands operators south of the industry hub of Fort McMurray evacuated workers from their sites over the weekend and shut production as a precaution.
Also supporting prices, the US dollar slipped across the board on Monday on worries that Trump's fresh tariff threats might hurt growth and stoke inflation.
A weaker US currency makes dollar-priced commodities like oil less expensive for buyers using other currencies. Prices were also supported by the increased geopolitical risk premium after Ukrainian drone strikes against Russia.

The Paramount film has made another $231 million overseas, which should help offset its massive production budget, reportedly at $400 million.
Debuting in a disappointing third place was Sony's Karate Kid: Legends, a sequel featuring Ralph Macchio – – the star of the original 1984 classic – – and action flick icon Jackie Chan, along with Ben Wang in the title role.

Centre bypasses Punjab in DAO postings,"US
.
The federal government has unilaterally appointed junior federal officers as Divisional Accounts Officers (DAOs) in all 43 districts of Punjab for the disbursement of public funds for the Public Works Department, bypassing constitutional and legal protocols and irking the Punjab Finance Department.
These appointments have effectively stripped Punjab's District Accounts Officers (DAOs) of their constitutional authority over the disbursement of public funds, particularly for the Public Works Department.
The move has sparked strong discontent within Punjab's Finance Department, which has raised the issue at a higher administrative level. In each district, two to three DAOs have been appointed, and they have already authorised payments exceeding Rs1 billion soon after assuming their roles.
Members of the ruling PML-N have formally opposed this decision. MPA Ilyas Chinioti has submitted a motion of adjournment in the Punjab Assembly, arguing that the move violates the spirit of the 18th Constitutional Amendment, which grants provinces administrative autonomy. The motion demands that the federal government immediately withdraw its decision.
The newly appointed federal officers are reportedly in grade 16 and 17, whereas Punjab's DAOs hold the more senior grade 18 posts. The reallocation of financial control to federal officers is seen as a direct infringement on provincial jurisdiction.

Bilawal meets China, Russia envoys at UN says peace not possible without Kashmir settlement
Two multi-party delegations dispatched by Pakistan to key world capitals as part of its diplomatic offensive against India, began their high-level interactions on Monday, with Bilawal Bhutto Zardari-led delegation holding talks with China and Russia's UN ambassadors in New York.
On the direction of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, two separate delegations began their tour of New York, Washington, London, Brussels and Moscow in order to brief these countries about Pakistan's stance in view of the recent military escalation with India.
Bilawal, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman, is currently in New York, leading a nine-member delegation, comprising parliamentarians and former diplomats. Another delegation, led by Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Tariq Fatemi, is visiting Moscow.
According to the Foreign Office, the delegations were scheduled to engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, senior officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora.
Bilawal started his two-day visit to New York with an interview with a foreign news channel. Later, he met with China's Permanent Representative to UN Fu Cong and Russia's Permanent Representative Vassily Nebenziaand.
According to Express News, Bilawal thanked China for supporting Pakistan during the conflict with India. He apprised the Chinese ambassador of Pakistan's responsible behaviour after April 22 attack in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) resort of Pahalgam.
Bilawal said that India had rejected Pakistan's offer for a transparent and impartial investigation into the attack. He stressed that the resolution of the Kashmir issue was indispensable for a lasting peace in South Asia.
The Pakistan delegation urged China to play its role in this regard. While expressing serious concerns over India's targeting of Pakistani citizens during the four-day conflict, the delegation urged the international community to move beyond conflict management and towards dispute resolution.
During the meeting, there were unanimity between both sides in opposing unilateral actions and aggression. Both the sides emphasised the need for respecting the UN Charter, international laws and agreements. They also opposed India's decision to weaponise water.
The delegation comprised Dr Musadik Malik; Sherry Rehman; Hina Rabbani Khar; Engr Khurram Dastgir Khan; Faisal Subzwari; Bushra Anjum Butt, Ambassador (retd) Jalil Abbas Jilani, and Ambassador (retd) Tehmina Janjua.
Later, the delegation briefed the Russia's UN ambassador on the situation following the Pahalgam attack, rejecting India's baseless accusations against Pakistan without any evidence, and highlighting its premature and unilateral actions, including the holding in abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty.
He noted that Pakistan's measured and proportionate response - guided by restraint and international law - was aimed at preserving regional peace and avoiding a wider conflict. He underlined that Pakistan was the biggest victim of terrorism in which more than 80,000 civilians have lost their lives.
He also apprised the Russian diplomat of India's sponsorship of terrorism inside Pakistan. He underscored that durable peace in the region hinged on the just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with international law.
On the occasion, Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik highlighted the humanitarian implications of holding the IWT in abeyance. Highlighting Pakistan's mature and restrained approach, the delegation reiterated the country's commitment to peace, dialogue, and regional stability.
In an interview earlier, Bilawal reiterated Pakistan's desire for peace through ""dignity, strength and diplomacy"", and termed India's actions after the Pahalgam attack dangerous and a violation of the international law.
""No lasting solution is possible without resolving Jammu and Kashmir dispute,"" he said, emphasising that the current ceasefire should lead to permanent peace, which would come through the resolution of the Kashmir dispute in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiri people.
India's unilateral decision to hold Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in abeyance violated the international law and the treaty obligations. ""By unilaterally suspending the IWT, India has set a dangerous precedent with implications for regional peace and security,"" he warned.
He added that Pakistan wanted that the international community played its role in facilitating dialogue between Pakistan and India. ""We are ready to talk to India on Jammu and Kashmir; IWT and terrorism,"" Bilawal pointed out.
He also said Pakistan is a victim of terrorism; from political leadership to military to Pakistani citizens; we have been affected by terrorism. ""While India committed naked and blatant act of aggression by violating international border, Pakistan acted in self-defence,"" he said.
The delegation's US engagements on Tuesday, included meetings with the US lawmakers, think tanks, and media representatives. A meeting of the Pakistani delegation with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also on the cards.
The visits of the delegations aim at projecting Pakistan's perspective on the recent Indian aggression. The Foreign Office said that they would engage in a series of meetings with the leadership of international bodies, public office holders, officials, parliamentarians, think tanks, media and diaspora.
""The delegations will highlight Pakistan's responsible and restrained conduct – seeking peace with responsibility – in the face of India's reckless and belligerent actions. They will also highlight that dialogue and diplomacy should take precedence over conflict and confrontation,"" the Foreign Office said.
""The delegations will underscore the imperative for the international community to play its due role in promoting a lasting peace in South Asia. The need for immediate resumption of the normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty will also be a key theme of the delegations' outreach.""
Meanwhile, responding to media queries concerning a flurry of antagonistic statements made by the Indian leaders as well as remarks made by the Indian external affairs ministry spokesperson, the Foreign Office spokesperson said that facts could not be obscured by hollow narratives.
The Indian leadership's recent remarks, including those made in Bihar, reflected a deeply troubling mindset that prioritised hostility over peace, the spokesperson stated. ""Any attempt to portray Pakistan as the source of regional instability is divorced from reality,"" he added.
According to the Foreign Office spokesperson, the international community was well aware of India's record of aggressive behaviour, including documented support for terrorist activities within Pakistan. ""These facts cannot be obscured by hollow narratives or diversionary tactics.""
The spokesperson stated that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remained the core issue and Pakistan would continue to stand firm in advocating for a just and lasting resolution to the dispute in line with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
""To sidestep this fundamental issue is to condemn the region to continued mistrust and potential confrontation,"" he said. ""The developments of recent weeks have once again underscored the utter futility of jingoism and coercion,"" the spokesperson said.
The spokesperson emphasised that ""India cannot and will not achieve its objectives"" through threats, misrepresentation, or force, saying that Pakistan was equally resolved to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression.
""Durable peace in South Asia demands maturity, restraint, and a willingness to address the root causes of conflictnot the pursuit of narrow political gains at the expense of regional harmony,"" the Foreign Office spokesperson stated.

Minor tremors create panic,"PK
Social media 'experts' fan fears of impending earthquake
A series of mild earthquakes rattled Karachi on Sunday, with the strongest tremor recorded at 3.6 magnitude on the Richter scale.
People in affected areas cited at least six aftershocks following the mild shaker on Sunday.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department's Seismic Monitoring Centre, the epicenter was near Quaidabad, and the quake occurred at a depth of 10 kilometres at 5:33pm on Sunday. This marks the second tremor in Karachi this year, following a 4.7 magnitude quake on March 31.
Later at night, aftershocks were felt across several neighbourhoods, including Malir, Landhi, Shah Faisal Colony, Korangi, and Jafar Tayyar Society. The second tremor, recorded at 1:03am, had a magnitude of 3.2 with a depth of 12 kilometres, and its epicenter was near Gadap Town.
A third round of tremors was reported in areas such as Quaidabad and Malir.
The repeated shocks sent residents fleeing their homes, reciting prayers such as the Kalima and Durood Sharif, and staying outdoors in fear. Some homes reportedly suffered minor structural damage, including cracks in walls.
No injuries or major damage were reported, but fear and uncertainty spread across the city.
Many people said they rushed out of their homes when the beds started shaking and windows rattling.
Adding fuel to the fire, so called experts took to the social media with details of fault lines of the city and chances of a big earthquake.
One social media influencer went as far as claiming that excess drawing of groundwater has caused the fault lines to move and Malir and the city was about to experience a huge earthquake.
The fact remains that Karachi lies 150km away from the junction of three tectonic plates in the sea making it vulnerable to an earthquake and tsunami.
Expert insight
Associate Professor and Geologist at the University of Karachi Dr Adnan Khan told Express Tribune that these tremors were minor and not a cause for alarm. He explained that Karachi lies on a passive margin, far from any major fault lines, which makes large, destructive earthquakes highly unlikely.
""These tremors are classified as 'mild tremors', resulting from minor tectonic movements and stress build-up deep in the Earth's crust,"" Dr Khan said. He added that Himalayan tectonic activity, which shifts the mountain range northward by four to five cm each year, causes distant pressure that can trigger such minor events.
He also noted that human activities, such as industrial waste burning and excessive groundwater extraction, can subtly alter the Earth's structure, potentially influencing seismic behaviour.
Dr Khan advised citizens to remain calm during mild tremors and to follow standard precautions - to leave buildings immediately and move to open areas, staying away from foundations or tall structures.
Official response
Commissioner Karachi Syed Hassan Naqvi urged residents to stay calm and not believe in rumours circulating on social media.
He confirmed that he had consulted Chief Meteorologist Ameer Haider Laghari, who assured him the tremors were not dangerous, although minor activity could continue for the next seven days. He emphasised that earthquakes can not be predicted with certainty.
Affected areas included Quaidabad, Malir, Saudabad, Gulistan-e-Jauhar, Khokhrapar, Steel Town, Landhi, Korangi, Shah Latif Town and Bhains Colony. Residents reported fleeing their homes during the shocks, engaging in prayer, and staying outdoors until the tremors passed.

Stocks close bearish amid tax hike concerns,"US
Index falls 813 points as inflation, geopolitical pressure dampen sentiment
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) endured a volatile session on Monday as investor interest remained muted ahead of the federal budget announcement.
The KSE-100 index reached the intra-day high of 1,018 points before hitting the low of 899 points and closing at 118,878, a drop of 813 points, or 0.68%. Analysts attributed the bearish activity to reports of proposed tax hikes on banking and saving schemes as well as additional petroleum levies.
Moreover, the inflation rate accelerated last month, reversing the decline recorded in previous months. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 3.5% year-on-year in May on account of a jump in food prices, which further dampened market sentiment.
Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp commented that stocks closed under pressure in the pre-budget session. Reports of higher taxes on income from banking and saving schemes and petroleum levies in the FY26 budget impacted sentiment.
Mehanti added that concerns over geopolitical tensions and rupee fluctuations also played the role of catalysts in bearish close at the PSX.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 813.29 points, or 0.68%, and settled at 118,877.81.
In its review, Topline Securities stated that the stock market exhibited volatility, with the index fluctuating within a wide band, primarily influenced by global market trends. Local equities faced selling pressure amid uncertainty surrounding the upcoming budget and the government's proposed 2-3% hike in tax rate on passive income.
The KSE-100 index reached the intra-day high of 1,018 points and intra-day low of 899 points, eventually closing at 118,878, a drop of 813 points, it said.
Topline noted that the upward momentum was supported by notable gains in Pakgen Power, National Foods, Meezan Bank, the National Bank of Pakistan and Bank AL Habib, which added 201 points to the index. Conversely, losses in Systems Limited, Engro Holdings and Pakistan Petroleum dragged the index down by 341 points.
In its commentary, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) said that Monday marked another session when the KSE-100 closed below 120,000 points.
Some 29 shares rose while 71 fell, with Pakgen Power (+10%), National Foods (+9.93%) and Meezan Bank (+0.72%) contributing the most to index gains. On the flip side, Systems Ltd (-4.98%), Engro Holdings (-1.76%) and Pakistan Petroleum (-1.78%) were the biggest drags, it said.
Pakistan's inflation rate accelerated in May, driven by a jump in food prices and reversing the decline seen in the last few months. The CPI rose 3.5% year-on-year, above AHL expectations of 3.04%.
""The KSE-100 continues to tread water below 120,000 and several key support levels below 120k appear to be inevitable,"" AHL commented.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala commented that the PSX opened on a positive note and rallied to the intra-day high of 120,591 points. Later, selling pressure dragged the index down to close at 118,878, lower by 813 points.
""Looking ahead, we expect market pressure to persist in the near term; however, this may present a buying opportunity in select sectors. Investors are advised to accumulate fundamentally strong stocks in the cement, automobile and fertiliser sectors on dips,"" the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 497.9 million shares compared with Friday's tally of 580.3 million. The value of shares traded was Rs23.5 billion.
Shares of 464 companies were traded. Of these, 193 stocks closed higher, 231 fell and 40 remained unchanged.
Dewan Cement was the volume leader with trading in 40.4 million shares, gaining Rs0.60 to close at Rs12.67. It was followed by Invest Bank with 31.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.84 to close at Rs2.31 and K-Electric with 30.9 million shares, falling Rs0.23 to close at Rs5.09. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs1.97 billion, the National Clearing Company reported.

Grenade attack targets police patrol in Quetta,"US
Genade explosion near Bakra Mandi along Eastern Bypass leaves three people injured, including SHO
Two separate incidents of violence in Balochistan on Monday have renewed concerns about public safety and the overall security landscape in the province.
In Quetta, a grenade explosion near Bakra Mandi along the Eastern Bypass left three people injured, including the Station House Officer (SHO) of Manzoor Shaheed Police Station.
According to police officials, the attack targeted a mobile patrol unit and was carried out by unidentified assailants.
The injured officers were swiftly transported to a government hospital, where they received emergency medical treatment. In response to the attack, law enforcement agencies cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.
The Eastern Bypass has seen similar incidents in the past, raising questions about security measures in the area.
Authorities have since tightened security in sensitive zones across the city.
Meanwhile, in Mastung, a separate violent incident sparked a major public protest.
After a man was fatally shot near the Alizai Bypass, his family and local residents staged a demonstration by placing the victim's body on the Quetta-Karachi Highway, demanding the immediate arrest of those responsible.

German court rules against migration crackdown,"US
They expressed their wish to claim asylum but were sent back to Poland the same day.
Berlin
The new German government's policy of turning asylum seekers away at its borders is illegal, a court ruled on Monday, dealing a blow to one of conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz's flagship measures.
The policy was brought in on May 7, just a day after Merz and his cabinet took office with a promise to crack down on irregular migration.
However, Berlin's Administrative Court said in a statement that people ""who express the wish to seek asylum while at a border check on German territory may not be sent back"" before it was determined which state was responsible for processing their claim under the EU's so-called ""Dublin"" system.
Monday's decision follows an appeal made by three Somali nationals who encountered an immigration check at a train station at Frankurt an der Oder on the Polish border on May 9.
They expressed their wish to claim asylum but were sent back to Poland the same day. The court said that their pushback was illegal and that its ""findings can also be applied to other cases"" of people being turned away at Germany's borders.
However, the court also ruled that ""the petitioners cannot demand to be allowed into"" Germany.
The process of establishing which EU state is responsible for the asylum application ""can be carried out at or close to the border"", the court said. The court rejected the government's argument that the Dublin procedure could be disregarded if this is necessary to ""keep public order and protect domestic security"".
The government had failed ""to demonstrate a danger to public security or order"" that would justify such a move, the court said. Under the Dublin procedure, irregular migrants should be registered in the EU country they first enter. Should they head to another nation in the bloc, they can in most cases be returned to their first port of call in the EU.
The German government has limited options to challenge the decision, for example by appealing to the federal Constitutional Court.
The new policy of pushing back undocumented migrants at Germany's borders, including almost all asylum seekers, was quickly introduced after Merz's government took office early last month.
This was despite worries voiced by some in his coalition's junior partner, the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), that the policy was not legally sound.
The government has also stressed that the pushbacks were temporary and that the longer-term solution has to be improved security at the EU's external borders.
According to the interior ministry, 1,676 people were denied entry to Germany in the first two weeks of the new policy being applied, including 32 people who wanted to claim asylum.
A crackdown on irregular migration was a key plank of Merz's platform for February's general election.
That vote saw the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) score its best-ever result of just over 20 percent and Merz insists that action on migration is the only way to halt the party's growth.
The new government's pushback policy has led to some irritation among Germany's neighbours as well as fears of adverse impacts on cross-border commuters and border communities. AFP

Delay in Punjab LG polls irks CEC,"US
Says ECP can also summon PM if Islamabad local elections remain pending
Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja on Monday warned that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) would soon pass an appropriate order regarding the long-delayed local government (LG) elections in Punjab, cautioning that such an order could prove embarrassing for the provincial government.
""We will pass an appropriate order. This process must be completed as soon as possible. The commission cannot sit idle with its eyes closed,"" the CEC remarked.
He further said the ECP had the authority to summon the chief minister of Punjab, and if local elections were not held in Islamabad, even the prime minister could be summoned.
The remarks came as a five-member bench of the ECP, headed by CEC Raja, resumed hearing a case related to the delay in holding local government elections in Punjab.
During the hearing, ECP Secretary Omar Hamid briefed the commission, saying that both the Punjab government and the federal government in Islamabad appeared disinterested in conducting local government elections.
He said Punjab had already delayed the polls for three years.
""The tenure of local governments in Punjab ended on December 31, 2021,"" he said, adding that from 2019 to the present, Punjab had amended its local government laws five times, and a sixth amendment was currently underway.
CEC Raja said he had personally appeared before the Supreme Court in the local government elections case and stressed that the elections could not be delayed indefinitely on the pretext of legislative processes.
""It is not acceptable for a provincial government to keep avoiding legislation for five years and not conduct elections,"" he said.
The provincial minister for local government informed the commission that the bill related to LG elections was currently under consideration in the standing committee and that efforts were being made to finalise the legislation soon.
""It's been over three months since the bill was tabled in the Punjab Assembly. Typically, a bill takes around two months for approval,"" he said.
The minister also noted that a draft of the local government rules was available and could be shared with the commission.
Once again, the CEC reiterated that all provinces except Punjab had conducted their LG elections, warning that a formal order from the ECP could embarrass the provincial government.
""We will pass a suitable order. This process must be expedited. The commission cannot sit idle,"" he said.

Shifting tides,"US
The banning of the Awami League, just as the Jamaat returns, must be viewed with equal scrutiny
Bangladesh's Supreme Court has restored the registration of Jamaat-e-Islami, the country's largest Islamist party, more than a decade after it was barred from the political arena. The decision, which follows the ouster of Sheikh Hasina's government last August in a students-led uprising, marks a pivotal moment in the nation's political realignment.
Restoring the once-barred entity is a symbolic reversal of a political order that had sought to marginalise the party from national discourse. Under Sheikh Hasina's Awami League, Jamaat was systematically targeted, its leaders prosecuted for war crimes and its influence curtailed. Critics argued this was a necessary reckoning with history. Supporters, however, viewed it as political vengeance dressed in judicial robes. Now, with Hasina in exile and facing charges, the tables are turning rapidly. Ironically, the Awami League itself has been banned pending legal proceedings, leaving the political field wide open. This moment is as fragile as it is historic. The interim government's promise of elections by June next year provides a sliver of hope for a return to democratic normalcy. But history in Bangladesh has shown that transitions rarely proceed smoothly. Jamaat's return to the electoral process may inflame old tensions, particularly among those who still see the party through the lens of its role in the 1971 liberation war. Yet, the question today is not merely whether Jamaat should or should not participate in, it is whether Bangladesh can build a truly pluralistic political culture that transcends revenge and repression.
The banning of the Awami League, just as the Jamaat returns, must be viewed with equal scrutiny. No democracy can thrive by simply rotating bans on its major political forces. Whether the nation can find solid ground again will depend on its ability to uphold the rule of law and resist the temptation to silence dissent regardless of who holds power.

PCC to draft digital assets framework,"US
The meeting reviewed a preliminary draft of regulatory protocols for digital and virtual assets.
The Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) on Monday agreed to form a technical committee tasked with developing a regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets, the Ministry of Finance announced on Monday.
The development emerged during a high-level meeting chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and attended by PCC Chief Executive Officer Bilal Bin Saqib, the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and senior officials from various government departments.
According to the ministry's press release, discussions centred on aligning Pakistan's approach to digital finance with global standards and keeping pace with rapidly evolving technological advancements.
The meeting reviewed a preliminary draft of regulatory protocols for digital and virtual assets.
Key among the proposals was the creation of an autonomous regulatory body to oversee the country's crypto and digital finance ecosystem. The idea garnered broad consensus from participants, paving the way for a coordinated institutional approach.
""It was agreed to constitute a technical committee comprising representatives from SBP, SECP, Law Division, and IT & Telecom Division,"" the ministry stated.
The committee will examine the draft legislation, refine the governance model and present a comprehensive framework in the next PCC session.
According to the release, stakeholders provided critical input for ""a secure, transparent, and innovation-friendly regulatory environment,"" one that would enable ""responsible blockchain adoption, safeguarding investors and advancing financial inclusion"".
Finance Minister Aurangzeb lauded the efforts of all parties involved and underscored the state's commitment to building a modern financial infrastructure.
He reaffirmed the government's goal of creating a ""future-ready financial infrastructure that supports innovation while maintaining financial stability and regulatory compliance"".
The move comes amid a growing push in Parliament for crypto legislation.
Just last week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance deliberated on a digital currency bill introduced by PPP lawmaker Sharmila Faruqi.
During the session, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal reiterated that the existing ban on cryptocurrency remained in effect, though he stressed the urgent need for a regulatory roadmap.
The same day, PCC CEO Bilal Bin Saqib made headlines by announcing the launch of Pakistan's first government-backed Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.
He also revealed the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, intended not for trade or speculation, but to hold digital assets already under state custody.
The Pakistan Crypto Council was formally launched in March this year with a mandate to help regulate and integrate blockchain and digital assets into the national financial architecture.

Govt approves Rs1tr uplift budget,"PK
Sets economic growth target at 4.2% for next year as Iqbal warns of compromises to growth.
The government on Monday approved a Rs1 trillion federal development budget and set the economic growth target at 4.2% for the next fiscal year, as Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said that the development budget cuts could compromise economic growth and delay strategic projects.
The Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) approved a record Rs4.1 trillion national development outlay, primarily backed by a Rs2.8 trillion financing envelope from the four provinces. Despite limited resources, the Sindh government secured Rs86 billion from the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), leveraging its alliance with the ruling coalition. ""The Pakistan Peoples Party took advantage of being an ally of the government that is dependent on its vote for the budget,"" said a cabinet minister.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, speaking after chairing the APCC meeting, said the Rs1 trillion PSDP includes Rs120 billion earmarked for the N-25 Quetta-Chaman-Karachi expressway. He confirmed that the committee had also approved a 4.2% growth target and a 7.5% inflation target for the fiscal year 2025-26. These recommendations will now be submitted to the National Economic Council for final approval, said Iqbal.
He identified top-priority projects for the upcoming year, including the Diamer Basha Dam, the Karakoram Highway, the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway, and the N-25 Expressway from Karachi to Quetta. However, he expressed concern that the remaining Rs880 billion after accounting for the expressway would be inadequate, potentially compromising future economic growth. He added that enhancing the development budget would be impossible without a significant increase in tax revenues.
""The water sector is our priority, but due to limited resources and with the current allocation, it will take 20 years to complete the Diamer Basha dam project,"" said Iqbal. He maintained, however, that the government would strive to allocate maximum resources to ensure its completion within the next three to four years. Ironically, despite increasing threats from India over water security, the federal water sector allocation has been slashed by 45% or Rs 119 billion, bringing it down to Rs 140 billion for FY2025- 26.
The planning minister reiterated that the commodity-producing sectors are expected to grow by 4.4%, led by a 4.5% recovery in agriculture and 3.5% growth in large-scale manufacturing. Exports are projected at $35 billion, while foreign remittances are expected to exceed $39 billion. ""I am thankful to overseas Pakistanis who, despite calls to the contrary, sent $10 billion in additional remittances over the past two years,"" he added.
The Rs1 trillion federal PSDP was finalised by a committee formed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. According to the APCC working paper, this year's development outlay is Rs300 billion or 8% higher than the previous year's budget. The four provincial governments are set to increase development spending by 28% from their resources, enabled by substantial revenues under the 2010 National Finance Commission (NFC) award.
Despite the record outlay, the Rs1 trillion federal PSDP is Rs400 billion lower than the originally approved budget for the current fiscal year. To fund this, the federal government plans to borrow Rs270 billion externally.
The four governments plan to spend Rs2.8 trillion, higher by Rs609 billion or 28% over this year's original budget. Provincial governments will borrow Rs802 billion, while state-owned companies will spend another Rs288 billion outside the federal budget. Punjab leads provincial spending with a proposed Rs1.19 trillion allocation, 41% higher than last year. Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) follows with Rs440 billion, reflecting a 63% increase. Sindh will spend Rs887 billion, up 7%, and Balochistan plans to spend Rs280 billion, marking an increase of Rs32 billion.
KP's Finance Advisor, Muzzammil Aslam, criticised the federal government for allocating disproportionately less funding to his province compared to Sindh. ""Only Rs3 billion were allocated to K-P, while Sindh received Rs47 billion. Punjab got Rs15 billion,"" he said. In response, Iqbal clarified that Rs70 billion has been allocated for K-P's merged districts and that the federal government is cutting back on spending for projects that fall under provincial jurisdiction.
The APCC decided not to include any new provincial-nature projects in the PSDP due to fiscal limitations and imposed a moratorium on the approval of projects costing up to Rs1 billion until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme concludes.
Despite these constraints, 30-40% of PSDP funds are still being directed to provincial-nature projects, which the planning ministry said have significantly hampered progress on large-scale national initiatives. In contrast, funding for the National Highway Authority (NHA) has increased by Rs49 billion, or 27%, to Rs229 billion.
However, to accommodate the political priorities of coalition partners, the government has proposed sharp reductions in water and power sector budgets. The power sector's funding is down 41% or Rs72 billionto Rs104 billion. The federal education ministry's budget is reduced by 27% to Rs20 billion, while the Higher Education Commission will face a 32% cut, reducing its budget to Rs45 billion.
Still, the government has retained Rs50 billion for parliamentarians' schemes under the Sustainable Development Goals Achievement Programme.
Currently, 1,071 development projects with a total cost of Rs13.4 trillion are under implementation. These projects require an additional Rs10.2 trillion to be completed, and the planning ministry estimates it would take more than a decade to finish them all. Iqbal stated that the ministry has identified 183 slow-moving or problematic projects, mostly under the DDWP, that should be capped or closed by June 2025. ""By capping or closing these projects, around Rs1 trillion could be saved, freeing up Rs100 billion immediately for fast-moving projects,"" he said.

Balochistan front,"MX
There should be no compromise on peace and security in Balochistan, goes without saying.
Balochistan's security situation is a growing concern, and warrants a growing focus. A theatre of Indian meddling, Balochistan needs to be treated with a holistic strategy, in all earnest, to bring the much-needed calm and peace to it. With our archrival on our eastern border, after conceding an all too evident defeat in the kinetic domain last month, now aggressively vocal about inflicting a two-front war on us - one of the fronts being the terrorism-hit Balochistan - it has become even more important to make our southwestern province our primary focus. It's thus good to see the state swing into action to pay attention to the imbroglio that our restive province has been mired in for long.
This past Sunday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir attended a jirga meant to strengthen engagement with the tribal leadership as part of the state's strategy to address the evolving security situation in Balochistan. Addressing on the occasion, the Prime Minister and the Army Chief reaffirmed the state's firm resolve to eradicate terrorism and counter Indian-sponsored proxy warfare in the desolate province.
That there should be no compromise on peace and security in Balochistan goes without saying. The state must take on the merchants of death and destruction - operating at the behest of the enemy against their own countrymen - firmly and ruthlessly. Simultaneously though, the state needs to show some magnanimity - towards those that are reconcilable. Disgruntled elements nursing genuine grievances can easily be separated from the terrorists through political outreach. While the jirga of tribal elders has made a unanimous pledge to stand shoulder to shoulder with the government and the armed forces in the fight against terrorists, this forum should also be tapped to approach the reconcilable elements so as to bring them back from the brink.

Russia and Ukraine said they had agreed at peace talks on Monday to exchange more prisoners of war and return the bodies of 12,000 dead soldiers.
The warring sides met for barely an hour in the Turkish city of Istanbul, for only the second such round of negotiations since March 2022.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan described it as a great meeting and said he hoped to bring together Russia's Vladimir Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskiy for a meeting in Turkey with US President Donald Trump.
But there was no breakthrough on a proposed ceasefire that Ukraine, its European allies and Washington have all urged Russia to accept. Moscow says it seeks a long-term settlement, not a pause in the war; Kyiv says Putin is not interested in peace.
Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky said Russian negotiators had handed their Ukrainian counterparts a detailed memorandum outlining Moscow's terms for a full ceasefire. Medinsky, who heads the Russian team, said Moscow had also suggested a ""specific ceasefire of two to three days in certain sections of the front"" so that the bodies of dead soldiers could be collected. Each side said it would hand over the bodies of 6,000 dead soldiers to the other.
In addition, they said they would conduct a further big swap of prisoners of war, after 1,000 captives on each side were traded following a first round of talks in Istanbul on May 15.
Ukrainian Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, who headed Kyiv's delegation, said the new exchange would focus on those severely injured in the war and on young people. Umerov also said that Moscow had handed a draft peace accord to Ukraine and that Kyiv - which has drawn up its own version - would review the Russian document.
Ukraine has proposed holding more talks before the end of June, but believes that only a meeting between Zelenskiy and Putin can resolve the many issues of contention, Umerov said.
Zelenskiy's chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said Kyiv's delegation had requested the return of a list of children who it said had been deported to Russia. Moscow says such children were moved in order to protect them from fighting.
Medinsky said there were 339 names on Ukraine's list but that the children had been ""saved"", not stolen. Reuters

SNGPL to lay dedicated pipelines for industries,"RO
The CEO insists that pending requests for new connections, the over-billing issue will be addressed swiftly
Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) Chief Executive Officer Aamir Tufail has said that the gas-related issues faced by industrialists are being resolved on a priority basis. In this regard, pending requests for new industrial gas connections and over-billing complaints are being addressed swiftly while a focal person will be appointed to ensure the timely resolution of complaints.
Speaking at the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), Tufail said that where industries or industrial areas require additional gas, dedicated pipelines would be laid following their request.
He pointed out that domestic consumers were being supplied gas at a loss with around 40% recovery, which was one of the reasons for gas outages and the pending three million applications for new connections.
He acknowledged that gas supply to the industries was expensive and tariff reduction was beyond SNGPL's authority. However, industries can be facilitated through gas blending. He said the industry plays a vital role in national economic growth and its development is equally important for SNGPL as industrial growth leads to higher gas demand.
Speaking on the occasion, acting LCCI President Engineer Khalid Usman emphasised that gas was the backbone of Pakistan's industrial sector but its reserves had been depleting over the years, which posed various challenges to industrialists across the country, including Lahore.
He said that gas comprises about 29% of Pakistan's energy mix and the promotion of alternative energy sources could allow gas to be diverted from power generation to industrial consumption.
Khalid Usman added that SNGPL's gas losses were 5.15% in 2022-23, which were reduced to 4.93% in 2023-24, noting that further improvement was possible.
He, however, voiced concern that gas pressure was extremely low in many industrial areas, which results in significant production losses and financial damage to the manufacturing units.
The acting LCCI chief remarked that the restriction on new domestic gas connections was harming SNGPL itself. LCCI members are also facing unexpected gas shutdowns, which disrupt factory schedules and prevent exporters from timely meeting orders.
""This undermines foreign buyers' confidence. Due to such reasons, industries are relocating and many have ceased operations altogether,"" he said. Khalid Usman proposed that dedicated gas pipelines should be allocated for industrial zones to maintain stable pressure, adding that exporting industries, in particular, should be provided gas at discounted rates, so they could compete well in the global market and reduce the trade deficit.

Animal fodder prices on fire ahead of Eid,"US
Daily cost of feeding a sacrificial animal now ranges from Rs1,200 to Rs1,400
With Eidul Azha fast approaching, there has been a massive increase in the prices of fodder and feed for sacrificial animals in the open market.
Due to the rise in fodder prices, daily cost of feeding a sacrificial animal now ranges from Rs1,200 to Rs1,400. Machine-cut green fodder is being sold at Rs40 per kg in the open market, oilcake at Rs200 per kg, black chickpea husk at Rs170 per kg, bran at Rs130 per kg, chaff at Rs150 per kg and straw at Rs200 per kg.
Despite the high prices, the quality remains low. More than half of the green chopped fodder is made from rotten or stolen green leaves so decayed that the animals don't even eat it, forcing buyers to purchase new batches again.
Temporary fodder shops have been set up in almost every street and neighbourhood across the city. Fodder stalls have also been established in city markets. Green fodder is being supplied daily from villages to the cities.
The high prices are still not enough to discourage enthusiastic celebrators like students and children, who are buying fodder and decorative items for the animals from their own pocket money.
A fodder seller, Shauqat Kayani, said that Eidul Azha is a seasonal business.
According to him, during the ten days of Eid, the sale of fodder exceeds what is usually sold in two months during normal days.
Traders have raised the prices of all types of fodder by 40 per cent and a further increase is expected two days before Eid.

India to host women's World Cup in October this year
Pakistan will play all their women's 50-over World Cup matches in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo when India hosts this year's tournament, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said on Monday.
Politically-estranged India and Pakistan, who have not played a bilateral series since 2013, will play their matches in neutral venues when either country hosts an ICC event, the sport's global governing body announced in December.
""The venues for the knockouts are dependent on Pakistan qualifying as two alternative venues have been identified for one semi-final and the final,"" the ICC said.
""Colombo will be the venue for the first semi-final and the final only if Pakistan qualify for those stages."" Bengaluru, where the tournament will start with India playing in the opening match, will host the final on November 2 if Pakistan are knocked out earlier in the tournament, the ICC added.
Bengaluru will also stage the second semi-final on October 30, a day after the first semi-final in Colombo or Guwahati. Visakhapatnam and Indore are the two other host cities for the eight-team tournament.
India played all their matches in Dubai when Pakistan hosted the men's Champions Trophy this year, including the final which they won.
Both the Indian Premier League (IPL) and the Pakistan Super League were suspended last month amid clashes between the two countries following an attack targeting tourists that killed 26 people in Kashmir in April.
Matches resumed after a ceasefire was announced. The neutral venue arrangement between the countries will also be in place for the men's T20 World Cup in 2026, which India will co-host with Sri Lanka, and the women's T20 World Cup in 2028 in Pakistan. Reuters
Women's Emerging Asia Cup postponed
The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has officially announced the postponement of the ACC Women's Emerging Teams Asia Cup 2025, which was originally scheduled to begin on June 6 in Sri Lanka.
The decision follows a formal request from Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) President Shammi Silva, who wrote to ACC President Mohsin Raza Naqvi, citing adverse weather conditions and growing health concerns stemming from a chikungunya outbreak in the region.
In a statement, ACC President Mohsin Naqvi reaffirmed the council's dedication to women's cricket.
""The ACC is committed to providing opportunities for young women cricketers to develop their skills and compete at the highest level,"" said Mr. Mohsin Raza Naqvi, President Asian Cricket Council.
""We understand the strategic significance of this tournament in shaping the future of women's cricket in Asia, and we will work diligently to reschedule the event at the earliest possible date,"" he added. The ACC emphasised that it remains focused on promoting women's cricket and nurturing emerging talent across the continent. New dates for the tournament will be announced in due course.
Meanwhile, speculation had been circulating in the media regarding India's possible withdrawal from ACC tournaments due to ongoing cross-border tensions. However, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has strongly refuted these claims.
Speaking to the Indian media, BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia clarified the board's position regarding participation in ACC events, firmly denying any withdrawal rumors.
""There has been no discussion or decision to withdraw from any ACC event. Our current focus remains on the Indian Premier League and the upcoming England series for both the men's and women's teams.""

Haris breaks Babar's T20I record
Pakistan's wicketkeeper-batsman Mohammad Haris showcased an explosive batting display on Sunday, leading his team to a convincing 3-0 series sweep over Bangladesh with a thrilling victory in the final match at Gaddafi Stadium.
Haris played a match-winning unbeaten innings of 107 runs off just 46 balls, featuring eight boundaries and seven sixes, at an extraordinary strike rate of 232.60. His stellar performance earned him the Player of the Match award.
With this remarkable century, the wicketkeeper batter became Pakistan's second-fastest T20I centurion, surpassing both Babar Azam and Ahmed Shehzad.
He reached his maiden T20I hundred in 45 deliveries, overtaking Babar Azam's previous record of 49 balls and Ahmed Shehzad's 58 balls. The fastest century for Pakistan remains Hasan Nawaz's 44-ball hundred, scored during the T20I series against New Zealand in March.
In the third T20I, Pakistan faced a challenging target of 197 runs. The innings started nervously as opener Sahibzada Farhan was dismissed early, scoring only one run off four balls to Mehidy Hasan Miraz's bowling.
However, Mohammad Haris and Saim Ayub quickly steadied the innings with a commanding partnership. The duo put together 56 runs for the loss of just one wicket in the first six overs, maintaining a strong scoring rate.
Haris and Saim forged a 92-run partnership for the second wicket, showcasing aggressive and fluent stroke play to keep Pakistan in control. The partnership ended when Tanzim Hasan trapped Saim for 45 runs off 29 deliveries, leaving Pakistan at 100-2 after 9.5 overs.
Despite the loss, Mohammad Haris continued to anchor the innings, reaching his half-century at 115-2 after 11 overs. Hasan Nawaz contributed quick runs with two boundaries before being dismissed for 26 off 13 balls by Mehidy Hasan, reducing Pakistan to 137-3 at 12.5 overs.
Undeterred, Haris maintained his dominance over the Bangladeshi bowling attack, striking boundaries and sixes with ease. He brought up his century in just 45 balls, displaying sublime batting throughout the innings. Haris remained unbeaten on 107 off 46 deliveries, including eight fours and seven sixes, while captain Agha chipped in with a quick 14 off 11 balls as Pakistan comfortably chased down the target in 17.1 overs.

Hayatabad street crimes draw top judge's ire,"PL
PHC CJ demands action as residents live in fear
Peshawar High Court (PHC) Acting Chief Justice, Justice SM Atiq Shah, has expressed serious concern over the growing incidents of street crime in Hayatabad Township, stating that residents of the upscale neighborhood are increasingly distressed by the deteriorating law and order situation.
Despite the frequency of such crimes, no significant measures have been taken to curb them, he noted.
Justice Atiq Shah made these remarks during the hearing of a petition regarding the recovery of a woman who went missing from the Darul Aman (women's shelter) in Hayatabad in 2023.
Additional Advocate General Adnan Ali, the police focal person, and Hayatabad SHO Tariq Ali appeared before the court. During the proceedings, the Chief Justice questioned the SHO on the rising crime rate in Hayatabad and asked why the situation continues to worsen.
The SHO explained that drug-addicted individuals from neighboring Khyber District frequently breach the boundary wall near Shah Kas, committing crimes and fleeing back through the same route. The SHO added that although the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA) has rebuilt the wall multiple times, it continues to be broken by these individuals.
Surprised by this revelation, the Chief Justice inquired why no police post had been established at the vulnerable location. The SHO responded that while a post does exist, it suffers from a severe lack of resources. Previously, each police station received 350 liters of diesel per month for mobile patrols, but now only 350 liters are allocated for the entire station, significantly hindering operations.
When asked about Hayatabad's population, the SHO stated it ranges between 800,000 to 1 million. Justice Atiq Shah observed, ""The entire population of Kuwait is around 1.3 million, while Hayatabad alone houses nearly 1 million residents. Yet, the area is being policed by only two police stations and three posts - this is wholly inadequate.""
In relation to the missing woman from Darul Aman, petitioner's counsel Manzoor Bashir informed the court that the woman has remained missing since 2023, and no investigation report has been submitted by the concerned SHO. The court demanded a report on her whereabouts and directed the provincial and federal governments, along with the police, to submit their findings within 14 days.
Advocate Hamza, a Hayatabad resident present in the courtroom, added that the law and order situation in the area is extremely poor and that the public is living in constant fear. After dusk, even law enforcement agencies face difficulties, as criminals often cross over from Khyber, commit crimes, and quickly escape.
The Chief Justice asked whether residents had formally petitioned the court regarding the issue. Advocate Hamza replied that several complaints had been filed but to no avail.
The court subsequently directed the SHO of Hayatabad to submit a detailed report outlining measures to control crime in the area and proposed actions to improve security. The court also ordered the inclusion of the PDA in the process to ensure the construction of a reinforced boundary wall.

Haripur's youth sparks digital uplift,"US
Hassan Nisar's project grows into major catalyst for tech education, economic inclusion
A young tech leader from Haripur is spearheading a grassroots revolution in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, empowering thousands of young Pakistanis through education, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
At only 25, Hassan Nisar has emerged as one of the most prominent youth voices in Pakistan's digital transformation.
Hailing from the scenic town of Khanpur in Haripur district, Hassan is the founder of Metrix Pakistan - a non-profit organisation that has rapidly grown into a major catalyst for tech education and economic inclusion across K-P's underserved areas.
Having completed his early education in Abbottabad and earned a degree in Economics from the University of Haripur, Hassan's journey reflects both a personal and professional commitment to his roots.
""There's immense potential in K-P's youth - we just needed to unlock it,"" he shared.
Launched in 2022, Metrix Pakistan was born out of a desire to bridge the digital divide.
In less than three years, the initiative has brought practical training in digital skills, freelancing, and entrepreneurship to thousands of students across the province - many from remote or marginalised communities.
""Our goal wasn't just to educate, but to prepare students for real-world opportunities,"" Hassan said.
""We've trained young people to develop portfolios, work on live projects, and land internships or jobs in Pakistan and beyond.""
Crucially, the organisation has focused on regions often overlooked by mainstream initiatives.
From Lower Dir to Mansehra, Metrix Pakistan has hosted summits and workshops in districts that rarely see such activity, creating local access to global knowledge.
But Hassan's efforts extend beyond education. He's brought major global tech players into the fold, with companies like Binance, Bitget, CoinEx, and even Microsoft participating in Metrix Pakistan-led events and mentorship programmes.
These collaborations have introduced emerging fields like blockchain and Web3 to youth in K-P - industries previously inaccessible to most in the region.
""There was a time when the idea of global companies engaging in K-P was unthinkable. Now, they're not just participating - they're investing,"" Hassan said.
Dozens of students trained under Metrix Pakistan have already entered the blockchain workforce, secured freelance contracts, or launched early-stage ventures. ""We've shown that with the right platform, youth in K-P can compete at the global level,"" he added.
Outside the digital sphere, Hassan has also led environmental and health initiatives.
His discovery of hidden waterfalls in Haripur turned into a sustainable tourism push, generating local jobs and boosting the economy. Additionally, his team has conducted free health camps in rural K-P, addressing basic healthcare gaps in neglected areas.
Recognising his contributions, various civil society organisations and government departments have honoured him with accolades including the Fakhre Hazara Award and a regional recognition award for youth empowerment.
More recently, Hassan launched the Metrix Pakistan Climate Change Summit series, engaging young people in climate activism.
""The climate crisis is real, and our youth want to be part of the solution,"" he emphasised.
Hassan has also advised provincial and federal authorities on youth engagement, digital empowerment, and social platforms, working closely with departments in both Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.
A key part of his advocacy has focused on combating misinformation and digital harassment.
Through strategic partnerships and platform outreach, Hassan has helped numerous women in Pakistan report and remove fake accounts used for impersonation or harassment.

Cinecittà plans comeback despite Trump's tariffs,"US
Studio aims to boost Italy's film production
Europe's largest film studio Cinecittà is aiming to re-launch Italy as a film powerhouse, even as U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on foreign productions cast a shadow over the film industry globally.
Cinecittà, the homonymous company that manages Rome's historic film studio, approved a five-year plan this week backed by the EU's post-COVID Recovery Fund, which includes building new high-tech sound stages and boosting production capacity by 60% by 2026.
""We want to lead the game,"" said CEO Manuela Cacciamani. ""Cinecittà must be a factory that works at full capacity with excellence as a minimum standard."" Founded in 1937 under Benito Mussolini's fascist rule, Cinecittà became known as the ""Hollywood on the Tiber"".
It has hosted over 3,000 films, attracting world-renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese, Federico Fellini and Francis Ford Coppola.
The company is targeting revenue of 51.9 million euros ($58.8 million) in 2029, almost double the 2024 figure, and aims to turn a 4.3-million-euro net profit after a loss of 11.6 million euros last year.
Trump has said he will impose a 100% tariff on movies produced outside the United States to save Hollywood from ""a very fast death"", but has issued few details on how the levy would work.
The tariff plan threatens to disrupt the current industry set-up, in which big U.S. productions rely on the services of studios around the world that can provide expertise, cheaper costs and striking location scenery.
Trump's sweeping tariffs were temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court on Thursday, a day after a U.S. trade court blocked them, ruling Trump had exceeded his authority.
Cacciamani told Reuters Cinecittà was monitoring developments ""with the utmost care"".
""The hope is that two historic powers of cinema worldwide, (Italy and the U.S.) which owe so much to each other, will continue to cooperate,"" she said.
Italy's tax credit of up to 40% for film production is ""among the most competitive worldwide"", Cinecittà said, helping attract some of last year's international successes such as Emilia Perez and the papal thriller Conclave.
Among projects slotted for filming in Cinecitta this year is Mel Gibson's The Resurrection of The Christ, a sequel to his 2004 The Passion of The Christ.
Gibson is one of Trump's ""Special Ambassadors"" in Hollywood, tasked with rescuing the US film industry alongside actors Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Reuters

The secret of China's success,"PK
China wants to have peace with its neighbours so that it can focus on its economic progress and development.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Lao Tzu
An opium-addicted nation that remained under occupation by six foreign powers is now the world's second largest economy. How China managed to transform itself from a weak and fragile country to a global power house needs to be understood in the light of the Lao Tzu's quote above. It was under Mao Zedong that mainland China emerged as an independent country in October 1949. The policy of 'great leap forward' from late 1950s to early 1960s focused on reforming the country from an agrarian to an industrial economy.
Resilience, simplicity, efficiency, hard work, intelligence, integrity, commitment and dedication shaped China's road to modernisation which got an impetus during Mao's leadership and the 'open door policy' of Deng Xiaoping. Pulling 500 million people from below the poverty line by 1980s; focusing on industrialisation; augmenting exports; and planning to improve the quality of life of people shaped characteristics of the world's second most populous country. In the first decade of Communist China (1949-59), the Soviet Union was the principal backer of China. But following a rupture in their alliance and severance of assistance from Moscow, Beijing was on its own and succeeded in miraculously emerging as the world's second largest economy by 2015.
The secret of China's incredible success against all odds has another dimension: maintaining peace with its neighbours. The last war which China fought was in January 1979, with Vietnam. Since then it has not been in an armed conflict with any of its neighbours. Following the 1989 visit to Beijing of Mikhail Gorbachev, the then Soviet leader, and the collapse of the USSR, the relations between China and Russia transformed into being partners instead of adversaries. China's border issues with India barring the October 1962 war remained under control. Another secret of China's success is its concentration on 'soft power' with focusing on trade, aid, investments, technology and diplomacy instead of 'hard power' in the form of military intervention and armed conflicts. The Chinese leadership knows that its military involvement will jeopardise its vision to emerge as the world's biggest economic power. China wants to have peace with its neighbours so that it can focus on its economic progress and development.
China is not a perfect country and has its own fault lines like democracy, human rights, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Tibet and Xinjiang. For critics, the price paid by the people of China for their economic development and progress is democracy because Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is the only party to rule the country - something that negates fundamental principles of democracy like political pluralism and multiparty system. CCP believes China cannot afford western democracy, as under a multiparty system, it may not remain in power which will open a Pandora's box like what happened in the wake of Gorbachev's policy of reforms in the then USSR. The issues of Tibet and Xinjiang as well as alleged human rights violations cannot be dealt with if CCP loses its control over power. For how long CCP and its powerful People's Liberation Army (PLA) will be able to deal with the fault lines in China depends on how strong the current leadership is and how success it is in retaining its strides in education, infrastructure, technology, research and development, communication, transportation and manufacture of exportable items.
China's secret of success against all odds is an interesting topic of discussion and needs to be analysed from three sides.
1) from an impoverished economy in 1949, China pursued a 'great leap forward' in 1960s and by following an open-door economy policy in late 1970s emerged as an economic power by 2000. Within a span of 21 years, China used its human resource to compete with other global economies. For instance, in 1979, China's foreign exchange reserves were around 1 billion dollars, per capita income was 270 dollars and GDP was 139 billion dollars. In 2025, China's foreign exchange reserves are 3.2 trillion dollars, per capita income is 25,000 dollars and GDP is 18.5 trillion dollars. If China maintains the pace of its economic progress and development, it will surpass the US as the world's biggest economy. China's miraculous turnaround in just 50 years is an example for other countries, particularly Pakistan, to follow. During 1960s and 1970s, Pakistan was ahead of China in terms of per capita income, economic growth rate and foreign exchange reserves. PIA was the only non-communist airline to fly to Communist China. But, after just 40 years, China is now far ahead of Pakistan.
2) Chinese leadership focused on domestic production instead of importing items. For decades, Chinese way of life was simple whereas Pakistan was an import-driven economy and relied on foreign loans. When China was able to emerge as a successful economy, only then it allowed imports of luxury items. The same policy was pursued by India too. Not an import-driven economy, India adopted a policy of self-reliance. The lesson Pakistan can learn from the Chinese success is: peace with neighbours; focus on exports; self-reliance; and investment in education, health, infrastructure development, housing and public transport to life the quality of life of the public. Planning, time management and efficiency are major characteristics of the Chinese leadership. The CCP has a zero tolerance for corruption and nepotism.
3) Maximum use of human and natural resources is another major reason behind China's success. Pakistan is the world's fifth most populous country whereas China is second from top. However, Chinese population is not a liability, it's an asset. When Communist China, despite its international isolation and the conflict with the then USSR, was able focus on human and social development, it worked wonders. Till late 1970s, China was not even a part of the Olympics, but now it is known for its best performances in global sports. All in all, it is the leadership that matters in the context of progress and development of a country.

Yasir Hussain is not opposed to raising a dozen kids,"US
Actor recalls growing up with 11 siblings
During an interview with Tabish Hashmi, Yasir Hussain had a thing or two to say about large families, starting with his own experience of being raised with 11 older siblings.
The actor, who recently returned to theatre, began by joking about his father's army of 12 children: ""If my father worked in theatre, the audience would be our own.""
Confirming that he's the youngest of the 12 siblings, Yasir refuted the common belief that he would have double the amount of nephews and nieces, quipping that not everyone is as ambitious as his father was.
Despite the wisecracks, the Badshah Begum actor doesn't see a problem with a large household. ""There are no issues. I, myself, am fond of children. And I've spent a great childhood with my siblings, even though we lived in a one-bathroom home,"" he revealed.
Yasir jested that in such an environment, one's natural cycles adjust on their own, adding that the body times itself according to whose turn it is to relieve themselves.
He believes that even in current times, it is possible to raise as many as 12 kids if families wish to brave that step. ""They can definitely do it. I've seen people who've done it very well,"" he noted.
The Karachi Se Lahore actor added that having many children doesn't impede each child's upbringing. ""It's important to take out time for your kids,"" he said. ""Even if you have two kids, you do make time for them, don't you? It's necessary to do that.""
Although he's not opposed to the idea of fathering an abundance of children, Yasir has only one son - Kabir - with wife Iqra Aziz. From Yasir championing time and attention to Iqra discouraging abuse, it is clear that Kabir is being raised in a loving environment and one that prioritises tradition.
In a March interview, the couple shared that they prefer to teach their son Urdu first and foremost, keeping all other languages secondary.
""Once an actor pointed out to me that Kabir speaks in Urdu, so I mentioned that that's the language we speak at home. So they said, 'Teach him English. Don't make this mistake. He will learn Urdu at some point eventually,'"" Yasir recalled.
""Urdu is more important; I've seen a lot of people who can't speak it properly. It's important to build that habit, then your child may learn English or Punjabi or any other language later on,"" he added.

Gold surges as uncertainty grows,"US
Local price soars by Rs5,900/tola amid escalation between Russia and Ukraine, rupee gains 5 paisa to 281.97/$
Gold prices in Pakistan surged on Monday, tracking a sharp rally in the international market where the precious metal rose over 2%its highest level in more than three weeks. The spike was driven by a weakening US dollar and growing investor appetite for safe-haven assets amid escalating geopolitical tensions and sustained global economic uncertainty.
According to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA), the price of gold in the local market rose by Rs5,900 per tola, reaching Rs353,100. The price for 10 grams of gold also increased significantly, climbing by Rs5,058 to settle at Rs302,726. This rebound reversed the weekend's losses, when gold prices had declined by Rs1,400 per tola to close at Rs347,200 on Saturday.
Commenting on the development, Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, said the international gold market is showing strong upward momentum. He noted that gold rose nearly $70 on the day, hitting a low of $3,301 and peaking at $3,377, where it was holding steady. ""The rally is largely driven by geopolitical developments, particularly Ukraine's recent large-scale attack on Russia, which has boosted safe-haven demand,"" he said.
Internationally, gold gained more than 2% on Monday to its highest level in over three weeks, as a weaker dollar and a combination of geopolitical risks and economic uncertainty fuelled safe-haven demand, according to Reuters. Spot gold was up 2.7% at $3,377.29 an ounce as of 1419 GMT, after reaching its highest since May 8 earlier in the session. US gold futures were up 2.6% at $3,402.70.
Agar added that if gold manages to close above the $3,380 mark, it could test higher resistance levels at $3,400, $3,420, and even $3,440. ""A close above these thresholds may pave the way toward $3,500, although it's still early to confirm such a move,"" he said. For now, the closing outlook remains bullish, with key levels in sight.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee posted a slight appreciation against the US dollar on Monday, strengthening by 0.02% in the interbank market. By the end of trading, the local currency settled at Rs281.97 per US dollar, reflecting a modest gain of five paisas from the previous session.
In contrast, the rupee had weakened slightly during the prior week, losing four paisas or 0.01% against the dollar. It closed at Rs282.02 last Friday, compared to Rs282.06 at the end of the week before, according to data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). According to Ismail Iqbal Securities, the rupee has depreciated by 1.23% calendar year-to-date and 1.30% fiscal year-to-date.

PA unites against unannounced load-shedding,"US
Cross-party committee demands strict action as KE, HESCO, SEPCO fail to justify unexpected power cuts
Members of the Sindh Assembly have unanimously condemned the unannounced load shedding by electricity distribution companies K-Electric, HESCO, and SEPCO. Leaders from PPP, MQM, PTI, and Jamaat-e-Islami stood united in their demand for an immediate end to surprise power outages.
Despite strong calls from the special committee on energy to reduce load shedding, K-Electric CEO Moonis Alvi continued to defend the unannounced power cuts. The committee expressed strong displeasure over the electricity companies' poor performance and ordered a strict ten-day deadline for compliance.
Committee members questioned how the load shedding schedule was changed without their approval, especially after the prior assurance that there would be no load shedding at night. Officials from K-Electric, HESCO, and SEPCO failed to provide satisfactory answers.
In a meeting held on Monday at the Sindh Assembly building and chaired by PPP's Fayyaz Butt, the special committee directed all electricity companies to immediately stop night load shedding and strictly adhere to an approved schedule. Sindh Assembly Speaker Owais Qadir Shah also attended the session.
Other participants included PPP leaders Ghulam Qadir Chandio, Asif Musa, Sadia Javed; MQM leader Ali Khursheedi; Jamaat-e-Islami's Muhammad Farooq; and senior officials from K-Electric, HESCO, and SEPCO. K-Electric CEO Moonis Alvi apologised for missing the previous meeting.
The committee's frustration was evident as members criticised the prolonged and unpredictable power outages across Sindh, especially in Karachi. The meeting was tense before the arrival of the K-Electric CEO, with some members threatening to issue a show-cause notice for his absence.
Moonis Alvi was grilled about the legal basis for load shedding. He claimed it was necessary due to line losses, but committee members demanded to know under which law such measures are authorised. The officials failed to provide a clear legal justification.
MPA from Liaquatabad Moaz Mehboob warned that FIRs should be registered against K-Electric officials for illegal load shedding. When Alvi countered by mentioning electricity theft, Mehboob expressed his support for cracking down on theft as well.
Sindh Assembly Speaker Owais Qadir Shah emphasised that all electricity companies must provide a clear load shedding schedule. Jamaat-e-Islami's Muhammad Farooq highlighted that the previous agreement banned night load shedding, questioning how the schedule was changed without committee approval. Alvi defended the need for cuts during heatwaves, but Farooq dismissed the claim, noting Karachi's temperatures had not reached 45 degrees.
The meeting also saw members expressing frustration over CEO Alvi's dismissive attitude. Bilqis Mukhtar criticised him for not taking concerns seriously, while Sajjad Soomro and Sadia Javed asked him to stop using his mobile phone repeatedly during the meeting. Sadia also demanded an apology from K-Electric officials for disrespectful remarks made towards an MPA in an earlier session, a demand Alvi acknowledged with an apology on behalf of his institution.
Alvi admitted K-Electric's failure to effectively combat electricity theft and said stronger action was needed in affected areas, though cutting connections remained a challenge.

Australia's Glenn Maxwell retires from ODIs,"IE
He played 149 matches, scoring 3990 runs and taking 77 wickets
Australian cricket stalwart Glenn Maxwell has announced his retirement from one-day international (ODI) cricket, ending a decorated 149-match career to concentrate on the T20 format.
He will be available for selection at the 2026 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.
The explosive allrounder, known as much for his unorthodox shot-making as for his underrated off-spin, leaves behind a legacy defined by match-winning brilliance and memorable performances, most notably a heroic 201 not out against Afghanistan at the 2023 World Cup.
Entering at 7-91 with Australia in crisis, Maxwell battled severe cramp and oppressive heat to forge a 202-run stand with Pat Cummins, ultimately guiding his team to victory and into the tournament's final, where Australia overcame hosts India.
Maxwell finishes with a career ODI strike rate of 126, second only to West Indies' Andre Russell, scoring four centuries and 23 fifties while taking 77 wickets.
His influence spanned two World Cup victories and a reputation as one of Australia's most dynamic white-ball players.
""I think back to right at the startI was picked ahead of my time and out of the blue,"" Maxwell said. ""I was just proud to be playing a couple of games for Australia. Since then, I've experienced the highs and lows, being dropped and recalled, playing in World Cups and being part of some great teams.""
Citing the physical demands of ODI cricket and lingering effects from a serious leg injury, Maxwell admitted that his body had begun to struggle with the rigours of the format.
Discussions with selection chair George Bailey led to the decision to step aside.
""I felt like I was letting the team down a little bit with how my body was reacting,"" Maxwell said on the Final Word Podcast. ""We talked about the 2027 World Cup, and I said, 'I don't think I'm going to make that.' It's time to give someone else the chance to own that role.""
Maxwell added that he did not want to linger in the side ""for selfish reasons"" and believed it was vital to give selectors a clear picture ahead of future planning.
Cricket Australia chief executive Todd Greenberg paid tribute to Maxwell's impact, calling him ""one of the most exciting and influential"" players in ODI history.
""Glenn's ballistic batting has lit up the cricket world,"" Greenberg said. ""Crowds have come just to watch him bat, and kids have picked up bats because of him. Australian cricket is indebted to Glenn for his contributions.""
George Bailey echoed the praise, highlighting Maxwell's versatility and longevity.
""His energy in the field, under-rated ability with the ball, and natural talent have made him one of the greats,"" Bailey said. ""We're fortunate that he still has so much to offer in T20 cricket.""
Maxwell will continue to play in the Big Bash League and remain available for international T20 duty as Australia builds towards the 2026 tournament.

Skyrocketing prices deter cattle buyers,"US
Residents find individual sacrificial animals unaffordable, turn to collective sacrifice options
As the religious festival of Eidul Azha approaches fast, three major sacrificial animal markets set up in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad have so far failed to attract potential buyers owing to skyrocketing prices.
With only four days remaining until Eidul Azha, the three major livestock markets of the twin citiesBhata Ground (Cantonment), I-12, and Rawat-Kallar Syedanare brimming with animals. However, buyers are few and far between.
Sky-high prices of goats, sheep, cows, bulls, and camels have left most people unable to afford an animal of their choice. If this trend continues, traders may once again be forced to take unsold livestock back home, as happened last Eid.
Many citizens unable to afford individual animals have already started reaching out to organisations arranging collective (joint) sacrifices.
Contracts for the three main livestock markets were auctioned at high rates with Bhata Ground market at Rs165.7 million, I-12 market Rs55m, and Rawat-Kallar Syedan market at over Rs30m.
Following these auctions, livestock was transported in trucks from Punjab and other provinces. Arrangements including tents, lighting, drinking water, animal feed, security, vehicle parking, and livestock health inspections by veterinarians were made in those markets.
Despite these facilities, sales have been dismal.
A 20-kg goat is priced as high as Rs100,000 or more, depending on weight and appearance. Bulls weighing around five maunds (approximately 200 kg) are priced between Rs300,000 to Rs400,000. For collective sacrifices, a single share in a large animal now costs Rs70,000 to Rs80,000, making even joint purchasing unaffordable for many.
Shocked by the high prices, most buyers inquire about prices, pose for photos with the animals, and then walk away. In all three markets, buyers are seen visiting in the evening, but purchases remain low. Discussions and arguments between traders and buyers under the tents have become a common scene.
Buyers turn to collective sacrifices
As livestock prices remain out of reach, many residents of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad are turning toward collective sacrifice options, where one share can be reserved for as low as Rs35,000. Many are now compelled to opt for this alternative to fulfil the religious obligation of Sunnat-e-Ibrahimi.

Punishment must be proportionate: SC,"US
Says interference with rights must be justified, lawful
The Supreme Court has ruled that proportionality must be applied with discipline, care and sensitivity to context, especially in cases involving fundamental rights and human dignity.
In a service matter involving a sub-inspector, the apex court stressed that the principle of proportionality offers a structured framework for judicial review of administrative actions.
The four-page judgment, authored by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, explained that the principle of proportionality provides a structured framework for judicial review of administrative actions.
""Developed across various constitutional jurisdictions, it involves a four-step test: (i) the measure must pursue a legitimate aim; (ii) be suitable to achieve that aim; (iii) be necessary, in that no less restrictive alternative exists; and (iv) strike a fair balance between the measure's impact on individual rights and the public interest.""
This court has recently introduced and adopted this four-stage test to assess the legality and fairness of administrative and disciplinary decisions. Such a framework ensures that any interference with rights is justified, necessary, and lawful,"" reads the four-page order.
The judgment was passed in a service matter where the Punjab Service Tribunal had partially allowed the appeal of a sub-inspector and modified the penalty from a two-stage to a one-stage reduction in pay through an order dated February 2, 2016.
According to the tribunal, while an investigation had been conducted, the prosecution ""failed to produce even a shred of evidence"" to substantiate the allegations. A division bench of the apex court, led by Justice Shah, heard the sub-inspector's appeal against the tribunal's ruling.
The order noted that despite these clear findings, the tribunal opted only to reduce the penalty rather than exonerate the petitioner.
""It appears that the Tribunal relied, albeit implicitly, on the principle of proportionality, finding the original penalty disproportionate to the alleged misconduct. However, this application was both legally flawed and logically inconsistent with its own conclusion when no misconduct was established. The Tribunal failed to properly exercise its discretion under Section 5 of the Punjab Service Tribunals Act, 1974, which empowers it to confirm, set aside, vary, or modify impugned orders. While the Tribunal has authority to vary the punishment in appropriate cases, such discretion must be exercised judiciously grounded in the record, legal standards, and principles of fairness,"" the order stated.
The court noted that judicial interference in disciplinary penalties is only warranted when the punishment is ""arbitrary, perverse, or based on irrelevant considerations"". ""Once the Tribunal found that the allegations were wholly unsubstantiated, the only lawful outcome was to exonerate the petitioner.""
The judgment further elaborated that proportionality fosters a stable and systematic method for constitutional adjudication.

OMCs failing to keep 20-day stock to face penalties,"US
Regulator will also take action if OMCs could not lift the required products from refineries
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has decided to impose penalties and in some cases suspend licences of oil marketing companies (OMCs) over failure to maintain 20-day oil stocks and lift the required petroleum products from refineries.
The refineries will also face Ogra's action if they produce less-than-committed volumes for three consecutive months.
In a letter to the leading OMCs, Ogra said it has observed that numerous OMCs were not adhering to their commitments made during the product review meeting (PRM) regarding the lifting of stocks from local refineries.
""This failure to comply with the PRM directives is not only adversely impacting Ogra's oil supply chain management but is also damaging energy security and causing substantial revenue losses due to imports, which is tantamount to violation of the authority's directions,"" the regulator said, adding that after careful consideration and thorough deliberation, it made the decision that the OMCs which fail to lift local products vis-a-vis their commitment/ allocation in the PRM from refineries, fail to maintain 20 days of stock and the refineries which produce less-than-committed products for three consecutive months, would be placed before the authority for consideration of suspension of their marketing licence.
The regulatory authority, during its meeting held on May 29, 2025, reviewed serious contraventions related to stock maintenance and product procurement. After deliberation, it approved immediate imposition of penalties by the department concerned under Rule 69 of the Pakistan Oil (Refining, Blending, Transportation, Storage and Marketing) Rules, 2016.
As per Rule 37, the OMCs that failed to maintain the mandatory 20-day stock cover in March 2025 shall be penalised based on the shortfall in the average stock days.
The OMCs which maintained less than five days of stocks will face a penalty of Rs10 million, for five or less than 10 days of stocks, the penalty will be Rs7.5 million, for 10 or less than 15 days of stocks, the penalty will be Rs5 million and for 15 or less than 20 days of stocks, the penalty will be Rs1 million.
The regulator will also slap penalties on the OMCs that lifted insufficient products from the refineries. It will impose a penalty on the refineries that failed to supply allocated products to the OMCs and even those refineries will face action that produced less than the quantity committed in the PRM during March 2025.
The OMCs which had more than 10% and less than 25% shortfall in lifting petroleum products from the refineries will face a Rs1 million penalty, in case of more than 25% and less than 50% shortfall, the penalty will be Rs5 million, in case of more than 50% shortfall, the penalty will be Rs7.5 million and those which had a shortfall of more than 75% in supplies from the refineries will face a Rs10 million penalty.
For April 2025, the regulator directed the department concerned to issue show-cause notices to the relevant OMCs and refineries by May 30, 2025. A response period of seven working days from the date of issuance was granted. The authority further advised that show-cause notices for May 2025 be issued by June 20, 2025.
Future enforcement measures
Ogra has decided that any OMC failing to lift local products in relation to its PRM commitment or maintain a 20-day stock cover, and any refinery under-producing against its commitment for three consecutive months, will be subject to the possible suspension of their marketing licence. The enforcement department has been instructed to issue this directive to all the entities concerned.
The authority has told the enforcement department (legal) to finalise the draft of ""Petroleum Products Review Meeting Regulations, 2025"" in consultation with the relevant departments. The draft will be submitted to the stakeholders for feedback, who will be allowed a period of seven working days to provide their comments.

Pakistan for creating growth opportunities,"US
Outlines efforts to integrate rail, road corridors with ECO network
Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan has emphasised the need for creating more opportunities for economic growth and mutual stability within the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) region.
""We believe in transforming challenges into opportunities,"" he stated while addressing an ECO ministerial meeting in Tehran on Monday. He was heading a delegation from Pakistan.
The two-day huddle was attended by ministers from 10 member countries including Pakistan, Turkiye, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan.

Sybil creates history for Pakistan,"US
She wins gold medal at Asian Weightlifting Masters Championship on her debut
Powerlifter-turned-weightlifter Sybil Sohail became the first Pakistani woman to win the gold medal at the Asian Weightlifting Masters Championship in Doha, Qatar.
This was also the Commonwealth Powerlifting Champion Sybil's international debut at a weightlifting event.
The 31-year-old athlete has always dreamed of raising the Pakistani flag at the Asian championship and it was an aim she had set for herself after she became the Asian Commonwealth Powerlifting and Commonwealth Powerlifting champion last year.
""I aim to make my country proud, make my family proud, we have sacrificed a lot for the sport, but I need to make sure that all of that effort and dedication pays off,"" Sybil told this correspondent from Doha.
She was competing in the 59kg category and she lifted a total of 95kg to get her gold. She lifted 40kg in snatch while she had a more solid performance in clean and jerk with a 55kg finish.
Sybil is the eldest of the powerlifting and weightlifting sisters, Twinkle Sohail, Veronika Sohail, and Mariam Sohail.
She and her sisters created a unique record at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Championships last year when they collectively grabbed 15 gold medals.
She alone won six out of those 15.
The sisters belong to the Christian community in Lahore and they have been a shining example for the nation that rarely sees any athletes coming forward from minority groups.
However, Sybil credits Twinkle for introducing her to the sport and thanks her coach Rashed Malik for guiding all four of them and training them in Lahore at their club which is at the Punjab University grounds.
""Sybil has won so many accolades for Pakistan in powerlifting, but she had never competed in weightlifting, and for her personally it was her debut at an international weightlifting event as well, it was a dream for her because she was always charmed with weightlifting,"" said Twinkle who also coached Sybil often while training together told this correspondent.
""This is huge, she has won her gold medal on her debut.""
'Bitter experiences fuel our ambition to win medals'
Twinkle shared a bitter experience of Sybil's from 2016, which resulted in her missing out on the trials for the national weightlifting squad.
""She had a rough experience in 2016, there were trials for the team that was meant to compete in the South Asian Games weightlifting. But Sybil couldn't go to compete in them because she had an exam that same day. She knew if she competed in them she would have secured a spot.
""So since 2016, this has been a wish of hers that she finally fulfilled now. It took her nine years to achieve what she really wanted.""
Twinkle added that Sybil's feat brings an immense sense of pride to her and her family. Twinkle says that she understands Sybil's emotions completely.
""I started sports in my family, if I reflect on my own experience, there was a time when I was selected to go to Nepal for a competition in 2019. Unfortunately, at the time when Imran Khan's government was at the helm of affairs, I found out that the government only had the funds for only five players, my name was in sixth place on that list, and I had a silver medal to my name, but I couldn't compete in that event.
""So we fuel our ambition with these disappointments. These feelings are really beyond explanation but they are strong and we use them to drive us to achieve bigger goals and more medals.
""Hopefully I would make my name in weightlifting too,"" concluded Twinkle.
Lifting weights is good for women
Sybil's achievements and her dedication to powerlifting and weightlifting shows that she is changing the perception of society -- one day and one medal at a time.
""It is actually a misconception that weightlifting is bad for women, and it disrupts the hormones and creates complications for us when it comes to having children and starting families,"" Sybil explained. ""It is actually healthy to build the muscles and we need these exercises and weight training to stay strong.
""There are so many Pakistani powerlifters and weightlifters I know who were very active in the sport and then went on to have children.""

"From Russia, with Love","PK
Pakistan has strategic space and a unique opportunity to outflank India in the heart of Eurasia
As the West-led, post-WWII global order undergoes a major transformation amidst turbulence and volatility, the building blocks of an alternative worldview are evident in Pakistan's vicinity. Recent journeys to Beijing and Moscow have confirmed the contours of a huge transition, driven by decline of the West and rise of the East. As President Xi Jinping famously told President Vladimir Putin during a visit to Moscow on March 22, 2023, ""Right now, there are changes, the likes of which we haven't seen for 100 years, and we are the ones driving these changes together."" These changes refer to the tectonic shifts in the global balance of economic, political, military, scientific and technological power, from the West to the East, shifts which are inexorable and irreversible.
In this context, Pakistan's military, political and diplomatic victory over India in last month's 16 hours of eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation is also having ramifications that go beyond the region, changing the South Asian geopolitical landscape. Perceptions of India and Pakistan, in the eyes of allies and adversaries, have been altered. The big picture presents an outlook that has pluses for Pakistan, providing Pakistan with strategic space, in an altered geopolitical landscape. Three new realities in terms of relationships among four key regional powers - China, Russia, Pakistan and India - are clearly evident.
First, the China-Russia alliance is rock-solid, cemented by their adversaries attempts to ignite a new Cold War, as well as Trump's failed trade and tariff war. Both Beijing and Moscow are of the view that the Western world, centred on the EuroAtlantic, with NATO as its military arm, is determined to 'contain' both of these giants, in Asia and Europe respectively. Hence, the possibility of a 'Reverse Nixon' is non-existent. 'Reverse Nixon' is the naive notion peddled by some in the Washington Establishment, who felt that just as President Nixon, in the 1970s, had delinked China from the Soviet Union to form a Sino-US alliance that ultimately proved decisive in the defeat of the Soviet Union, a similar manoeuvre now by the US to delink Russia from China could jointly pressure China. Both China and Russia are now deeply committed to jointly building Eurasia as the global strategic centre for both geopolitics and geoeconomics.
Second, the Pak-China strategic partnership has been solidified in the recent struggle in a new qualitative manner, as rock solid as the China-Russia relationship. Reinforcing this is the fact that Moscow no longer views Pakistan through Indian lenses, and there's a new-found respect and liking for Pakistan in the Russian political establishment. Russia is now ready to build a closer rapport with Pakistan, an outreach in which Russian disillusionment with India is also a factor.
Third, after meeting Russia's highly experienced Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, and listening to his landmark 29 May speech at the Eurasian Forum in Perm, Russia, where, for the first time, he criticised India's role in the Western sponsored military arrangements like the Indo-Pacific Strategy and QUAD, in front of an audience that included a dozen BJP parliamentarians and party activists, shows that the first cracks have appeared in the bond between Delhi and Moscow. Trump's India-specific embarrassing statements (calling for reviving the Kashmir dispute and rehyphenating Pakistan with India), Pakistan's May 10 victory over India and China's May 14 announcement of giving Indian-occupied Arunachal Pradesh a new Chinese name, Zangnan have added to India's isolation and discomfiture. The Big Three - US, China and Russia - are now collectively equidistant from India.
The narrow-based, insular, divisive Hindutva regime in Delhi offers limited appeal to the Big Three, more so, since its arrogance and hubris were decisively punctured by Pakistan's demolition of the 'Shining India' military myth in May. No wonder it is Whining India now, carrying on a chorus of cribbing and complaining about Pakistan in world capitals.
A key change in the Russia-India relations is that, irrespective of the regime ruling New Delhi, Russia also had a deep ingress in the Indian political establishment. Now with a weakened Left in India, almost a non-relationship of Moscow with the Congress Party and Kremlin's discomfiture with the ruling BJP's deep-seated pro-Americanism, Russia's political bond with India has weakened. Russia has prioritised ties with China and is willing to seek greener pastures in South Asia with a more confident and reliable Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Lavrov's speech at the Eurasian Forum on May 29 had three key planks:
1) Building new security architecture in the Eurasian continent (largest and wealthiest) is necessary given 'approaching end of centuries-long Western dominance and advent of multipolar era', with Eurasia replacing EuroAtlantic as the center of gravity in global affairs.
2) Within Eurasia, the centerpiece is where the region's four nuclear powers - China, Russia, Pakistan and India - are located, with Indian participation in the Western military schemes like Indo-Pacific Strategy and QUAD causing discomfiture to both Beijing and Moscow.
3) ""Four years after its ignominious retreat from Afghanistan, NATO is once again seeking new points of entry into Afghanistan.""
However, the most telling of Lavrov's remarks was his unvarnished critique of India's participation in QUAD, as during preliminary discussions with the Russians, India ""emphasised that their intent was confined exclusively to trade, economic and other peaceful domains of collaboration"". But to the surprise of Russia, India did the opposite of what they promised to Russia: ""in practice, however, the QUAD nations (India, US, Japan and Australia) are already endeavouring, with notable persistence, to organise naval (military) exercises!"" In another first, Lavrov specifically attacked the Indo-Pacific Strategy, linking it directly to India's role, saying that such a nomenclature ""had never existed and NATO made it up to drag India into their anti-China schemes"". In other words, India is being viewed in Moscow as a willing accomplice of and collaborator in the West's anti-China games, which are synonymous with anti-Russia policies.
Given this context, Pakistan has strategic space and a unique opportunity to outflank India in the heart of Eurasia. With better ties now emerging with Iran and Afghanistan, a solid and stable relationship with China and a sympathetic perspective from Moscow, plus an assertive South Asia that has rejected Indian hegemony, Pakistan should consolidate its gains, with a healing touch at home and a region-centric foreign policy that leverages its role, relationships and respect into strategic dividends for the country. These developments provide an opportunity for a strategic reset in foreign policy: with Russia; with our Western neighbours like Iran and Afghanistan; and with the smaller states of South Asia. The last such opportunity that arose for a strategic reset with Russia was after the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, but it was squandered due to the flawed obsession with 'strategic depth' in Afghanistan.
Let it not be said ""we never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.""

'From near-certainty to a coin flip',"US
Milky Way may not collide with Andromeda after all
The Milky Way may not have a catastrophic collision with another huge galaxy as has been predicted, computer simulations revealed Monday, giving our home galaxy a coin-flip chance of avoiding destruction.
But don't worry either way: no galactic smash-up is expected for billions of years, long after our ageing Sun will have burnt away all life on Earth.
The Milky Way and the even-larger galaxy Andromeda are speeding towards each other at 100 kilometres (60 miles) a second, and scientists have long predicted they will collide in around 4.5 billion years.
That would be bad news for our neighbourhood.
Previous research has suggested that the Sun -- and our Earth -- could wind up in the centre of this newly merged ""Milkomeda"" galaxy and get sucked into its supermassive black hole. Alternatively, the Sun could be shot out into the emptiness of intergalactic space.
However, ""proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated"", according to a new study in the journal Nature Astronomy.
There is only a roughly 50 per cent chance the Milky Way and Andromeda will smash into each other in the next 10 billion years, the international team of astrophysicists determined.
""It's basically a coin flip,"" lead study author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki told AFP.
The researchers ran more than 100,000 computer simulations of our universe's future, using new observations from space telescopes. AFP

"Gauff, Keys set up all-American clash","US
Djokovic takes 
on Norrie, seeking his 100th win on red clay
Second seed Coco Gauff brushed aside Russian Ekaterina Alexandrova 6-0 7-5 on Monday to set up an all-American French Open quarter-final clash with Madison Keys and stay on course for her first title in Paris.
Madison Keys fought off a late challenge from fellow American Hailey Baptiste to book her spot in the quarter-finals with a 6-3 7-5 victory.
Gauff, who got to the final in 2022 and semi-finals last year, is the youngest American player to reach at least the fourth round at seven consecutive Grand Slams since Venus Williams between 1997-1999.
Five American women and three American men reached the fourth round in Paris this year to equal a 40-year-old record.
Russian teenager Mirra Andreva also punched her last eight ticket after overcoming Australian 17th seed Daria Kasatkina 6-3 7-5 to become the youngest player to reach back-to-back French Open quarter-finals in nearly three decades.
Gauff, the world number two, must have thought she would have an easy morning session after powering through the first set in sensational fashion but 20th seed Alexandrova bounced back in the second to test her opponent.
The 21-year-old Gauff started fast, earning three consecutive breaks for a 5-0 lead in 15 minutes as she ran her opponent ragged across the baseline. The 30-year-old Alexandrova, bidding to reach her first Grand Slam quarter-final, earned a mere five points until that stage.
Gauff, who has now won four of their five meetings, gave away five break points in the next game but still secured her first bagel of the tournament.
In the men's draw three-times champion Novak Djokovic takes on Briton Cameron Norrie, with the Serbian seeking his 100th win on the red clay at Roland Garros, a feat achieved only by retired 14-times champion Rafa Nadal.
The winner will face Germany's Alexander Zverev, last year's finalist, who advanced after his opponent, Dutchman Tallon Griekspoor retired midway through the second set with an abdominal injury.
Zverev has reached his seventh French Open quarter-final in the last eight years as he looks to secure a maiden Grand Slam title.
Sinner sets sights on French Open quarters
Jannik Sinner will seek to light up the night session on Monday as the top seed clashes with Andrey Rublev for a place in the French Open quarter-finals.
Italy's Sinner will look to continue his quest to make it three Grand Slam titles in a row when he takes on Russian 17th seed Rublev.
The pair have met nine times in their career with Sinner holding the edge with six wins to three, but the former world number five emerged the victor in their only previous meeting at Roland Garros at the same stage in 2022.
Sinner retired injured from that encounter but should come into Monday's headline match in fine nick after limiting his time on court so far this tournament by winning all his matches in straight sets.
However, his opponent has spent even less time playing after receiving a walkover past France's Arthur Fils in the third round.
""I have to be very careful. Andrey is an incredible player. I have to be focused. He's rested. So let's see what's coming,"" said Sinner.
Musetti swings past Rune into French Open quarters
Lorenzo Musetti's impressive claycourt season rolled on in style on Sunday when the Italian craftsman downed the talented yet erratic Holger Rune 7-5 3-6 6-3 6-2 to reach the French Open quarter-finals for the first time.
World number seven Musetti, who will take on American 15th seed Frances Tiafoe for a place in the last four, adjusted to the Dane's shift to a swashbuckling approach to keep his title hopes alive in a year that has seen him steady his game.
For the 10th-seeded Rune, it was yet another failure against a member of the top 10 at a Grand Slam as he was denied a third quarter-final appearance at Roland Garros.
""Last night I was dreaming of this match against Holger and I was playing at that level. I need to be very good, and I am really proud of myself tonight,"" said Musetti.
Musetti, who said he has put some order in his game, arrived in Paris having reached at least the semi-finals in all three Masters events this season on clay. He did not disappoint on the Philippe Chatrier court, delighting the crowd with a handful of exquisite shots, notably from his impressive single-handed backhand.

Nutrition key to cutting maternal deaths,"US
According to UN, Pakistan records approximately 190,000 newborn deaths annually
A health expert on Friday underscored the importance of targeted nutrition and care awareness programmes in reducing maternal and newborn mortality, urging global and local partners to invest in impactful interventions.
Sara Aslam, Assistant Professor and Nutrition Diet Expert, in a conversation with a local news channel stressed that comprehensive awareness initiatives on nutrition and care are crucial to tackling maternal and newborn mortality, and urged stakeholders to invest swiftly in effective solutions.
According to UN and WHO reports, Pakistan witnesses approximately 190,000 newborn deaths annually, with a daily maternal mortality rate of 27 deaths, she added.
Experts stress that addressing the high rates of maternal and newborn mortality in Pakistan requires a multifaceted approach, including improved access to quality healthcare, enhanced nutrition, and increased awareness about reproductive health.
Health experts emphasise that reducing maternal and newborn mortality in Pakistan demands a concerted effort from governments, healthcare providers, and communities to ensure that all women and newborns have access to quality care.
Experts stress that proper nutrition plays a vital role in reducing maternal and newborn mortality, emphasising the need for increased awareness about healthy diets, particularly for pregnant women and new mothers, to ensure optimal health outcomes.
""Diet awareness initiatives can empower women to make informed choices about their nutrition, reducing the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth, and ultimately contributing to a decrease in maternal and newborn mortality rates,"" according to health experts.
A balanced diet rich in essential nutrients is crucial for pregnant women, as it directly impacts the health and development of their babies, experts say, highlighting the importance of diet awareness programs to promote healthy eating habits.

Negligence leaves Yazman Road in filth,"US
Faulty construction blamed for collapse of sewerage project
A major thoroughfare in Bahawalpur has turned into a virtual sewage drain, causing distress among residents and raising questions about the integrity of a multi-million rupee public project.
Yazman Road, particularly the stretch in front of Islami Colony, has become inundated with stagnant sewage water due to the failure of a recently installed drainage system.
The resulting foul stench and unsanitary conditions have alarmed residents, who fear a potential outbreak of waterborne diseases.
According to government sources, the area faced similar sewerage issues nearly 18 months ago.
To address the problem, authorities approved a high-cost development scheme that included the laying of new sewerage pipelines and the reconstruction of the road. However, the effort appears to have been in vain.
Sub-engineer Mudassar, formerly with the Tehsil Municipal Administration (TMA) and now posted in the District Council, disclosed that the project was awarded to Madina Construction Company, reportedly owned by Bilal Randhawa, an SDO posted in the Public Health Department.
""The project was flawed from the start,"" said Mudassar. ""Even after its completion, sewage could not flow properly through the installed pipes. The only reason the system worked temporarily was due to extensive cleaning at the time.""
He further claimed that little to no attention was paid to critical technical details during the construction process, leading to a complete collapse of the system once again.
Residents of Islami Colony and nearby neighborhoods have voiced frustration at the inaction of local authorities.
""Senior government officers travel this route daily, yet they ignore the open drain right under their noses,"" said one local resident.
Despite repeated complaints, no action has been taken against either the contractor or the public health officials responsible for the failed project.
Locals have appealed to the authorities to intervene immediately. They are demanding not only the urgent repair of the road and drainage system but also strict legal action against the officials and contractors responsible for the substandard work.
""The entire area is suffering because of their negligence. We need accountability, not just broken promises,"" a resident added.

Reimagining institutions,"US
Academic institutions are built over a long time.
The new restrictions on US student visas, and the uncertainty around them, are likely to cause tremendous anxiety among current and prospective international students. Happening right at the time when students apply for visas and prepare for the beginning of a new journey in their lives, the new policies are taking a toll on the students and their families.
One hopes that those around the impacted students would react with a sense of empathy, understanding and support, and not through sermons on why these policies are good for everyone, and will end the so-called 'brain drain'.
Too often, wrapped in the conversation of students who choose to study abroad is a sentiment that people leave because they are fundamentally unpatriotic or greedy.
My own experience meeting students who come abroad for undergraduate or graduate education, as I have discussed in these pages before, is quite different.
The patriotism question is one that does not merit any discussion anyway. No one has a barometer to measure patriotism, and recent history of the country has given us plenty of information about the deeds of those who claim to be the high priests of patriotism.
Students come to universities abroad because of a simple calculus - it offers something that institutions close to them do not. In many cases, it is the educational environment and the learning opportunity in areas that the students are deeply passionate about, in others it is the set of skills that offer prospects of a robust career, and in some it is the opportunity to escape economic and social injustice.
We know from the history of the Soviet satellite states that keeping people from leaving for better opportunities (economic or educational) does not quite work out in the long term. While the barriers to leave were high until the fall of the Berlin wall, but as the wall came down (as all walls tend to do), people from the satellite states left in droves. That trend continues some three decades later.
There is, however, another way to think about this question. It is possible (perhaps likely) that some students will take another look at local institutions. Perhaps it is an opportunity for those institutions to take a look at themselves.
There is no question that lack of financial resources impact the ability of our institutions to attract students, but that is not the complete story. We know that for many of our public institutions, there are serious governance issues at play as well (recent issues around appointment of VCs in multiple provinces is just one example).
So is the question of honest inquiry - the most precious value of any academic institution. Regardless of how well resourced an institution may be, we all know that honest questions about a whole range of topics remain prohibited. The inability to question, debate or be uncomfortable undermines the very mission of a university.
Institutions in the US are far from perfect. The events of the recent past have shown that there is actually a bigger gap, than previously appreciated, between stated goals and actual practice at these institutions.
Yet, for a whole host of reasons, these institutions continue to attract international students from around the world. For some it is a chance at a better life, and for many, it is the opportunity to delve in subjects that they absolutely love but are considered 'useless' by the society at large - which is everything in humanities and nearly everything in social or physical sciences that is not the most recent fad or is likely to land a lucrative job.
Academic institutions are built over a long time. The process is often painfully slow - yet there are moments in the history of institutions when its leaders take stock of the world around them, and act deliberately to reimagine a different institution. An institution that reflects deeply on its past, and charts a different path for its future than the one that it was on. For our institutions, this may be one such moment.

MYT impact estimated at over Rs300b,"US
Consumers will have to pay billions of rupees under new KE multiyear tariff
The Power Division has challenged the regulator's decision on granting a multiyear tariff (MYT) to K-Electric (KE), alleging that it will allow the company to collect over Rs300 billion from consumers.
""The total financial impact is in excess of Rs300 billion of the interventions identified for review by the government of Pakistan in the KE MYT,"" the division said in a review petition submitted to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
It has asked Nepra to revisit its recent approval of electricity rates for KE, Karachi's main power supplier. KE's new tariffs come into effect from financial year 2024-25 and will run through FY30.
The government believes that Nepra has allowed several cost items and profit margins to KE that are higher or more favourable than for any other utility in Pakistan, resulting in unnecessarily high bills for consumers and extra pressure on public finances.
The Power Division has raised serious concerns over the preferential treatment granted to KE. Nepra set KE's fuel cost benchmark at Rs15.99 per kilowatt-hour (kWh), significantly higher than the rates paid by other utilities purchasing power from the national grid. This discrepancy adds Rs28 billion in FY24 and Rs13 billion in FY25 to the federal budget, shielding KE customers from these costs.
KE also received a ""recovery loss allowance,"" despite its actual recoveries exceeding the threshold set by Nepra. No other utility enjoys this privilege, which has generated Rs36 billion in FY24 and Rs35 billion in FY25 for KE, amounting to over Rs200 billion in seven years.
Furthermore, Nepra allowed KE a 24% markup on working capital – higher than any other utility – boosting revenue by Rs2.4 billion in FY24 and Rs15 billion over seven years. Additionally, a higher distribution loss target of 13.90% (vs KE's own 13.46%) was set, passing Rs3.1 billion in FY24 and Rs21 billion over the seven-year period on to consumers. A unique 2% ""law and order"" margin was granted to KE, despite an improved security situation. This adds Rs14 billion in FY24 and Rs99 billion over seven years. KE was also allowed to retain ""other income"" from fines and investments, which should have offset customer costs.
Transmission losses were overestimated at 1.30% (vs actual around 0.75%), and KE keeps 75% of savings, creating inefficiency and costing Rs4 billion in FY24 and Rs28 billion over the seven-year period.
Excessive returns were also permitted. KE enjoys a 12% return on equity (RoE) in US dollar (around 24.46% in Pakistani rupee) on generation, compared to National Transmission and Despatch Company's (NTDC) 15% in rupees, and 14% RoE in US dollar (around 29.68% in PKR) on distribution, far exceeding the 14.47% RoE in rupees for others like the Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco).
Idle KE power plants still receive capacity payments, costing Rs12.7 billion in FY25 and Rs82.5 billion overall. Generous inflation indexation and a 17% RoE for these plants further strain finances.
The Power Division urged Nepra to align KE's tariff structure with national standards to ensure fairness, transparency and affordability, stressing the need to eliminate unjustified allowances and ensure equal treatment for all utilities.
KE eyes DISCO acquisitions
K-Electric held a corporate analyst briefing on Monday to provide insights into its recently approved tariffs and operational updates. The company expressed openness to acquiring other DISCOs (distribution companies), should the privatisation process move forward, according to Arif Habib Limited.
Its management highlighted that KE's total generation capacity currently stands at 2,397 megawatts (MW) from internal sources, while it procures over 1,600 MW externally. With the anticipated completion of NTDC interconnection projects, an additional 400 MW is expected to be integrated into its grid.
The utility's robust transmission network now comprises 7,095 MVAs capacity, 74 grid stations and 1,394 km of lines, while its distribution infrastructure includes 8,964 MVAs capacity, 2,112 feeders and over 31,000 pole-mounted transformers (PMTs).
Since its privatisation in 2005, KE has added 1,957 MW to its generation capacity, improved efficiency from 30% to nearly 46%, doubled transmission capacity and cut transmission and distribution (T&D) losses from 34.2% to 16%.
The utility estimates a cumulative saving of Rs900 billion for the government and consumers, alongside annual fiscal savings of Rs164 billion due to lower aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses. Nepra has approved a multi-year tariff (MYT) structure of Rs39.98/kWh for KE, lower than the utility's request for Rs44/kWh. Return on equity (RoE) has been set at 14% for generation/distribution and 12% for transmission, with a 70:30 D/E ratio. The cost of local and foreign debt has been capped at Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor) + 2% and Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) + 4.5%, respectively.

"Trump, Xi will 'likely' talk this week","US
Stock markets around the world mostly slid on Monday as the US-China tensions resurfaced.
US President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping will likely hold a long-awaited call later this week, the White House said Monday, as trade tensions between the world's two biggest economies ratchet back up.
Trump reignited strains with China last week when he accused the world's second-biggest economy of violating a deal that had led both countries to temporarily reduce huge tit-for-tat tariffs.
""The two leaders will likely talk this week,"" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing when asked whether Trump and Xi would speak.
Trump and Xi have yet to have any confirmed contact more than five months since the Republican returned to power, despite frequent claims by the US president that a call is imminent.
Trump even said in a Time Magazine interview in April that Xi had called him -- but Beijing insisted that there had been no call recently.
Stock markets around the world mostly slid on Monday as the US-China tensions resurfaced.
Trump in early April introduced sweeping worldwide tariffs that targeted China most heavily of all, accusing other countries of ""ripping off"" the United States and running trade imbalances.
Beijing and Washington last month agreed to slash staggeringly high tariffs on each other for 90 days after talks between top officials in Geneva.
But Trump and top US officials Washington officials last week accused China of violating the deal, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying Beijing was ""slow-rolling"" the agreement in comments to Fox News Sunday.
Beijing rejected those ""bogus"" US claims on Monday, and accused Washington of introducing ""a number of discriminatory restrictive measures."" AFP

South Asia's David vs Goliath,"PK
This confrontation was a focal event in South Asian security and Indo-Pak relations.
The recent Indo-Pak duel was an indicator of a worsening security dilemma in South Asia. Since 2016, New Delhi has adopted a policy of cost imposition on Islamabad for their support of the Kashmir cause.
For Pakistan, the Kashmir cause is tied to its national fabric; for India, it remains a constant security concern. This issue is likely to persist despite India's show of military and conventional capability in 2019 and again in the early hours of May 7, 2025.
The calculus among Indian strategists appears to be shifting towards a mix of vertical and horizontal escalation, designed to pressure Pakistan into accepting India's political, diplomatic and military primacy in the region.
However, Pakistan's strategic culture is unlikely to shift, and in the case of direct confrontation, both countries are unlikely to back down. This increases the likelihood of more focus on hard security and balance-of-power politics in the region.
Around 1:30 AM on May 7, reports emerged of multiple strikes on locations in mainland Pakistan. An Indian PIB press release later confirmed the strikes were part of Operation Sindoor, a retaliatory mission following an insurgent attack in Pahalgam.
The Indian media framed the operation in two ways: as a political victory for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and as a display of India's rising military influence.
The strikes were conducted using Indian Air Force aerial assets, targeting nine locations with precision munitions, launched from within Indian airspace.
As the attack was underway, Pakistan reportedly initiated defensive measures, resulting in an air-to-air engagement between the PAF and IAF.
Pakistan's ISPR claimed six Indian aircraft were downed. Even critical voices like Christine Fair considered it likely that at least two Dassault Rafales had been lost. This not only marked the loss of high-value equipment but also hurt India's military image.
Operation Sindoor, which was likely meant to be a strategic warning to Pakistan and a symbolic flex to Beijing, ended up escalating risks in the region.
The seriousness of the situation became clear when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called a meeting of NCA - the body overseeing nuclear weapons policy. As tensions climbed, so began UAV-based surveillance missions from both sides to probe air-defence systems. Hours before Pakistan's anticipated response, the IAF launched another wave of strikes targeting airbases, including Nur Khan near Islamabad.
On May 10, Pakistan launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos i.e. an unbreakable barrier. It targeted 27 locations inside India, three times the number hit by Operation Sindoor.
The strike package included Fatah-1 short-range ballistic missiles, PAF aircraft, loitering munitions and cyber assets.
The goal was to reject any idea of a ""new normal"" and re-establish strategic balance with India. This response was calculated, rapid, and likely met its intended signal. The skirmish ended just as quickly as it escalated, with both sides claiming that the other had called for a ceasefire.
This confrontation was a focal event in South Asian security and Indo-Pak relations. It introduced new elements of escalation: drones, cyberattacks and long-range standoff munitions. Both sides revealed parts of their strategic calculus. Operation Sindoor was disproportionate in scale for a response to a localised insurgent attack. Pakistan's retaliation, however, denied India any clear advantage and pushed back against claims of conventional superiority. Pakistan asserted it had downed six aircraft, destroyed an S-400 battery, and struck an Indian military HQ in Kashmir and a BrahMos facility. While such claims are debated, India's missteps were clear: underestimating Pakistan's willingness to respond; misreading its civil-military resolve; and believing further escalation would serve as deterrence.
For policymakers in Pakistan, the answer to Indian aggression may not lie only in conventional or nuclear means. Like David against Goliath, Pakistan must strike the sensors that give India an edge. Building electronic warfare, cyber tools and AI-enabled systems should be a priority. Pakistan also needs an information warfare strategy to counter Indian propaganda and project its own narrative clearly and credibly.

Inflation rate jumps tofive-month high of 3.5%,"US
Spike ends 18-month downtrend as CPI becomes double of govt's forecast; food, fuel prices put strain on households
Pakistan's annual inflation rate accelerated to 3.5% in May, the highest level in five months, due to a sudden spike in food prices ahead of the budget, breaking the downward spiral that had persisted for a year and a half.
The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) reported on Monday that the prices of a basket of essential goods and services rose at an average rate of 3.5% last month. This is the highest reading seen in the past five months and was contrary to official expectations. Nonetheless, it remains far below the fiscal year's inflation target of 12%.
In its monthly economic outlook report, the Ministry of Finance had projected inflation to remain between 1.5% and 2% in May. The actual rate was more than double that forecast and fell within the ministry's expectations for June, ahead of the federal budget.
For June, the ministry has projected that inflation could rise to between 3% and 4%.
With the fresh inflation figure, the gap between headline inflation and the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) key policy rate has widened to 7.5%. The banking sector continues to benefit from elevated interest rates, at the expense of the rest of the country.
Last month, the Monetary Policy Committee cut the policy rate by 100 basis points to 11%, citing a sustained decline in inflation. Despite the high rates, the money supply grew by 4.7% in May. For the upcoming fiscal year, the government has set a 7.5% inflation target, allowing further room for interest rate cuts.
Average inflation during the first 11 months (July-May) of the current fiscal year slowed to 4.6%, significantly below the annual target of 12%. This lower average inflation rate will form the basis upon which the increase in pensions and salaries of the government employees will be determined.
The government is considering an increase of 6% to 10% in wages and pensions, in line with the reduced average inflation.
Core inflation excluding food and energy eased in both urban and rural areas, dropping to 7.3% in cities and 8.8% in rural areas, according to PBS.
Average core inflation remains about 3% below the policy rate, providing further space for the SBP to reduce interest rates. However, under International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy, the government switched the benchmark for borrowing costs from core to headline inflation nearly four years ago.
Urban inflation rose to 3.5%, driven by rising food costs. In rural areas, prices turned positive again, with inflation recorded at 3.4% in May.
PBS compiles inflation data from 35 cities and tracks 356 consumer items. In rural regions, data is collected from 27 centres and includes 244 items.
The PBS data showed that food prices resumed their upward trend. Urban food inflation was recorded at 5.3%, and rural food inflation at 2.1%. Chicken prices soared 52% last month, followed by a one-third increase in pulses, a 30% rise in fresh fruits, 26% in butter, 22% in powdered milk, and 21% in sugar.
The government failed to honour its promise of keeping sugar prices in check, following last year's decision to allow exports. The rise in sugar prices is also boosting tax revenues, as the government has linked the 18% sales tax on sugar to the fortnightly inflation rate.
Meat prices increased by 12%, while fresh milk rose by 10%.
Onion prices remained 54% lower compared to a year ago, while tomato prices dropped 32%, wheat 24%, and tea 18%. Non-perishable food items saw a 5.1% increase in inflation last month.
Electricity charges were 29% lower year-on-year, while petrol remained 8% cheaper despite increased taxation. Although global crude oil prices have remained largely stable, the depreciation of the rupee led the government to pass on a Rs3.5 per litre impact on petrol and Rs1 per litre on diesel.
Global crude prices are not expected to rise significantly, and overall commodity prices are projected to decline by 15% this year.

First Eid train departs from Karachi,"US
.
With Eidul Azha around the corner, Pakistan Railways flagged off its first special train from Karachi Cantt Station to Lahore on Monday, sending hundreds of homebound passengers on their way with smiles and suitcases in tow.
The emotional pull of reuniting with loved ones lit up weary faces as passengers boarded amid a flurry of activity.
According to railway officials, the first special train comprises one business class coach, one AC standard coach, eight economy class coaches, and one power van, accommodating around 700 passengers.
The train will make scheduled stops at nine major stations during its journey: Hyderabad, Rohri, Rahim Yar Khan, Bahawalpur, Multan, Sahiwal, Okara and Kot Lakhpat.
Passengers, expressing delight, said the journey offered them a long-awaited opportunity to visit their native towns and meet relatives, describing it as a ""blessing after a long time"".
The divisional superintendent (DS) of Pakistan Railways Karachi Division, Mehmood-ur-Rehman Lakho, visited the platform to inspect the travel arrangements aboard the special train. He said more special trains will be dispatched in the coming days to facilitate as many travellers as possible during the Eid holidays.
Meanwhile, the federal government has announced a major Eid relief, setting a special discount on train fares for the three days of Eidul Azha.

Immerse yourself into 'The Matrix',"US
Classic sci-fi to release in 3D, dome-style screens
In a Los Angeles theatre, a trench coat-wearing Neo bends backwards to dodge bullets that spiral over the viewer's head, as the sound of gunfire erupts from everywhere.
This new immersive experience is designed to be a red pill moment that will get film fans off their couches at a time when the movie industry is desperate to bring back audiences, as reported by AFP.
Cosm, which has venues in Los Angeles and Dallas, is launching its dome-style screen and 3D sets in June with a ""shared reality"" version of The Matrix, the cult 1999 film starring Keanu Reeves as a man who suddenly learns his world is a fiction.
""We believe the future will be more immersive and more experiential,"" said Cosm president Jeb Terry at a recent preview screening.
""It's trying to create an additive, a new experience, ideally non-cannibalistic, so that the industry can continue to thrive across all formats.""
Cinema audiences were already dwindling when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out, shuttering theaters at a time when streaming was exploding. With ever bigger and better TVs available for the home, the challenge for theater owners is to offer something that film buffs cannot get in their living room.
Prestige projects like Tom Cruise's Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning or Christopher Nolan's Oscar-winning Oppenheimer increasingly opt for the huge screens and superior film quality of IMAX.
But Cosm and other projects like it want to go one step further, collaborating with designers who have worked with Cirque du Soleil to create an environment in which the viewer feels like they are inside the film.
For filmmakers, it's all about how you place the cameras and where you capture the sound, said Jay Rinsky, founder of Little Cinema, a creative studio specialising in immersive experiences.
""We create sets like the Parisian opera, let the movie be the singer, follow the tone, highlight the emotions through light, through production design, through 3D environments,"" he said.
The approach, he said, felt particularly well suited to The Matrix, which he called ""a masterpiece of cinema, but done as a rectangle.""
For the uninitiated: Reeves's Neo is a computer hacker who starts poking around in a life that doesn't quite seem to fit.
A mysterious Laurence Fishburne offers him a blue pill that will leave him where he is, or a red pill that will show him he is a slave whose body is being farmed by AI machines while his conscious lives in a computer simulation.
There follows much gunfire, lots of martial arts and some mysticism, along with a romance between Neo and Trinity, played by the leather-clad Carrie-Anne Moss.
The Matrix in shared reality kicks off with a choice of cocktails – blue or red, of course – which are consumed as the audience sits surrounded by high-definition screens.
Shifting perspectives place the viewer inside Neo's office cubicle, or seemingly in peril.
""They're sometimes inside the character's head,"" said Rinsky.
""The world changes as you look up and down for trucks coming at you."" The result impressed those who were at the preview screening.
""It just did feel like an experience,"" influencer Vince Rossi told AFP. ""It almost feels like you're at a theme park for a movie.""

'Flamethrower' attacker facing US federal hate charges,"US
He blamed ""Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy"" for allowing Soliman into the country.
The man suspected of a Molotov cocktail attack on Jewish protesters in Colorado was facing federal hate crime charges on Monday, with the government saying he was in the United States illegally.
Mohamed Sabry Soliman is alleged to have thrown Molotov cocktails and sprayed burning gasoline in Boulder on Sunday at a gathering in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
Eight people were hurt in the attack -- four men and four women -- with the oldest reportedly being 88 years old.
FBI agent Mark Michalek said the suspect used ""a makeshift flamethrower"" and ""was heard to yell: 'Free Palestine,'"" during the incident.
An FBI affidavit said Soliman had been planning the assault for a year.
""He stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,"" the affidavit says.
""He hated this group and needed to stop them from taking over 'our land,' which he explained to be Palestine.""
Agents said they had found at least 14 unused Molotov cocktails and a backpack weed sprayer containing gasoline.
US Homeland Security officials said he was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.
President Donald Trump lashed out at his predecessor, Joe Biden, over the incident.
""Yesterday's horrific attack in Boulder, Colorado, WILL NOT BE TOLERATED in the United States of America,"" Trump said on his Truth Social network, describing it as a ""terrible tragedy.""
He blamed ""Biden's ridiculous Open Border Policy"" for allowing Soliman into the country.
""This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland,"" he wrote.
The attack occurred on Sunday afternoon during a regular demonstration in support of hostages taken in the assault on Israel by Hamas gunmen on October 7, 2023.
In one video that purportedly shows the attack, a shirtless man holding bottles in his hands is seen pacing as the grass in front of him burns.
He can be heard screaming ""End Zionists!"" and ""They are killers!"" towards several people in red T-shirts as they tend to a person lying on the ground. AFP

Britain unveils radical defence overhaul,"RO
UK to build attack submarines to counter new security paradigm
Britain announced on Monday that it would build 12 new attack submarines as it launched a major defence review to move the country to ""war-fighting readiness"" in the face of ""Russian aggression"" and the changing nature of conflict.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that ""the threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,"" as he launched the review in Glasgow.
""We face war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyberattacks, growing Russian aggression in our waters, menacing our skies,"" he added.
The Strategic Defence Review, which assesses threats facing the UK and makes recommendations, said that Britain was entering ""a new era of threat"". As a result, Starmer said his government aimed to deliver three ""fundamental changes"".
""First, we are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces,"" he said.
""Every part of society, every citizen of this country, has a role to play, because we have to recognise that things have changed in the world of today. The front line, if you like, is here.""
Secondly, the prime minister insisted that UK defence policy would ""always be NATO first"", and finally that the UK ""will innovate and accelerate innovation at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow.""
Addressing parliament later Monday, Defence Secretary John Healey said the world had entered a ""new era"" and vowed to make the UK army ""10 times more lethal"" by combining future drone technology and artificial intelligence with the ""heavy metal of tanks and artillery"".
""We face war in Europe, growing Russian aggression, new nuclear risks and daily cyberattacks at home,"" he said.
""Our adversaries are working more in alliance with one another, while technology is changing the way war is fought -- we are in a new era of threat."" AFP

Chicken prices drop in Peshawar,"US
.Despite steep decline in raw chicken prices, cost of chicken dishes at restaurants, food outlets remains unchanged
The price of poultry has dropped significantly, falling from Rs460 per kilogram to Rs380 within a week - a decrease of Rs80 per kilogram.
Despite the steep decline in raw chicken prices, the cost of chicken dishes at restaurants and fast-food outlets remains unchanged, drawing criticism from consumers.
As Eid-ul-Azha approaches, the poultry market has witnessed a notable dip in prices.
However, eateries across the city continue to sell chicken dishes at inflated rates, unchanged since prices peaked earlier this year.
Previously, when chicken prices surged to Rs500 per kilogram, restaurant and fast-food operators raised the prices of popular chicken dishes.
Now that chicken rates have dropped significantly, the public is questioning why those increased menu prices haven't been revised.

FinMin to approve budget honorariums,"DE
ECC approves new policy for grant of honorariums to govt employees
A cabinet body on Monday approved a new honorarium policy for the civil servants, giving discretionary powers to the finance minister to approve as many as budget honorariums for the employees of economic ministries, parliament and Prime Minister's Office, according to an official statement.
Headed by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet ""approved a summary by the Finance Division, outlining the policy for the grant of honorariums to the government employees"", it said.
The ECC authorised the finance minister to ""grant budget honorarium to the employees posted in Finance Division, Revenue Division, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Division, National Assembly Secretariat, Senate Secretariat and the Prime Minister's Office,"" according to the newly approved policy.
""The quantum of budget honorarium for each financial year shall be decided by the Finance Minister,"" reads the new policy that gives discretionary powers to the finance minister to dole out as many budget honorariums as he or she deems fit without any upper cap.
The tax rate for these budget honorariums will also be far lower than the standard income tax rates. According to the policy that is subject to the federal cabinet approval, ""taxation of honorarium will be on the lines of taxation of monetisation allowance"". The bureaucrats receiving monetisation allowance pay only 5% in income tax on the amount that they receive as monetisation allowance.
""The tax on payments under the Compulsory Monetisation of Transport Facility for Civil Servants in BS-20 to BS-22 (as reduced by deduction of driver's salary) shall be charged at the rate of 5% as a separate block of income"", reads the income tax law.
Responding to the queries from The Express Tribune, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that ""the grant of budget honorarium has always been with finance minister as chair of the ECC"".
He added that the finance minister was in best position to evaluate efforts in budget making exercise as his work entailed close working with all the economic ministries associated with budget formulation and implementation.
""Secondly the supposed discretionary power is exercised on the recommendations of Honorarium committees and PAOs and is further subjected to a delegated evaluation within each ministry's constituent units,"" added the minister.
Reposnding to another question about the tax rate on these honorariums, the finance minister stated that the ""budget honorarium is one time reward regime and therefore taxed at a different rate than salary"".
Overall, the new policy streamlines the rewards that the bureaucrats get over and above their standard salaries. Currently, the federal secretaries have been authorised to give one honorarium up to grade 18 officers in a fiscal year.
Above the Grade 18, the approval of the ECC chairman was required. According to the new policy, the federal secretary will be empowered to give one honorarium to all the employees, except to him or herself.
A new reward category is also announced for all the federal government employees. Currently, there is no reward regime in place for high performing individuals in the federal government, which is demotivating for high performing employees, according to the Finance Ministry.
Now, it has been decided that the federal secretary may grant one performance honorarium equal to one basic pay, on outstanding performance, to not more than 25% employees of a ministry or division in BPS 1-22, except for him or herself. The federal secretary's honorarium will be decided by the federal minister, according to the decision.
Except for one annual reward, one performance reward and as many as budget rewards as the finance minister wishes so, no other honorariums will be granted, including those associated with religious festivals such as Eid and Christmas, according to the new policy. Employees who have received budget honorarium will not be eligible for grant of ordinary and performance honorarium.
The new policy states that no honorarium will be paid in cash and all honorarium payments have to be reflected in payroll statements. The performance honorarium will not be granted by a ministry, if the employee has not served in such ministry for less than six month.
No honorarium, except for outstanding performance honorarium, will be granted before May 1, in any financial year. Employees who have received budget honorarium will not be eligible for grant of ordinary and performance honorarium.
If ordinary and performance honorarium has already been granted to an employee, who is being granted budget honorarium, the amount of budget honorarium will be adjusted against the already drawn performance honorarium. No employee will receive honorarium from more than one organisation.
Meanwhile, the ECC approved Rs61.2 billion in supplementary grants for various ministries, mainly for payment of short-term debt. It approved Rs1.7 billion for the ministry of defence ""for technological upgradation of the ISPR"", according to the Finance Ministry.
The meeting approved Rs1.3 billion in grant for the Finance Ministry to return the amount to the government of Sindh as unutilized funds from wheat seed cash reimbursement programme. It approved Rs40.3 billion for the Economic Affairs Division on account of revised budget estimates for FY2024-25 for repayment of short-term foreign loan credits.
The ECC also approved a summary by the Power Division for approval of a tripartite power purchase agreement of 1,145 MW Karachi Nuclear Plant Unit-2 (K-2) and Unit-3 (K-3) at Karachi.
The ECC considered a summary by the Commerce Ministry and approved an amendment in import policy order (IPO) for the state-owned defence production entities and their wholly-owned commercial subsidiaries. The ECC also approved a summary by the Housing Ministry for withdrawal of directives for transfer of Hyderabad Package and Karachi Package from the Government of Sindh to PIDCL.

Deadly heat waves, catastrophic floods and vanishing glaciers threaten millions of lives and livelihoods, making Pakistan one of the most vulnerable nations.
The country faces a climate emergency despite being an emitter of less than one per cent of global greenhouse emissions. ""We are in a fight for survival,"" said Saleem Shaikh, a spokesperson for Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination. ""But we are not to surrender to despair.

Anderson stars in T20 comeback,"US
He signs a 
one-year deal with Lancashire
England pace legend James Anderson marked a remarkable return to T20 cricket by delivering his career-best bowling figures in nearly 11 years, taking three wickets against Durham here at Chester-le-Street on Sunday.
Anderson was named in Lancashire's playing XI for their T20 Blast clash against Durham, his first T20 appearance since August 2014.
Anderson impressed with figures of 3/17 runs in his four overs, helping Lancashire secure a strong performance in the match. This marks his best bowling figures in the T20 format.
The 42-year-old Anderson, who retired from Test cricket last year as the world's leading wicket-taker among fast bowlers, had signed a one-year contract with Lancashire this season covering both the County Championship and the T20 Blast.
His international commitments had limited his appearances for Lancashire over the years, though he did feature once in the 2024 County Championship, picking up 7/35.
Anderson last played a T20 International for England in 2009 and an ODI in 2015, focusing primarily on Test cricket during his illustrious international career.
Since retiring from Tests, he has served as a consultant for the England men's team.
Lancashire started their 2025 Blast campaign on a strong note with victories over Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire on May 29 and May 31, respectively, despite ongoing struggles in the County Championship.
In the match against Durham, Anderson replaced Mitch Stanley in the side. Opening the bowling, he quickly made an impact by dismissing Durham openers Alex Lees and Graham Clark in his first spell.
He then returned later in the innings to claim the wicket of Colin Ackermann.
This comeback contrasts sharply with Anderson's last T20 appearance on August 23, 2014, in the Blast final against Warwickshire, where he went wicketless and conceded 52 runs in his four overs, with Lancashire losing by four runs.
Overall, Anderson has featured in 44 T20 matches, taking 41 wickets at an average of 32.14 and an economy rate of 8.47 runs per over.
Throughout his career, he has represented only Lancashire at the domestic level and England internationally.
