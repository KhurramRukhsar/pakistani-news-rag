Govt plans tax to counter India's water threat,"PL
Seeks IMF approval for 1% cess to fund Diamer-Bhasha, Mohmand dams completion
Pakistan has sought the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) permission to impose a special 1% tax on every taxable product produced in the country, except electrical energy and medicines, to fund two mega water storage dams as a solution to deal with Indian water aggression.
The decision to impose a new cess has been taken after majority of the provincial governments showed reluctance to finance the early completion of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and the Mohmand Dam, according to the sources in the Ministry of Water Resource and the Ministry of Finance.
However, the government was also meeting opposition from the IMF, which has urged the federal government to try to find a space within the approved Rs1 trillion federal Public Sector Development programme, the sources revealed.
The Diamer-Bhasha Dam worth Rs480 billion and Mohmand Dam – originally estimated to cost Rs310 billion – had been approved in 2018 but still a minimum Rs540 billion was needed for their completion.
India has threatened to cut water supplies after it held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance in violation of the treaty provisions and in the breach of the international law. Islamabad has plainly told India that any such act would be considered as an act of war.
The sources said that as an alternate strategy, Pakistan has decided to fast track the construction of the two dams. However, due to its political priorities and pressing demands by the coalition partners, the government has reduced the water sector development budget by 28% to Rs133 billion for the next fiscal year. Now it wants to offset this by introducing a new tax.
The sources said that the government has decided to levy a 1% cess on the gross value of all local taxable supplies to raise the additional funds, subject to the approval by the IMF and by parliament. They said that all the goods produced in Pakistan and subjected to tax are proposed to be charged at a new cess rate of 1%.
The goods that are currently exempted from the sales tax under the Sixth Schedule, or are charged at a zero rate under the Fifth Schedule of the sales tax law would be immune to the cess. Likewise, the electrical energy goods and pharmaceutical goods are proposed to be exempted from the new cess.
Cess is different from a normal tax and it can only be levied for a specific purpose, like the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) that had been imposed to fund Iran-Pakistan Gas Pipeline. Effectively, every good produced in Pakistan and consumed by all households would be subject to 1% new special tax, said the sources.
The Ministry of Finance spokesman Qumar Abbasi and the Secretary Water Resources Ministry Syed Ali Murtaza did not respond to the request for comments. They have been asked to confirm the development and also the IMF's position.
A senior Finance Ministry official said that the proposal was under consideration but the discussions with the IMF were still going on. He said that the cess would not be imposed through the Finance Act 2025, and instead a new separate bill will be introduced in parliament, subject to the IMF clearance.
In the case of GIDC, the Supreme Court has decided that the cess can only be levied for a specific purpose and it requires separate legislation. This binds the government's hands from introducing the cess through the Finance Act, which is currently under discussion in parliament.
The GIDC case is also an example of how the government is indifferent. The textile and fertiliser companies have not yet deposited over Rs400 billion in the kitty despite collecting those from the consumers. The finance and petroleum ministries are not able to make an effective strategy.
One of the options is that instead of levy a new 1% cess, the government should amend the GIDC law and divert the already collected money towards building dams.
On the intervention of the Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz, the government has again constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to recover the GIDC. But this committee too is moving at a snail's pace.
The sources said that the IMF's view was that the government should fund the dam projects from the PSDP instead of imposing more burden on the people.
However, the Ministry of Water Resources has informed the government that it would take 15 years to complete the Mohmand Dam and over 20 years to finish work on the Diamer-Bhasha Dam at the current pace of the budget allocations.
The PSDP is already overstretched and there is no space to fund these projects beyond the allocations made in the new budget, said Ahsan Iqbal, the federal minister for Planning and Development. He said that out of the Rs1 trillion allocations, effectively, Rs640 billion was available for funding the PSDP.
Iqbal said that the remaining Rs360 billion had been allocated for spending on N-25 Karachi-Quetta road, provincial schemes and special areas' allocations.
The sources said that after the National Economic Council (NEC) meeting earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also chaired a special meeting with the provinces to convince them to fund these two dams to deal with Indian aggression.
In a follow-up meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, the provinces except Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa showed reluctance to fund federal projects, said the sources.
The cost of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam had been estimated at Rs480 billion seven years ago and it still needs Rs365 billion more to complete the work against a price that is likely to increase further. For the next fiscal year, only Rs25 billion has been allocated for project, which is even less than this fiscal year.
Likewise, the Mohmand Dam was approved at a cost of Rs310 billion seven years ago and it still requires a minimum of Rs173 billion more at the old price. Only Rs35.7 billion has been allocated in the new fiscal year.
Earlier this week, Ahsan Iqbal said that the government has advanced the completion of both the projects by two years and these dams will be completed by 2030. He said that on completion, Pakistan will have 7 million acre feet of additional water storage capacity.
Pakistan's two reservoirs Tarbela and Mangla dams are facing storage related issues due to sedimentation and other technical issues.
The Sindh government has given a deficit budget for the next fiscal year and also showed zero-balance for the outgoing fiscal year. This has surprised many, as the provincial government had a cash surplus of Rs395 billion till March this year, according to the Ministry of Finance's fiscal operations summary.
For the next fiscal year, Sindh has shown a Rs38.5 billion deficit budget, which defeats the IMF's core objective of getting Rs1.4 trillion cash surpluses from all the four provinces.

Pakistan stands with Iran against Israeli atrocities: Nawaz,"US
.
PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has condemned Israel's ongoing actions against Iran, deploring them acts of ""oppression and excess"" and reaffirmed Pakistan's solidarity with the Iranian people.
In a brief interaction with journalists outside the Avenfield residence in London, Nawaz Sharif said Israel was currently committing ""oppression and injustice"".
""We were with Iran and we will continue to stand with Iran.""
The former premier's statement came amid escalating regional tensions following Israeli strikes inside Iranian territory, drawing widespread condemnation from across the Muslim world.
Pakistan, in official statements, has firmly supported Iran's right to self-defense and denounced Israel's military aggression, calling it a violation of international law.
Commenting on Pakistan's defense posture, Nawaz Sharif said that being a nuclear power was a blessing for the country, but added that the intent behind acquiring nuclear capability was to promote peace, not war.
""Pakistan being a nuclear country is a matter of good fortune,"" he said. ""We became a nuclear power not to wage war, but to establish peace.""
He called for global efforts toward stability and coexistence.
""There should be peace in the world,"" the former premier asserted. ""Israel has wronged Iran. What is happening is oppression. Just attacking someone like that and burning them down  this is not acceptable. In what kind of society does this happen?""
He said that Pakistan remained aligned with Iran against Israeli atrocities.
""Pakistan stood with Iran against Israeli atrocities and will continue to stand by it,"" he added.
The comments by the three-time prime minister come as Pakistan has condemned the Israeli actions, rejecting Tel Aviv's military action that has entered its fifth day, while advocating restraint, dialogue and adherence to international norms.

Iranian missiles pierce through Israeli air defences,"PK
Iranian state broadcaster hit 
  Tehran asks Arab states to intercede with Trump
  Iranian lawmakers float idea of q
An Israeli strike hit Iran's state broadcaster on Monday while the head of the UN nuclear watchdog indicated extensive damage to Iran's biggest uranium enrichment plant and Iran called on the US to force a ceasefire in the four-day-old aerial war.
Israeli forces have stepped up their bombardment of Iranian cities, while Iran proved capable of piercing Israeli air defences with one of its most successful volleys yet of retaliatory missile strikes.
""If President Trump is genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential,"" Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on X.
""Israel must halt its aggression, and absent a total cessation of military aggression against us, our responses will continue. It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu.""
Sources told Reuters that Tehran had asked Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Oman to press US President Donald Trump to use his influence on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and push for an immediate ceasefire.
In return, Iran would show flexibility in nuclear negotiations, said the two Iranian and three regional sources.
Netanyahu told troops at an air base that Israel was on its way to achieving its two main aims: wiping out Iran's nuclear programme and destroying its missiles. ""We are on the path to victory,"" he said. ""We are telling the citizens of Tehran: 'Evacuate' - and we are taking action.""
Late on Monday, Israel said it hit Iran's broadcasting authority, and footage showed a newsreader hurrying from her seat as a blast struck. Iran's State News Agency also reported the strike.
Iranian media said Iran was preparing for the ""largest and most intense missile attack"" yet against Israel, including against military and intelligence targets.
NATANZ DAMAGE
Israel launched its air war on Friday with a surprise attack that killed nearly the entire top echelon of Iran's military commanders and its leading nuclear scientists. It says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days.
Israel said it hit Iranian F-14 fighter planes at Tehran airport on Monday, and its airstrikes have also put at least two of Iran's three operating uranium enrichment plants out of action.
Rafael Grossi, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told the BBC on Monday it was very likely all the roughly 15,000 centrifuges operating at Iran's biggest uranium enrichment plant at Natanz were badly damaged or destroyed because of a power cut caused by an Israeli strike. There had been very limited or no damage at the separate Fordow plant, he said.
Tehran's retaliation is the first time in decades of shadow war and proxy conflict that missiles fired from Iran have pierced Israeli defences in significant numbers and killed Israelis in their homes.
Iran says more than 224 Iranians have been killed, most of them civilians. Media published images of wounded children, women, and the elderly from cities across the country.
State TV broadcast scenes of collapsed presidential buildings, burned-out cars, and shattered streets in Tehran. Many residents were trying to flee the capital, describing queues for petrol and bank machines that were out of cash.
""I am desperate. My two children are scared and cannot sleep at night because of the sound of air defence and attacks, explosions. But we have nowhere to go. We hid under our dining table,"" Gholamreza Mohammadi, 48, a civil servant, told Reuters by phone from Tehran.
In Israel, 24 people have been killed so far in Iran's missile attacks, all of them civilians. Round-the-clock television images showed rescuers working in ruins of flattened homes.
""It's terrifying because it's so unknown,"" said Guydo Tetelbaum, 31, a chef in Tel Aviv who was in his apartment when the alerts came in shortly after 4am. He went to a public shelter and was inside when the door was blown in.
Trump has consistently said the Israeli assault could end quickly if Iran agrees to US demands that it accept strict curbs to its nuclear programme. ""I'd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late,"" Trump said at a G7 meeting in Canada.
Talks between the United States and Iran, hosted by Oman, had been scheduled for Sunday but were scrapped, with Tehran saying it could not negotiate while under attack. On Monday, Iranian lawmakers floated the idea of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a move bound to be seen as a setback for any negotiations.
'PAYING THE PRICE'
Before dawn on Monday, Iranian missiles struck Tel Aviv and Haifa, killing at least eight people and destroying homes. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said the latest attack employed a new method that caused Israel's multi-layered defence systems to target each other so missiles could get through.
Global oil prices eased on Monday, suggesting traders think exports could be spared despite Israeli attacks on domestic Iranian oil and gas targets.
The sudden killing of so many Iranian military commanders and the apparent loss of control of airspace could prove to be the biggest test of Iran's system of clerical rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Iran's network of regional allies who could once have been expected to rain rockets on Israel - Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon - have been decimated by Israeli forces since the start of the Gaza war.
Netanyahu has said that, while toppling the Iranian government is not Israel's primary aim, it believes that could be the outcome.

Influencers rethink visibility after Sana Yousaf murder
Since seeing thousands of comments justifying the recent murder of a teenage TikTok star in Pakistan, Sunaina Bukhari is considering abandoning her 88,000 followers.
""In my family, it wasn't an accepted profession at all, but I'd managed to convince them, and even ended up setting up my own business,"" she said.
Then last week, Sana Yousaf was shot dead outside her house in the capital Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.
News of the murder led to an outpouring of comments under her final post – her 17th birthday celebration where she blew out the candles on a cake. In between condolence messages, some blamed her for her own death: ""You reap what you sow"" or ""it's deserved, she was tarnishing Islam"".
Yousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media, where she shared her favourite cafes, skincare products and traditional shalwar kameez outfits.
TikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.
But as TikTok's views have surged, so have efforts to police the platform.
Pakistani telecommunications authorities have repeatedly blocked or threatened to block the app over what it calls ""immoral behaviour"", amid backlash against LGBTQ and sexual content.
TikTok has pledged to better moderate content and blocked millions of videos that do not meet its community guidelines as well as at the request of Pakistan authorities.
After Yousaf's murder, Bukhari, 28, said her family no longer backs her involvement in the industry.
""I'm the first influencer in my family, and maybe the last,"" she told AFP.
'Fear of being judged'
Only 30 per cent of women in Pakistan own a smartphone compared to twice as many men (58 per cent), the largest gap in the world, according to the Mobile Gender Gap Report of 2025.
""Friends and family often discourage them from using social media for fear of being judged,"" said a statement from the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF).
In southwestern Balochistan, where tribal law governs many rural areas, a man confessed to orchestrating the murder of his 14-year-old daughter earlier this year over TikTok videos that he said compromised her honour.
In October, police in Karachi, in the south, announced the arrest of a man who had killed four women relatives over ""indecent"" TikTok videos.
These murders each revive memories of Qandeel Baloch, dubbed Pakistan's Kim Kardashian and one of the country's first breakout social media stars whose videos shot her to fame.
After years in the spotlight, she was suffocated by her brother.
Violence against women is pervasive in Pakistan, according to the country's Human Rights Commission, and cases of women being attacked after rejecting men are not uncommon.
""This isn't one crazy man, this is a culture,"" said Kanwal Ahmed, who leads a closed Facebook group of 300,000 women to share advice.
""Every woman in Pakistan knows this fear. Whether she's on TikTok or has a private Instagram with 50 followers, men show up. In her DMs. In her comments. On her street,"" she wrote in a post. ""The misogyny and the patriarchy that is prevalent in this society is reflected on the online spaces,"" she added.
A 22-year-old man was arrested over Yousaf's murder and is due to appear in court next week. At a vigil in the capital last week, around 80 men and women gathered, holding placards that read ""no means no"".
""Social media has given us a voice, but the opposing voices are louder,"" said Hira, a young woman who joined the gathering.
The capital's police chief, Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, used a press conference to send a ""clear message"" to the public.
""If our sisters or daughters want to become influencers, professionally or as amateurs, we must encourage them,"" he said. afp

Singapore's Gen Z swaps pints for pour-overs,"US
Caffeine-fuelled raves usher in sober clubbing
Swaying to dance music and TikTok-fuelled pop under a disco ball, young punters are packed shoulder to shoulder while sipping on coffee, their energy powered by pour-overs rather than pints, reported AFP.
This is no underground rave, nor a brunch gone wild. It's a caffeine-powered daytime clubbing sesh - part of a growing wave of alcohol-free, Gen Z-driven events gaining traction in Singapore and elsewhere in the world.
At a recent event in Singapore's trendy Duxton district, the space was jammed by 4PM, with baristas churning out fancy coffees and DJs spinning back-to-back sets.
The crowd grooved with energy, even without the usual liquid courage.
""A lot of people think alcohol gives you the high, but caffeine sometimes can do that too,"" said Aden Low, 21, co-founder of Beans and Beats which organises coffee raves at different venues.
""That's why the atmosphere at our events tends to be quite energetic.""
The parties blend curated music with specialty coffee served in white paper cups. The vibe is light, friendly and very Gen Z.
""It's also the idea that this is a safe space,"" said Esther Low, 31, who was at the event in Duxton.
""When you go to a club setting, there's usually this underlying intention to hook up. So, for me, that's personally why I would prefer this.""
Several reports say Gen Z is chugging fewer pints than previous generations, with the sober curious movement gaining popularity on social media.
Sober curious people cut back on drinking or abstain altogether, often citing health reasons and better mental acuity.
""Changes in alcohol use have been observed in population surveys and cohort studies. Generally, alcohol use among young adults has decreased,"" the World Health Organisation said in a 2024 report.
Club culture update
From London to Los Angeles and Melbourne, similar coffee raves have swept up the social scene, appealing to young partygoers who also want to avoid hangovers.
Ashley Chean, a Singaporean student who has been alcohol-free for a year, said she appreciates these sober gatherings.
""When I lived in Paris, I realised I had a lot of alcoholic tendencies and I didn't want that to be my lifestyle,"" the 20-year-old told AFP. ""More and more of my friends are sober or sober curious.""
The coffee clubbing events are usually held in cafes and other spaces such as rooftop bars – as long as there's room for DJs and baristas to do their thing while people dance.
The parties typically end by late afternoon, just in time for golden hour selfies.
Besides the health benefits of avoiding alcohol, the events appeal to cost-conscious youth in Singapore, one of the most expensive cities in the world.
The excess drinking and hard-partying ways of Gen X - fuelled by anthems like the Beastie Boys' Fight for Your Right (to Party) and hip-hop videos glamorising club culture - are fading for members of Gen Z.
While organisers don't see Singapore's glitzy nightlife and clubbing being replaced, they hope their combination of beats and brews will keep the dance floor buzzing.
""As long as we bring the vibes, we'll be OK,"" said Ashley.

PSG cruise to 4-0 win as Atletico wilt in CWC,"US
Winners proved too hot to handle for their Spanish opponents in Group B clash
Newly crowned European Champions Paris Saint-Germain launched their bid for Club World Cup glory with a convincing 4-0 victory over Atletico Madrid on Sunday.
In searing heat at the Pasadena Rose Bowl east of Los Angeles, PSG proved too hot to handle for their Spanish opponents in an impressive opening Group B win.
Goals from Fabian Ruiz, Vitinha, Senny Mayulu and Lee Kang-In sealed the three points for PSG, who delighted a crowd of 80,619 with their adventurous attacking play in temperatures that reached 31 degrees Celsius (87.8 Fahrenheit) shortly after kick-off at midday local time.
""We did very very well in difficult conditions,"" PSG goalscorer Vitinha said. ""It was a good victory to start the competition.""
PSG coach Luis Enrique said the heat ""had an impact on the game.""
""The rhythm of our play was a bit lower than usual, but we were better,"" Enrique said. ""We trained at such a high level; this team loves to compete and we are ready to go as far as possible.""
Atletico coach Diego Simeone refused to blame the heat for his team's struggles.
""I cannot blame it on the heat -- we both played in the same weather conditions,"" Simeone said. ""They played much better than we did. They have amazing players and that's why they've just won everything.
""We played better in the second half. But Paris Saint-Germain is a wonderful team and they played a wonderful game.""
The French giants picked up where they had left off in their 5-0 Champions League final mauling of Inter Milan a fortnight earlier, quickly settling into their smooth passing game to control the early exchanges before taking the lead in the 19th minute.
A lovely passing move down the right saw the ball swiftly transferred to Georgian winger Khvicha Kvaratskhelia who deftly laid off into the path of Ruiz to sweep in a low finish for 1-0.
With Atletico struggling to gain any kind of a foothold in the contest, the Spanish side's frustration began to show.
Clement Lenglet was booked for a rash challenge on Moroccan international Achraf Hakimi in the 21st minute, and Robin Le Normand picked up Atletico's second yellow soon afterwards for bringing down Ruiz.
Disallowed goal
Atletico appeared to have hauled themselves back into the game early in the second half when Julian Alvarez rifled home a low finish to make it 2-1.
But the goal was chalked off after VAR spotted a bodycheck by Argentine midfielder Rodrigo De Paul on Desire Doue in the build-up.
That effort appeared to buoy Atletico for the remainder of the half, but despite playing with greater intensity they were unable to create a single shot on goal.

The climate clock is ticking!,"US
Across the world, nations are pledging to move toward cleaner futures
Each semester, we stand before a new cohort of students enrolled in environmental and renewable energy courses, young minds carrying a mix of curiosity, anxiety and cautious optimism. Some arrive hoping to find solutions to the growing ecological crises they witness; others seek clarity in a world where weather patterns grow chaotic, air quality declines and the future feels increasingly fragile. But beyond their immediate motivations lies a deeper truth: these students are not merely learners; they are emerging agents of change, preparing to step into roles that did not exist a generation ago, roles that require not just scientific literacy but ethical insight, critical thinking and the courage to reimagine systems that no longer serve a sustainable future.
Each time I begin a new semester, I remind myself that I am not just teaching a subject, I am addressing a generation standing at a historic crossroads. These students will not just interpret the future; they will invent it. I see in them the quiet urgency of youth: the drive to repair what's broken, to reimagine what's possible.
Across the world, nations are pledging to move toward cleaner futures. But bold declarations and future targets are not enough without robust infrastructure, inclusive innovation and practical implementation strategies. A gap has emerged between what is promised and what is possible, and it is into this gap that today's students must step with skill and confidence.
Take, for example, the global transport sector. While road and air travel are justifiably criticised for their carbon intensity, maritime shipping offers a more nuanced case. Ships, often overlooked in public discourse, are far more efficient in moving goods per ton over long distances. Yet they are increasingly burdened with one-size-fits-all regulatory models that ignore this comparative advantage. Such mismatched policies reflect a wider pattern: applying uniform solutions to complex, sector-specific problems.
As educators, we believe environmental regulation is essential. But it must be anchored in economic fairness and technological readiness. Otherwise, we risk transferring the costs of transition to those least equipped to carry them, especially in countries like ours, where the energy transition must contend with structural inequality, fragile infrastructure, and uneven access to resources.
This is why I urge my students to think critically. Whether discussing electric vehicles, battery production or sustainable fuels, I encourage them to look beyond the headlines. Yes, electric cars offer cleaner urban transport, but what about the emissions and ethics of mining lithium or cobalt? What about the global supply chains behind every 'clean' device?
Our responsibility is not simply to teach facts but to inspire systems thinking. We must cultivate a generation that not only understands how things work, but who questions who they work for and at what cost.
Pakistan is particularly vulnerable to climate-related disruptions. At the same time, it is rich in human capital and untapped ingenuity. If we truly want to participate in shaping a sustainable global economy, we must empower our youth, not just with degrees, but with vision, skills and purpose. Our students must become creators, not just consumers, of green solutions.
To them, we say: your work will be difficult. You will encounter resistance, complexity and compromise. But you are also stepping into the most meaningful opportunity of our time, to steer the future in a more just and resilient direction. Do not underestimate your capacity to influence policy, transform industry and redefine the way we live and produce energy.
Our classrooms are just the beginning. Whatever you take from them (i.e. the ideas, the questions, the courage) will shape cities, laws and landscapes. Environmental literacy and sustainable innovation will not be luxuries; they will be necessities.
The climate crisis is already unfolding, and we cannot afford to delay. Let us learn with depth, act with wisdom and lead with courage. The world is watching, and time is running out.

Punjab targets cash-only businesses with fines,"ZA
New finance bill also shifts to negative list regime to widen tax base, boost revenue
The Punjab government has introduced sweeping reforms to its tax system through a new finance bill presented to the provincial assembly on Monday. A major feature of the bill is a strict penalty regime targeting businesses that refuse to accept digital payments, with fines reaching up to Rs1 million.
The bill also transitions the Punjab Sales Tax on Services (PSTS) regime from a ""positive list"" to a ""negative list"" system under the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act 2012. This change aligns with global best practices and is expected to significantly expand the tax net. Under the new approach, only services explicitly listed in the negative list will be exempt from PSTS, meaning all others are taxable. A total of 26 service categories have been placed on this negative list.
Despite reducing its revenue estimates from Rs471 billion to Rs421 billion for FY25, the Punjab government has set an ambitious target of Rs524.7 billion in provincial tax revenues for FY26.
The proposed penalty for refusing electronic payments is substantial. Any person declining payments made via debit or credit cards, mobile wallets, or QR codes may face a fine of up to Rs1 million. The first violation will carry a minimum penalty of Rs400,000, with each subsequent violation costing no less than Rs300,000. In cases of three such violations, the business premises may be sealed for up to one month.
Additionally, the bill proposes enhanced penalties for non-compliance with the Electronic Invoice Monitoring System (EIMS), further reinforcing the government's move toward digitised documentation and payment systems.
Beyond these enforcement measures, the amendments introduce several technical reforms. These include limiting input tax adjustment to the standard tax rate, requiring apportionment of input tax adjustments for composite services based on tax rates, and clarifying tax liability division between withholding agents and service providers in company-to-company transactions.
Among the 26 services on the negative list and exempt from PSTS are public healthcare services provided by federal, provincial, or local governments, including doctor fees and hospital bed charges. Also exempt are cosmetic or reconstructive procedures performed exclusively for acid or burn victims.
General education services and education offered by public institutions are also exempt. Public transport, government-run postal and courier services (limited to government departments), and registration services (such as for passports or ID cards) are included in the negative list. Religious, cultural, and recreational services provided by the government - such as sports clubs, parks, museums, zoos, botanical gardens, and gyms - are tax-exempt.
Services provided by developers, builders, and promoters are exempt only if linked to government-sponsored affordable housing schemes or private housing schemes notified by the Punjab Housing and Town-Planning Agency (PHATA) under the relevant rules of 2020.
Also exempt are services provided by registered religious or charitable institutions and international NGOs approved by the federal government (subject to FBR exemption). Insurance services limited to marine insurance for exports and crop insurance also fall under the negative list.
Construction-related services, including water, gas, sanitation, electrical, mechanical, and turnkey projects, are exempt. Personal care services like salons, beauty parlours, spas, and slimming clinics are exempt only if their premises are not air-conditioned at any point in the fiscal year. Other exempt services include those provided by tour operators and travel agents for Hajj, Umrah, or Ziyarat, as well as air travel originating from Punjab for Hajj, Umrah, diplomats, and flight crew.
Storage services are tax-exempt if related to agricultural produce stored for personal consumption. Photography and videography services provided by individual non-corporate operators working from roadside shops are also included.
Diplomatic missions and residential rentals are fully exempt. Services involving execution of work contracts and supply arrangements, advertising via radio and TV, and diagnostic tests strictly for medical treatment are exempt as well. Toll or job-based manufacturing, classified advertisements in print media, and currency exchange services provided by licensed foreign exchange dealers are also in the negative list. Lastly, port and terminal operator services, including bonded warehouse operations at airports, seaports, and dry ports, are exempt from sales tax under the new framework.

"Rupee loses 21 paisa on imports, global woes","PK
The rupee has depreciated by 1.63% so far in the current calendar year
The Pakistani rupee on Monday lost 21 paisa, or 0.07%, reaching its lowest level in 18 months against the US dollar amid rising import demand and evolving geopolitical factors.
By the end of trading, the rupee stood at 283.17/$, down 21 paisa compared to the previous day. This marks the first time the currency has touched the 283 level since December 2023.
The rupee remains under pressure due to increased import payments and ongoing debt repayments. Over the past week, the currency lost 0.28%, or 79 paisa, settling at 282.96 against the dollar, compared to the prior week's close at 282.17, as per data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
The rupee has depreciated by 1.63% so far in the current calendar year and by 1.71% in the current fiscal year, according to Ismail Iqbal Securities.
Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan General Secretary Zafar Paracha said the rupee has remained relatively stable compared to past crises, despite recent geopolitical tensions. He noted that unlike previous situations when the dollar surged sharply, the market has been managed better this time around.
However, ongoing tensions and uncertainty have led to a slight depreciation of the rupee and rise in gold prices. Paracha also highlighted reduced remittances and increased capital outflows during recent India-Pakistan tensions, with some investors turning to alternatives like cryptocurrencies. Gold prices in Pakistan fell on Monday, mirroring the decline in the international market where bullion slipped over 1% as investors booked profits following an eight-week high. Market participants also remained cautious due to escalating Israel-Iran tensions and the upcoming US Federal Reserve policy meeting.
In the domestic market, the price of gold per tola dipped Rs700 to settle at Rs362,300. Likewise, the price of 10 grams of gold decreased Rs600 to Rs310,613, according to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association.

France shuts Israeli weapons booths at Paris Air Show,"US
.
Geopolitical tensions roiled the opening of the Paris Air Show on Monday as French authorities sealed off Israeli weapons industry booths amid the conflicts in Iran and Gaza, a move that Israel condemned as ""outrageous"".
The decision added drama to the major aerospace industry event, which was already under the shadow of last week's deadly crash of Air India's Boeing 787 Dreamliner.
Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defence firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.
The booths displayed ""offensive weapons"" that could be used in Gaza -- in violation of agreements with Israeli authorities, a French government source told AFP.
The French government has not given its exact definition of ""offensive"" or attack weapons.

Pak-made football gets global acclaim,"PL
Fifa Club World Cup 25 Pro Ball is a player's delight
As the Fifa Club World Cup 2025 kicks off in the United States this weekend, all eyes aren't just on the competing teams but also on a crucial piece of equipment: the official match ball.
Unveiled earlier this year by Adidas, the Fifa Club World Cup 25 Pro Ball is garnering significant attention not only for its striking stars-and-stripes design but also for its remarkable performance, advanced engineering, and notably, its ""Made in Pakistan"" label.
Sam Handy, Adidas' general manager for football, described the ball as the culmination of 18 months of meticulous development. The aim, he stated, was to create something ""bold, loud, iconicand unmistakably American.""
However, behind its patriotic aesthetic lies a testament to Pakistan's manufacturing excellence and high-performance engineering, with the ball proudly produced in the South Asian nation.
Beyond its origins, the 2025 Club World Cup ball also marks a step towards greater sustainability as it is crafted entirely from polyurethane, this iteration is composed of 61% polyurethane, 30% recycled polyester, and 9% viscose, unlike previous versions.
It also features Adidas' innovative PRECISIONSHELL technology - a 20-panel, thermally bonded structure with strategically placed debossed grooves designed to improve airflow control and enhance flight consistency.
This construction is carried out in Pakistan, where the majority of the world's footballs are manufactured.
Testing conducted at Loughborough University, a leading sports research institution in the UK, demonstrated the ball's superior performance.
Using both human players and a robotic kicker, researchers compared the new Adidas model with balls from the Premier League (Nike Flight), Carabao Cup (Puma Orbita 1), and FA Cup (Mitre Ultimax Pro).
While robot testing showed similar speed and spin across all models, player testing revealed ""noticeable differences,"" according to Professor Andy Harland, who oversaw the analysis.
Players achieved their fastest strikes and higher spin rates with the Club World Cup ballone even recorded more than double the spin compared to the Nike ball. One player remarked the ball ""hits truer for professionals,"" suggesting its design caters well to high-level, precision-based play.
Players observed that the ball felt firmer and had a smaller sweet spot, demanding more precise contact. However, they appreciated its consistency during open play, particularly for delivering long, accurate ground passes.
Despite the limited sample size, all three players registered their fastest strikes using the Club World Cup ball. ""It hits truer for the professionals,"" one player remarked afterward.
""You had to hit it more precisely,"" the players noted, highlighting that the Club World Cup ball has a smaller 'sweet spot' compared to others.
The players also described the distinct feel when striking the ball: ""Especially the Adidas (Club World Cup) ball, that felt rock-hard,"" one player said. ""It has no grip. Because you have the little grooves, you spin it more,"" another added.
Two players shared a similar verdict on where it excels: ""Probably better in open play. It would be good to hit a long pass with, a grasscutter (a long pass, kept low to the floor) would be perfect.""
All the balls were manufactured in Pakistan, which produces the majority of the world's footballs. The distinct construction of the Club World Cup edition is the reason players notice such differences when kicking it.
The ball also includes a motion sensor, sending data 500 times per second to aid in semi-automated offside decisions, player tracking, and touch-point identificationdemonstrating the merging of sport and smart technology.
Ultimately, Adidas has broken from the tradition of simply repainting an existing model. The Club World Cup ball isn't just a visual upgradeit's a technical overhaul, built for modern football.
With 63 matches on the horizon, the ball's real-world performance will be under close scrutiny. But so far, early signs suggest that this Pakistani-made marvel is ready to deliver on the biggest stage.

Captain Cummins flags Australia shake-up,"US
The defending champions suffered a five-wicket defeat against South Africa at Lord's
Australia could shake up their batting after crashing to South Africa in the World Test Championship final, with captain Pat Cummins saying a ""reset"" was needed ahead of three Tests in the West Indies and a home Ashes series.
The five-wicket defeat at Lord's on Saturday, after posting a 74-run first-innings lead, has renewed focus on Australia's top order which has struggled since opener David Warner retired 17 months ago.
The elevation of out-of-form Marnus Labuschagne as Usman Khawaja's fifth opening partner since Warner bowed out did not work, while the experiment of Cameron Green at three flopped.
The 38-year-old Khawaja is also under the microscope, scoring nought and six as his lean spell against pace continued.
Green made four in the first innings and lasted only two balls before departing for a duck in the second as the new-look top three managed a total of 49 runs in the match.
Australia's batting woes were laid bare, particularly in the second innings, when only a plucky unbeaten fifty from fast-bowler Mitchell Starc and 43 from wicketkeeper Alex Carey gave the Proteas a tough chase.
""There's probably quite a few people in the line-up that wish they could have done a little bit more,"" Cummins told reporters.
""The top three was an obvious one in this game.""
Fresh start
With the 2027 WTC cycle kicking off when Australia travel to the West Indies for a three-Test series beginning in Barbados on June 25, the skipper admitted ""it does feel like a little bit of a fresh start"".
""We've got a couple of weeks before the first Test in the Windies, so we'll sit down and have a bit of a think after we digest this game,"" he said.
""But for me, I think a new WTC cycle in some ways does feel like a bit of a reset.
""It's probably more for the selectors and for me to sit down and map it ahead.""
Compounding Australia's woes, veteran Steve Smith, who hit a majestic first innings' 66, is doubtful for the first West Indies Test after dislocating his finger.
If he is ruled out, gung-ho teenager Sam Konstas, who played two Tests against India last summer before being dropped, could slot back in alongside Khawaja.
That would allow Labuschagne to drop back to three, should he survive the axe after averaging just 25.63 in Tests during the 2024/25 season.
There is also the option of Josh Inglis, who was in the WTC squad, as an opener.
Australian media made it clear that change was needed, with The Australian newspaper calling the defeat a ""wake-up call"" with the five-Test Ashes series against England beginning in November.
""Father Time is undefeated and selectors must now be decisive over key calls for the future,"" it said.
Cummins acknowledged all cards were on the table with only five months to go until the first Ashes Test in Perth beginning on November 20.
""Coming to this match, you've got guys like Sam Konstas and Scotty Boland and Josh Inglis, all those guys were right on the fringes,"" he said.
""So I think again, after this Test match, everyone gets thrown back into the conversation.""

Frustration voiced over policy rate status quo,"TR
Business community calls on SBP to reconsider 11% interest rate policy amid growth concerns
Business leaders on Monday voiced strong frustration over the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) decision to maintain the status quo on interest rates, announced on Monday, warning that the policy continues to choke economic growth and industrial recovery.
Echoing this sentiment, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani said, ""We appeal to the central bank to act with foresight and show empathy towards the productive sectors of the economy. Pakistan cannot afford to stifle its growth potential any longer.""
He expressed profound disappointment over the SBP's decision to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11%, describing it as an overly cautious and counterproductive stance given easing inflation and worsening industrial competitiveness. In a statement he said, ""The business community had pinned hopes on a long-overdue reduction in the interest rate to single digits to help kick-start economic activity, reduce the cost of doing business, and support struggling industries. By choosing to maintain the status quo, the SBP has not only ignored market signals but also dampened business sentiment at a time when the economy urgently needs a boost.""
He noted that inflation had clearly bottomed out, with independent analysts projecting it to remain between 6% and 7% for FY26, while both the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the government estimate it at 7.5%. In light of these forecasts, the decision to maintain the policy rate at a high level of 11% appears unjustified. While the SBP cited the uptick in inflation to 3.5% in May as a reason, this rate remains relatively low and still provides ample room for a further reduction in interest rates - a step that, regrettably, was not taken, he lamented.
Bilwani emphasised that such high interest rates have rendered Pakistan's industrial sector uncompetitive in the regional and global markets.
""Our exporters are struggling to maintain their foothold internationally, while domestic manufacturers face increasing pressure from cheaper imports. A rate cut would have provided critical breathing space for industrial revival and job creation,"" he said.
Site Association of Industry (SA) Karachi President Ahmed Azim Alvi said this was a good opportunity for the SBP to reduce the interest rate to a single digit, offering hope to disappointed businesspeople and boosting economic growth. He added that the government needs competent economists and policymakers who can closely understand the fluctuations of the national economy and business environment. Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) President Atif Ikram Sheikh said the industry is disappointed at the status quo in the monetary policy.
He said the business, industry and trade community of Pakistan is disappointed with the monetary policy as it continues to be based on a heavy premium vis-à-vis Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the SBP has maintained status quo in the policy rate in its Monday meeting.
He said the CPI, as per government's own statistics, stood at 3.50% in May 2025; but, the policy rate continues to be 11% as of today – which reflects a premium of 750 basis points (bps) as compared to inflation and it makes no economic sense.
He said after deliberations from the apex trade and industry platform with all industries and sectors, the FPCCI had demanded a single-stroke rate cut of 400 basis points during the Monday's monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting to rationalise the key policy rate; and, align it to the vision of special investment facilitation council (SIFC) and, the prime minister's vision for industrial development, import substitution and export growth. Sheikh noted that CPI is expected to remain between 24% in JuneJuly 2025, and therefore demanded the key policy rate be cut to 7%.

Three family members gunned down near Shahpur,"PK
Five injured in attack on wedding procession
Three members of the same family were shot dead and five others injured late Sunday evening when unidentified assailants ambushed a vehicle carrying a wedding party near Bahadariyan Wala in Shahpur Tehsil.
Police sources said Muhammad Iqbal, a resident of Thathi Mian Ranjha village in Tehsil Sahiwal, was returning home with his family after attending a wedding in Tanki Wala. As their vehicle neared Mangoowal, five armed men on motorcycles intercepted them and opened indiscriminate fire.
Iqbal, his daughter Saima Parveen, and his six-year-old grandson Bilal Ashir died on the spot. The injured included Iqbal's wife Salat Bibi, son Muhammad Abrar, daughter-in-law Bushra Bibi, granddaughter Zoya Bilal, and taxi driver Muhammad Ilyas.
Rescue 1122 personnel responded swiftly, transporting the injured to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Shahpur. Due to the critical condition of some victims, they were later referred to Faisal Masood Teaching Hospital in Sargodha. Salat Bibi, whose injuries are life-threatening, was moved to Lahore for urgent treatment.
SP Investigation Sargodha along with a heavy police contingent arrived at the scene shortly after the incident. A case was registered at Shahpur Saddar Police Station on the complaint of the deceased's son, Muhammad Bilal. Authorities have launched a search operation to apprehend the attackers, who remain unidentified and at large.
The brazen assault has left the local community in shock and grief, prompting calls for swift justice and heightened security. The motive for the attack has not yet been determined.

PSX range bound ahead of monetary policy,"SG
Investors stay cautious, restricting rise in index to just 82 points
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday remained range bound and registered thin gains of 82 points as investors treaded cautiously ahead of monetary policy announcement later in the day.
As expected by many analysts in the wake of escalating geopolitical tensions, the central bank left its policy rate unchanged at 11%. Despite the conflict between Israel and Iran, the market ended trading in the positive territory as it took cue from the recovery in global equities.
In the morning, the PSX kicked off proceedings on an upbeat note and immediately reached its intra-day high at 122,903 points. Soon afterwards, investors resorted to profit-taking, pulling the KSE-100 index down to the intra-day low at 121,890 after midday.
""Stocks advanced despite geopolitical risks amid speculation about the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) policy announcement later in the day,"" said Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp. ""Trade remained high amid consolidation. Recovery in global equities, IMF-driven upbeat projections for privatisation, economic growth and development expenditure in the federal budget for FY26 played the role of catalysts in positive close at the PSX.""
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a slight rise of 81.79 points, or 0.07%, and settled at 122,225.36. Topline Securities, in its review, remarked that Pakistan's stock market experienced a pullback session, following recovery in global markets. The benchmark index traded within a range, hitting the intra-day high of 759 points and low of 253 points, before settling at 122,225 with a modest gain of 81 points.
Topline mentioned that positive contribution to the index came from Bank AL Habib, OGDC, NBP, Mari Petroleum and Meezan Bank, which collectively added 371 points. On the other hand, stock selling in Engro Holdings, Pakgen Power and Lucky Cement wiped off 255 points.
Market participation was robust as total traded volumes reached 1.22 billion shares and the traded value hit Rs26 billion, it added.
Arif Habib Limited Deputy Head of Trading Ali Najib called it ""a consolidation day ahead of the MPS (Monetary Policy Statement).""
He said that the PSX had a range-bound session and ended on a relatively flat note at 122,225, up 82 points. The State Bank maintained its benchmark rate at 11%, as anticipated by the street.
During the day, the benchmark index floated between 121,890 and 122,903 levels, making them the intra-day low and high, respectively. Investors opted for a cautious approach amid heightening geopolitical tensions in the backdrop of Iran-Israel conflict, Najib said.
Among corporate news, the Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC, -0.26%) board approved the submission of an Expression of Interest for PIA Holding Company (+7.95%) as the government planned to sell a 51-100% stake in PIA by the deadline of June 19.
""Market direction hinges on Middle East developments and 120,000 serves as a key support. With improved stability, the index could target 130,000 in the near term,"" he anticipated. JS Research analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the bourse opened on a positive note, touching the intra-day high of 122,903, but failed to sustain the momentum. It closed at 122,225 as profit-taking emerged later in the session. On the economic front, the State Bank kept the policy rate unchanged at 11%, aligning with expectations.

FATF snub to India,"SG
New Delhi's embarrassment, World Bank recently approved a major loan for Pakistan's Reko Diq mining project
In yet another attempt to malign Pakistan on the global stage, India lobbied aggressively to have the country reinserted into the FATF grey list. But much to New Delhi's frustration, the move not failed badly. FATF member states refused to entertain India's politicisation of a technical forum, and instead acknowledged Pakistan's sustained progress on countering money laundering and terrorist financing.
Following the Operation Bunyad Marsoos, Indian missions ramped up a campaign to build a narrative of Pakistan's alleged involvement in terror-related activities. But as has been the case too often in the past, facts did not align with India's rhetoric. During the latest FATF plenary, sources confirm that India - reportedly backed by Israel - attempted to pressure the forum to drag Pakistan back on the grey list. However, the effort was swiftly neutralised by key international players. China firmly backed Pakistan, while Turkiye and Japan extended unequivocal support, recognising the political undertones of India's push. The diplomatic tables were turned and India's isolation in the room was evident as FATF decided to keep Pakistan under a standard reporting mechanism, sending a clear message that propaganda has no place in policy. Pakistan, after being removed from the grey list in October 2022, has maintained a consistent trajectory on anti-money laundering and counter-terror financing compliance. Adding to New Delhi's embarrassment, the World Bank recently approved a major loan for Pakistan's Reko Diq mining project - a sign of growing international confidence in Pakistan's economic stability and governance reforms.
For Pakistan, this is more than just a diplomatic win. It is a vindication of efforts to rebuild international credibility and a signal that the world is no longer willing to entertain India's narrative without scrutiny. Multilateral institutions must remain immune to bilateral grudges. FATF's refusal to bow to political pressure is a welcome reminder of that principle.

Five terrorists killed in K-P IBOs,"US
In a separate IBO in North Waziristan District, one more Kharji was neutralised in an ensuing fire exchange.
Five Khawarij terrorists affiliated with Indian proxy outfit Fitna al Khawarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa during intelligence-based operations (IBOs), the military's media wing said on Monday.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the first operation was carried out by security forces in Peshawar District following reports of the presence of Indian-sponsored Khawarij.
""During the conduct of operation, own troops skilfully surrounded and effectively engaged the Indian sponsored khwarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored khwarij, including Kharji Haris and Kharji Baseer, were sent to hell,"" the press release said.
In a separate IBO in North Waziristan District, one more Kharji was neutralised in an ensuing fire exchange.
Security forces also recovered weapons, ammunition and explosives from the Indian-sponsored Khawarij killed in the operations. The terrorists were reportedly actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
The ISPR added that sanitisation operations are underway to ensure no remaining Indian-sponsored Khawarij are present in the vicinity. The military reiterated its resolve to eliminate the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country.
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for their success in neutralising five terrorists of Fitna al Khawarij in the two operations in K-P.
They reaffirmed the government's commitment to completely eradicate the terrorist network.
""Operations against Fitna al Khawarij will continue till complete elimination of terrorism from the country,"" President Zardari said.
PM Shehbaz said that the anti-human terrorists will have to pay a heavy price for endangering the lives and property of innocent people.

"One dead, five injured in suspected targeted attack","PK
Investigating Officer Sub-Inspector Muhammad Ali Shah stated that the shooting appeared to be a targeted attack
A rickshaw driver was killed while five including a woman and a child sustained injuries in a shooting incident, took place near a restaurant in Surjani Town, late on Sunday night.
According to the police, four armed men, riding two motorcycles, opened indiscriminate fire on a rickshaw killing the rickshaw driver Aleem, 45, on the spot and injuring Tehmina, 50, Subhan, 30, Nauman, 22, Zaryab, 20, and Zainab, 6. They were rushed to a nearby hospital.
Investigating Officer Sub-Inspector Muhammad Ali Shah stated that the shooting appeared to be a targeted attack, as the assailants fired from a distance of approximately 200 metres from the restaurant. He also noted that the restaurant owner had previously received extortion threats via WhatsApp from a South Africa number which was later traced belonging to a former member of a political party.
CCTV footage has been obtained but it is not clear because of the distance between the criminals and the camera. Tehmina, one of the injured, shared with The Express Tribune that they were returning from a wedding in Bilal Colony. On the way, they stopped for cold drinks when the incident took place.

Carpenter doesn't care about criticism,"US
Pop star's cover art for 'Man's Best Friend' attracts online attention
By now, Sabrina Carpenter fans will be counting down the weeks until August 29, which is the date the pop star's seventh studio album, Man's Best Friend, is scheduled for release.
As Carpenter's Instagram followers will be well versed, the announcement was made during an Instagram Live session last Wednesday, with Carpenter making the announcement as she flipped through vinyl records by artists such as Donna Summer, ABBA, and Dolly Parton.
A sizzling cover
Even more than news of the album reveal itself, however, has been the cover art photograph of the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine, with the singer's provocative pose (in which she appears to be dressed in nothing but a pair of stockings), having set tongues wagging.
Carpenter is no stranger to online criticism, having already been subject to backlash for her songs with sexually explicit themes and bold stage performances. Now, in an interview with the publication, the star has addressed the criticism head on. She is unable to see any basis for any complaints about modesty (or lack thereof) on her part – certainly not given how in-demand her tracks are across streaming platforms.
""It's always so funny to me when people complain,"" mused Carpenter. ""They're like, 'All she does is sing about this.' But those are the songs that you've made popular. Clearly, you love sex.""
Carpenter reminded fans of own range, pointing to her shows that include not just playful tracks, but also introspective ballads. Since it is her more provocative moments that attract attention, the singer highlighted the irony of critics obsessed with the sexual nature of her performances despite driving up her sales figures regardless. Citing her hit track, Juno, as an example, the pop superstar remarked, ""There's so many more moments than the Juno positions, but those are the ones you post every night and comment on,"" she remarked in the interview. "" I can't control that.""
Difficult time for women
As someone whose personal life and career is splashed across the public eye, Carpenter did not miss a beat when speculating over the difficulties faced by women living under the harsh glare of the spotlight.
""I truly feel like I've never lived in a time where women have been picked apart more, and scrutinised in every capacity,"" she lamented.
Pointing out the paradox of so-called 'girl power' juxtaposed with the constant judgement women must endure over their appearances and actions, the Disney-child-turned-pop-star stressed the importance of growing a thick skin to survive such brutal attention to detail.
""We're in such a weird time where you would think it's girl power, and women supporting women, but in reality, the second you see a picture of someone wearing a dress on a carpet, you have to say everything mean about it in the first 30 seconds that you see it."" she noted. ""It's something that keeps coming back. We just have to grow thicker skin, but they don't have to learn how to shut their mouths.""
In Carpenter's view, it is impossible to survive under such unremitting attention without that armour of thick skin.
""What people probably don't realise is the more eyes you have on you, the harder it is to love what you're doing, and you have to keep fighting to still love making things and to still love performing,"" she explained. ""Because the critical sides start to taint it, and they start to make things less fun. They start to make friendships and relationships less fun and enjoyable. [But] there's still so much light and goodness in this, if you're doing it for the reason of 'you love it and can't live without it'.""
Carpenter's busy diary
Being on the verge of releasing her seventh studio album, it is clear that Carpenter, at least, does love what she is doing, regardless of censure from critics about her mode of expression.
News of Carpenter's upcoming album comes on the heels of her latest single, Manchild, released on June 5, which rocketed to the top of the Spotify US chart, having accumulated nearly 2 million streams. No stranger to churning out records in quick succession, Carpenter's latest offering follows on from last year's wildly successful album Short n' Sweet, of which the deluxe edition was released in February this year. Man's Best Friend is poised to be a major milestone in her career, following the success of Short n' Sweet, which sold over 10 million copies globally and earned her six Grammy nominations.
After performing at Primavera Sound in Barcelona, Carpenter will continue her summer festival circuit, with notable performances in London, Lollapalooza, and Austin City Limits. Later this year, she will embark on a North American tour, performing in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles, with multiple nights scheduled at Madison Square Garden and Crypto.com Arena.
Man's Best Friend is now available for pre-order, with a special picture disc featuring artwork by Jacob Rochester, depicting Carpenter alongside a man. Carpenter herself, clad in a black dress, is kneeling on the ground, with an off-centre man holding onto a lock of her hair as he would the leash of a dog. In conclusion: for any wallflowers wanting to know how to do anything with a bang, look no further than Carpenter.

"Rs7.5b agri budget neglects research, seed development","US
Less than 8% allocated for research; seed shortage, water inefficiency unaddressed
With the demands of farmers concerning seed development and research remaining unheard, the Sindh government has proposed expenditure of over Rs7.535 billion on agriculture, in addition to another sum of Rs3.5 billion under the head of foreign project assistance (FPA), in fiscal 2025-26.
More than Rs3.3 billion have been earmarked for water courses related projects as less than eight per cent of the provincial budget is going to be spent on research and below one per cent on the seed development.
The farmers' training will also see a minuscule funding of Rs87 million as challenges ranging from efficient water use to climate resistant farming lay ahead. The Sindh Agriculture, Supply and Prices Department is distributing its development budget in its nine sub-sectors.
The wing responsible for overseeing the supply of commodities, regulating prices, checking weights and taking measurements will also get a paltry amount of Rs69.28 million to procure mobile testing unit for inspection. ""With water being scarce and Pakistan being one of the least efficient users of water in agriculture, there is no attention to correcting that or investing in high efficiency systems like drip,"" commented Syed Mahmood Nawaz Shah, the acting President of Sindh Abadgar Board.
He also pointed out that the availability of certified seed in the market is around 45 per cent but the provincial government remains indifferent to the situation. ""Again, there is no way forward or a strategy."" The Rs150 million seed development programme will get only a small sum of Rs50 million in the upcoming financial year. The programme is also supposed to conduct capacity development of the agriculturists. The Rs7.535 billion outlay consists of allocations of Rs six billion for 35 ongoing schemes and Rs1.5 billion for eight new and unapproved projects.
Research
The government plans to spend Rs89.7 million on bio saline agriculture research and development phase-II; Rs100 million on upgrade of horticulture research centre in Mirpurkhas; Rs125 million on rice research in Larkana; and Rs62.5 million on varietal development of wheat through speed breeding. The two unapproved schemes include bio saline, rehabilitation and resilient initiative and climate resilient crops seed research with the allocations of Rs50 million and Rs25 million, respectively.
Meanwhile, after the water management projects, the agriculture mechanisation sector receives the largest funds from the provincial government with Rs2.166 billion being pledged for the next fiscal. Eight ongoing and one new schemes of the Agriculture Extension wing will receive Rs1.042 billion from the Sindh government besides a hefty injection of Rs3.5 billion under the FPA.
The sector's Sindh Water and Agriculture Transformation (SWAT) project, whose total cost surpasses Rs142.28 billion, funded primarily from the credit received from the World Bank with the Sindh government's contribution of only Rs23 billion, will get Rs200 million in 2025-26. Likewise, the Rs3.4 billion project to transform the Indus basin with climate resilient agriculture and water management will be provided Rs316 million by the government in the upcoming financial year.
The government plans to spend Rs198.5 million to establish a new fruit and vegetable market in Mehar taluka of Dadu district but the project is still categorised as unapproved. The supply of laser levelling equipment on rental basis to farmers will be apportioned Rs220.7 million with the project's total outlay being at Rs300 million. The government is also assisting the date farmers to set up date processing, packaging and pasting plant at the cost of Rs628 million. Rs254 million, or half of the sanctioned funds, will be released next year.

Bayern hit 10 against Auckland City,"US
Musiala scores a second-half hat-trick
Bayern Munich showed no mercy to amateurs Auckland City at the Club World Cup on Sunday, beating the minnows from New Zealand 10-0 in their opening game as Jamal Musiala came off the bench to score a second-half hat-trick.
Kingsley Coman, Michael Olise and Thomas Mueller all netted twice, while Sacha Boey was also on target for the German champions in the game in Group C, which also features Boca Juniors and Benfica.
Harry Kane started but didn't find the target before being replaced just after the hour mark by Musiala, who netted his three goals in the space of 18 minutes towards the end.
It was a stroll in the park in the midday sun in Cincinnati for Vincent Kompany's side, with France winger Coman scoring twice in the opening 21 minutes either side of goals by compatriots Boey and Olise.
Coman's sixth-minute breakthrough goal was the first of the tournament following the 0-0 draw between Inter Miami and Al Ahly in Saturday's opening game.
Mueller got the fifth and Olise's second of the afternoon made it 6-0 in first-half stoppage time for the Bundesliga heavyweights.
Auckland City managed to stem the tide for much of the second half before Musiala came on and took centre stage, his three goals including one from the penalty spot.
Mueller made it 10-0 in the 89th minute for a Bayern side who won the Club World Cup twice in its former seven-team guise, in 2013 and 2020.
They have recorded bigger victories in the past in the German Cup, but the 10-goal winning margin equals their best ever win in the Bundesliga, when they beat Borussia Dortmund 11-1 in 1971.
Bayern, who gave new signing Jonathan Tah a debut in central defence following his recent arrival from Bayer Leverkusen, play Boca in their next match in Miami on Friday.
Auckland City take on Benfica earlier the same day in Orlando.

Provincial debt rises to Rs1.71 trillion,"GB
Bulk comprises concessional, long-term loans in foreign currencies
Punjab's total debt stock increased by Rs25 billion during the fiscal year 202425, reflecting a 1.5 per cent year-on-year rise, according to official budget documents released on Monday.
By the end of the ongoing month, the province's overall debt will reach Rs1,710 billion, up from Rs1,685 billion in June 2024. The debt comprises Rs1,709 billion from external sources and just Rs1.29 billion from domestic lenders, accounting for 2.7 percent of Punjab's Gross State Domestic Product.
While external debt rose by Rs26 billion over the year, domestic debt fell from Rs1.7 billion to Rs1.29 billion, marking a 22.5 % decrease. In dollar terms, Punjab's external debt stands at approximately $6.1 billion. The bulk of this debt is sourced from concessional, long-term loans extended in foreign currencies by multilateral and bilateral lenders.
These include the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), as well as bilateral partners such as China, Japan, and France. Though these loans are contracted by the federal government, they are disbursed to Punjab to support development initiatives.
The budget report breaks down external debt into the broad categories of project loans, which finance long-term public infrastructure, and programme loans, which offer budgetary support tied to policy reforms or targeted spending. As of June 2025, Punjab owes $4.81 billion to multilateral lenders and $1.29 billion to bilateral sources.
The external debt portfolio is largely denominated in US dollars (68%), followed by Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) at 23%, Japanese yen at 5%, and other currencies making up the remaining 4%.
Sector-wise, agriculture, irrigation, and livestock absorbed the largest share of debt-financed investments, accounting for 24% of total outstanding loans. This was followed by the transport and communications sector with 20%, education with 19%, and urban and community development with 17%. Governance-related borrowing constituted 11%, health 5%, energy 2%, tourism 1%, and industries and infrastructure another 1%.
Officials said despite the increase in total debt stock, the province maintains a low debt-to-GSDP ratio and relies predominantly on concessional borrowing for development priorities.

Alcaraz ready for Queen's after Ibiza party,"US
He saved three match points to beat Sinner in Roland Garros final
Carlos Alcaraz will return to action at Queen's Club next week after the world number two celebrated his epic French Open triumph by partying in Ibiza.
Alcaraz saved three match points and rallied from two sets down to beat Jannik Sinner in a fifth set tie-break in the sensational Roland Garros final on June 8.
Having triumphed in one of the greatest finals in tennis history, the 22-year-old jetted off to Ibiza to soak up his second successive French Open crown.
As well as partying with friends, Alcaraz used the break as a welcome opportunity to recharge his batteries after a gruelling clay-court campaign that also included titles in Monte Carlo and Rome.
""It was fun, but honestly, I was there more mentally than physically. I had fun, just three nights, three days, and I think that was more than enough,"" he told reporters at Queen's on Sunday.
""The craziest thing was probably staying out really late. I danced a bit, but nothing more than what a normal person would do. I'm getting older, my body doesn't keep up anymore!""
Refreshed by his break, Alcaraz practised at Queen's Club on Saturday evening as he stepped up his preparations to defend the Wimbledon title. The Spaniard is confident his Ibiza holiday won't leave him rusty in west London.
""It's kind of the middle of the season. After the clay season, which is very intense, I think it's the perfect time to get away,"" he said.
""My friends go every year, so I go too. It doesn't matter where. The point is to switch off mentally, recharge physically and come back ready for the grass season. ""After such a great but intense few weeks, having time to disconnect and have fun is really important for me.""
'Can't believe it'
Alcaraz, who has won Wimbledon for the last two years, is the third-youngest man to claim five Grand Slam titles, trailing only Rafael Nadal and Bjorn Borg.
He is also only the third man in the Open era to save at least one championship point before winning a Grand Slam final.
Alcaraz said his memorable achievements in Paris were still sinking in as he prepares to open his grass-court campaign against compatriot Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in the Queen's first round.
The 22-year-old, who won Queen's in 2023, said: ""I still look at the phone and the media. I have seen a lot of videos from that match, that moment from match point down.
""I still watch it sometimes and can't believe I came back from that moment. Sometimes it's difficult to realise that I am in this position, that I won Roland Garros. I still watch the videos and am still in shock sometimes.""
Alcaraz cannot pick a favourite between his maiden French Open victory last year and the victory against Sinner, adding: ""The first one is always there. It's going to be always in your heart.
""And this one, the second one, a lot of people told me that it was the best final they have ever seen.""

'ECP justified in case of 41 candidates',"US
Mandokhail says SC agreed 39 candidates submitting PTI certificates couldn't be declared independent
The constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Monday issued notices to respondents on a petition filed by the PTI led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to become a party in a case related to allocation of reserved seats to Imran Khan's party.
During the hearing, the counsel for the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC)a party comprising PTI-backed independent parliamentariansstated that the SIC intended to file a review petition against the CB's decision to dismiss its objections to the bench.
The eleven-member CB, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard the petitions challenging the SC's July 2024 majority order for allocation of reserved seats to the PTI.
At the outset, Justice Khan remarked that the SC granted a relief to the PTI initially meant for the SIC.
On January 13, 2024, a three-member SC bench upheld the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) December 22, 2023 order declaring the PTI's intra-party polls null and void.
Later, the PTI candidates had to contest the February 8, 2024 general elections as independents.
Eighty such independent candidates reached the National Assembly and later joined the SIC in an apparent bid to claim reserved seats for women and minorities. The ECP, however, refused to allocate the seats to the party, a decision that the SIC challenged in the Supreme Court.
On July 12, 2024, a full bench of the apex court through a majority of 8 to 5 resurrected the PTI as a parliamentary party, noting that 39 of the lawmakers who had submitted certificates of their affiliation with the PTI along with their nomination papers were already PTI lawmakers.
The SC ruled that the remaining 41 lawmakers who had not submitted the affiliation certificates at the time of nomination papers' submission could do that now within a period of 15 days.
The ruling coalition later filed a review petition against the SC ruling, which the CB took up in May.
During the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed that the SC verdict came on January 13, whereas nomination papers were submitted in December, and many candidates had then declared their independent status.
Siddiqi responded that the ECP had withdrawn PTI's symbol on December 22, 2023. He said all 11 judges of the SC larger bench had stated the ECP's decision to declare PTI members as independents was illegal. Justice Mandokhail remarked that the agreement among the 11 judges applied only to those members who had submitted nomination papers and party tickets from the PTI.
""Only 14 PTI candidates had submitted the party certificate but we assumed that perhaps others had also submitted it and it may have been misplaced. That was why we considered 39 members.""
The court adjourned the hearing until today. Siddiqi will resume his arguments on behalf of the SIC.

Instant ceasefire a must,"US
The tendency to prolong warfare as scores are being levelled must be revisited
As warmongering between Iran and Israel escalates to new heights with their respective cities, ports and military installations under fire, the point of consolation is that diplomacy is slowly picking up momentum. The offer from Russia and Turkiye to mediate is a welcome development, and there is an opportunity in disaster for the G7 leaders to work for a perpetual peace in one of the most volatile regions as they rub their shoulders in Canada.
The riddle to start working, nonetheless, would be an immediate ceasefire and that too with the tactical endorsement from the United Nations that it will monitor the situation. The UNSC must deploy necessary confidence building mechanisms so that the conflagration is stemmed, and regional trade and commerce is not impacted. It is, however, a pity that the Arab League and the OIC are nowhere to be seen, and this is where the role of regionalisation gets a drawback.
The volume of destruction on both sides, and the resolve from either party to go for the kill till extinction is worrisome. Tel Aviv's threat to ""burn"" Tehran and, likewise, the clergy's intention to ""wipe out"" the Jewish state are now literally taking a toll on regional security and stability. As far as Iran is concerned, it is buoyed with the impact that its ballistic missiles had drawn misery on Israel, especially on the port of Haifa and the capital city. The tendency to prolong warfare as scores are being levelled must be revisited.
Trump, in the midst of his counterparts in Kananaskis, Alberta, must be made to realise that it is his adamant attitude that had led to eruption. Iran's latest stance, as reiterated by President Pezeshkian in the parliament on Monday, that his country does not seek nuclear weapons should be the starting point of peace talks. Likewise, Tehran should be consoled not to pull out of NPT and work closely with Russia to ""store uranium"" with it as had been an earlier bilateral endeavour. The least that is expected to emerge from the G7 summit is leadership that could stop the war.

K-P Wildlife Dept accused of bid fraud,"GB
Complainant accuses officials of manipulating tender process of eco-tourism project
A legal notice has been served to the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife & National Parks Department, accusing it of serious irregularities, favouritism, and legal violations in the recent tender process for an eco-tourism project at Ayubia National Park. The notice demands immediate corrective action.
Issued by Advocate Malik Saeed Akhtar on behalf of the firm Titanic 2000, the legal notice alleges that the tender process was manipulated to benefit ""pre-selected, blue-eyed"" bidders in collusion with department officials.
The notice highlights that the department unlawfully bypassed the UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) Programme's mandated Biosphere Management Committee, violating international commitments. It also accuses the department of duplicityopposing the Ayubia Chairlift Project on ecological grounds while allegedly advancing a similar initiative under a non-transparent Request for Proposals (RFP).
Citing ""concrete evidence,"" the notice claims that technical evaluation scores were arbitrarily altered post-submission to favour specific bidders, breaching KPPRA Rule 47. It also expresses strong suspicion that financial bids may be tampered with after submission, violating KPPRA Rule 34.
The document outlines additional procedural breaches, including: Absence of the Bid Evaluation Committee Chairman during the opening of bids, unlawful delegation of decision-making authority to a single individual and marginalisation of official committee members while two Wildlife Department officials handled the process.
Formation of a ""parallel evaluation committee,"" which allegedly opened bids and showed clear favouritism toward one bidder.
Moreover, bidders were reportedly given an unrealistic six-day deadline to submit Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs), despite legal obligations under the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act, 1997, placing this responsibility on the project proponentnot bidders. This requirement was allegedly omitted from the RFP.
Significant delays in the evaluation process occurred without formal communication, and the department's actions are said to violate the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Wildlife and Biodiversity Act, 2015, KPPRA Rules, and other governing laws.
Titanic 2000 has demanded that the Divisional Forest Officer: Immediately rectify all legal and procedural violations. Ensure compliance with KPPRA Rules 2014 and other environmental and procurement laws, transfer responsibility to the officially notified committee and take corrective action against officials involved in the alleged misconduct.
The firm warned that failure to comply within seven days would result in legal proceedings at the department's risk and cost.
Concerns raised
In a related development, Sardar M Sabir, Vice Chairman of the Biosphere Management Committee, has written to the Secretary of the Forest & Wildlife Department, Government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. In a two-page letter, a copy of which is available with The Express Tribune, he raised concerns over alleged bid manipulation, procedural violations, and the committee's exclusion from the entire processdespite its governance role under the UNESCO MAB Programme.
Sabir stated that technical scores were altered to favour a particular bidder and alleged attempts to modify financial bids post-submission. He also noted that no committee members were involved in bid evaluation, with all authority centralised in one individual. The absence of the Conservator Wildlife, the committee's chairman, during the bid opening was also highlighted.
He called for an impartial investigation into bid-rigging and procurement violations, immediate cancellation of the current tender process and inclusion of the Biosphere Management Committee in all future planning and decision-making.
The controversy echoes a similar uproar surrounding the earlier Ayubia Chairlift Project, which also faced backlash over procedural irregularities and ecological concerns. In that case, the Galiyat Development Authority (GDA) leased 110 kanals of land to the Monal Group for commercial use, raising alarms about potential harm to the park's ecological balance.
Ayubia National Park's status as a UNESCO-designated Biosphere Reserve underscores the need for rigorous environmental protection and transparent governance to ensure its biodiversity and ecological integrity are preserved.

Says modern communication system to be developed
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced plans to develop a sustainable and modern Information and Communication System in Pakistan, aimed at positioning the country as a regional hub for the information technology (IT) sector.
Chairing a review meeting on the development of the IT training ecosystem in Pakistan, the prime minister emphasized the importance of equipping youth with modern, market-driven skills to support local transformation. He stressed that training programmes must be designed to ensure employment opportunities for participants.
Shehbaz also underscored the need to provide competent IT professionals to local companies, enabling them to meet international standards and contribute to foreign exchange earnings. He directed that clear terms of reference be drafted for consultancy services related to the training system.
He directed the Federal Education Ministry, Higher Education Commission (HEC) and Neotech to work together with the IT Ministry to impart trainings in schools, colleges and universities level. The IT training should be ensured in summer camps during the current summer vacations, he said.
The meeting was informed that recently the trained Pakistani students made the country proud by winning the first three positions, not only in China, but other competitions also, which was contested by 200,000 students from across the world.
The prime minister was briefed that a target had been set to give training to 50,000 trainers in Azad Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Islamabad, keeping in view modern technology and contemporary requirements.
Separately, the prime minister met with a United Arab Emirates (UAE) delegation, led by Deputy Minister Competitiveness and Knowledge Exchange Abdulla Nasser Lootah, and expressed his desire to benefit from the UAE's experiences of its modern management system.
Shehbaz said that Pakistan had taken steps such as digitisation and paperless economy to improve its administrative structure. In addition, a faceless customs system has also been implemented, said a separate press release issued by the PMO Media Wing.
On the occasion, Lootah said that the UAE was happy to exchange experiences and information with Pakistan. Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz and Minister Lootah witnessed the signing ceremony of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the two countries.
Under this MoU, the two countries will cooperate in improving government performance by exchanging knowledge and mutual experience, guidance and development models in the fields of development planning, public sector reforms, human resource, urban planning, and science and technology.

Rain forecast falls flat on face,"US
City steam cooked on hot, humid day
The city recorded an extremely hot and humid day on Monday, with temperatures touching 40 degrees Celsius. Due to high humidity, residents experienced severe discomfort and suffocating weather conditions during the afternoon. Most of the day felt like a heatwave, while some suburban areas received light drizzles, leaving the rest of the city waiting in vain for rainfall.
The day began with a minimum temperature of 30 degrees Celsius, and humidity spiked significantly to 73 per cent, leading to a sweltering start. As the sun blazed and wind speeds dropped, the intensity of the heat increased steadily. By afternoon, the city experienced heatwave-like conditions, accompanied by intense humidity and suffocation.
According to the Meteorological Department, the maximum temperature in the city reached 40 degrees Celsius, with humidity levels at 58 per cent. The combined rise in temperature and humidity made the weather feel even hotter than it actually was.
Throughout the scorching day, citizens eagerly awaited rainfall. However, apart from light drizzles and slight rain in a few suburban areas, most parts of the city remained dry. It is worth mentioning that the Meteorological Department had forecast light to moderate rain with thunder and gusty winds in the city on Monday.

Judge transfer needs full consensus: CB,"GB
Bench notes president's limited power in transfer process
Head of a constitutional bench (CB) of the apex court has observed that transfer of a judge from one high court to another is a process, which cannot be completed without the consent of all involved.
""The president has the authority to transfer a judge but the process can end if the concerned judge or the chief justice of his own high court or the chief justice of the high court where he is being transferred or the chief justice of Pakistan does not agree with it,"" Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar noted.
Justice Mazhar was heading a five-member CB, hearing the petitions filed against transfer of three judges of provincial high courts to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) in February this year and the subsequent change in the capital's high court's seniority list.
Barrister Salahuddin, counsel for the five IHC judges who have challenged the transfer, continued his rebuttal arguments, asserting that Article 200 of the Constitution applies only to sub-section 3.
He argued that in civil service, a transfer from one department to another affects seniority, unlike in the judiciary where no deputation or merger of judges of two high courts takes place.
Punjab Advocate General Amjad Pervez also filed a miscellaneous application during the hearing.
Justice Salahuddin Panhwar inquired about the application, to which Pervez responded that he had submitted historical record of judicial transfers from 1947 to 1976 and acknowledged that while they weren not a party to the case, a notice under Rule 27-A had been issued to them. Justice Mazhar noted that the 27-A notice is specifically for becoming a party, and the advocate general should have followed the Attorney-General for Pakistan in presenting arguments.
After the completion of the rebuttal, the court directed other counsels representing the petitioners to conclude their arguments by Tuesday. The hearing was then adjourned until today.

Sana Yousaf's 'murderer' remanded to police,"US
The police requested a seven-day remand to recover the mobile phone and vehicle allegedly used in the crime.
A Judicial Magistrate in Islamabad on Monday granted a four-day physical remand for the accused, Omar Hayat, in the murder case of TikToker Sana Yousaf.
The court also ordered a medical examination of the accused and directed the police to submit the report at the next hearing.
The Islamabad police presented the suspect before Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Hafeez following an identification parade. According to the prosecution, the accused had been identified by two specific individualsthe victim's mother and paternal aunt.
The police requested a seven-day remand to recover the mobile phone and vehicle allegedly used in the crime.
However, the court approved a four-day remand instead. During the hearing, the accused informed the court that he had already handed over his mobile phone to the police. He also requested a medical examination and stated that he currently has no contact with his family and is uncertain about hiring legal representation.
The court accepted his request for a medical examination and directed the police to produce him again on June 20, along with a medical report and updates on the investigation.

Govt mulls over oil imports via pipelines,"PK
Experts also call for keeping oil stocks in storage of abandoned power plants
Pakistan is mulling over alternative options for oil supply from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) through pipelines in case the Strait of Hormuz is shut down owing to the Israel-Iran conflict.
Saudi Arabia has an existing oil pipeline network, including the East-West Pipeline (Petroline), which supplies crude oil from the eastern province to the Red Sea port of Yanbu. The UAE oil pipeline to Fujairah, also referred to as the Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline (Adcop), is a strategic infrastructure project designed to bypass the Strait of Hormuz and ensure safe oil exports.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday chaired the inaugural meeting of a high-level committee constituted to monitor petroleum prices amid escalation in regional tensions.
Sources told The Express Tribune that the Petroleum Division in a report said that the Strait of Hormuz supplies 20% of global crude oil and in case Iran shuts it down, the oil supply to the world could be affected, including Pakistan. It will be the worst-case scenario when oil prices could touch $100 to $150 per barrel.
It was highlighted that there was no immediate threat of higher oil prices and Pakistan was also engaged in talks with world oil suppliers to ensure smooth supplies.
At present, the abandoned power plants have furnace oil storages for up to one million tons. Experts suggest that the government should store oil in these storages. It has been proposed that the government can buy the storages as the power sector plans to sell them in scrap.
According to a statement, in response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel's recent attack on Iran and the resulting volatility in international oil markets, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has constituted a high-level committee to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics. The committee is headed by the finance minister and includes senior representatives from key federal ministries, regulatory authorities and energy sector experts.

"Schwarzenegger, Moss bring the heat in 'Fubar 2'","US
Actors talk action-comedy and tango scene
Austrian and American actor Arnold Schwarzenegger had to admit that it took him a lot of practice to nail the tango scene with Canadian actor Carrie-Anne Moss for season 2 of the Netflix action-comedy series Fubar.
""We practiced. We practiced a lot, and she didn't need as much practice as I did, but I really practiced,"" the former California governor told Reuters.
The Terminator actor recalled doing the first take for the dance scene and impressing everyone with how ready they were. ""They just thought we were rehearsing, but they did not know that we were that prepared for the whole thing,"" Schwarzenegger said with a smile.
Fubar season 2, created by Nick Santora and produced by Skydance Television and Blackjack Films, premiered on Netflix last Thursday. The story follows Luke Brunner, played by Schwarzenegger and his daughter Emma, played by Monica Barbaro, who are both CIA operatives.
Their fellow CIA team members include Barry Putt, played by Milan Carter, Boro Polonia, played by Gabriel Luna, Roo Russell, played by Fortune Feimster and Aldon Reese, portrayed by Travis Van Winkle.
In season 2, Brunner is back to working with his CIA team, but things take an unexpected turn when he encounters his ex-lover Greta Nelson, played by Moss.
Greta is a former East German spy who ends up going up against Brunner in both the tango and a tussling battle.
""Most of my scenes are with Arnold, so we developed this incredible friendship,"" Moss said.
Schwarzenegger humorously recalled the Matrix actor bringing what he dubbed as ""secret oil"" to the set and putting it behind his ears before shooting a scene.
""Peppermint oil. I'm a big peppermint oil or just essential oil person,"" Moss clarified.
""It was like some magic power because as soon as she smeared the stuff behind my ears, I mean it was like 'pum!' and we were kind of out of the gate doing our scenes in the most perfect way,"" Schwarzenegger added. Reuters

Trump urges Iranto talk,"US
G7 looks for common ground
US President Donald Trump on Monday warned Iran, which Israel is pounding, to re-enter negotiations ""before it's too late"" as Group of Seven leaders considered a joint call for de-escalation.
Host Canada had designed the summit in the Rockies resort of Kananaskis to paper over differences within the bloc of major industrial democracies, as Trump returns to the global stage in his norm-shattering second term.
But two days before the summit, Israel launched a surprise, massive military attack on Iran, which had been in negotiations with the Trump administration over the cleric-run state's contested nuclear program.
Trump, who has praised Israel's strikes despite his stated preference for diplomacy, said he believed a negotiated settlement remained ""achievable.""
""It's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately, before it's too late,"" Trump told reporters as he met Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.
Israel has struck major nuclear and military sites and killed leading commanders and nuclear scientists in Iran, which has responded with its own volley of drones and missiles on Israel.
Canada and European leaders have looked to draft a statement on the crisis, although it looks set to stop short of demanding a ceasefire.
Leaders will discuss the statement Monday evening, a diplomat said.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that G7 leaders share concern about Iran's nuclear program but there is ""absolutely a focus on how we de-escalate this and that will be a central focus as we go into the talks.""
""I do think there's a consensus for de-escalation,"" Starmer told reporters.
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that a text being put forward by the Europeans would put the onus on Iran.
""We'll highlight again that Iran must never possess material that would allow it to produce nuclear weapons,"" Merz said.
""We'll highlight the legitimate right of the state of Israel to defend itself and we will also discuss potential additional measures to reach a diplomatic solution,"" he said.

Transport fares hiked across Rawalpindi,"GB
Ride-hailing services and rickshaws have also increased rates
Transporters across Rawalpindi have increased fares on all urban, intercity, and suburban routes following a sharp hike in petrol and diesel prices. Passengers are now paying Rs2030 more per ride on local and twin-city routes (RawalpindiIslamabad), while fares on long routes have gone up by Rs4050 per passenger.
Pakistan Railways has also decided to raise train fares. The sudden fare hikes have led to disputes between transporters and commuters in the twin cities. Qingqi rickshaw operators have added Rs10 per ride, while motorbike ride-hailing services like Bykea have increased fares from Rs100 to Rs130 per trip.
Public transport vehicles such as Suzuki vans and Bykea servicing routes like Fawara Chowk to Bhara Kahu, Rawat, Adiala Road, Pirwadhai, Sihala, Golra Sharif, and Chaklala Airport have added Rs20 to their fares. Other routes including Saddar to Adiala Jail, Taxila, Rawat, Kahuta, and Kutchery have seen fare increases ranging from Rs10 to Rs20 per passenger.
Passengers complain that fares rise immediately with fuel price hikes but are never reduced when prices drop. ""From Raja Bazaar to Morgah, Rs10 extra was charged per person, yet no official fare hike notification has been issued,"" said commuter Asghar Ali.
Meanwhile, Vice President of the Transport Federation, Asif Khan, justified the increase, stating, ""Our vehicles run on petrol and diesel. When prices go up, it affects everything - spare parts, maintenance, tires - all have become 100% to 400% more expensive. We can't bear any more losses. Toll taxes and traffic fines have doubled or tripled, and traffic police bribes have also increased.""
Adding to the chaos, many petrol stations across the city suspended fuel sales late Sunday night around 11pm in anticipation of the price hike. Most stations refused to dispense more than 12 litres per customer, leading to long queues of cars and motorcycles. Normal sales resumed after the official announcement of the new prices.

IHC judge disputes legality of new court rules,"US
Justice Sattar says full court approval mandatory for rules under Article 208
Islamabad High Court (IHC) judge Justice Babar Sattar has raised objections to the newly notified Islamabad High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025, asserting they lack legal authority as they were not approved by a full court.
In a letter addressed to all ten IHC judges, Justice Sattar stated that he was not aware of any full court meeting convened to consider the enactment of the Rules or the repeal of the rules.
""The Rules are, therefore, devoid of legal authority and have been issued in breach of the requirements of Article 208 as well as those of the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders, as adopted by the Islamabad High Court,"" he argued.
The letter, along with a copy of the new rules, has been submitted to the Supreme Court during hearings on a petition filed by five IHC judges challenging the transfer of three judges from other high courts to the IHC.
Justice Sattar urged his fellow judges to undertake corrective measures without delay, stressing the potential consequences for IHC staff.
He noted that if rules are challenged or it otherwise emerges that the high court has itself purported to enact rules in breach of requirements of Article 208 of the Constitution and the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders, ""it will cause great embarrassment to this high court"".
He added that it would also prejudice ""the rights and entitlements of the employees of this Court"".
He noted having received S.R.O. 585(1)/2025 dated March 25, 2025, which was published in the Gazette of Pakistan on April 10, 2025, notifying the Islamabad High Court Establishment (Appointment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 2025.
""The preamble states that the Rules have been enacted in exercise of authority under Article 208 of the Constitution, which says that the Supreme Court, the Federal Shariat Court and the Islamabad High Court, with the approval of the President and a High Court, with the approval of the Governor concerned, may make rules providing for the appointment by the Court of officers and servants of the Court and for their terms and conditions of employment.""
Justice Sattar contended that constitutional authority under Article 208 rests with the full high court.
""The authority under Article 208 of the Constitution is vested in the High Court which is defined in Article 192 of the Constitution as consisting of a Chief Justice and Judges of the High Court. The power created by Article 208 can neither be delegated nor be exercised in any manner other than by the High Court itself i.e. all Judges of the High Court in a collegiate manner.""
He further pointed to legal limitations regarding the delegation of such powers, noting that it was a settled proposition that discretionary authority cannot be sub-delegated unless the law which creates such authority provides for its further delegation.
Justice Sattar added that no such delegation exists under the existing provisions.
""In any event, the power under Article 208 of the constitution has not been delegated as is evident from the provisions of Rule 5(2) of Chapter 10, Part A of Volume-V of the Lahore High Court Rules and Orders, adopted by the Islamabad High Court.""
He also cited case law on the matter.
""The manner in which the High Court can exercise authority in terms of Article 208 of the Constitution has also been explained in Muhammad Shabbir vs. Registrar, Islamabad High Court and another (Judicial Service Appeal No. 03 of 2026),"" he added.
Meanwhile, another IHC judge, Justice Saman Riffat, also submitted her own letter to the SC.
In her May 5 letter to the IHC registrar, Justice Riffat refers to the earlier notification regarding the Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025, published via Gazette Notification No. S.R.O.169(1)/2025 dated February 18, 2025.
""As the letter dated 25-4-2025 informed her that the Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025 have been published vide gazette Notification No.S.R.O.169(1)/2025 dated 18.02.2025.""
She referred to previous correspondence contradicting the registrar's claim.
""Please recall that vide Letter dated 11-3-2025 you were informed that contrary to your assertion the Rules & Orders of the Lahore High Court. Lahore were in fact adopted by the Honourable Chief Justice and Honourable Judges of this Court vide Notification No. 354/Legis/IHC dated 28-08-2019 and not by the Administration Committee. You were directed to provide all the amendments that have been made to the Rules & Orders of the Lahore High Court, Lahore by the Administration Committees of this Court as claimed by you as well as the date on which the purported Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025 were framed and the names of the Members of the Administration Committee who framed the same.""
She further noted the absence of a reply.
""Neither such information nor copy of the Rules has been provided despite lapse of 10 days since your last letter confirming their publication,"" she added.
Justice Riffat reiterates her demand.
""Once again you are directed to provide the information and documentation as well as the purported Islamabad High Court Practice and Procedure Rules, 2025,"" she added.

"PPP threatens budget session boycott, again","SG
PTI offers support as PPP fumes over PSDP cuts, warns of firm response
In a familiar turn of events, the Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) - a key ally of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) - strongly objected to the federal budget on Monday, accusing the government of discriminating against Sindh and threatening a potential boycott of the budget approval process.
The criticism has come during the budget season when internal tensions between the coalition partners annually surface before they are settled, at least till now. Last year, a similar standoff between PPPP and PMLN had emerged, which the main opposition party had dubbed a ""fixed fight"" aimed at deflecting attention from public scrutiny.
Seeing both PPPP and PMLN at odds once again, sources said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has offered PPPP its support in blocking the budget if it was serious. Sources said that PTI's senior leader Asad Qaiser met PPPP leader Raja Pervez Ashraf at Parliament House and proposed that if PPPP was serious about boycotting the vote, the opposition party was ready to coordinate efforts.
Hoping to create a schism between the ruling party and its key ally, Qaiser reportedly said that a joint stance could increase pressure on the government. However, Ashraf reportedly assured Qaiser that the offer would be conveyed to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who is expected to join parliamentary proceedings soon.
Addressing journalists earlier, PPPP central spokesperson Shazia Atta Marri described the 2025-26 federal budget as a ""dangerous game"" being played with Sindh. She alleged that federal projects under the Public Works Department (PWD) meant for Sindh have been transferred to the federal housing ministry rather than being handed over to the provincial government, unlike similar projects in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Marri alleged that transferring PWD's urban development projects to the federal ministry was a violation of provincial autonomy. ""It seems they believe Sindh is not capable of managing its own schemes, while other provinces are considered competent,"" she said.
Emphasizing if Sindh's development projects are not handed over to the province, she said, PPP will not hesitate to take extreme measures – possibly withdrawing support to the federal government. She revealed that PPP initially refrained from giving a strong reaction as talks with the ruling party were ongoing and there was hope that Sindh's PSDP allocations and federal commitments would be honored.
However, she said, it was now clear that not only Sindh but also Punjab, particularly central Punjab and the Seraiki belt, have been neglected in the budget. She also criticized reduced funding for Sindh's universities, calling the allocation of Rs2.5 billion instead of the expected Rs4.8 billion unacceptable.
On energy, Marri pointed out a contradiction in government policy, questioning the rationale of imposing an 18% tax on solar panels while terming solar energy a national priority. Citing further discrepancies, Marri noted that just Rs15 billion funds have been allocated for the Sukkur Motorway in the budget, when its total cost of the project is Rs400 billion.
She also claimed that PPPP lawmakers in Punjab were sidelined in PSDP allocations and that the Seraiki belt was largely ignored. She concluded by saying the party's final decision, including any potential boycott, would be made in consultation with PPP chairman and that objections will be raised across all relevant forums before the PMLN government. ""We are pursuing a firm strategy. If the government fails to listen, our response will be equally firm,"" she warned.
Last year, PMLN and PPPP also had face-off as main ally of PML-N government had only a token participation in the National Assembly's budget session after the ruling party didn't bother to address PPPP's reservations about budget.
""The PML-N has violated the agreement that it reached with PPPP before forming the government in the Center as it has not taken any input from its key ally in the PSDP budget,"" Marri had shared with The Express Tribune last year, ""the government is taking us for granted.""
Subsequently, PPP had linked its support for the budget and other issues to receiving more share of power in Punjab after a meeting between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal. In addition to receiving ""more space"" in Punjab and its set-up, it had emerged that the PPP sought additional development budget for its lawmakers in the province.

New abnormal,"PK
Modi used the visit to India by US Vice President Vance to demonise Pakistan
After 4 days of combat ending with a ceasefire on 10 May, India claimed to have created a ""New Normal"" in relations with Pakistan. In reality, this sets the stage for continued hostility between two nuclear powers; a perpetual state of suspended conflict. Such endless strategic instability under the shadow of nuclear weapons will be dangerously unpredictable since any future escalation could go beyond the nuclear threshold. This in fact is a ""New Abnormal"" which requires Pakistan to further strengthen its conventional and nuclear deterrence to neutralise future Indian adventurism as it did during the May crisis.
Indian allegations of Pakistan's involvement in the Pahalgam terrorist incident on 22 April were meant to justify its aggression. No evidence has been provided so far and according to their own official sources, the investigation is still ongoing. This reinforces Pakistan's assessment that this incident was an Indian false-flag operation for achieving Prime Minister Modi's internal and external objectives.
Internally, Modi sought to use the crisis for electoral mobilisation in toughly contested forthcoming state elections. A senior India's politician, Yashwant Sinha, has conceded as much in a television interview. The same tactics were used by Modi in February 2019 by staging the Pulwama terrorist incident leading to the clash with Pakistan which ensured a massive electoral victory for him.
Externally, Modi used the visit to India by US Vice President Vance to demonise Pakistan just as India had done in 2000 during President Clinton's visit by conducting the Chattisingpura massacre. The Modi government also wanted to try and derail perceived improvement in Pakistan-US relations following President Donald Trump's appreciation of Pakistan's counter-terrorism cooperation in Afghanistan and the American interest in Pakistan's mineral potential. An added objective was to weaponise water by illegally holding the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance.
However, the Indian plan backfired, diplomatically and militarily. No country, not even Indian allies like the US or Russia or those in QUAD, blamed Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack. The statement adopted by UN Security Council did not either accuse Pakistan or refer to Pahalgam as part of Indian Territory. Moreover, the Indian attack thereafter was not endorsed by any country. Instead, the international community called for a ceasefire and de-escalation. As such, India stood totally isolated.
Militarily, the outcome of the Indian aggression was even worse for Modi. While innocent Pakistani civilians were killed and some mosques were destroyed on 6-7 May, India lost six of its advanced fighter aircraft in the aerial combat. In response to subsequent Indian attacks on military targets, Pakistan carried out its own robust response in which 24 Indian military assets were destroyed or damaged. This compelled India to seek a ceasefire which was first offered by India's own army and air force spokespersons. Eventually, the Americans bailed out India by brokering a ceasefire. President Trump also called for a dialogue to resolve the Kashmir dispute and offered to mediate a solution. This proved to be a further blow for India since Modi's claim about normalcy in Kashmir was exposed along with greater international focus on the dispute as a nuclear flashpoint.
However, since Modi and his media minions had built up a frenzied war hysteria, acceptance of the ceasefire was seen as succumbing to American pressure, leading to a strong backlash against his government. Seeking damage limitation, Modi claimed that the military operation had been ""paused"" and that he had set a new normal or new red-line according to which India would react militarily against Pakistan in case of any terrorist attack without waiting for proof of Pakistani involvement. As such India claimed the right to act unilaterally, pre-emptively and repeatedly, behaving as judge, jury and executioner. Modi also claimed to have called Pakistan's nuclear bluff by not submitting to ""nuclear blackmail"". As such, India claimed to create space for military operations below the nuclear threshold.
This Indian attempt to enforce compellence and coercion against a nuclear power is both unrealistic and dangerous. The glaring fact is that Pakistan effectively deterred India through conventional means and at no point was the nuclear option even considered. More to the point, India itself avoided resort to its Cold Start or Dynamic Response doctrine for war under the nuclear threshold. As such, Pakistan did not need to implement its Full Spectrum Deterrence option. Consequently, Pakistan's conventional capabilities proved sufficient for credible deterrence. Moreover, the so-called ""New Normal"" ended with Indian acceptance of a ceasefire - just as in the crisis of 2001-2002 and 2019 which is not ""New"" by any measure.
Even objective Indian security analysts have recognised is that while nuclear deterrence prevented outbreak of a full scale war, strategic stability between the two nuclear powers has been undermined. For instance it is claimed that ""mere presence of its nuclear arsenal gave Pakistan space for conventional action"" and that India ""climbed the escalation ladder but lacked an endgame"", which ""exposed the gap between Modi's bombastic rhetoric and India's strategic calculations"". It is also recognised that Modi's new normal is a ""hallow"" doctrine without any strategic thought behind it and aimed essentially at the domestic audience.
From its perspective, Pakistan ensured that deterrence held at all levels - conventional and nuclear - reinforcing that no space exists for conventional war between nuclear powers. Pakistan also demonstrated the required conventional capability to deter a much larger military threat.
Pakistan now needs to capitalise on these developments. National defence capabilities in both conventional and strategic domains need to be continuously upgraded. In this regard, our partnership with China has proved to be invaluable which requires further enhancement. Similarly, collaboration with allies like Turkey and Azerbaijan must be strengthened. India should be actively projected on a sustained basis as a reckless rogue state that promotes terrorism in Pakistan, has weaponised water and pursues policies that undermine strategic stability, not only between nuclear powers but also other South Asian neighbours.
That is the only way to ensure national security in the future of a ""New Abnormal"".

Consequently, the case file was forwarded to the chief justice for an appropriate order.
Earlier, the court had reserved its decision on whether the contempt petition should be heard by a single-member bench or the larger bench.

"K-P Opposition rejects budget, cites failures","US
Slams PTI's fiscal plan as misleading, debt-heavy, and lacking in development and transparency
Opposition parties in the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly have outright rejected the provincial budget for the fiscal year 202526, expressing deep reservations over its substance. In stark contrast, government members lauded the budget, hailing it as the ""best in the province's history.""
Leader of the Opposition, Dr Ibadullah, speaking on the floor of the House, criticized the budget by highlighting the province's heavy reliance on external sources.
""Only seven per cent of the province's revenue is internally generated, while 93 per cent depends on federal transfers and loans,"" he said.
""Government expenditures make up 99 per cent while development spending is only 1 per cent. This is the 12th and likely the last budget of PTI's rule.""
He criticized the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government for failing to fully utilize Annual Development Program (ADP) funds during its 12-year rule. ""There's a lot of activity on social media, but the reality on the ground is that the province lies in ruins,"" he added.
Dr Ibadullah also made references to international and regional politics, praising the army for its response to Indian aggression and expressing solidarity with Iran.
Addressing the development allocations, he noted: ""Though Rs538 billion has been earmarked for development, this is not a surplus budget as claimed. The figures are misleading, and the public is being deceived.""
He pointed out the provincial debt ballooning from Rs166 billion during the ANP era to Rs800 billion under PTI, amounting to a 600 per cent increase.
He called out failures in flagship projects such as the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and raised corruption allegations related to the Kohistan, Malam Jabba, and Billion Tree Tsunami scandals.
""Rs31 billion have been recovered from the Kohistan scam alone due to the Speaker's efforts,"" he claimed.
He also lamented the overall state of education and healthcare in the province, saying that 30 per cent of schools lack basic facilities and a large percentage of students struggle with basic subjects like Urdu and mathematics.
In higher education, he accused universities of mass hiring and lack of research output, while also claiming that 60 per cent of Basic Health Units (BHUs) are non-functional.
""Health cards are being politicized, and hospitals are in a dire state. Tell us one positive achievement,"" he demanded.

"Dare not look at Pakistan, Dar warns Israel","US
FM rejects Pakistan nuke threat to Israel; dismisses 'fake news'
Pakistan on Monday strongly rejected claims that it threatened to nuke Israel if it dropped an atom bomb on Iran, even as the foreign minister warned Tel Aviv ""dare not look at Pakistan"" with an evil eye.
Ishaq Dar, who is the leader of the house in the Senate as well as deputy prime minister, stressed that Pakistan's nuclear and missile programs were meant for the defence of the country.
Dar said that the news attributed to an Iranian general regarding a nuclear strike on Israel was false and based on ""fake news"".
The foreign minister's remarks came at a time when reports were circulating on social media and mainstream media, claiming that in the event of a nuclear attack on Iran, Pakistan would retaliate by launching a nuclear strike on Israel.
While speaking in the Senate on Monday, Pakistan's foreign minister said, ""This is fake news"".
""Pakistan's nuclear program is a trust of our nation. This programme has been achieved by the Pakistani nation through immense sacrifices.""
He said that misleading misinformation was being spread and urged caution. ""A clip about US President Trump was circulating yesterday, but it was later discovered to be AI-generated,"" he said.
He mentioned that after June 13, several fake news stories emerged.
""Netanyahu's interview being circulated is from 2011. In such a sensitive situation, everyone should act responsibly. This is not child's play - a serious kind of war is underway. Iran's foreign minister remained in constant contact with me during the negotiations,"" he said.
He stressed the need for caution: ""A lot of wrong and misleading news is spreading. War is no joke. We must clarify things regarding fake news. The reports suggesting that Pakistan would launch a nuclear strike on Israel in case of an attack on Iran are baseless. Our nuclear and missile programs are solely for our own defence.""
He, however, made it clear that Pakistan was on high alert in view of the regional tensions and warned Israel not to cast an evil eye on Pakistan.
""Our message is very clear for Israel: Dare not look at Pakistan,"" Dar said, adding Pakistan had the strength and resolve to give a befitting response to any malafide action.
He recalled that the entire world saw the unity shown by the people of Pakistan in the wake of Indian aggression.
""God willing, we will remain united. When it comes to safeguarding the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Pakistan, we are all one,"" he remarked.
""By the grace of Almighty, we have enough strength that whoever dares to look at us with hostility, we will respond with greater force,"" he added.
Dar said that the foreign ministers of Oman and Iran kept him updated on developments. ""We played our role regarding the UN Security Council meeting, and Iran expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its support,"" he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar also stated that due to the Iran-Israel tensions, Iranian pilgrims had become stranded in Saudi Arabia. ""Iran requested our assistance,"" he said.
""We will welcome the Iranian pilgrims at Karachi Airport, issue them on-arrival visas, and allow them to stay in Karachi. Afterwards, the Iranian government will take them back via shuttle service through road routes,"" he added.
Referring to the ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, the Pakistani foreign minister said that a serious nature of war has already started between the two countries.
""We are making every effort for dialogue, particularly for successful negotiations between the United States and Iran.""
According to Ishaq Dar, Iran's foreign minister had taken him into confidence regarding the talks with the US.
He added that Pakistan has supported Iran diplomatically, and Iran has also appreciated Pakistan's role.
""We have been in contact with Iran's foreign minister, and he has said that they will give a strong response to Israel.""

Govt limits powers of taxmen,"PK
Decision comes after PM steps in to address concerns of people, businesses
After the hue and cry made by common people and businesspersons, the federal government on Monday decided to radically limit the proposed powers for arresting executives and also simplified the income tax on cash-on-delivery of goods at home.
The decisions were made after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif intervened over concerns expressed by people about giving powers of arresting businessmen to junior tax officers.
However, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, where these decisions were disclosed, opposed the grant of authority to share taxpayer information with banks and to allow taxmen to enter business premises in income tax cases. PPP's Syed Naveed Qamar chaired the committee meeting.
The prime minister on Monday chaired a meeting and decided that safeguards would be introduced to limit the arresting powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in the standing committee meeting.
The government has proposed in the budget to give the FBR the authority to arrest people in tax fraud cases without arrest warrants from any magistrate. This set off alarm bells across the country.
Another NAB in the form of FBR could not be allowed, remarked MNA Sharmila Faruqui, who also criticised the permission to the FBR to share taxpayer information with commercial banks.
The authority to arrest people for tax fraud should only be given in cases where huge amounts were involved, PM Sharif said while chairing the meeting.
FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial said that new safeguards would be introduced to limit the use of such powers. He said that a person could only be arrested if he tried to escape from the country.
According to another safeguard, the person can be arrested for tampering with evidence or if he does not appear before the FBR despite the issuance of three notices. An executive could be arrested over tax fraud involving large amounts, likely to be set above Rs50 million, said the FBR chairman.
Langrial added that a special FBR board comprising three members would give permission for arresting an executive, instead of the current proposal to give powers to a junior officer.
While reviewing the budget, the standing committee objected to imposing taxes on cash-on-delivery of goods. The government has proposed 0.25% to 2% income tax on cash-on-delivery of goods.
There would be single and separate rates for payment in cash or in digital mode, said Bilal Azhar Kayani, Minister of State for Finance. He said that the tax rate on cash payment would be higher than the digital mode to compensate for revenues and discourage a cash economy.
FBR's Member Policy Najeeb Memon said that the government aimed to collect Rs59 billion from the tax on cash-on-delivery for goods.
Meanwhile, Standing Committee Chairman Syed Naveed Qamar urged the FBR to ask the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to continue the tax rebate for teachers and researchers in the next fiscal year too.
The FBR chairman had committed that 25% rebate would continue but the amendment said otherwise, said MNA Nafisa Shah. However, Langrial said that the IMF did not agree to the rebate beyond June 2025. He will again take up the issue with the IMF.
Langrial informed the standing committee that the income tax credit regime for non-profit organisations (NPOs) had been made stringent on the IMF's insistence. Unlike the current system, the NPOs will have to file income tax returns to claim tax credit and the FBR will have the authority to review business activities of these entities.
Langrial had to face a lot of criticism for corrupt practices in his organisation and in that backdrop for giving more powers under Section 175A related to banks and Section 175C related to business premises.
""Unfortunately, your department has a very bad reputation and it's not desirable to move onto a new territory,"" said Syed Naveed Qamar.
Langrial made a surprising statement by offering to leave his position after July 1, if he could not appoint at least 90% of people with clean reputation in key FBR offices.
""From July 1, 90% of FBR people working in key field offices won't be corrupt and if majority of those still remain corrupt, I will not do this job,"" he said.
The powers to allow FBR employees to sit in business offices in income tax matters were not aimed at enhancing revenue but to open avenues for corruption, said MNA Ali Sarfraz.
""The FBR is getting under the skin of the industry and its new powers will lead to harassment and open new mines of corruption,"" said MNA Nafisa Shah.

Flooded by neglect,"US
There is no shortage of evidence proving that drain clean-ups demand immediate action
For an agricultural country, rain has always held the power to heal communities, rejuvenate crops and strengthen the livelihood of many. But since more than a decade ago, this divine gift has turned into a death sentence for Pakistanis residing in Karachi. Yet again, despite repeated opportunities to prepare for the upcoming monsoonal season, the city is headed towards destruction as delayed funding obstruct full-scale drain clean-ups. With 20 to 30 per cent more rainfall expected this year, Karachi is instead preparing for flooded roads, collapsing infrastructure, waterborne diseases and severe economic disruption.
While KMC awaits funding and support for its large-scale cleaning operations, urban academics highlight the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board's failure to prevent the dumping of garbage into storm drains which reduces their operational capacity. In turn, the Board has touted its own lack of funding. At the centre of the tango that these corporations and government bodies are enmeshed in, stands a man in knee-deep water trying to get to work at the risk of electrocution from exposed electrical wiring. The horrors of urban flooding caused by rainfall are endless. Not only the derelict neighbouhoods but many posh areas also turn into cesspools. Major thoroughfares remain impassable for days due to standing water standing.
In 2020, Karachi saw its worst flooding in almost a century - which killed at least 41 people - and that was majorly caused by the city's poorly maintained drainage systems. There is no shortage of evidence proving that drain clean-ups demand immediate action. According to experts, the upcoming cleaning efforts have already been rendered less effective due to current delays. And since they are time-intensive, their efficacy will only continue to decline with every passing day - unless urgent action is taken.

CM hails 'largest development budget',"US
Indicates payment of performance bonus to govt officials
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif asserts while addressing a provincial cabinet meeting on Monday, ""We are not only giving a zero tax budget, but the largest development budget. The previous development budget was also a record, we will break all our own records. We not only gave a surplus budget of Rs740 billion despite fulfilling IMF conditions, but also delivered by imposing emergency in the province.""
The chief minister said 100 innovative programmes and projects had started in Punjab, 700 roads were being built, and the construction and expansion of 12,000km of roads is a record.
She added, ""Full attention is focused on the people, there is no example of such a hefty budget in health and education in the history. Free medicines will be available everywhere. We will also meet our target of providing essential facilities in government schools during this year.""
She underscored, ""A record of cleanliness was set across the province on the Eid. It is easy to increase taxes by increasing their rate, but instead we will focus on enhancing the tax net. If we build two or four big projects, it seems as if a big job has been done, but we have brought 100 new programmes. More than 40,000 houses could not even be built in 40 years but we have completed them in just one year.""
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said, ""I have memorised figures related to each department in the 2025-26 budget, which will prove to be an unprecedented budget in the history of the country.""
She added, ""We will consider the grant of bonus to government employees on their performance, minimum wage of a labourers is fixed at Rs40,000 per month."" She emphasised, ""The wage system should be digitalised. The rate of local debt in Punjab has decreased by a record 94%.""
The chief minister said, ""We are presenting a historic package of public service. Governance is improving due to financial discipline.""
She added, ""The entire progress will be presented in the provincial assembly, everyone will tell how much funds were spent where. No scandal surfaced due to e-tendering and good governance.""

Lawyers strike over 'police misconduct',"GB
The Bar President and Secretary warned of strong repercussions
The District Bar Association observed a complete strike on Monday, boycotting court proceedings in protest against the alleged assault, mistreatment, and false FIR against former Bar Joint Secretary Malik Tajammul Awan and senior lawyer Chaudhry Rizwan Elahi by traffic police personnel.
During the Bar meeting, lawyers unanimously passed a resolution to ban the entry of traffic wardens and traffic police officers into the District Courts complex.

They also called for the City Traffic Officer (CTO) to be barred from entering the court premises, declaring that the traffic police's misconduct will no longer be tolerated.
Bar Secretary Malik Asad Mahmood stated that no law permits traffic wardens to act violently or abusively, adding, ""This matter will not be treated as routine. Strict action must be taken against the responsible warden.""
A resolution condemning the conduct of the involved traffic warden was also passed. As part of the strike, lawyers did not appear in any court proceedings, which brought judicial activity to a standstill across district, civil, family, and special courts.

SBP holds interest rate at 11%,"PK
Flags trade deficit, weak inflows and global uncertainty as key threats
The State Bank of Pakistan's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) on Monday decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11%, as it cautiously navigates multiple economic challenges. While inflation expectations remain contained for now, the central bank flagged rising risks to the external sector due to a widening trade deficit, weak financial inflows, and global uncertainties including volatile oil prices and geopolitical tensions. Domestically, the economy faces subdued agricultural output, heavy reliance on domestic borrowing, and the pressing need for structural reforms, including broadening the tax base and privatising loss-making public enterprises, to ensure fiscal consolidation and sustainable growth.
In its latest review, the MPC noted that the year-on-year headline inflation rose to 3.5% in May 2025largely as anticipatedcompared to 0.3% in April. However, core inflation saw a marginal decline, and inflation expectations among businesses and households also moderated. The committee maintained that inflation is expected to trend higher in the coming months but will likely stabilise within the target range of 5% to 7% during fiscal year 2025-26 (FY26).
The decision to leave the policy rate unchanged comes as Pakistan's economic growth shows signs of gradual improvement. The real GDP growth for the outgoing fiscal year is provisionally estimated at 2.7%, with the government targeting an ambitious 4.2% growth for FY26. The MPC expects the impact of prior interest rate cuts to continue filtering through the economy, further boosting demand and investment activity over the next year.
Despite these positive signals, the committee flagged several challenges that could undermine the recovery momentum. Chief among these is the sustained widening of the trade deficit and sluggish financial inflows, which have heightened pressures on the external account. The MPC also warned that some of the proposed budgetary measures for FY26such as incentives or subsidies that could spur importsmay exacerbate the trade imbalance.
Among recent economic developments, the MPC pointed to the broadly balanced current account position in April 2025, which brought the cumulative surplus to $1.9 billion in the July-April period. This balance was supported largely by strong workers' remittances, which helped offset the impact of rising imports and slowing exports amid a tough global trading environment. The disbursement of $1 billion under the first review of the International Monetary Fund's Extended Fund Facility contributed to boosting the SBP's foreign exchange reserves to $11.7 billion by early June.
However, the external outlook remains precarious. The MPC expects the current account to shift into a moderate deficit in FY26, as domestic demand leads to stronger import growth while export prospects remain dim due to persistent global economic uncertainty. Additionally, financial inflows have not met expectations, though reserves are projected to climb to $14 billion by the end of June 2025. The committee also highlighted risks stemming from geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East, and volatility in international oil pricesfactors that could worsen the external sector position.
On the fiscal side, the MPC mentioned improvements in both the overall fiscal and primary balances for FY25. The primary surplus is now projected at 2.2% of GDPup from 0.9% the previous yearhelped by rising revenues and restrained expenditures, especially in public sector development programs (PSDP). For FY26, the government aims for a higher primary surplus target of 2.4% of GDP. The central bank emphasised that maintaining fiscal discipline through effective reformssuch as broadening the tax base and overhauling state-owned enterpriseswill be critical to sustaining macroeconomic stability.
Turning to the real economy, the MPC noted that GDP growth picked up pace in the second half of FY25, reaching 3.9% after a subdued first half marked by only 1.4% expansion. While industry and services sectors drove the recovery, agriculture lagged behind due to a notable drop in major crop production. The outlook for the agriculture sector remains cautious, with early data on the Kharif season suggesting potential setbacks due to unfavourable weather conditions. In contrast, momentum in industry and services is expected to continue, supported by improving business confidence, private sector credit expansion, and rising imports of machinery and intermediate goods.
In the monetary domain, broad money (M2) growth slowed to 12.6% by late May, down from 13.3% at the previous policy review. This deceleration was attributed to reduced government borrowing from the banking system. Meanwhile, private sector credit rose by 11%, reflecting robust demand from textiles, telecommunications, and wholesale and retail businesses. Consumer financing also expanded at a healthy pace, indicating improved economic sentiment.
The MPC observed a sharp rise in reserve money growth, largely driven by seasonal demand for cash during Eid. To manage liquidity and keep the interbank overnight repo rate close to the policy rate, the SBP ramped up its liquidity injections into the banking system.
Despite the modest rise in inflation in May, energy prices remained lower compared to the previous year due to the earlier decline in global oil prices. However, the central bank cautioned that recent budgetary measures could introduce near-term price volatility, though their overall inflationary impact is expected to be limited. Risks to the inflation outlook remain, including potential disruptions in global supply chains, geopolitical conflicts, commodity price swings, and adjustments in domestic energy tariffs.

Fire erupts in Saddar Electronics Market,"PK
Electronic items stored in the shops were completely destroyed.
A fire broke out in an electronics market building near Regal Chowk, Saddar on Monday.
The blaze erupted in a multi-storey commercial building located in a densely packed lane. The flames started on the ground, quickly spreading to the upper levels.
Teams from the KMC Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122 battled the flames for over two hours before bringing the situation under control.
Five fire tenders from KMC, two water bowsers, a snorkel, and a Rescue 1122 fire truck, along with an ambulance, rushed to the scene. Due to the narrow alleys and a lack of direct access to the interior of the building, firefighters launched the operation from the rear side.
Heavy smoke and poor visibility complicated the operation, but firefighters managed to control the fire.
Electronic items stored in the shops were completely destroyed.
Chief Fire Officer Humayun Khan said that 80 per cent of fire incidents in the Saddar area are caused by short circuits due to haphazard electrical wiring. He added that the exact cause and damage would be determined after the cooling process.Despite the intensity of the blaze, no injuries were reported.

Blue whale found dead in Gwatar Bay,"PK
WWF-Pakistan expresses concern over mortality
A blue whale measuring about 35 feet long was recorded dead at a remote area in Gwatar Bay between Pakistan and Iran on Monday.
A local fisherman, Ahmad Baloch, who was fishing in the area, reported the incident of a dead whale floating near Kuntani, Balochistan.
It is likely that the whale may have died a few days back in the open seawaters between Pakistan and Iran, and it drifted towards the Gwatar Bay under the influence of a rough sea and strong currents, a news release said.
Although the cause of the death is not ascertained so far, it seems the animal might have gotten entangled in gillnets that are used for catching fish in the coastal and offshore waters in the area.
Blue whale, scientifically called Balaenoptera musculus, is one of three baleen whales reported from Pakistani waters.
The other two whales are the Bryde's whale and the Arabian humpback whale.
There are four subspecies of blue whales, of which two include the pygmy blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus brevicauda) and the Indian Ocean blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus indica) found in the Northern Indian Ocean. Considering its small size, this dead blue whale sighted at Kuntani may be a pygmy blue whale.
Muhammad Moazzam Khan, Technical Advisor, WWF-Pakistan, expressed concerns over the mortality of the blue whale and termed it sad news for the conservation community around the world.
He shared that the blue whale is known to be distributed in tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian Ocean.
Khan emphasized that although this whale is categorized as an endangered species, urgent steps are required for its conservation. Now all cetaceans, including whales and dolphins, are protected under the wildlife and fisheries legislations of Sindh and Balochistan.

Mathews hails 'dream run' in final Test against BD,"US
Hosts Sri Lanka begin series as firm favourites
Sri Lanka are set to begin a two-Test series against Bangladesh in Galle on Tuesday that will mark the end of Angelo Mathews's ""dream run"" in the game's longest format, as the cricket season resumed following South Africa's World Test Championship triumph at Lord's.
The red-ball matches between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will be followed by a white-ball series of three one-day internationals and three T20s.
Hosts Sri Lanka begin the contest as firm favourites, eager to turn a fresh page after a stuttering end to the previous WTC cycle.
Sri Lanka were firmly in the mix for a place in the WTC final until December before the wheels came off spectacularly.
Two defeats in South Africa followed by a twin collapse at Galle against Australia saw them tumble down the rankings.
""We had one hand on a spot in the final but a few brain fades at crunch moments cost us dearly,"" Sri Lankan captain Dhananjaya de Silva told reporters on Monday.
""We've learnt our lessons. A strong home start lays the foundation for success on the road.""
Sri Lanka's squad includes six uncapped players, with at least one debut cap set to be handed out.
Spin remains Sri Lanka's strength, with Prabath Jayasuriya the key and selectors also calling up off-spinner Akila Dananjaya.
Bangladesh enter the series without stalwarts Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan, and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto is realistic about the challenge.
""Tamim and Shakib -- those are massive boots to fill,"" he said. ""But this is a chance for the young guys to put their hands up.""
Shanto, who is playing in Galle for the first time, said the team have ""prepped well and we're ready for the challenge"".
The Test will also be the swansong of Sri Lanka's veteran Angelo Mathews, who is retiring after 118 Tests.
The former skipper also played his first Test on the famous pitch perched beneath the fortress in Galle in 2009.
""It's been a dream run,"" said 38-year-old Mathews.
""The wins in England in 2014 and whitewashing the Aussies in 2016 stand out. I've seen so many youngsters come through the ranks,"" he said.
""I truly believe Sri Lanka's future is in good hands.""
Sri Lanka have won 20 of the 26 Tests they have played against Bangladesh, who have only managed a solitary win along with five draws.
The second Test will begin in Colombo on June 25.

Kosinski told reporters after an advance showing at the Canadian Grand Prix that the involvement of Hamilton, who joined Ferrari this season after winning six of his seven titles at Mercedes, had been key.
The 40-year-old Briton is credited as a co-producer while his Dawn Apollo production company was also involved. Kosinski, who directed the hit Top Gun: Maverick, explained how Hamilton was the first person he reached out to with the idea of a film.
""I sent him an email and just said 'I want to tell the story in your world. I want to make it as authentic as possible. Will you help me?'"" he said. ""And luckily Lewis said yes... He had actually talked to me earlier about playing a role in Top Gun: Maverick. So that's how I knew Lewis.""
Hamilton, who had to turn down a part in that Tom Cruise film because of his racing commitments, acted as go-between with Formula One and as a consultant advising on technical accuracy and authenticity.
He was also a driver advisor to Pitt and co-star Damson Idris.
""At Hungary, for instance, he said, 'If Brad's going to let someone pass during a blue flag and he wants it to be as tight as possible, he's going to only do that at turn six,'"" recalled Kosinski. ""That kind of detail... from a seven-time world champion who lives and breathes this world every day, I couldn't have gotten that from anywhere else.""
Hamilton also contributed to the story and served as an inspiration for one scene where Pitt's character talks about why he races in spiritual terms.
""So his involvement has been amazing. We couldn't make the film without him.""
Producer Jerry Bruckheimer referred to Hamilton's insistence on authenticity also in the sound of the film, citing an example at Silverstone where the Briton had pointed out a corner was taken in second gear but the audio was of fourth gear.
""It's that kind of detail that went into this,"" he said.
Hamilton has said Pitt's speed is real and the film will be the most authentic racing film yet.
Formula One is hoping the film cements the appeal of the Netflix docu-series Drive to Survive that has boosted Formula One's popularity and growth worldwide and particularly in the key US market.
""I think there's this perception that Drive to Survive turned America onto F1 but I think there's just so many more people out there that don't know anything about it,"" said Kosinski. ""So there's a lot of potential still there."" Reuters

"Privilege, justice and kindness","US
This year we find ourselves in the midst of several challenges
Later this week, on Friday June 20th, many institutions and organisations around the world that work on refugee related issues will commemorate the World Refugee Day. The idea of the World Refugee Day started in 2001 to mark the 50th anniversary of the 1951 Geneva Refugee Convention. This year we find ourselves in the midst of several challenges. On one end is seemingly endless conflict in many parts of the world. On the other, there is a greater concern about the future of institutions that focus on the issues facing refugees and migrants - including structures within the UN system. UN High Commission for Refugees is facing serious cuts, and some recent reports indicate that the entire office dedicated to health and migrants within the World Health Organization may disappear altogether.
Facing these headwinds, arguments by individuals and institutions are being put forward about why we should care about those who are forcibly displaced due to conflict, persecution, xenophobia and climate change. A common argument is that refugees are good for the economy. That they contribute to job creation, they work hard, and they do work in sectors that other 'locals' may not be interested in. These arguments are often backed up by economic data. I have never been a fan of this line of thinking. I worry that this argument reduces our humanity. If we only look at who is good for the economy, should a refugee who is an elderly person, or a child, or has some disability be crossed off our lists? Is our empathy tied exclusively to who is 'productive' and 'good for us'?
I was traveling in South Africa last week and have been thinking about the issue of privilege and justice. At a museum in Durban, I was reminded, again, about the injustice and horrors of apartheid. Alongside countless Blacks, Indians and coloured persons of South Africa who stood up against the evil system, there were also white citizens from all sectors of society who were privileged, not subjected to the racist laws, and in principle could have benefitted from the segregationist system. There were church goers, among the Dutch Reform Church in South Africa, who found the position of their church to be morally indefensible and stood up for justice and human dignity. These people, alongside their black, coloured and south Asian community members, paid a very heavy price for their moral compass. Their struggle, and their rejection of the privileged system that was ensuring their economic success, was not in vain. In a divided world of exclusion and injustice for many who suffer, but stable, enabling and fertile for those of us who are privileged, the museum reminded me once again to ask ourselves - what does justice and human dignity demand of us? Are we brave enough to stand up for a fairer world? Does our privilege deny others their basic humanity?
Perhaps there is a different way to think about forced displacement. Whether or not one has technically been a refugee or not (since the term has a specific legal connotation), we all have benefitted from the kindness of others in difficult times; others who owed us nothing, or did not ask if we would be good for their financial future. Many of us have had family members or loved ones who had to leave a home, a town or a country overnight. Think of the partition, 1971 or many other events of the past. These loved ones were helped not just by family, but by strangers - who did not have to help them, but they did anyway. Those who helped gave up something - their time, their money, part of their home or something else. But their sacrifice, small as it may have been, was not in vain. It saved an individual or a family from harm.
History reminds us that no one knows when one may have to flee their home and leave in the middle of the night. And should that happen to us, how would we want to be treated? What kind of a world would we want to live in? Maybe we should ask ourselves, what is stopping us from creating that world?

PM says blue economy is Pakistan's next frontier,"CN
Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff Commodore Ahsan Ali Khan emphasised the vast economic potential of oceans
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday called for a unified national effort and stronger collaboration between the public and private sectors to transform the maritime sector into a catalyst for inclusive growth and unlock its vast potential.
Addressing the soft launch ceremony of the second Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference (PIMEC)-2025, the prime minister laid out the vision for transforming Pakistan into a regional maritime powerhouse, declaring the ""blue economy"" as Pakistan's ""new economic frontier"".
With over 1,000 kilometers of coastline and a position at the crossroads of vital sea lanes, the prime minister said, Pakistan was uniquely positioned to harness the trillion-dollar blue economy globally. ""Even tapping a fraction of this economy could be a real game-changer,"" he said.
""Our coastal trade already brings in nearly $7 billion a year and just imagine the potential if we fully develop this sector,"" he said. He lauded the Pakistan Navy and the Maritime Affairs Ministry for their strategic foresight and dedication in steering this important initiative.
On the occasion, Maritime Affairs Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry outlined the government's strategic roadmap for the maritime sector. He reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to building a vibrant blue economy and introduced the ""Maritime at 100"" Vision.
He explained that the ""Maritime at 100"" was a long-term plan to grow this sector into a $100 billion economic force by 2047. ""The oceans are not just water bodies, they are economic lifelines. Pakistan must position itself as a regional maritime hub,"" he said.
Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff Commodore Ahsan Ali Khan emphasised the vast economic potential of oceans. He noted that oceans were increasingly being tapped for tourism, renewable energy, aquaculture, and extraction of valuable resources like hydrocarbons and minerals.
Meanwhile, talking to Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam during the PIMEC-2025, the prime minister discussed the current regional situation, according to the Prime Minister's Office Media Wing a press release.
Prime Minister Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan's condemnation of the recent Israeli aggression against Iran and expressed the nation's sympathies with the brotherly neighbour over the martyrdom of its innocent civilians.
The prime minister reiterated Pakistan's solidarity with Iran and its people during this time of heightened tension. He termed the Israeli attacks on Iran a complete violation of the UN Charter and the international laws.
Referring to his recent telephone conversation with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, the prime minister said that Pakistan supported Iran at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting, the press release added.

Court moved against appointment of new HEC executive director,"PK
Situation poses serious challenges for current administration
The situation at the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan has become complicated following the removal of the executive director, posing serious challenges to the current administration.
Some people have approached the courts against the advertisement issued by the Commission for the appointment of a new executive director. The complainants who filed petitions in court have raised objections regarding the advertisement for the appointment of new executive director. The advertisement has been challenged in the Lahore High Court as well as in a court in Islamabad.
It has been reported that the court has issued a stay order, halting the recruitment process for the new executive director. In the advertisement published in the last week of May, the age limit was set at 65 years. However, in the advertisement for the same position in 2023, the age limit was 62 years, which is being considered a violation of federal government rules.
Furthermore, the advertisement allows candidates only 15 days to submit applications, compared to 30 days in the 2023 advertisement.
Critics argue that since the current HEC Chairman, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed, is completing his third term in the last week of July and wants the appointment to be made during his tenure, the entire process is being rushed. There is also ambiguity regarding further extension of Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed's term.
Sources close to Dr. Mukhtar said that he was initially given a two-year term, of which one year has passed, and he may now receive an additional year. However, his critics point out that he has already served as HEC Chairman twice before and was appointed for a third term, meaning this is not a new term but merely a one-year extension, which will expire on July 29.
Meanwhile, regarding the appointment of the executive director, it has been learned that the HEC has reportedly received over two dozen applications from across the country, including vice chancellors of some public sector universities from Sindh and Punjab. However, the HEC chairman does not consider some of them suitable for the position.

Uproar in PA over provincial budget 2025-26,"US
PPP members hail it as people-centric, opposition terms it anti-poor
The discussion on the provincial budget for 2025-26 commenced in the Sindh Assembly on Monday with several members from government as well as opposition benches voicing contrasting views.
The session, with Deputy Speaker Naveed Anthony in the chair, saw mixed reaction as government members hailed the budget as a people-centric, while opposition members termed it as anti-poor and away from ground realities.
Opening the debate, MQM-P's Jamal Ahmed Khan highlighted the problems in his constituency, saying that people in North Nazimabad were struggling for water. He said, the solid waste management system was dysfunctional, and trash remained uncollected for three days, negates city mayor's commitment of cleaning all areas and roads. Jamal questioned, which roads and areas he is talking about?
PPP's Shazia Karim accused the federal government of discriminatory treatment towards Sindh. She criticised the exclusion of key projects including the Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway and the K-IV water project. She questioned, ""Is Sindh a slave to the federation?""
PPP's Ijaz Shah Bukhari said the people had not forgotten the days of bodies found in gunny bags in Karachi, asserting that the PPP had always stood by the public. He criticised the federal government's neglectful attitude toward Sindh, pointing out the ongoing 16-hour power outages in the province.
He called for upgrading the Tando Muhammad Khan Hospital to the district level, increasing its budget, and providing a fire brigade for the local municipal committee.
MQM-P's Abdullah Sheikh warned against maligning the Mohajir community through 'baseless allegations', while raising pointed questions about Zulfiqar Mirza from the gang war era.
He mentioned an incident in Surjani Town where one person lost his life after receiving an extortion note.
PPP's Maliha Manzoor defended saying, the budget was people-friendly. ""Women flood victims will receive property rights. Pink buses are already operating in Karachi, and we plan to introduce EV taxis and scooters,"" she said.
MQM-P's Farah Sohail slammed the budget as anti-people, saying the Sindh government continued the 17-year trend of ignoring public needs.
She question, where the PPP's 'Roti, Kapra aur Makaan' has gone. She claimed that development funds were slashed and projects left uninitiated.
She also criticised the government's health sector performance, pointing out that an assembly member was set to receive Rs70 million in public funds for medical treatment abroad. Ijaz Haq of MQM-P criticised the lack of budget allocations for Orangi Town and the continued neglect of the Qatar Hospital trauma centre.
PPP's Nuzhat Pathan said, despite the federal government's neglect, Sindh has managed to present a better budget.
PPP's MPA Farzana Baloch raised the issue of K-Electric's overbilling and its impact on Karachi's residents. ""Those who pay are punished, while defaulters go unchecked,"" she remarked. PTI's Muhammad Owais condemned the recent arrests of party workers and MPAs, including former opposition leaders, during a youth wing rally. He criticised the PPP for ignoring opposition recommendations in the budget and failing to manage K-Electric's performance.
MQM-P's Adil Askari accused Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah of nepotism and objected to the appointment of his brother-in-law as chief secretary which is against the principles of good governance. His comments drew strong backlash from PPP members. His remarks angered PPP members, leading to an uproar in the House.
PPP MPA, Mukesh Chawla strongly objected to the speech and demanded that the chief minister's name be removed from the record, calling the statement 'unnecessary and inflammatory'. Following the objections, members from both parties stood up and exchanged harsh words, further escalating the tension. The session descended into chaos, prompting the acting speaker to intervene.
The acting speaker urged the lawmakers, saying, ""Please refrain from directly addressing each other. Maintain the dignity of the House."" The situation intensified further when another MQM-P member addressed PPP's Farooq Awan, saying, ""If, as you say, the MQM founder was a devil, you were probably an inspector in the Sindh Police back then. If you had the courage, you should have spoken up at the time. Now that his politics are over, there's no point in cursing him.""
Following the debate, the Assembly was adjourned until 10am on Tuesday. The debate is expected to continue over the next several days.

FinMin chairs oil price monitoring huddle,"TR
Expresses satisfaction over stock levels, rules out immediate supply disruption
Minister for Finance and Revenue Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb on Monday chaired the inaugural meeting of a high-level committee established to monitor petroleum prices amid rising regional tensions. The committee conducted a comprehensive assessment of both global and domestic petroleum market situation.
In response to the evolving geopolitical situation following Israel's recent attack on Iran and the resulting volatility in the international oil markets, the prime minister has constituted a high-level committee to monitor petroleum product pricing and supply dynamics, according to a press release issued by the ministry.

Groundwater depletion alarms Chakwal residents,"PL
Locals report that underground water levels have significantly dropped
A severe water shortage has gripped the Kahoon region of Tehsil Choa Saidan Shah due to intense heat and prolonged dry weather, leaving residents desperate for even a drop of water. The situation is worsened by the unregulated extraction of groundwater by cement factories operating in the area.
Locals report that underground water levels have significantly dropped, pushing residents to wander from place to place in search of water for household use. The crisis has reached alarming levels, prompting citizens to urge the Punjab Chief Minister, Rawalpindi Commissioner, and local and district administrations to take immediate action.
According to a public survey, the main causes of the water shortage include the widespread cultivation of water-intensive potato crops and the excessive use of water by cement factories. The region relies heavily on rainfall for agriculture, but the installation of hundreds of tube wells for potato farming has further depleted underground reserves.
Residents have particularly blamed the cement factories, claiming that despite Supreme Court orders to seal tube wells within factory premises using concrete, there is suspicion that the factories have installed underground pipelines to secretly extract and store large quantities of groundwater. While factory ponds appear dry, water tanks inside remain full, raising concerns of foul play.
Meanwhile, household water boreholes are rapidly drying up, and Choa Saidan Shah's famed loquat orchards are withering due to lack of water.

Ayeza marks Father's Day with sweet couple selfie,"DK
Star paid homemade to Danish and her father on IG
If there is any celebrity couple who do not shy away from showing their love on social media, it is Ayeza Khan and Danish Taimoor – and this past Sunday, Ayeza seized upon the chance to shower her actor husband with affection on Instagram to mark Father's Day.
""Happy Father's Day, we're so lucky to have you always,"" began Ayeza on IG stories, right above an idyllic selfie of the happy couple. The backdrop? A cerulean sky dotted with cotton-white clouds,a verdant field and a cluster of trees up yonder. Danish's crisp white collar can be seen poking above a light blue sweater blending in with the sky.
Ayeza, radiating summer freshness in a bright yellow outfit with her raven locks tumbling down her shoulders, can be seen planting a kiss on her husband's cheek as he has his arm outstretched, gripping the phone to capture the moment on camera. To complete this vision, both husband and wife donned a pair of sleek sunglasses, showing that it is not just their hearts that are in sync, but also their choices of eyewear.
""Thank you for being an amazing dad!"" continued the Jaane Jahan star. ""We celebrate you every day, and we are already counting down to our next crazy vacation together!"" The remainder of Ayeza's short but sweet message was dotted with an array of emojis, including a football, goal post, roller coaster, skateboard, burger, pizza, and popcorn – in short, all the components that make up a family holiday with two young children in tow.
Despite a full time showbiz career that often takes her out of the country – Ayeza's latest shoot on Instagram, for example, showcases the model in Doha – the mother of two often shares moments on social media where she has made memories with her young family. If her latest Father's Day celebratory post is any indication, all the signs are pointing towards another fun-filled family holiday.
With the occasion being Father's Day, the model-turned-actor also made sure to acknowledge her love for her own father (as opposed to just the father of her children) by putting up a screenshot of an earlier post she had shared on February 6. In the photo, both father and daughter are seated at a table, clad in winter clothing, with Ayeza leaning in to her father for extra closeness.
""No matter how old I get, for him I am still his little 'ichi amma' don't ask its meaning cause we don't know it either!"" captioned Ayeza with a laughter emoji.
Having celebrated both important men in her life, Ayeza's short but sweet IG Father's Day pictures give a refreshing insight into the close bonds the star enjoys with her family.

Israel manufacturing war to escape accountability,"AT
This is not self-defense. This is empire in motion
In the early hours of June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented and illegal military assault deep into Iranian territory, striking nuclear facilities, government buildings and residential areas in what it dubbed ""Operation Rising Lion"". Far from a defensive maneuver, this was a calculated escalation designed to ignite a broader regional war, deflect global scrutiny from its ongoing genocide in Gaza and edge closer to the goal of Eretz Israel.
This is not self-defense. This is empire in motion.
According to reports, Israeli fighter jets targeted not only Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities at Natanz and Fordow but also civilian apartment blocks in Tehran, killing several senior military leaders and civilians. Among the dead were Major General Mohammad Bagheri, chief of staff of Iran's conventional military, and Hossein Salami, the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) - a deliberate attempt to decapitate Iran's military command structure.
As commentator Belén Fernández noted, ""Israel thrives on perpetual upheaval and mass killing, all the while portraying itself as the victim of the folks it is slaughtering."" The latest strike, she argues, represents Netanyahu's continued use of war as a political escape hatch - one that shields him from mounting corruption charges and domestic unrest, while solidifying Israel's regional dominance.
Just as troubling is the geopolitical context. This brazen attack came just days before planned negotiations between the US and Iran over reviving the nuclear deal, which Trump had once called a ""priority"". But as Juan Cole observed, ""Netanyahu launched the strikes to thwart the peace negotiations striking a day before the next talks were scheduled to take place.""
This isn't just warmongering - it's sabotage.
Netanyahu's strategy is disturbingly familiar. Following the classic authoritarian script, he manufactures external threats to justify violence, sow panic and change the narrative. Israel's genocidal campaign in Gaza has triggered worldwide condemnation and legal scrutiny. The ICJ is reviewing allegations of genocide. International NGOs have documented systematic targeting of civilians, journalists and aid workers. So what does Netanyahu do? Strike Iran. Shift the frame. Expand the war.
As the Atlantic Council noted, the key question now is whether Israel's true goal is merely to delay Iran's nuclear programme or to catalyse regime change. But as their analysis warns: ""What is likely to follow a theocratic Iranian government is not democracy but IRGC-istan a government much more hardline than the current one.""
The United States has tried to distance itself from the attack. President Trump denied prior knowledge and emphasised that no US forces were involved. Secretary of State Marco Rubio declared, ""We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.""
Yet such denials ring hollow. Just months ago, Trump boasted that the US was ""sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job"" in Gaza. The vast stockpile of American weapons and intelligence flowing to Israel makes the claim of non-involvement dubious at best.
Even as the White House disclaimed responsibility, Trump warned Iran to ""cut a deal before there is nothing left"". Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress rallied behind the assault, with Senator John Thune proclaiming, ""Iran must never gain access to a nuclear weapon Israel has determined that it must take decisive action to defend the Israeli people.""
But as Juan Cole points out, ""Iran is not assessed by U.S. intelligence to have a military nuclear weapons program, only a civilian uranium enrichment program."" In fact, until Trump tore up the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran was in full compliance with the terms - verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency. By contrast, Israel is not even a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and possesses an undeclared nuclear arsenal of several hundred warheads.
This isn't about preventing nuclear war. It's about maintaining unchallenged regional supremacy.
Iran has, meanwhile, responded. Before Iran's response, analysts at Bloomberg had outlined four possibilities: a narrow strike limited to Israel; a broad escalation targeting US assets; a nuclear breakout; or a coerced return to the negotiating table under humiliating terms. The worst-case scenario, already plausible, is a regional conflagration pulling in multiple actors from Iraq to Yemen.
And still, much of the world stays silent.
The double standards of international law have never been starker. Iran is vilified for enriching uranium under international supervision, while Israel bombs multiple countries with impunity. Gaza is starved, razed, and suffocated, but Western capitals remain mute. Palestinian children die under rubble, while Western media recycles Israeli talking points about ""security.""
Meanwhile, the global arms industry cheers. As Fernández notes, ""Key sectors of U.S. capitalism make a killing off Israel's regional savagery."" One wonders how many weapons contracts were signed as Tehran burned.
Israel's current path does not lead to peace or security - it leads to perpetual war, international instability and the erosion of global legal norms. The pursuit of Eretz Israel is not just destroying Palestinian life; it is destabilising the entire region and pushing the world toward another catastrophic conflict.
It is time to stop pretending that this is about defence.
The international community must act decisively: to rein in Israeli impunity, to prevent further escalation, and to apply international law equally to all states. Silence now is not neutrality. It is complicity.
Let us be clear: one can oppose Iran's authoritarianism and its proxy conflicts, while still recognising that Israel's current conduct is far more dangerous. It threatens not just Palestinians or Iranians, but the global order itself.

Viral footage exposes police brutality,"US
Cops assault youth outside his house, harass his family, CPO takes notice
A disturbing incident of alleged police brutality has surfaced in Rawalpindi's Bani area, where policemen from Waris Khan police station allegedly stormed a residential street near Saidpuri Gate and assaulted a young man who was sitting outside his home.
The police officials allegedly manhandled the youth, forcibly took him to the police station and threatened to implicate him in a fake narcotics case. Notably, the house where the youth was sitting does not even fall under the jurisdiction of the Waris Khan police station.
According to details, when residents reached the police station to inquire about the youth, the officials misbehaved even with senior citizens, tearing their collars and treating them with disrespect. However, when CCTV footage of the incident went viral on social media, the police released the youth and began pleading with the family to settle the matter quietly.
CPO Rawalpindi, Khalid Hamdani, took serious notice of the incident and appointed SP Rawal as the inquiry officer, demanding a detailed report.
The CCTV footage showed four young men seated on chairs at the ramp outside a house when suddenly, five or six motorcycles arrive carrying police personnel, both in uniform and plainclothes, armed with batons. A plainclothes official approaches the group, saying something to them, and begins throwing their chairs aside. Soon, more police officials, some uniformed, are seen physically assaulting and pushing the youths.
One young man is pushed backwards while another is beaten and forcibly taken onto a motorcycle. Despite being seated, the youth continues to face physical abuse by the officials. Two plainclothes policemen are then seen riding away with him, while other officials scatter in different directions.
As the situation escalated, the family of the victim, identified as Subhan Qureshi, reached Waris Khan police station, where police initially denied any such incident or the youth's presence at the station. When a large number of area residents gathered at the station and mentioned the existence of CCTV footage, the police panicked.
After confirmation of the footage, Subhan was released, and police officials began requesting a compromise. Raja Talha, a resident of the house where the raid occurred, submitted a written complaint to CPO Khalid Hamdani, stating that the officials, both uniformed and in civilian clothes were armed and used pistol butts, fists, kicks, and batons to physically assault Subhan. He added that the police continued to beat him after taking him to the station and threatened to book him in a drug case falsely.
When the elders went to inquire, the police initially denied being aware. Upon entry, the officers misbehaved, abused, and tore the collars of the elderly men. It was only after learning that CCTV footage was available that the police released the victim.
A policeman has been identified who claimed he was acting on the orders of SHO Waris Khan. The video footage is clear and allows identification of all involved personnel.
Raja Talha has appealed to the Chief Minister Punjab, IG Punjab, RPO, and DPO Rawalpindi to take strict legal action against the SHO and all involved officers to ensure justice is served.
CPO Khalid Hamdani, while taking notice of the incident, directed SP Rawal to conduct a thorough inquiry and submit a report. He said misuse of authority and abusive behaviour will not be tolerated under any circumstances. ""Rawalpindi Police are committed to accountability and merit-based practices, which will be ensured at all times,"" he stated.

UK apologises to thousands of grooming victims,"US
.
The UK government announced on Monday that it would bring in tough new laws to ""root out the scourge"" of grooming gangs, and apologised to thousands of victims believed to have been sexually exploited.
Any adults who engage in penetrative sex with a child under 16 will now face the most serious charge of rape, interior minister Yvette Cooper told parliament, as authorities launched a nationwide crackdown on the gangs.
The announcement came as a damning report, written by parliamentarian Louise Casey, was published into the decades-long scandal, which has affected towns and cities across Britain.
In it she wrote about how institutions failed the victims, and how the young girls and women were often blamed for their own abuse.
Seven men were convicted on Friday in the UK's latest grooming trial, after jurors heard that two girl victims were forced to have sex ""with multiple men on the same day, in filthy flats and on rancid mattresses"".
One of the victims said social workers had regarded her as ""a prostitute"" from the age of 10.
On Monday, three other men appeared at Sheffield Cown Court in a separate case and denied raping a teenage girl in Rotherham between 2008 and 2010.
Despite the age of consent being 16, Casey's report said there were ""too many examples"" of grooming cases being dropped or downgraded where a 13-15 year-old had been deemed to be ""in love with"" or ""had consented to"" sex with the perpetrator.

Heat drives surge in demand for net curtains,"DE
Vendors say they offer relief from heat and protection against insects
Amid the ongoing intense summer heat, the demand and prices of colourful net curtains have soared in markets across the city. Residents and shopkeepers are increasingly buying these curtains to cover doors, windows, balconies, courtyards, and lawns, seeking relief from the heat and protection from insects, despite a noticeable hike in prices.
Street vendors have also started selling these net curtains. The curtains are available in various colours, including white, blue, red, green, orange, and black. The most basic variety is being sold at Rs450 per meter, while slightly better quality costs Rs650. Good quality curtains are priced at Rs850 per meter, and the highest-quality colourful net curtains are available for Rs1,050 per meter.
Stitching charges, depending on the size of windows or doors, are around Rs350. Apart from residential use, many people who keep livestock or pets have begun installing these curtains in animal enclosures to prevent mosquitoes and insects from entering.
A large number of people are installing these beautiful net curtains on their balconies. They are also being used to cover water tanks on rooftops to prevent colour fading. These curtains are also in high demand in government and private hospitals, clinics, and dengue wards to prevent mosquito breeding. With the summer heat peaking in May, June, and July, demand for these curtains is expected to remain high. Large shops also have a high demand for the installation of these curtains.
A resident, Agha Qizilbash, noted that the prices of net curtains have increased by 30 to 35 per cent compared to last year. However, their installation can significantly reduce the intensity of direct sunlight and provide shade, which is beneficial for livestock and birds.
Shahbaz Ali, a street vendor, shared that last year the prices ranged from Rs300 to Rs800 per meter, depending on quality.
This year, prices have risen significantly, now starting at Rs450 and going up to Rs1,050 per meter. He attributed the surge to the prolonged heatwave, rising temperatures, and the burden of increased taxes and duties on imported materials. Ali starts selling curtains from the end of May, and it's currently at their peak. After June, the sales of net curtains typically decline.

Punjab earmarks Rs130b for agriculture amid scepticism,"US
Farmers argue financial packages cannot help without reforms that could ensure fair crop prices
The Punjab government on Monday unveiled a significant 10.7% increase in its agriculture sector budget for the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26, allocating Rs129.8 billion compared to Rs117.2 billion in FY25.
However, the announcement was immediately met with scepticism from farmers' representatives, who argued that financial packages could not help without fundamental reforms to ensure fair crop prices. Provincial Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman, during his budget speech, stated that the total development outlay for agriculture, livestock and dairy development, irrigation and water in FY26 would be Rs123 billion, with an additional Rs56.2 billion being earmarked as non-development funds.
This conflicts with the combined Rs129.8 billion agriculture sector outlay presented in budget documents. These papers reveal that the total Annual Development Programme for the agriculture sector will be Rs80 billion. This comprises 37 schemes, where 16 ongoing projects will receive Rs32.4 billion and 21 new schemes will get Rs47.6 billion.
Key initiatives include the Chief Minister's Punjab Hi-Power Tractor Programme, for which Rs10 billion has been allocated, the CM's Green Tractor Programme Phase-II (Rs5.5 billion) and the CM's Programme for Water Efficient Agriculture (Rs2 billion). Other notable projects are agricultural farm mechanisation (Rs0.7 billion), Fasal Bema (Rs1.5 billion), transformation of agriculture in Potohar (Rs1 billion), Green Pakistan (Rs20 billion), solarisation of tube wells (Rs8.7 billion) and Kissan Card (Rs6.3 billion). An agricultural subsidy of Rs10 billion has also been set aside.
Livestock and dairy development has secured a funding of Rs5 billion, which will support 16 schemes. Of these, nine ongoing schemes will get Rs2.8 billion and seven new projects will receive Rs2.2 billion. The allocation for the CM Punjab Livestock Card scheme is Rs1 billion. Irrigation has received a hefty Rs38 billion that will go to 120 schemes – 65 ongoing projects with Rs24.8 billion and 55 new schemes having Rs13.2 billion. The water sector allocation is Rs6 billion, supporting 47 ongoing schemes (Rs4.95 billion) and a new scheme (Rs1.05 billion).
Expressing deep dissatisfaction, Pakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Khokhar said, ""We do not need any package from the federal or provincial government; we need prices for our produce."" He said that the cost of production was higher than market prices for major crops such as wheat and corn. ""Farmers are frustrated due to the absence of support prices as their livelihoods are at stake.""
Khokhar added that fertiliser sales had shrunk 30% along with tractor demand, which dropped 50% from 18,000 to 9,000 units in the first five months of calendar year 2025. The drop comes despite distribution of around 1,000 tractors by the government, he mentioned.
Drawing comparison, he pointed out that farmers in India were in a better position, ""who know the price for their next crop before the sowing season"". ""That is called futures trading; we need to put our house in order.""

"Blast in Barkhan's Rakhni area kills one, injures ten","US
Emergency responders and law enforcement agencies swiftly reached the scene
A powerful explosion ripped through the Rakhni area of Balochistan's Barkhan district on Monday, killing one person and injuring at least ten others in what authorities suspect was a targeted act of terrorism. The blast occurred in a crowded section of the local marketplace, sparking panic among vendors and shoppers.
According to officials, the deceased has been identified as a resident of Sakhi Sarwar, Punjab. The explosion caused extensive damage to nearby shops and vehicles, sending debris flying and forcing frightened onlookers to flee for cover.
Emergency responders and law enforcement agencies swiftly reached the scene, cordoning off the area and launching rescue operations. The injured were rushed to nearby hospitals, where medical staff described the condition of several victims as critical. Health authorities have placed medical facilities in the region on high alert.
Security forces have initiated a detailed investigation into the incident. Bomb disposal experts and counterterrorism units are analyzing the blast site to determine the type of explosive used and whether specific individuals or infrastructure were targeted.
While no group has claimed responsibility so far, initial intelligence reports suggest the attack may have been orchestrated by militant elements seeking to destabilize the region. The incident marks yet another grim reminder of the fragile security situation in parts of Balochistan.
Political leaders and civil society representatives have condemned the attack, urging the government to bolster counterterrorism efforts and enhance the protection of civilians in vulnerable districts. As investigations continue, security has been tightened across the district, with additional patrols and checkpoints established to deter further violence.
