Why this must be a transition budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318008-why-this-must-be-a-transition-budget,"THE finance minister recently announced that the next budget would be a ‘strategic’ budget rather than making the math work.
The annual budget is not only an instrument of fiscal policy (taxation, levies and expenditure choices ) but also directly or indirectly affects monetary policy, trade and exchange rate policy, private investment, poverty reduction, human capital formation, etc.
This article helps lay out the contours of a transition budget that consolidates the recently achieved macroeconomic stability and paves the way towards a trajectory of long-term, inclusive and sustainable growth. The last few weeks have been marked by a positive change as the country became united because of the actions of an aggressive neighbour, minimising political fragmentation. This political stability is the much-awaited and desired precondition under which tough, unpopular but inevitable economic reforms can be implemented -- and this opportunity should be fully availed.
In addition, the outcome of the FY25 budget in terms of positive primary fiscal balance, despite the FBR revenue shortfall and the possibility of the external current account ending up slightly surplus, provides a solid base for the next year. Implementing some of the structural benchmarks agreed upon with the IMF, such as the National Fiscal Pact and including provincial finances in the revenue mobilisation strategy for the first time, is the beginning of widening the tax base in the medium to long term.
The main challenge, in the coming year, however, is to strike a balance between the increased allocation for defence and climate change initiatives while preserving social protection, education and health spending.
Given the aforementioned positive factors and challenges, the first step should be to lay out a medium-term policy roadmap in parliament while presenting the budget for the direction in which the economy would be steered in the next two years and the post-2028 period.
During the next two years, we are obligated to comply with the conditionalities agreed with the IMF under the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, and the room for manoeuvrability for policymakers will remain limited, but the degree of freedom would be enhanced after 2028. Such a roadmap is essential to minimise uncertainty and assure potential investors about the future environment in which to invest. We would not repeat here the ongoing reforms of digitalising and documenting the economy and rightsizing the government as well as reforms in the energy sector, import Tariffs, SOEs, regulatory overlay, FBR, etc, that have to be part of the roadmap.
However, we touch upon three additional ingredients which require priority attention. First, the emphasis under the IMF programme has been rightly placed on financial variables -- fiscal, monetary, exchange rate and current account.
The primary factor driving frequent balance-of-payments crises is the underlying deficit in the productive sectors of the real economy -- agriculture and industry. This deficit reflects a mismatch between the aggregate demand generated by economic growth and the total domestic production, leading to a spillover into import demand. Since reducing this deficit will take time, it is essential to address it now.
In agriculture, which has strong forward and backward linkages with industry, retail and wholesale trade, transportation and exports, the decline in the output of major crops, particularly wheat and cotton, must be reversed. At the same time, the country needs to substitute imports of oilseeds, pulses, milk, and other such items, which currently account for an outflow of $7 billion to $8 billion annually. This can be achieved through a targeted package aimed at boosting the productivity of small and medium farmers. These farmers have been unable to increase their output largely because the volume of agricultural credit for necessary inputs has not kept pace with growing demand.
The government was preempting the banking assets to meet its budgetary deficits. As these deficits are reduced over time, the banks must be incentivised to deploy digital tools and innovative methods to reach out to this underserved segment. The threat of the Indus Waters Treaty forces us towards the efficient and equitable use of irrigation water. Contract farming between the farmers and processors has created a silent revolution in maize, potato, milk, fruits, etc -- and needs to be encouraged in other crops and meat, poultry, etc.
Industrial policy, which has been under preparation for quite some time, should be announced with an emphasis on export orientation, medium and high technology-intensive internationally competitive products, attracting FDI flows, joint ventures, particularly relocation of Chinese enterprises, and creating employment opportunities for the youth. Skill formation, technical and vocational training, apprenticeship programmes, industry-academia partnership should be an integral part of the policy.
Restructuring SMEDA and improving SME financing, ensuring the full utilisation of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Export Processing Zones (EPZs) and developing intermediate goods industries, such as steel, petrochemicals, and refineries, that support downstream industries should all be key components of a comprehensive industrial policy.
Second, allocations for Research and Development (R&D) in public sector universities and research institutes, particularly in agriculture and industry, have been dismally low, despite these institutions having significant untapped capacity. With appropriate incentives and improved governance structures, these institutions could play a critical role in addressing our productivity and competitiveness challenges. It is worth remembering that the significant increases in cotton, wheat and rice production up to the 1990s were largely the result of focused efforts by these very institutions.
R&D funding should primarily be channelled through competitive research grants, and researchers should be allowed to commercialise their patents and inventions. In addition, private sector firms engaged in research in pharmaceuticals, engineering goods, electronics and other technology-intensive products and services should be offered tax credits to incentivise innovation.
Third, the real purchasing power of the middle class has eroded during the last three years due to high inflation, stagnant incomes and wages, exorbitant taxation, depreciating currency and soaring utility bills. They can no longer afford good schooling for their children within their disposable incomes. The result is the exodus of highly skilled professionals depleting the ranks of academic and research institutions, as well as private-sector firms including multinationals at a time when we want to bring in additional qualified expatriate Pakistanis to benefit from their expertise to give a boost to the competitiveness of our industry.
Some estimates suggest that the middle-income group pays nearly three times more in taxes than the business sector. In the upcoming budget, income tax on the salaried class should be reduced. At the same time, the government should announce a five-year roadmap to gradually lower the General Sales Tax (GST) from 18 per cent to 12 per cent and reduce the corporate income tax rate to 25 per cent. Utility pricing should be rationalised, and the government should transition toward targeted subsidies to better support vulnerable populations.
Banks must also be encouraged to expand consumer financing for mortgages, automobiles and durable goods, as the credit risk associated with middle-income borrowers is relatively low.

Shehbaz explains why India would be loath to initiate another attack,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318009-shehbaz-explains-why-india-would-be-loath-to-initiate-another-attack,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has outlined three reasons why he believes India will not initiate another attack against Pakistan.
The prime minister was speaking at an exclusive high tea hosted by Pakistan’s senior leadership on Monday for prominent media representatives at the Prime Minister House. The event was attended by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Political Affairs Minister Rana Sanaullah, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Culture Huzaifa Rehman.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif highlighted Pakistan’s recent victory in the military conflict with India, describing it as a moment of complete vindication that has fundamentally settled the regional balance of power. He also emphasised how this decisive outcome has not only avenged past grievances dating back to 1971 but also left India’s leadership in a state of serious embarrassment and humiliation. “Modi is now known as an established troublemaker”, he said.
The PM also especially mentioned China’s role in the recent military conflict, saying, “I can say with complete confidence that China is Pakistan’s most trusted ally outside of the Muslim world. Its support is vital for Pakistan’s security as well as maintaining a balance of power in the region.”
Moving to why he believes India will not initiate another attack, the prime minister said that the first pillar rests on international support and transparency. PM Shehbaz believes Pakistan’s commitment to the international investigation of the Pahalgam attack has garnered global backing. “We have consistently offered even to the Americans to participate in an international investigation to probe India’s allegations”, he said, adding that this transparent approach had won international confidence.
The second factor is what the Pakistani leadership calls ‘the Trump factor’, expressing particular optimism about US President Trump’s role as a peace facilitator in the recent conflict. “Trump has proudly claimed credit for playing a decisive role in achieving the ceasefire, and this he sees as a big victory for himself”, the PM said. “While there is not much progress on Ukraine and Gaza, the Pakistan-India crisis was much easier to de-escalate through diplomacy. President Trump grabbed this opportunity to be known as a peacemaker, and we’re confident he won’t let this great achievement [go to waste]. Trump is fundamentally a man of peace, not war.”
The third pillar involves economic realities, with Pakistani officials pointing to India’s economic vulnerabilities, noting that: “Given the economic progress India claims to have made, war would be a complete disaster for them. The destruction would be India’s to bear; we’re already in a struggling phase, so we’re prepared for any scenario.”
The Pakistani leadership expressed readiness for talks at neutral venues on four critical areas: Kashmir resolution, discussion on the Indus Waters Treaty, trade normalisation and counterterrorism cooperation.
“If Modi stops his warmongering, we’re prepared for serious counterterrorism discussions”, PM Shehbaz stated. He also speculated about Modi’s mental health. The country’s leadership proudly highlighted recent domestic achievements, particularly emphasising their spotless governance record. “In our one year and three months in government, there hasn’t been a single case or even allegation of corruption”, PM Shehbaz declared.
He said the International Monetary Fund’s satisfaction with Pakistan’s progress serves as external validation of these domestic successes, with the IMF expressing willingness to fund Pakistan’s revenue enhancement enforcement efforts.
The Pakistani leadership also spoke enthusiastically about their recent diplomatic successes, particularly highlighting the warm reception received during recent visits to Turkey, Iran and Azerbaijan.
In a move reflecting political maturity and long-term thinking, the leadership revealed their proactive outreach to opposition parties. “This is a time when public sentiments are aligned, allowing us to initiate long-term plans supporting our broader economic agenda”, the PM explained.
The briefing concluded with the Pakistani leadership expressing their commitment to advancing national interests through improved trade relations with the US, recognising the strategic importance of tariff discussions in strengthening Pakistan’s economic position.The overall tone of the interaction reflected the leadership’s confidence in Pakistan’s strategic position and tangible achievements in governance and diplomacy.

PTI counsel grills PM in hearing of defamation plea against Imran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318010-pti-counsel-grills-pm-in-hearing-of-defamation-plea-against-imran,"LAHORE: A Lahore sessions court on Saturday adjourned the hearing of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s Rs10 billion defamation lawsuit against PTI founder Imran Khan until June 21. The proceedings were presided over by Additional Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani. PM Shehbaz appeared before the court via video link and was cross-examined by Imran Khan’s legal counsel.
In his testimony, the prime minister confirmed that he was accompanied by his lawyer, Mustafa Ramday, and was testifying from a closed room. He stated that his affidavit comprised seven pages and denied any procedural irregularities in its submission.
When asked by the PTI lawyer whether the oath commissioner had attested the affidavit, Shehbaz responded that the claim about missing stamps was incorrect. He rejected allegations that the affidavit was not compliant with legal or Lahore High Court procedural standards.
The prime minister’s lawyer objected to what he termed irrelevant questions by the PTI legal team, led by Mian Muhammad Hussain. During the hearing, Shehbaz denied filing the defamation suit in retaliation after the Panama Papers verdict and also rejected claims that he failed to send or attach any legal notices to the PTI founder as part of the affidavit.
The high-profile defamation case stems from Imran Khan’s public allegations against Shehbaz Sharif, which the latter claims damaged his reputation and demanded Rs10 billion in damages.

Massive hunt launched as up to 50 inmates on the run after Malir jailbreak,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318011-massive-hunt-launched-as-up-to-50-inmates-on-the-run-after-malir-jailbreak,"KARACHI:  Law enforcers launched a massive hunt after upto 50 prisoners escaped from the Malir district jail late on Monday night.Police officials said the jailbreak occurred when multiple earthquakes caused cracks in barrack walls of the overcrowded prison, which reportedly has between 3,500 and 4,000 inmates. Talking to Geo News, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan said from 45 to 50 prisoners managed to escape from the Malir jail during scuffles with police inside the jail. He said that from 30 to 35 prisoners had already been rearrested.
Lanjar said none of the escaped prisoners was a hardcore criminal. He said most of these prisoners were involved in petty crimes.He directed that re-arrest of the escaped prisoners should be carried out by taking highly coordinated and effective measures at the district level.  He further said the task should be completed by taking all measures, including blockade, reconnaissance, surveillance and intelligence.
The home minister described the jailbreak a very serious incident.Earlier, taking to media persons, DIG Prisons Muhammad Hassan Sahito confirmed some inmates had escaped after bringing down barrack walls and the Mari Gate of the Malir jail. He said prisoners also tortured and injured some policemen.
Police sources some inmates snatched weapons from policemen before fleeing. Paramilitary Rangers also arrived at the prison to assist the police in bringing the situation under control.
Malir SSP Arshad Hussain said a shootout took place between cops and prisoners, leaving one inmate injured. Personnel from different police stations also joined the search operation.Police said that over 20 inmates were arrested again during a search operation in nearby areas, including Cattle Colony and Shah Latif Town.
The Sindh minister for prisons, Ali Hassan Zardari, took notice of the incident and sought reports from the prisons IG and DIG.He directed that the area should be cordoned off, and if any prisoner has escaped, he should be caught at all costs. He said officers who were negligent in the incident would be identified.

Modi ‘unlikely’ to attend upcoming G7 summit in Canada,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318012-modi-unlikely-to-attend-upcoming-g7-summit-in-canada,"KARACHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is not expected to attend the upcoming G7 Summit in Canada, according to Indian media reports citing official sources. The decision comes amid ongoing diplomatic tensions between New Delhi and Ottawa.
Sources familiar with the matter said that neither side has initiated discussions regarding Modi’s participation, and that the bilateral relationship would need significant improvement before a visit of this stature could take place. Notably, Canada has sent invitations to a few countries. India is not one of them.Security concerns would also need to be addressed if a visit were to be considered, add sources.
This marks the first time in six years that Modi will likely skip the G7 Summit, which is scheduled to be held from June 15 to 17 in Kananaskis, Alberta.India-Canada relations have remained frosty since the 2022 killing of Khalistani separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in British Columbia. Tensions escalated last year when Canada expelled six Indian diplomats, including its head of mission, alleging their involvement in a plot targeting Sikh separatists.
While uncertainty surrounds India’s participation, other invitees — including South Africa, Ukraine and Australia — have reportedly confirmed their attendance. The summit will bring together leaders from the G7 nations — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US — along with the president of the European Commission and several guest countries.

"PTI, PPP allege rigging in PP-52 by-poll",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318013-pti-ppp-allege-rigging-in-pp-52-by-poll,"ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), speaking in the Parliament House and addressing press conferences separately in Islamabad and Lahore on Monday, alleged ‘massive’ rigging in PP-52 Sambrial by-elections, demanded re-election and vowed to move courts of law against electoral laws violations.
Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly (NA) Omar Ayub Khan, while talking to the media at  the Parliament House Islamabad, denounced what he called the shameful events in Sambrial by-poll, highlighting incidents where ballot boxes were stolen in broad daylight, presiding officers fled, and police were caught stamping ballots.
He claimed that polling agents were denied access, whereas the returning officer (RO) offices were sealed with containers.
Speaking on the occasion, Asad Qaiser strongly criticised the way the by-election was conducted in Sambrial and hailed PTI’s ‘overwhelming victory’ as proof of the party’s unshaken public support. He also emphasised that despite full federal and provincial backing, the PMLN failed to win the seat, clearly reflecting their waning popularity.
He pointed out that if the PMLN had truly been in a winning position, then there would have been no need for the senior poll staffers to flee with ballot boxes. Asad Qaiser also expressed grave concern over what he called the political victimisation, including baseless charges against MNA Abdul Latif Chitrali, and questioned the legitimacy of a National Assembly where the opposition leader is under attack.
He said that the Speaker’s office should remain neutral and above pressure. Highlighting PTI’s commitment to democratic values, he vowed to take the movement for constitutional supremacy to the people.
Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja Monday rejected the results of the PP-52 Sambrial by-election, announcing that the party would pursue legal action over what he termed “massive rigging”.
Addressing a press conference alongside Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bachar, Raja said in Lahore the by-poll outcome amounted to a “robbery of the people’s mandate”.
He questioned whether the nation was being treated as a mere “herd” or a community of human beings with democratic rights, calling the alleged manipulation of the vote a national tragedy.
“The people’s mandate has been hijacked,” he said, vowing that PTI would move the courts to seek justice. Malik Ahmad Bachar echoed the concerns, describing the polling day as one marred by repression. He alleged that state machinery, including the police, was used to suppress opposition supporters.
He also raised eyebrows over the victory margin of the PMLN candidate, pointing out that she received 17,000 more votes than her father did in the last general election. “Form 45s were not provided to polling agents of rival parties,” he claimed, adding that the transparency of the electoral process had been completely compromised.
Also, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leadership strongly rejected the results of the PP-52 Sambrial by-election, alleging large-scale rigging and demanding a re-election in the constituency.
Speaking at a joint press conference at the People’s Secretariat in Model Town Lahore, senior PPP leaders, including Central Information Secretary Nadeem Afzal Chan and Punjab General Secretary Syed Hassan Murtaza, claimed the polls were neither transparent nor fair. They accused the civil administration and criminal elements of widespread interference, with polling stations being overrun and ballot boxes allegedly stolen.
“It would be better for the Election Commission to directly issue allotment letters instead of holding such fraudulent elections,” said the PPP leadership. Nadeem Chan said the PPP’s alliance with the PMLN had cost the party its support base, admitting, “People didn’t vote for us not because they supported the PMLN, but because we are seen as allies.” He described the by-election as a “fraud” and criticised the Election Commission and media for serving elite interests.
PPP’s PP-52 candidate Raheel Kamran Cheema demanded formation of an independent commission to probe the alleged rigging. He claimed that out of 185 polling stations, Form 45s were received from only 39. He also alleged that police halted polling in several areas, including Malkanwali and Mitranwali, and that local factory workers were barred from voting.
Hassan Murtaza further lambasted the government’s performance, accusing it of harming public services through privatisation and layoffs. “Despite outsourcing hospitals and privatising schools, their vote bank is still rising due to administrative manipulation,” he said.
The PPP leadership stated that it would prepare for the next election with renewed strategy and reaffirmed its commitment to democratic principles and constitutional supremacy.

Pakistan drafts crypto regulation framework in push to formalise digital finance,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318014-pakistan-drafts-crypto-regulation-framework-in-push-to-formalise-digital-finance,"KARACHI: Pakistan has begun drafting a regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets, as the government signals its intent to bring the crypto ecosystem under formal oversight.
The initiative was taken during a high-level meeting of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Islamabad on Monday.
The meeting , attended virtually by Minister of State and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib, who also serves as CEO of the PCC, is part of broader efforts to align Pakistan’s digital finance sector with international standards while fostering innovation in blockchain technologies.
Also attending virtually was the governor of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), while the chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) and secretaries from the Law and IT ministries joined in person.
The meeting focused on a draft regulatory framework for digital and virtual assets. Participants discussed aligning domestic regulations with global practices and emerging technology trends, including the possibility of establishing an independent regulatory authority to oversee crypto-related activity and ensure financial integrity.
The council underscored the need for a balanced regulatory approach -- one that protects investors, promotes transparency and supports innovation without compromising financial stability. To this end, a technical committee comprising representatives from the SBP, SECP, Law Division, and IT & Telecom Division will review the draft legislation and propose a governance structure for discussion at the PCC’s next meeting.
Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to modernising the financial sector, saying any future-ready regulatory framework must promote inclusion, transparency, and economic resilience.
The meeting followed a major announcement last week, when Saqib unveiled Pakistan’s first-ever government-led strategic Bitcoin reserve during the Bitcoin Vegas 2025 conference in the United States.
On Friday, the SBP issued a clarification saying that cryptocurrencies were not banned outright, but remain outside the existing legal framework. The central bank noted that it had advised regulated entities -- including banks, DFIs, microfinance banks, electronic money institutions, and payment service providers -- to avoid engaging with virtual assets (VAs) due to the absence of legal and regulatory protections, not because such assets are illegal.
This clarification came after the government told the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance that cryptocurrencies remain banned and illegal in Pakistan. The government also added that individuals involved in cryptocurrency transactions could be investigated by the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The path to virtual asset regulation in Pakistan remains uncertain. In a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication, members raised concerns about the legitimacy of the PCC and the lack of parliamentary consultation in its formation. Some questioned whether it could be established solely through an executive order.
The Ministry of IT also clarified during the meeting that its involvement had been limited to providing input on the council’s terms of reference. However, several committee members argued that the Crypto Council should fall under the Ministry of IT rather than the Finance Division.

"CEC hints at calling PM, CM over delay in LG polls",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318015-cec-hints-at-calling-pm-cm-over-delay-in-lg-polls,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja Monday hinted at calling prime minister (PM) and chief minister (CM) if local government (LG) elections are not held in Islamabad and Punjab.
He made this observation during hearing of the case related to the delay in the conduct of local government elections in the federal capital and Punjab, the population-wise largest province. The full five-member bench of the electoral body, headed by the CEC, heard the matter.
Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Secretary Omar Hamid Khan briefed the forum about the delay in holding electoral processes and contended that the Punjab government and the federal government were not interested in holding LG polls.
He pointed out that Punjab delayed the elections for three years, as the term of local governments in Punjab ended on December 31, 2021. Moreover, he added, since 2019, local government laws had been changed five times in Punjab, and the law was being changed for the sixth time in the province.
The bench was informed that the ECP held a hearing on the Punjab local governments in February. The CEC stated that he himself had appeared in the Supreme Court in the LG polls case. “It is not possible that the provincial government does not make legislation and there is no election for five years,” the CEC made it clear.
Appearing on behalf of the provincial government, Punjab local government minister informed the bench that the provincial government was trying to complete the legislation soon. The local government bill had been in the assembly for more than three months. The minister noted that usually it takes two months for the bill to be approved, but right now the proposed legislation in Punjab was under consideration in the standing committee concerned. He offered to share the draft of the LG rules with the ECP. In response, the CEC retorted that barring Punjab, all three provinces have conducted elections.
The CEC contended that if the ECP issued an order regarding local government elections, then it would be ‘embarrassing’ for them and declared to pass an appropriate order. “We shall not ask you about time rather the Election Commission will spell out time,” he remarked.
He stressed that the process should be completed as soon as possible and insisted the commission could not sit with its eyes closed. At one point, one ECP member wondered, “whom should we call who will give us a commitment that the election will be held”.
The ECP could call the PM as well as the Punjab CM in case the LG elections are not held in Islamabad and Punjab.  Later, the hearing was adjourned.

National fiscal pact: Provinces bound to get cabinets’ nod to collect GST on services,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318016-national-fiscal-pact-provinces-bound-to-get-cabinets-nod-to-collect-gst-on-services,"ISLAMABAD: To implement the National Fiscal Pact (NFP) under the IMF program, all four provinces are bound to get approval from their cabinets and provincial assemblies to collect General Sales Tax (GST) on all kinds of services and notify a negative list from July 1, 2025.
At the moment, the GST on services is collected by the provinces on the basis of a positive list. It will be replaced from the next budget, and GST on services will ensure transition from positive to negative list with effect from July 1, 2025.
The FBR will have to implement GST on services under the jurisdiction in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). The GST on goods is the domain of the Center, and on services is the domain of the provinces under the 1973 Constitutional arrangement.
Only those services will come out of the GST ambit which will be notified in the negative list from the next budget 2025-26, and all four provinces will have to formulate this negative list almost similar manner, except few services where the provincial government or legislatures prefer to differ from one province to another.
Top official sources confirmed to The News on Monday that all four provinces will have to implement six key conditions under the IMF program. First of all, the provinces will have to devise a mechanism for starting the collection of Agriculture Income Tax (AIT). The provinces had already amended the AIT regimes to fully align through necessary legislative changes with the Federal Personal Income Tax and Corporate Income tax regimes with the AIT.
“The provinces to ensure transition the services GST from a positive list to a negative list approach to combat tax evasion, to take effect from the start of FY 2025-26,” the National Fiscal Pact signed by the all provinces reads out.
One top official said that the provinces were ready to implement this fiscal pact. There are chances that except few dozen services, the GST on all services will be imposed from the next fiscal year.
Aim to collectively raise revenues from corporate tax in agriculture and GST on services combined with provincial tax effort in expanding additional areas of revenue collection. The provinces will have to develop, implement and collect revenue under a common approach to property taxation.

Rs288bn plan being rolled out for SOEs’ growth without federal funding,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318017-rs288bn-plan-being-rolled-out-for-soes-growth-without-federal-funding,"ISLAMABAD: The government will roll out Rs288 billion ($1.02 billion) investment plan for selected state-owned enterprises (SOEs), aiming to accelerate infrastructure upgrades and economic productivity without leaning on federal budget allocations.
The government’s new strategy empowers top-performing SOEs to finance their own development projects outside the traditional Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), focusing on critical sectors such as energy, telecoms, water, and defence production.
Officials say the move signals a shift towards performance-based public investment and fiscal self-reliance. Leading the charge is the Petroleum Division, with Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL), Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGC), Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC), and Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd (PARCO) collectively investing Rs109 billion.
The Power Division, including NTDC and PEPCO, will follow with Rs77 billion, while IT and telecom entities such as PTA, NTC, and the Universal Service Fund (USF) are set to spend Rs34.4 billion.
Wapda, under the Water Resources Division, is mobilising Rs26 billion in a bid to boost water security and climate resilience, while the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) will deploy Rs1.8 billion.
Earlier, the planning ministry asked all divisions to compile non-PSDP development interventions being executed by SOEs and related bodies, forming the basis of a new investment map aimed at bolstering transparency, public-private partnerships, and sectoral efficiency.
While economists have praised the initiative’s scale, they warn that channeling large sums through underperforming entities without meaningful reform may limit its impact. “Unless governance in loss-making SOEs improves, the capital infusion could fall short of intended outcomes,” an official said.
Notably, SOEs have reported total losses of Rs851 billion and outstanding loans of Rs9.2 trillion in FY2023-24—nearly matching the Federal Board of Revenue’s annual tax collection, according to the Ministry of Finance’s annual report.
After adjusting for profits from entities under the Pakistan Sovereign Wealth Fund, net losses stood at Rs521.5 billion, with limited free cash flow. Power sector firms remained the biggest drain, while the National Highway Authority alone posted a loss of Rs295.5 billion. Despite a 5.26 per cent rise in total revenues to Rs13.5 trillion, net losses surged 89 per cent, underscoring severe financial and credit risks.
OGDCL stood on top of the profit-making firms with Rs208bn, followed by Pakistan Petroleum Ltd at Rs115.4bn and National Power Parks at Rs76.8bn. Government Holding Pvt Ltd (GHPL) profit amounted to Rs69.1bn, Pak Arab Refinery Company at Rs55bn, Port Qasim Authority at Rs41bn, Mepco at Rs31.8bn, NBP at Rs27.4bn and Wapda at Rs22.2bn. KPT’s profit was reported at Rs20.3bn, PNSC at Rs20.1bn, PSO at Rs19.6bn and State Life Insurance Corp at Rs18.3bn, the report said.

Senate panel questions legal standing of Pakistan Crypto Council,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318018-senate-panel-questions-legal-standing-of-pakistan-crypto-council,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunications questioned the legal standing of the Pakistan Crypto Council and reiterated that the legislature have not been taken into confidence prior to the establishment of the Council, and decided to seek briefing by the finance ministry in the next meeting for comprehensive briefing.
The meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunications was held with Senator Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan in the chair at Old PIPS Hall Parliament Lodges to review the scope and mandate of Pakistan Crypto Council recently launched by the federal government.
Senator Mohammad Humayun Mohmand inquired as to whether or not the Council could be created by the Executive orders. Senator Kamran Murtaza inquired about a law to regulate the Crypto Council as if there is a major fraud or deception, who will be responsible. “If a crypto-related issue arises in the country, what will be its legal status,” he inquired.
The Committee further inquired about the role of IT Ministry in Crypto Council.  Senator Afnanullah said that the Crypto Council should have been under the Ministry of IT and Telecom. Secretary IT, Zarrar Hasham Khan, stated that the Ministry has a role of providing input with regard to TORs.
The Committee was of view that the Crypto Council should be under the preview of Ministry of IT, rather than the finance ministry.  After due deliberations, the committee deferred the matter and decided to seek comprehensive briefing from the Finance Ministry in the next meeting.
Discussing the issue of renewal of LDI/FLL licenses, Secretary IT informed that the consultation with the stakeholders has been completed as per the directions of Sindh High Court, and the final decision will be announced in two to three weeks.
Furthermore, the Committee was briefed on the role of IT Ministry in Pakistan Digital Authority.  Secretary IT apprised that the Pakistan Digital Authority has been tasked to implement digital transformation initiatives focused on making the economy and governance digital, and will eventually play a major role in creating citizens centered ‘Digital Society’.
However, the IT Ministry is mainly responsible for policy formulation, legislation, governance in IT and telecommunications sector, he added.  Moreover, the Committee raised concerns on ‘Digital Nation Commission’ which will be headed by prime minister and includes chief ministers of all provinces.
Senator Kamran Murtaza opined that the Digital Nation Commission aimed to dilute the provincial autonomy as it lacks consensus mechanism.
The Committee deferred the matter and decided to take federal minister’s input on the matter. While discussing the purported claim of launching first GPT (Zahanat AI) by the IT minister and subsequent denial by CEO, NITB, officials stated that Zahanat AI is the first initiative of such kind initiated by the private sector and the federal minister attended the event to encourage private sector.
However, the minister has not made such remarks and her statement has been misconstrued, officials claimed. Additionally, the Committee was briefed on Digital Foreign Direct Investment Forum (DFDI) which was held on 29 & 30th April at Jinnah Convention.
The Officials stated that the event was spearheaded by the Ministry of IT and Telecommunications in partnership with the Digital Cooperation Organization and was a great success as 40 countries participated in the event and a commitment of around 700 million USD was made during the event by the several companies.  The officials further informed the breakup of IT companies registered with PASHA and PSEB.
Officials informed that a total of 20,000 plus IT companies are registered with the Pakistan Software Export Board indicating a 19pc increase than the previous year.
Officials further stated that the IT sector generated an export remittance of $3.22 billion during the 2023-24, reflecting an increase of 24.15 pc compared to FY 2022-23.  In attendance were senators Pervaiz Rashid, Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee, Dr. Afnanullah Khan, Gurdeep Singh, Kamran Murtaza, Dr. Mohammad Humayun Mohmand, Nadeem Ahmed Bhutto, secretary Information Technology and Telecommunications Zarrar Hasham Khan, Chairman PTA Major General (R) Hafeez Ur Rehman and senior officials of relevant departments.

"Refineries, OMCs to face penalties for breaching PRM decisions",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318019-refineries-omcs-to-face-penalties-for-breaching-prm-decisions,"ISLAMABAD: In a bid to maintain the fuel supply chain intact and ensure energy security, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has carved out a new mechanism under which any party -- whether refineries or Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) -- involved in disputes over the import of POL products, less uplifting of local petroleum products, or short local production in violation of decisions made in the monthly Product Review Meeting (PRM) will face penalties and suspension of their licenses.
At last, the regulator issued a strict warning to refineries and OMCs stating that if they failed to accomplish commitments of producing POL products and lifting local products as per the PRM they would not only be punished through a monetary penalty but their licenses would also be suspended.
This warning has been conveyed by Ogra on May 30 to the Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) of refineries and over three dozen OMCs, calling for strict compliance with commitments made to the oil sector regulator.
According to Ogra, the issue of non-compliance by OMCs in uplifting locally produced fuel and failure by refineries to meet production targets was discussed on May 29 in detail during the recent PRM. The authority observed that numerous OMCs did not honour their commitments to procure product from local refineries, as agreed in the PRM.
In the meeting held on May 29, the OMCs which in March failed to maintain 20 days stock cover of MS & HSD in compliance of Rule 37 of the Pakistan Oil Rules 2016 will be penalised with a penalty of Rs10 million if they have less than 5 days stock of petrol and HSD. If the OMCs have a stock of POL products with less than 10 days cover but more than 5 days will face a penalty of Rs7.5 million. And those OMCs that have a stock of POL products less than 15 days cover and more than 10 days needs, will face the punishment of Rs5 million and those having a stock of less than 20 days cover and more than 15 days cover will be exposed to a penalty of Rs1 million.
However, OMCs that have uplifted insufficient products from refineries, the refineries that have not supplied the products to an OMC as per their allocation, and the refineries that have produced products less than the commitment in the PRM during the month of March-2025 shall be penalised, owing to violation of decisions taken in relative PRM meeting as per the new formula.
Under the formula, the OMCs involved in short upliftment of local products by less than 25 percent would face a penalty of Rs1 million and those which will be involved in procuring local POL products less than 50 percent and more than 25 percent will pay Rs5 million as penalty.
However, those OMCs involved in less lifting of products more than 50 percent and 75 percent will face a penalty of Rs7.5 million and Rs10 million respectively and the same treatment will be meted out to the refineries if any of them found involved in less production of POL products in breach of PRM decisions.
“This failure to comply with PRM directives is not only disrupting Ogra’s oil supply chain management but also undermining national energy security and leading to significant revenue losses due to unnecessary imports, which constitutes a violation of the authority’s directives,” Ogra stated.

Adviser to be hired for ZTBL privatization push,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318020-adviser-to-be-hired-for-ztbl-privatization-push,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan inched closer to privatizing Zarai Taraqiati Bank Ltd. (ZTBL) on Monday, as the Privatization Commission opened technical bids to hire a financial adviser — a key step in the government’s push to offload struggling state-owned enterprises, an official said.
A committee has now begun evaluating the bids, which were submitted by several financial consulting firms vying to steer the bank’s restructuring and potential sale. The process is part of the government’s push—backed by the International Monetary Fund—to trim its bloated public sector, enhance operational efficiencies, and attract private capital.
ZTBL, a specialised financial institution focused on agricultural lending, has long been plagued by governance issues, rising non-performing loans, and outdated service models. Its reform is considered central to improving rural credit delivery and fostering private-sector participation in agri-financing.
Officials familiar with the matter said financial bids will be invited from technically qualified firms in the next phase. The advisor will play a key role in asset valuation, buyer identification, and transaction structuring.

"Ukraine drone attacks on Russia spark fires, disrupt traffic, officials say",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318022-ukraine-drone-attacks-on-russia-spark-fires-disrupt-traffic-officials-say,"KYIV/ISTANBUL: Ukraine’s overnight drone attacks on Russia’s Kursk and Voronezh regions sparked residential fires and disrupted traffic on a major highway, regional officials said early on Monday.
Russian air defence units destroyed a total of 162 Ukrainian drones overnight, downing 57 of the air weapons over the Kursk region that borders Ukraine.Falling debris from destroyed drones in the Kursk region sparked fires at several houses and damaged private apartments, acting governor of the region, Alexander Khinshtein, said on the Telegram messaging app.
In the southern Russian region of Voronezh, where Russian air units destroyed 16 Ukrainian drones, regional governor Alexander Gusev said drone debris cut through power lines which fell on the M-4, a major expressway.
A small section of the highway, which links the cities of Moscow, Voronezh, Rostov-on-Don and Krasnodar, was closed, Gusev said. Falling drone debris also damaged the facade of several houses, he added on Telegram.
There were no injuries reported, the governors of the regions said.The attacks come as both Russia and Ukraine are about to meet for a round of peace talks, trying to find a way to end the war that Russia launched with a full-scale invasion on its smaller neighbour more than three years ago.

Polio team attacked in Diamer,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317999-polio-team-attacked-in-diamer,"GILGT: A monitoring team involved in the ongoing anti-polio campaign in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) came under fire in the Tangir Shekho area of Diamer district on Monday, a day after a new case of polio detected in the area.
No casualties were reported in the incident, which officials say was triggered not by opposition to the polio campaign itself, but due to the public presence of female workers in the conservative region.
According to provincial government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, the polio team had not coordinated their visit with the district administration or local police before entering Tangir, a move described as a lapse in protocol given the area’s sensitivity to gender norms.
“The firing was a reaction to the open presence of women, not an act of hostility toward the vaccination campaign,” Faraq clarified, urging polio teams to strictly follow communication and security protocols, particularly in socially conservative zones like Tangir.
The targeted team included Zonal In-charge Bilal, along with staffers Kainat, Adnan, and Iqbal — all of whom escaped unhurt. Following the incident, the team was shifted to a secure location.
Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has taken notice of the incident and directed local authorities to enhance security measures for health workers across the province, said Faraq, adding the police have launched an investigation and registered a case against unknown assailants. The provincial government has also instructed law enforcement agencies to make immediate efforts to apprehend those involved.
Despite the attack, officials say the polio campaign will continue in Diamer and other districts, with a renewed focus on ensuring safety and coordination with local authorities. “The campaign will not be suspended. We are taking additional steps to safeguard field staff,” said Faraq.
In a related development, the Department of Health, in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), carried out a detailed field investigation around a recently reported polio case in Gabbar, a union council in Tangir, Diamer.
The assessment covered a 500-metre radius around the index case. Key findings revealed that while most children had received both Routine Immunization (RI) and multiple rounds of the Special Immunization Activity (SIA), the infected child had never received routine doses—though he had been administered at least seven SIA doses.
Officials said the child’s father had traveled to Punjab for religious preaching (Tabligh) during Ramazan, raising concerns about possible virus exposure during travel. However, the child has since fully recovered and shows no signs of paralysis, likely due to partial immunity developed through SIA doses.
Stool samples tested at the Regional Reference Laboratory (RRL) in Islamabad confirmed the presence of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV-1). In light of this case, health officials have recommended strengthening Permanent Transit Points (PTPs) in Diamer, launching intensified immunization drives in Gabbar, ensuring rapid response to suspected polio cases, and retraining medical personnel to promptly report Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) cases.

Withholding uplift funds to LGs: PHC puts KP govt on notice,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318005-withholding-uplift-funds-to-lgs-phc-puts-kp-govt-on-notice,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Monday issued notices to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and relevant departments over the alleged non-provision of development funds to elected local government representatives.
The court directed them to submit their responses by June 26.A two-member bench comprising Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Farah Jamshed heard the petition, which was filed by Himmatullah Mayar.
Babar Khan Yousafzai appeared on behalf of the petitioner.During the proceedings, the petitioner’s counsel informed the court that local government elections were held in February 2022 across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, after which elected representatives took oath and began performing their duties.
However, he argued that the provincial government began attempts to curtail their authority and control their functions without justification.In 2022, the provincial government amended the Local Government Act, transferring powers from the elected representatives to the district administration and other departments.
The counsel pointed out that although the Peshawar High Court had earlier struck down these amendments, the provincial government did not restore the powers or release development funds to the local bodies.
He argued that the amendments, particularly to Section 23-A of the Act, were politically motivated. In the first phase of the local government elections, opposition parties had secured a majority, prompting the government to limit their influence by restricting their powers and financial autonomy, he added.As a result, elected officials, including tehsil mayors and village council members, were unable to execute any development work due to a lack of access to funds.The counsel maintained that for the past three years, these representatives faced public pressure while remaining in a state of uncertainty due to their inability to serve their voters.

Omar Ayub sees pressure behind reference against him,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318007-omar-ayub-sees-pressure-behind-reference-against-him,"ISLAMABAD: Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly (NA) Omar Ayub Khan Monday dismissed the disqualification reference, filed against him as a bid to intimidate him and claimed his rival (Babar Nawaz) had greeted him on his win in 2024 general election.
He argued that the NA speaker should have applied his mind, but it appeared that there was so much pressure on him from the agencies that he straight away forwarded the reference to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
Omar Ayub, who had made to the National Assembly from NA-18 Haripur, while talking to the media here at the Parliament House, said even his opponent had congratulated him, despite later trying to fabricate allegations through a fake letter, which the district election officer confirmed was never received.
Omar Ayub, flanked by ex-speaker NA Asad Qaiser, condemned the ‘false’ reference being filed to pressurise him, reiterating that courts have ruled in his favour and rejecting any attempt to intimidate him.
He made it clear that neither Form-47 regime nor political pressure could force him to abandon his stance, asserting that all his parliamentary speeches have been for the unity, sovereignty and democratic future of Pakistan.

A large number of residents participated in the protests who carried placards and banners, and chanted slogans against the power utility.  Addressing a protest demonstration at Liaquatabad, Karachi JI Emir Monem Zafar said then Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, later renamed as KE after privatisation, was privatised in order to end loadshedding, whereas the result was totally opposite.
The KE was subjecting Karachiites to collective punishment in an open violation of all the laws, rules and regulations, as well ascourt orders, he said. He added that KE had proved that it was above the law and the state institutions.
Zafar criticised the ruling political parties for supporting the KE on its cruel policies against Karachiites. He alleged that there was a nexus between the government, KE and National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra).
He said the KE's basic tariff was changed in the name of recovery losses. He remarked that on the one hand, Nepra had reprimanded the KE over its policies through a letter but on the other hand, it had raised its basic tariff by Rs5, which showed the dual face of the regulator. He quoted official figures as saying that some 300 feeders of total around 2,000 feeders were responsible for 87 per cent losses and said that those who paid their bills regularly despite overcharging had been made to pay for those who engaged in electricity theft.
He said the KE had offered the government to take responsibility for the 300 feeders, but actually the government needed to take responsibility for all the feeders, eliminating the role of the KE.

IBA roundtable discusses implications of India’s unilateral suspension of IWT,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317964-iba-roundtable-discusses-implications-of-india-s-unilateral-suspension-of-iwt,"The IBA Karachi hosted at its City Campus a policy roundtable titled “Indus Water Treaty in Perspective” to discuss the implications of the India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in April 2025.
The event was organised by the Centre for Business and Economic Research (CBER) at SESS, said a press release issued by the IBA. Experts highlighted a critical lack of institutional capacity to engage and respond meaningfully with the treaty’s technical and legal dimensions on diplomatic fronts. While academic institutions in Pakistan teach water-related subjects, they emphasized the urgent need to strengthen expertise in international water law and transboundary water diplomacy.
Participants also discussed how prevailing media narratives about India’s “blocking water” have misguided public as such claims are technically unfeasible without large-scale infrastructure and serve more as political tools than realities.
Participants noted that the World Bank role is not clear regarding the resolution of this dispute, and without an institutional conflict resolution mechanism between the two countries, the treaty’s ability to adapt to new challenges remains limited. Some of the experts warn that building new dams is not a solution, as Pakistan lacks sufficient water stock and is facing long-term water flow decline.
In conclusion, participants called for the establishment of a multi-stakeholder working group under the umbrella of IBA-CBER that meets regularly to deliberate on national and regional water strategies and provide actionable recommendations to modernize and strengthen the Indus Water Treaty.
The session brought together government officials, journalists, and academicians to engage in dialogue on the topic, moderated by Dr. Lubna Naz, Director, IBA-CBER. Notable participants included Mr. Muhammad Ehsan ul Haq Laghari, Sindh Member, Indus River System Authority; Mr. Shahab Usto, Advocate, Supreme Court of Pakistan; Mr. Syed Jaffar Ahmed, Member on IBA’s Board of Governors and Director, Institute of Historical and Social Research; Mr. Hafeez Ahmed Jamali, Director General, Balochistan Civil Service Academy; Mr. Syed Hasan Habib, Former Ambassador; Mr. Syed Imran Ahmed, Director, Panjwani Hisaar Water Institute; Mr. Yasir Husain, Founder, Climate Action Center; Mr. Zakir Hussain Dahri, Director General, Pakistan Agricultural Research Council; and others.

SC dismisses Sindh govt’s appeal against SHO’s reinstatement,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317965-sc-dismisses-sindh-govt-s-appeal-against-sho-s-reinstatement,"The Supreme Court has dismissed the Sindh government’s appeal against the decision of the service tribunal to reinstate a station house officer (SHO) who had been dismissed from service by the provincial police chief.
The provincial government had challenged the decision of the service tribunal to reinstate SHO Ghulam Abbas Sundrani, who had been dismissed over his alleged links with dacoits. The government’s counsel told the court that the SHO had been dismissed after a departmental inquiry into his links with dacoits of the Kutcha areas and his involvement in extortion cases.
He said the service tribunal reinstated the respondent without considering the facts of the case, and requested the court to set aside the order of the service tribunal. A two-member SC bench headed by Justice Munib Akhtar said the respondent had not been provided an opportunity of hearing at the time of his dismissal, adding that the service tribunal had issued its order on his appeal in accordance with the law.

SMTA signs MoU to train women in driving scooties,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317967-smta-signs-mou-to-train-women-in-driving-scooties,"The Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) and international food chain KFC on Monday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) at a hotel in Karachi pledging to jointly launch initiatives aimed at empowering women.
The MoU was signed by SMTA Managing Director Kamal Hakim Dayo and KFC CEO Raza Pirbhai. Sindh Senior Minister for Information and Transport Sharjeel Inam Memon, Secretary Transport Asad Zamin and other senior officials witnessed the MoU signing.
Under the agreement, the Sindh government in collaboration with the KFC would establish training centres in all the divisional headquarters of the province to provide scooter-driving training to women.
Addressing the ceremony, Memon said the Sindh government had been taking comprehensive measures to empower women. He emphasised that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had always championed the cause of women’s rights. He recalled that the late Benazir Bhutto launched landmark initiatives such as the First Women’s Bank, Women’s Police Stations, and land distribution among landless women farmers.
The transport minister also highlighted that former president Asif Ali Zardari launched the country’s largest income support programme, which provided financial assistance to millions of women. He added that during the PPP's tenure, women were issued national identity cards and granted the right to vote.
He noted that PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari pledged to rebuild two million houses destroyed in recent floods, with ownership rights granted to women, a project he described as the world’s largest housing initiative.
Memon also referred to the Pink Bus project, which, according to him, was Pakistan’s first women-only public transport service. He said the bus service also garnered international media’s praise.
Building on that success, the government would now provide free Pink EV scooties to women to ensure their independence and mobility, the transport minister said. He revealed that 8,000 women had so far applied for the scooters, of whom 140 already possessed driving licences.
The KFC committed to providing training to women and covering the cost of their licences. The CEO stated that the training would be conducted at divisional headquarters across the province.
Memon assured that the bidding process for the scooter project would be transparent and that scooters would be distributed purely on merit. He also announced plans to launch a pink taxi service and confirmed that more buses, including double-decker buses, would arrive in Pakistan next month.
He added that the Sindh government had already introduced Pakistan’s first electric buses. He concluded by noting that collective efforts were now required to move the nation forward. The KFC CEO hosted a reception for the distinguished guests and expressed pride in supporting this impactful initiative. He reaffirmed the KFC’s commitment to creating employment opportunities for women and supporting their right to lead empowered and dignified lives.

Intoxicated son kills father with hammer in Surjani Town,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317968-intoxicated-son-kills-father-with-hammer-in-surjani-town,"In a horrifying incident in Surjani Town, a drunken man brutally murdered his father during a domestic dispute on Monday evening.
Police arrested the suspect and recovered the murder weapons. The incident occurred in a house near Rajput Milk Shop, Razi Goth, Gulshan-e-Surjani, within the jurisdiction of the Surjani Town police station. The 35-year-old suspect, Owais, allegedly under the influence of alcohol, got into an argument with his 50-year-old father Haroon, son of Sheikh Ibrahim.
In a fit of rage, Owais attacked his father, repeatedly striking him on the head with a hammer and cement block, killing him on the spot. Upon receiving the information, police rushed to the scene and summoned the Crime Scene Unit for forensic examination. The body was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
Police arrested the accused on the spot and seized the murder weapons. According to SHO Ali Shah, the suspect was heavily intoxicated and had been giving conflicting statements during initial interrogation.
Police said the murder may have been triggered after the father scolded his son for drinking alcohol. They added that further investigations would proceed once the suspect became sober. The body was handed over to the family after a post-mortem examination.

Armaghan’s father gets post-arrest bail in illegal weapon case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317969-armaghan-s-father-gets-post-arrest-bail-in-illegal-weapon-case,"A sessions court has granted post-arrest bail to Kamran Asghar Qureshi, the father of Mustafa Amir murder case suspect Armaghan, in an illegal arms case.
Additional Sessions Judge (South) Muhammad Suleman Buriro heard an application filed by the suspect seeking post-arrest bail. After hearing arguments from both sides, the judge granted bail to Kamran, subject to the submission of a surety of Rs100,000.
Defence lawyer Khurram Abbas Awan argued that the suspect was innocent and had been falsely implicated in this case with the alleged recovery of an unlicensed pistol foisted upon him. He said that the FIR appeared to be based on false implication, adding that the benefit of the doubt always went in favour of an accused even at the bail stage.
On the other hand, the state prosecutor vehemently opposed the suspect's bail plea. In his written order, the judge noted that the suspect was arrested in the present case on March 20, 2025, after an unlicensed pistol, bullets and drugs were allegedly recovered from him.
""Though, the offence of recovery of unlicensed weapon is punishable up to 14 years attracted with prohibitory clause of section 497 CrPC, but in the instant case all the witnesses are police officials,"" he said. ""There is no chance of tempering of prosecution case evidence,"" he added.
The judge said that the suspect was in judicial custody since the date of his arrest and that he was no more required for further investigation. ""Moreover, trial is yet to be initiated and prosecution has to prove offence against accused which will take time to be completed. Therefore, in view of the above facts and circumstances, the applicant/accused is entitled for grant of bail,"" ruled the judge.
Kamran faces three separate cases pertaining to the possession of illegal arms and narcotics. According to his lawyer, while he has secured bail in one of the cases, he has yet to obtain bail in the drug-related case and another illegal weapons case, in which he is a co-accused alongside his son, Armaghan.

ACE restrained from taking coercive action against SBCA official in heritage building demolition case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317971-ace-restrained-from-taking-coercive-action-against-sbca-official-in-heritage-building-demolition-case,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Monday restrained the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) from taking any coercive action against a director of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), who is facing charges pertaining to demolition of a heritage building, Kharas House, located in the Clifton area.
The interim order came on the petition of Ashfaq Hussain who challenged the Karachi commissioner’s inquiry report and registration of FIR against him and others under the Sindh Cultural Heritage (preservation) Act along with initiation of proceedings under the anti-corruption laws for misuse of authority.
The commissioner in the inquiry report had recommended criminal action against SBCA officials and owner of the property after finding severe irregularities, deliberate violations and a nexus between government officials and the private owner aimed at the unlawful demolition of the heritage building.
The inquiry report had revealed that the SBCA in a blatant disregard for the law issued a demolition permit without consulting the heritage department, thereby violating mandatory legal procedures.
A counsel for the petitioner submitted that the commissioner’s inquiry was unlawful as mandatory requirements had been fulfilled prior to the issuance of the demolition order. He also questioned the initiation of inquiry by the Anti-Corruption Establishment on the issue and submitted that ACE did not have the authority to proceed with the matter.
He submitted that the high court had also issued an interim order in another petition in the instant case and requested the SHC to set aside the commissioner’s inquiry report and restrain ACE from initiating proceedings in the matter.
A division bench of the SHC headed by Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput after a preliminary hearing of the petition issued notices to the advocate general, prosecutor general and others and in the meantime, restrained ACE from taking any coercive action against the petitioner till the next date of hearing.
It is pertinent to mention that Kharas House, located at Plot No. FT-4/14, Bath Island Road, Clifton, was earlier declared a protected heritage property in 2018 under the Sindh Cultural Heritage (Preservation) Act. The owner had initiated process for demolition of the building due to its dilapidated structure. The commissioner’s inquiry found that the SBCA technical committee on dangerous buildings initiated the demolition process on January 4, 2024, without involving professional regulatory bodies.

Habib University celebrates Class of 2025 at its 8th convocation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317972-habib-university-celebrates-class-of-2025-at-its-8th-convocation,"Habib University hosted its 8th Convocation ceremony on June 1, 2025, at a hotel in Karachi, celebrating the academic achievements and transformative journeys of the Class of 2025.
This milestone event honoured the resilience, intellect, and creativity of 237 graduates shaped by the university’s distinctive liberal arts and sciences education. This year’s convocation highlighted the power of a reparative curriculum rooted in Yohsin—the philosophy of thoughtful self-cultivation. The ceremony was attended by distinguished faculty, proud families, and prominent members of the academic and civic community.
Iman Ashraf, Class Valedictorian from the Comparative Humanities programme, reflected on the collective journey of the graduating class:  “We’ve learned to unlearn, to question, to be resilient. And in that journey, it’s natural—human even—to be tempted by self-interest. But if we truly long for the world we wish we had been born into, then words must become actions. Phrases like ‘reparative futures,’ ‘thoughtful self-cultivation,’ and even Yohsin—they remain just words unless we embody them through amal, through meaningful action. So, as we set our sights on future goals, let us also carve out space—not just to give back, but to give forward.”
In his address, Habib University President Wasif Rizvi challenged conventional notions of progress:  “What we often call progress is merely a more efficient form of cruelty. Behind the polished façade of modernity—celebrated by a multi-trillion-dollar PR machine—lies a 500-year campaign of relentless extraction: of resources, bodies, and meaning.
“And yet, here you are—Class of 2025. You do not arrive at the gates of this world in ignorance. You were formed at Habib University—a rare sanctuary in today’s world. A space that refuses to sell your mind for utility or your soul for credentials. Instead, it opened a portal. That portal is Yohsin—a philosophy, a practice, a way of being that calls you to live with beauty, passion, and purpose.”
President Wasif Rizvi also highlighted the university’s unwavering commitment to accessibility and equity in higher education, noting that 83% of the Class of 2025 received financial support during their academic journey. He expressed deep gratitude to the Mohsineen—Habib University’s donor community—whose generosity and belief in the power of education have made these transformative opportunities possible.
Dr. Shamshad Akhtar, world-renowned economist and Chairperson of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, delivered the commencement address. She encouraged graduates to embrace ambition with humility:  “Your attitude, not your aptitude, will determine your altitude. So, think high. What you get by achieving goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.”
Mr. Rafiq M. Habib, chancellor of Habib University, praised the graduating class:  “You are what makes Habib University. Your enthusiasm, curiosity, and strong bonds define the spirit of this institution. As you leave, you are equipped with the finest undergraduate education in Pakistan, ready for whatever path you choose.”
As the Class of 2025 steps into the world, they carry forward the spirit of inquiry, compassion, and purpose that defines the Habib experience. The university community extends its heartfelt congratulations to the graduates and looks forward to their continued impact as changemakers and thought leaders.

Three candidates selected for Szabul VC post,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317973-three-candidates-selected-for-szabul-vc-post,"The only law university in the country -- Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto University of Law (Szabul) -- has paved the way for the appointment of a vice chancellor after two years.
The search committee has selected three candidates for the post of vice chancellor after interviews on Monday, including two female candidates. In the search committee meeting chaired by Chairman Sindh Higher Education Commission Dr Tariq Rafi, 11 candidates were called for interviews, and on the basis of the interviews, the first number was given to Justice Kausar Sultana, the second number to Muhammad Shahid Shafiq and the third number to Dr. Tehreem Farrukh.
The search committee meeting was attended by Sindh High Education Commission Chairman Dr. Tariq Rafi, Sindh HEC Secretary Moin Siddiqui, Boards and Universities Secretary Abbas Baloch, Justice Zia Pervez, Justice Nadeem Akhtar and College Education Secretary Shahab Qamar Ansari.
The search committee had received applications from 24 candidates for Szabul, and after the documents of the candidates were checked, 11 candidates were called for interviews, including Munawar Sultana, Liaquat Ali Abro, Abdul Ghaffar Korai, Badar Jamil Mandro, Professor Dr. Nabi Bakhsh Narejo, Professor Muhammad Tahir, M. Sajjada Shamim Ahmed, Nazir Hussain Phulpoto, Justice Kausar Sultana, Muhammad Shahid Shafiq and Dr. Tehreem Farrukh.
Justice Qazi Khalid was the first vice chancellor of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto University of Law, but due to political differences, he was not given a second term. Even in the second term, he was in first place but was not appointed on the basis that only two candidates were selected and three names are required to send a panel of candidates to the chief minister of Sindh. However, later, despite a panel of two candidates, few candidates were appointed as vice chancellor to some universities of Sindh.

Following the incident, Farooqi, reportedly the Land Cruiser’s owner, allegedly ordered his armed guard and driver to forcefully detain the motorcyclist inside his vehicle, where he was assaulted, abused and threatened at gunpoint.
A woman, said to be the motorcyclist’s sister who was accompanying the victim, was also pushed and humiliated, despite pleading with the suspects. Several bystanders witnessed the assault and recorded it on their phones, then shared the video clips on social media, prompting public outrage.
The FIR has been lodged under sections 506-B, 354, 342, 34 and 504 of the Pakistan Penal Code for criminal intimidation, assault on modesty, wrongful confinement, common intention and intentional insult. South Zone police chief DIG Syed Asad Raza confirmed Farooqi’s arrest and his being locked up in the Gizri police station lock-up. His vehicle has also been impounded.
Earlier, the guard and the driver were arrested, and raids were conducted at the businessman’s home and office during the night. DIG Raza said the suspect is not a government official, and denied claims that the police initially ignored the incident.
“No one is above the law. The matter is being taken very seriously. The victim will receive full justice,” he stressed. He said police are continuing their investigation, and vow to bring all those involved to justice.
Karachi police chief Addl IG Javed Alam Odho had also taken notice of the incident, and had directed the District South SSP to arrest the key suspect and ensure his punishment in accordance with the law.
Police said the victim and his sister are believed to be residents of the Ranchore Line area, adding that either of the siblings is yet to approach the police in the matter.

EPA prohibits sale of substandard fuels,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317909-epa-prohibits-sale-of-substandard-fuels,"LAHORE:Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has prohibited sale of substandard fuel for motor vehicles across the province.
In this regard, DG EPA issued an order, which stated that Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Punjab was striving hard to provide for the protection, conservation, rehabilitation and improvement of the environment, prevention and control of pollution, promotion of sustainable development.
The order said source apportionment studies have reported that vehicular emissions are major contributor in smog formation and air pollution. The vehicular emissions due to sub-standard fuels (petrol / diesel) further deteriorate the air quality especially during the smog season. Poor Air Quality has been linked to increased incidence of respiratory illnesses, environmental degradation, and violations of air quality standards.
DG EPA said as per Section 2(xxxiii) of The Punjab Environmental Protection Act 1997, pollution means the contamination of air, land or water by the discharge or emission of effluents or wastes or air pollutants or noise or other matter which either directly or indirectly or in combination with other discharges or substances alters unfavorably the chemical, physical, biological, radiation, thermal or radiological or aesthetic properties of the air, land or water or which may, or is likely to make the air, land or water unclean, noxious or impure or injurious, disagreeable or detrimental to the health, safety, welfare or property of persons or harmful to biodiversity.
Environmental Protection Agency vide order No. 259/PA/DG/EPA/2025 dated 29.05.2025 has declared that any specification of automobile fuel (Gasoline and High-Speed Diesel) other than approved by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) shall be deemed as sub-standard fuel. DG EPA said U/S 15(2) of the Punjab Environmental Protection Act, 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency is empowered to issue directions to any motor vehicle or class of vehicles to use such fuels as may be prescribed to ensure compliance with the standards.

Pakistan Forum re-launched with hybrid event,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317910-pakistan-forum-re-launched-with-hybrid-event,"LAHORE:The once well established and respected Pakistan Forum was officially re-launched this weekend with a hybrid event that gathered students, organisers, and activists as well as others from across the Pakistani diaspora.
The event marked a renewed commitment to building a progressive platform for political education, grassroots solidarity, and transnational organizing. The online event was conducted from New York and brought together people from cities around the world on Zoom.
Originally founded in 1970 by figures like academicians Eqbal Ahmad and Feroz Ahmed, the Pakistan Forum emerged during a time of mass uprisings and democratic hope. Today’s revival draws on that legacy to confront the intersecting crises facing Pakistan — mounting authoritarianism, economic inequality, climate collapse, and the suppression of dissent.
The forum aims to connect diaspora communities to political struggles in Pakistan and among Pakistani immigrant workers globally. It seeks to leverage diaspora privilege — access to resources, safety, and platforms — to support grassroots movements, amplify marginalised voices, and build a shared vision for justice and equity.
Participants reflected on global solidarity movements, including Palestine, and discussed ways to resist isolation, censorship, and elite narratives.
They also highlighted the invisibilised struggles of undocumented Pakistani workers in the West, calling for their inclusion in the diaspora’s political imagination. The forum will move forward with projects spanning political education, digital publications, cross-solidarity efforts, and fundraising for movement work in Pakistan. It invites anyone committed to justice to join in building a progressive, inclusive, and collective vision for Pakistan’s future.

In another operation, New Anarkali Police arrested two drug dealers—Imran and Tony—during a crackdown. A significant amount of crystal meth (ice) worth thousands of rupees was seized from their possession. In Shahdara Town, tireless efforts by the police led to the safe recovery of missing children. Three-year-old Ayan had gone out with his cousins, seven-year-old Hadiya and four-year-old Hania, and got lost. After a search by their mother, an abduction case was registered.
SP City Bilal Ahmed formed a team to locate the children, using Safe City cameras, technology, and human resources. After an overnight search, the children were safely recovered. Their mother thanked the Shahdara Town Police for their efforts.

Business community expects relief in budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317930-business-community-expects-relief-in-budget,"Islamabad:The business community has high expectations from the upcoming budget, and appropriate relief measures should be introduced, said the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI).
Speaking on recent reports about tax relief for salaried individuals, RCCI welcomed the news and emphasized that such relief should be extended to all segments of society, not just salaried individuals.
The Chamber expressed hope that the proposals presented in the joint declaration of the All Pakistan Chambers Presidents’ Conference would be incorporated into the budget. RCCI stated that while exemptions are being announced for imported vehicles in the auto sector, protection for the local auto industry must also be ensured. Tax concessions should be granted on locally assembled vehicles to boost employment. The local auto parts and vendor industry should be promoted by reducing taxes and customs duties on auto parts and raw materials.
To support car buyers, the loan limit for car financing from banks should be increased. To encourage tax compliance, new taxpayers should be granted a three-year exemption from tax audits.
The Chamber demanded that utility charges, especially electricity and gas, be reduced to lower the cost of doing business. This would facilitate the establishment of new industries and help revive closed industrial units.
They also proposed that withholding agents should be recognized as partners and granted a 10% tax credit on collections. Referring to a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, RCCI stated that the PM had addressed their concerns about the Income Tax Ordinance 2025 and clarified that the proposed amendment was intended solely for the tobacco sector, and that it would be corrected immediately. The Chamber stressed the need for policy continuity and urged that FBR should avoid frequent issuance of SROs. Existing taxpayers should not be overburdened.

FAPUASA condemns faculty victimisation at SMIU,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317931-fapuasa-condemns-faculty-victimisation-at-smiu,"Islamabad: Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) has strongly condemned the victimisation of faculty members at Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU), Karachi.
To assess ongoing concerns regarding faculty treatment at SMIU, a committee constituted by FAPUASA visited the university on May 29. The committee’s findings were formally presented and discussed in an online meeting of the FAPUASA Executive Council. During the meeting, it was revealed that one faculty member had been terminated on the very day of the committee's visit. This abrupt action raised serious questions regarding due process and whether disciplinary protocols were properly followed.
The Executive Council expressed grave concern over the procedural irregularities and whether the punishment administered was proportionate to the charges if substantiated as per the university's own regulations. After detailed deliberation, the EC unanimously resolved to request Chief Minister of Sindh Murad Ali Shah and Governor Kamran Tessori to intervene in the matter and ensure a transparent and impartial investigation. FAPUASA further demands that the inquiry be conducted by an independent committee with at least one representative nominated by FAPUASA Pakistan.
Additionally, the council urged the Vice-Chancellor of SMIU to immediately suspend any punitive actions against faculty members until the findings of the independent inquiry are made public. FAPUASA expressed firm stand with the academic community and remains committed to protecting the rights, dignity and professional integrity of university faculty across Pakistan.

Pak-EPA cleans up Margalla Hills,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317932-pak-epa-cleans-up-margalla-hills,"Islamabad: Ahead of the World Environment Day, the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) carried out a clean-up drive on Margalla Hills Trail 5.
The initiative launched Environment Week activities in line with the global theme: “Eliminate Plastic Pollution.” Over 40 volunteers from universities, civil society, and local communities joined forces, collecting over 500kg of plastic wrappers, bottles and other waste from the popular hiking trail.
The effort aimed to raise awareness about sustainable waste management and the protection of natural ecosystems, especially given Trail 5’s high footfall and ongoing littering issues. Addressing the volunteers, Secretary of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Aisha Humera stressed the importance of public support and education to tackle plastic pollution.
“Plastic waste is invading our oceans, food, and even our bodies,” she said. “Sustainable habits and community action are key to a greener future.” Pak-EPA Director General Nazia Zeb Ali said the drive was about more than just cleaning the hills—it’s about changing community attitudes toward the environment. Participants said plastic bags remained a major pollutant, taking decades to degrade and threatening both wildlife and soil.

Teachers oppose replacing FDE colleges’ cultural hubs with IT parks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317933-teachers-oppose-replacing-fde-colleges-cultural-hubs-with-it-parks,"Islamabad:Even though co-curricular activities are imperative for the holistic development of students, the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) is understood to be moving ahead with plans to convert several college auditoriums in Islamabad into IT parks, triggering widespread concern among teachers and administrators.
The move, reportedly made without consulting college principals and other stakeholders, involves the conversion of auditoriums in Islamabad Model College for Boys (IMCB), H-9; IMCB, Sihala, IMCB, G-10/4; Islamabad Model College for Girls (IMCG), Humak; IMCG, F-8/1 and IMCG, I-10/4.
Educators insist college auditoriums have traditionally served as vibrant platforms for intellectual, cultural and social engagement, hosting events like debates, dramatics, student elections and graduation ceremonies, so removing these facilities undermines the modern educational model that integrates classroom instruction with practical and extracurricular experiences.
A principal told 'The News' that during his tenure in the ministry, former education Secretary Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani had planned to upgrade his college,s hall into a state-of-the-art auditorium, but after his recent transfer, the FDE officials appeared to be reversing his decisions.
“Auditoriums are essential for academic and cultural expression, serving as venues for convocations, student elections, and competitions that foster leadership, creativity, and confidence,” he said.
Another principal said her college hosted a wide range of events from ‘Naat’ and ‘Qirat’ competitions to debates, poetry, dramatics and student elections in the auditorium, so eliminating that space would strip students of vital developmental experiences that complemented classroom learning.
""Beyond co-curricular activities, college halls also serve a crucial logistical function. These halls are primary venues for home exams, Federal Board annual exams, and university examinations. Without these facilities, conducting large-scale examinations becomes extremely difficult,"" he said.
Educators emphasised that the FDE’s plans overlooked the holistic role such spaces play in shaping students emotionally, intellectually, artistically and morally. While acknowledging the importance of technological development, they argued that it should not come at the expense of facilities that contribute significantly to a well-rounded education.
“There’s ample open space on our campus where a new IT park could be established,” a teacher said.
“With thoughtful planning, we can meet both technological and educational needs.” In a college where the auditorium has already been converted into an IT park last year, its principal revealed the project remains largely inactive.
“The facility has failed to attract student interest and remains closed most of the time. Instead of dismantling more auditoriums, the focus should be on making existing IT parks functional and relevant,” he said.
Another principal said that he was not against technology but development should not come at the cost of spaces that nurtured creativity, collaboration, and confidence. ""Constructing IT parks on unused land instead of demolishing key student facilities would show a real commitment to holistic education,” he said.

QAU evolving or devolving?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317934-qau-evolving-or-devolving,"Islamabad:This has become a ritual in Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) that the administration closes the university prematurely before the start of Spring Semester Terminal examinations. It precedes students’ clashes between themselves or their strife with the authorities over some demands.
This year, the students closed the campus on May 12 by not letting any bus to leave the Transport Section. More than a week passed and then the Registrar suddenly issued an order, of course, with the approval of the competent authority closing the university for Eid holidays. Students were asked to immediately leave the campus. It will obviously save some money ‘wasted’ on fuel and electricity by this funds-starved seat of higher learning and research.
But the notification had strange points. It was assumed, I don’t know how, that most of the faculty has completed course work or about to complete. It advised the teachers to complete their course work, assignments, if left any, etc., during holidays through on-line classes or any means of their choice.
It happens where ‘competent authority’ prioritises securing the job and seeking appointment in another university to repeat the deeds giving two hoots to improving the teaching and research or ameliorating life at the Camps.
It is interesting to note that improving Internet service was one of the major demands of the striking students. When this is state of affairs in the Federal Capital, how a student sitting in Shiggar, Chitral, Taunsa, Khuzdar, Daudkhel, Pasni or Thar could have state-of-the-art Internet facilities to interact with a teacher or the vice-versa.
Indirectly, the notification is saying that forget about the syllabus or course, just take the exams after Eid. What happens with the standard of education, to use Sher Afzal Marwat’s lexicon, ‘woh to warh gaya.’
Students also complain of safety and security situation including drug paddling. Rather, it is a worry of campus community including teaches and employees working or living at the campus. Despite security staff now having wireless sets, vehicles, etc, dacoits looted house of a female teacher in Shahdara Colony recently and two dacoits on a motorbike fired at police in front of the B-Type colony on QAU-Bari Imam Road and fled towards Diplomatic Enclave a fortnight ago.
After that a battalion of monkeys has started patrolling in the A to D Type colonies and teaching departments. One of the faculty commented that seeing the inadequacy of its security outfit, the QAU administration has appointed new security guards fitting in the Darwin’s Theory of Evolution also. A teacher quipped that if the experiment succeeds, the responsibility can be entrusted to hanumans. The Faculty of Biology has a Primate Facility also where rhesus monkeys, Guinea pigs and rabbits are bread to test different medicines and solutions. What about appointing a new head of QAU security force (Resident Officer) from Faculty of Biological Science to have a better liaison. Devolving may be a missing link. After all the QAU is also evolving. Or is it evolutioning?

Accompanied by key officials including Project Director Amara Awais, Director North Zone (American Lycetuff School) Naila Khusro, ECE Project Head Alveena Ahmad, ECE Project Manager Syeda Mariam, and Bhara Kahu Mentor Madiha Amir, the Minister engaged with both students and teachers, observing classroom dynamics and reviewing academic progress.
During the visit, Ms. Wajiha commended the high level of student engagement, particularly noting the enthusiastic participation in the “Jolly Phonics” activity. She took a keen interest in the learning materials presented, including student portfolios and classwork copies, which reflected significant academic growth.
The ECE classrooms, led by main teacher Sadia Shahzad and assistant teacher Saba Sadiq, currently serve 47 students across ECE 1 and ECE 2. The classrooms were found to be exceptionally well-maintained, with teaching resources, DLPs, and student materials neatly organised—indicative of the teachers' commitment and diligence.

In her opening remarks, Farrah Naz, Country Director, GAIN Pakistan, emphasised the urgency of integrated policy action: “Fragmented policies are no longer sufficient to meet today’s complex food system challenges. This workshop marks an important milestone in fostering dialogue across sectors and grounding our analysis in local realities.”

Key Policies Module, examines coherence among sectoral policies in agriculture, health/nutrition, trade, environment, and social protection.The workshop created a space for cross-sector collaboration and joint analysis, contributing to a stronger evidence base for future action.
Faiz Rasool, Head of Policy and Advocacy at GAIN, highlighted the broader vision: “This is more than a validation workshop-it is a step toward a nationally owned process of building policy coherence to transform Pakistan’s food system. Only through alignment and collective effort can we meet the nutrition and sustainability needs of our population.”
The workshop concluded with a renewed commitment to integrate feedback into the final Policy Coherence analysis and engage policymakers in advancing food systems transformation in Pakistan.

‘Teachers’ transfer affecting studies of girls’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317953-teachers-transfer-affecting-studies-of-girls,"GHALLANAI: The local government representatives in Mohmand tribal district on Monday asked the high-ups of the Education Department to take notice of the transfer of women teachers from the far-flung areas as it was affecting the studies of the girl students.
Speaking at a press conference in the Mohmand Press Club, Vice-Chairmen of various neighbourhood and village councils - including Naqab Shah, Dr Majeed Khan, Hikmat Shah, Shoaib Khan, Malik Asfandyar, Hassan Sardar, and others raised concerns about the deteriorating state of education in the region.
They alleged that irregularities, school closures, absenteeism of teachers, and administrative negligence had affected the studies of the girl students in Mohmand.The LG representatives warned that if immediate action was not taken, large-scale protests, including participation by schoolgirls, would be launched.
They said that women teachers were being posted out of the far-flung areas, leaving thousands of girls without access to basic education, adding that the transfers were being ordered in violation of the directives of the chief minister.
The LG representatives said that around 24 schools for girls in various tehsils of Mohmand had been shut down due to transfers of female teachers based on favoritism or political influence. These closures, they added, were putting the future of countless young girls at risk.
They accused the District Education Officer (DEO) of blatantly violating government orders. “The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister had imposed a ban on transfers,” said one speaker, “yet the DEO has completely disregarded those directives.”
The speakers pointed out that literacy rate among girls in Mohmand was already at an alarmingly low level, and it was now nearing a total collapse. They urged the authorities to intervene and take swift action to save education in Mohmand.

Power bills: SCCI flays FCA revival for industrial consumers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317959-power-bills,"PESHAWAR: Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) has expressed grave concern over the revival of the fuel charge adjustment (FCA) in power bills for industrial consumers and termed the move detrimental for economic growth.
SCCI President Fazal Moqeem Khan, in a statement here on Monday, said the decision was completely contrary to the government’s commitments to bring down the electricity prices.
They said such decisions would bring sluggishness in the process of revival of the industrial sector and the economy. He said that the industrial sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was also on the verge of closing, and the revival of rising fuel costs would force manufacturers to pack up their units and shift the investment from the country.
The SCCI chief said it was the need of the hour to incentivize the local industries rather than further burdening them with such unpredictable decisions.He urged the government and relevant authorities to reconsider the decision in the best interest of the industries and the national economy. “Let the wheel of industries continue to spin, which are the major source of employment for many households,” he added.  Quoting the various official data and reports, the SCCI chief said over 50 percent of industries were rather close or running on very low production in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, whereas the sick industries were in a dilemma and its revival was a challenging and daunting task for the government and authorities concerned.

"As Tesla stalls across Europe, sales rise in Norway",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317857-as-tesla-stalls-across-europe-sales-rise-in-norway,"OSLO: Tesla sales have rebounded in Norway this year, industry figures showed on Monday, bucking a broader European trend as consumers turn away from Elon Musk’s electric car brand.
Norwegians have flocked back to the US brand as it offered zero-interest loans and a new Model Y, the best-selling car in the country for three months running. Norway is the country with the highest proportion of electric vehicles (EV), making up 93.9 per cent of new car registrations in May, according to the Norwegian Road Federation (OFV).
EVs made up 92.7 per cent of new car registrations in the first five months of the year. Tesla regained the title of leading car brand in the Scandinavian country in May, tripling its sales and accounting for 18.2 per cent of new cars sold. For the first five months of the year, Tesla sales increased by 8.3 per cent -- lower than the overall new car market which grew by 30.6 per cent. Over that period, Tesla had a market share of 12.9 per cent, second to German auto giant Volkswagen.
Tesla sales fell by half in the European Union in April, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers´ Association (ACEA). The company’s EU market share dropped to 1.1 per cent amid growing competition from Chinese rivals and consumers protesting Musk’s politics and ties to US President Donald Trump.
“Looking at Tesla sales in Norway in May and for the year so far, we stand out from the rest of Europe, where sales of this brand have seen a noticeable decline,” OFV director Oyvind Solberg Thorsen said in a statement.Jonathan Parr, an analyst at used-car dealer Rebil, told broadcaster TV2 that “ultimately, it’s the price that Norwegian motorists care about most.”
“Norwegians don’t like Musk but feel no shame owning a Tesla,” Parr explained.In recent months, Norwegian media have nonetheless reported several stories of Tesla owners deciding to part ways with their cars or refrain from buying another Tesla. Norway, the largest oil producer in Western Europe, has adopted a goal that this year all new cars should be zero-emission vehicles.

"Gold prices surge by Rs5,900 per tola amid global market gains",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317858-gold-prices-surge-by-rs5-900-per-tola-amid-global-market-gains,"KARACHI: Gold prices in Pakistan rebounded sharply on Monday, rising by Rs5,900 per tola, after a notable uptick in global bullion markets. This marks a strong recovery in the local market following recent volatility in precious metal prices.
According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), the price of gold in the domestic market climbed to Rs353,100 per tola, while the 10-gram gold rate increased by Rs5,058, settling at Rs302,726.
In the international market, gold prices also registered a solid gain, increasing by $59 to reach $3,347 per ounce. Pakistani gold rates are typically adjusted with a $20 premium over global rates to account for import costs, currency fluctuations, and local demand dynamics.
Bullion traders attributed the price surge to renewed investor interest in gold as a safe-haven asset amid concerns over a slowdown in global economic growth and uncertainty around central bank policies.
“The rebound in gold prices was driven by growing expectations that major central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, may delay further interest rate hikes due to slowing inflation and mixed economic indicators,” said a bullion trader in Karachi. “Investors are turning back to gold to hedge against financial uncertainty.”
In recent weeks, gold prices have seen erratic movements, influenced by geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in the US dollar, and changes in inflation expectations. After falling to Rs335,200 per tola on May 15, prices have gradually climbed back as global economic sentiment remains fragile.
Despite Monday’s gain, analysts caution that gold markets are likely to remain volatile in the near term, depending on macroeconomic data releases and developments in international trade relations.
Meanwhile, silver prices remained flat in the local market. The per tola silver rate stood unchanged at Rs3,456, while the 10-gram silver price remained steady at Rs2,962.Retail jewellers noted that the price rise may dampen demand slightly among consumers, particularly in the wedding season, as many had hoped for continued relief after the recent price dip.
“Footfall in markets had picked up last week when gold dipped, but this sudden surge could push many buyers to postpone their purchases again,” a local jeweller in Karachi said.

Apple challenges ‘unreasonable’ EU order to open up to rivals,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317859-apple-challenges-unreasonable-eu-order-to-open-up-to-rivals,"Apple has submitted a legal challenge to an EU order to open up its closed ecosystem to rivals such as Meta and Alphabet’ Google, saying the demands are unreasonable and hamper innovation.
The European Commission had in March detailed how Apple must comply with the Digital Markets Act, which aims to rein in the power of Big Tech. Apple said the EU’s interoperability requirements create “a process that is unreasonable, costly and stifles innovation”. “These requirements will also hand data-hungry companies sensitive information, which poses massive privacy and security risks to our EU users,” it said in a statement.
“These deeply flawed rules that only target Apple -- and no other company -- will severely limit our ability to deliver innovative products and features to Europe, leading to an inferior user experience for our European customers.”
Meta, Google, Spotify and Garmin are among companies that have requested access to Apple users’ data.The legal fight will likely take years to play out in court. Until then, Apple will have to comply with the EU order.
The commission ordered Apple to give rival makers of smartphones, headphones and virtual reality headsets access to its technology and mobile operating system so they can connect with Apple's iPhones and iPad tablets.It also set out a detailed process and timeline for Apple to respond to interoperability requests from app developers.

Indian billionaire Adani under new scrutiny from US prosecutors: WSJ,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317860-indian-billionaire-adani-under-new-scrutiny-from-us-prosecutors-wsj,"US prosecutors are investigating whether Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s companies imported Iranian liquefied petroleum gas into India through their Mundra port, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.
A WSJ investigation found tankers travelling between Mundra in the western Indian state of Gujarat and the Persian Gulf exhibited traits experts say are common for ships evading sanctions, the report said.
The US Justice Department is reviewing activities of several LPG tankers used to ship cargoes to Adani Enterprises, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
“Adani categorically denies any deliberate engagement in sanctions evasion or trade involving Iranian-origin LPG,” a company spokesman told the WSJ in a statement. “Further, we are not aware of any investigation by US authorities on this subject.”Adani, the US Department of Justice and the US Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.
US President Donald Trump said in May that all purchases of Iranian oil or petrochemical products must stop and any country or person buying any from the country would be immediately subject to secondary sanctions.Any inquiry into Adani would come months after US authorities indicted Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, alleging they paid bribes to secure power supply contracts, and misled US investors during fund-raising in the United States.
Adani Group has called the accusations “baseless” and vowed to seek “all possible legal recourse”.

US manufacturing contracts again despite some tariff easing,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317861-us-manufacturing-contracts-again-despite-some-tariff-easing,"WASHINGTON: US manufacturing remained in contraction territory in May for the third month in a row, according to survey data published on Monday, as uncertainty over US President Donald Trump’s tariff plans continued.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has hit most countries with a baseline tariff of 10 per cent, threatened dozens of trading partners with higher duties, and slapped sector-specific levies on steel, aluminium and autos not made in the US.
Against that backdrop, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) manufacturing index declined to 48.5 per cent in May, extending its decline, and remaining firmly below the 50-point mark separating expansion from contraction.
The index for imports plunged 7.2 per cent from a month earlier, while the indices for inventories and new export orders also saw steep declines. The survey data was in line with the market consensus, according to Briefing[dot]com.
“Contraction in most of the indexes that measure demand and output have slowed, while inputs have started to weaken,” ISM survey chief Susan Spence said in a statement. Tariffs were front of mind for many of the businesses who responded to the survey.
One firm in the computer and electronic products sector told ISM that government spending cuts or delays and tariffs were “raising hell with businesses”. Another company in the chemicals sector said most suppliers were simply passing on the cost of tariffs “at full value”.
“The position being communicated is that the supplier considers it a tax, and taxes always get passed through to the customer,” they continued, adding: “Very few are absorbing any portion of the tariffs.”
The new levies are not only causing higher prices, however, with one firm warning of a severe supply crunch “rivaling that” of the Covid-19 pandemic.Despite fierce criticism from many businesses, the White House continues to insist that any pain from tariffs will be short-lived, and that it forms just one plank of an overall economic strategy to boost growth which includes tax cuts and deregulation.

Stocks down 813 points on pre-budget pressure,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317862-stocks-down-813-points-on-pre-budget-pressure,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed lower on the start of the week in a volatile session amid pre-budget pressure.
The benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 813.29 points, or 0.68 per cent, to 118,877.81 points, down from 119,691.09 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 120,590.77 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 118,672.84 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said, “Stocks closed under pressure in the pre-budget session at the PSX. Reports of higher taxes on banking and saving schemes income and POL levies in the Budget FY26 impacted the sentiments.”
He said that concerns over geopolitical tensions and rupee instability played a catalytic role in the bearish close. The KSE-30 index decreased by 309.56 points or 0.85 per cent to 36,144.59 points from 36,454.15 points.
Traded shares dropped by 83 million shares to 497.94 million shares from 580.318 million shares. The trading value increased to Rs23.45 billion from Rs22.743 billion. Market capital expanded to Rs14.444 trillion against Rs14.503 trillion. Of the 464 companies active in the session, 193 closed in green, 231 in red and 40 remained unchanged.
Naveed Nadeem, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the stock market exhibited volatility, with the index fluctuating within a large band, primarily influenced by global market trends. He said local equities faced selling pressure amid uncertainty surrounding the upcoming budget and the government’s proposed 2-3 per cent hike in the tax rate on passive income.
Upward momentum was supported by notable gains in PKGP, NATF, MEBL, NBP, and BAHL, which collectively added 201 points to the index. Conversely, losses in SYS, ENGROH, and PPL dragged the index down by a combined 341 points.
The highest increase was recorded in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which rose by Rs2,937.45 to Rs32,311.99 per share, followed by Khyber Textile Mills Limited, which increased by Rs279.07 to Rs3,069.78 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs41.89 to Rs9,919.02 per share; SS Oil Mills Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs41.31 to Rs788.43 per share.
Mubashir Anis Naviwala, an analyst at JS Global, said the selling pressure dragged the index down. “Looking ahead, we expect market pressure to persist in the near term; however, this may present a buying opportunity in select sectors. Investors are advised to accumulate fundamentally strong stocks in the cement, automobile and fertiliser sectors on dips.”
Dewan Cement remained the volume leader with 40.375 million shares, which closed higher by 50 paisas to Rs12.67 per share. Invest Bank, with 31.862 million shares, followed it, which closed higher by 84 paisas to Rs2.31 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included K-Electric Ltd, WorldCall Telecom, Fauji Foods Ltd, Kohinoor Spinning, National Bank XD, Sui South Gas, Maple Leaf and Pervez Ahmed Co.   In the futures market, 314 companies recorded trading, 91 of which increased, 220 decreased and 3 remained unchanged.

Rupee extends gains,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317863-rupee-extends-gains,"KARACHI: The rupee rose for a third consecutive session in the interbank market on Monday due to sluggish dollar demand from importers.The rupee ended at 281.97 per dollar, compared with the previous close of 282.02.
In the open market, the rupee remained stable, trading at 284.4 against the dollar, unchanged from the prior close.Dealers said that the rupee gained slight ground, supported by soft dollar demand for import payments and Eid-related inflows.
With only three trading days remaining before the budget announcement, market players are closely monitoring news and developments related to fiscal policy. The federal budget will be unveiled first, followed by the monetary policy statement. Given these circumstances, the rupee is expected to remain range-bound as investors evaluate incoming data and policy signals. Ongoing attention to budget outcomes and macroeconomic indicators will influence the direction of the rupee in the near term.
In a surprising development, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 3.5 per cent year-on-year in May, above the finance ministry’s prediction of 1.5 per cent to 2.0 per cent.In April, annual inflation decreased to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate in nearly a decade, a significant decline from 11.8 per cent in May 2024 and a record high of nearly 40 per cent a year earlier. The finance ministry’s monthly report said that inflation is projected to rise to between 3.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent in June.

Stocks fall over trade row; oil rises on geopolitical risks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317864-stocks-fall-over-trade-row-oil-rises-on-geopolitical-risks,"LONDON: Oil prices surged Monday over renewed concerns about Russia’s war in Ukraine and relief over OPEC+ production, while stock markets mostly slumped as US-China trade tensions resurfaced.
The dollar was under pressure while Wall Street opened mixed, with the Dow and the broad-based S&P 500 in the red while the tech-heavy Nasdaq rose. European stock markets were down in afternoon deals.US President Donald Trump reignited tensions with China last week when he accused the world’s second-biggest economy of violating a deal that had led both countries to temporarily reduce huge tit-for-tat tariffs.
Beijing rejected the “bogus” US accusations on Monday and accused Washington of introducing “a number of discriminatory restrictive measures” against China since they agreed on a truce last month.
Trump also ramped up tensions with other trade partners, including the European Union, by vowing to double global tariffs on steel and aluminium to 50 per cent from Wednesday.
“Trump’s pledge to double steel and aluminium import tariffs have caused fresh uncertainty, especially with the European Union vowing to retaliate against the measures,” said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.
“Negotiations between the US and China also appear to be in disarray.”The European Union on Saturday said it “strongly regrets” the tariffs move by Trump, warning it “undermines ongoing efforts to reach a negotiated solution” with the US.The EU added it stood “ready” to retaliate.
The two sides are set for talks on the sidelines of an OECD ministerial meeting in Paris on Wednesday.A US trade court ruling against the tariffs last week briefly buoyed the markets, but the decision was frozen pending an appeal and the Trump administration insisted that the levies would not go away.
“Overall, it feels as if investors are wary of adding to their exposure until they get more clarity on trade and tariffs,” said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services firm Trade Nation.
The Hong Kong and Tokyo stock markets both ended with sizeable losses Monday. Shanghai was shut for a Chinese public holiday.Oil prices surged, with the main US contract, WTI, briefing jumping by 5.0 per cent.
The surge came after producers’ grouping OPEC+ agreed on a smaller-than-expected increase in crude production.“Traders had feared that OPEC+ would announce a significantly larger increase in production,” Morrison said.
“Prices were also lifted by the increased military activity between Ukraine and Russia reported over the weekend. In addition, there were reports that the US may impose stricter sanctions on Moscow, and this helped boost prices.”
Ukraine said on Sunday that it hit dozens of strategic Russian bombers parked at airbases thousands of kilometres behind the front line.Traders were also monitoring tensions over Iran’s nuclear programme after Tehran said it would not accept an agreement that deprives it of what it calls “peaceful activities”.

Can conglomerates drive Pakistan’s economic transformation?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317866-can-conglomerates-drive-pakistan-s-economic-transformation,"LAHORE: Conglomerates have the potential to play a transformative role in developing economies, often serving as engines of industrialisation, job creation, innovation, and export expansion. However, in Pakistan, the behaviour of large business groups has diverged from this ideal, with many accused of preserving their dominance through protectionist policies rather than driving growth through innovation.
The strength of conglomerates lies in their ability to mobilise capital at scale, navigate complex markets, and operate across multiple sectors such as manufacturing, banking, energy and textiles. In environments where foreign investment is limited and public institutions are weak, such groups can fill critical investment gaps. Their organisational capacity allows them to adopt new technologies more rapidly than small and medium enterprises, meet international standards, and enter global markets with greater ease -- thus contributing to export diversification.
They also help distribute economic activity across sectors, reducing dependence on any single industry and cushioning the economy from sector-specific shocks. Large business groups can generate substantial employment, provide relatively stable jobs and contribute to workforce development through training and upskilling initiatives. In the absence of strong public infrastructure, some conglomerates have taken on the role of building industrial zones, power plants or logistics networks. At times, they have advocated for reforms that support a more favourable business environment, such as trade liberalisation and improvements in intellectual property rights and financial regulation.
Despite these advantages, Pakistan’s conglomerates have often fallen short of fulfilling such a role. Rather than driving transformation, many have sustained their influence through market protection, resisting reforms and crowding out smaller competitors. The current structure of these business groups has, in some cases, stifled innovation by discouraging new entrants and maintaining monopolistic control over key sectors such as cement, automobiles and fertilisers.
A major concern is the potential for cartelisation and rent-seeking in the absence of effective competition laws. The dominance of conglomerates in specific industries has allowed them to influence prices and restrict access for smaller businesses. Their close ties to policymakers can also result in preferential treatment, tax evasion, or regulatory capture, making it difficult for genuine reformers to implement policies that promote fairness and efficiency.
Furthermore, instead of focusing on high-value exports or technology-intensive industries, many conglomerates remain anchored in low-productivity sectors or protected markets. This limits the country’s ability to move up the global value chain and tap into more lucrative and sustainable export opportunities.
Nonetheless, with the right incentives and regulations, these powerful business groups can still be realigned toward national economic goals. Their scale and resources could support export transformation through integrated value chains in textiles and food processing, increased investment in logistics and cold storage, and the development of globally recognised brands in sectors such as apparel, dairy and processed foods. Achieving this would require a policy framework that supports research and development, provides concessional financing for modernisation, and enforces fair competition to curb monopolistic practices.If properly directed, conglomerates could yet become a force for economic progress rather than an obstacle to it.

"Trump tax bill poses limited benefits, higher costs for lower-income Americans",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317867-trump-tax-bill-poses-limited-benefits-higher-costs-for-lower-income-americans,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s signature tax break on tips promises relatively few upsides for low-income Americans, who face a net loss of income under his massive tax and spending bill in Congress, analysts say.
The new tax break is one of several aimed at helping working-class Americans who are a key bloc in Trump’s political coalition. But experts say it would reach only a fraction of the bartenders, hairdressers and other workers who rely on tips. And those who benefit could see gains outweighed by cuts to healthcare and food assistance.
“If you’re thinking about things that could help low-income workers, ‘no taxes on tips’ would not be high up on my list,” said Martha Gimbel, director of the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Several independent analyses conclude that the bill now before the Senate would effectively transfer money from poor Americans to the rich.The Penn Wharton Budget Model, for example, found it would reduce after-tax income by $1,500 for families earning less than $22,000 per year, and boost income by $104,000 for those earning more than $5.2 million. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reached a similar conclusion.
Still, the idea of making tipped income tax-free has drawn wide support since Trump first floated it last year at a campaign stop in Nevada, a swing state with a large hospitality industry.
The bill that passed the House of Representatives last month allows workers earning up to $160,000 a year to deduct tips from their gross income until 2029, though tips would remain subject to Social Security and Medicare taxes.
House Republicans say the bill would provide the typical family with a $1,300 tax cut and that business tax breaks would lead to higher wages for workers.
“Permanently lower tax rates and a doubled standard deduction, combined with President Trump's no tax on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, will help workers afford the roof over their head, food for their families, and help build their financial security and wealth,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican, said in a recent statement.
Senate Republicans are likely to seek considerable changes to the bill, which also would make Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent and implement other top priorities, like a crackdown on immigration.
MANY WOULDN’T QUALIFY
But the deduction for tip income would not help the 37 per cent of tipped workers who already earn too little to pay any income tax, according to the Yale Budget Lab. Tipped employees account for only about 2.5 per cent of all US workers.
The tax break would cost the US government nearly $40 billion in lost revenue through 2028, according to the congressional Joint Tax Committee.
Other benefits for working families face similar limits, including deductions on overtime pay and interest on auto loans. In each case, the greatest benefits accrue to people with higher incomes.
“All of those will only benefit someone if they have enough income that they are paying a positive tax liability,” said Brandon DeBot, policy director at New York University’s Tax Law Centre.
The new tax breaks would be outweighed by higher costs from cuts to social safety-net programs and rising debt levels.At least 8.7 million lower-income Americans would lose health insurance coverage from new restrictions to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, according to CBO.
Republicans have also added new restrictions to two bulwarks of support for low-income families: the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit.The legislation would temporarily increase the $2,000 child tax credit to $2,500 through 2028 and adjust it for inflation after that.
But it contains a new requirement that parents provide Social Security numbers to qualify. That would exclude 4.5 million eligible children, according to the nonpartisan Centre for Migration Studies.
Families would also have to meet tighter standards to qualify for the earned income tax credit, a major anti-poverty programme that reached 23 million tax filers in 2022.And analysts warn that cuts to Internal Revenue Service funding and staff would leave the tax agency less able to help lower-income people navigate the new restrictions.
The legislation would add $3.8 trillion to the national debt, which now stands at $36.2 trillion, according to CBO.Ultimately, the cost would weigh most heavily on poor Americans, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, which estimated that low-income households in the future would see a lifetime loss of $8,500 due to a weaker safety net and higher debt service. The model found that some high-income households would see a lifetime gain of $17,800.“You’re inheriting this higher debt, this higher burden. Somebody has to pay for it,” said the budget model’s director, Kent Smetters.

EU says it will make strong case for US tariff cuts this week,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317868-eu-says-it-will-make-strong-case-for-us-tariff-cuts-this-week,"BRUSSELS: The European Commission said on Monday it would make a strong case this week for the US to reduce or eliminate tariffs even after US President Donald Trump said he would double import duties on steel and aluminium to 50 per cent.
European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic will meet US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer at an OECD gathering in Paris on Wednesday, while Commission technical teams will be in discussions with counterparts in Washington this week.
The Commission, which oversees trade policy for the 27-nation EU, said it was prioritising negotiations to resolve the conflict.“We don’t want to go down the route of tariffs. Rather than have them increase, we want them to decrease and where possible eliminate them,” a Commission spokesperson told a press conference on Monday.
“That remains the case, that remains our priority. We will be making that case strongly both at technical level and at political level this week.”The EU has said it strongly regrets the planned doubling of steel tariffs.
The EU currently faces 25 per cent tariffs on steel and cars and for Trump and “reciprocal” tariffs on most EU goods, which were provisionally set at 20 per cent for the EU but is being held at 10 per cent during a 90-day pause until July.
The EU imposed, but immediately suspended, a first set of counter tariffs on 21 billion euros ($24 billion) of annual US imports package in response to US metals duties.It is also weighing a response to the US car and broader tariffs that would hit up to 95 billion euros of US imports.The Commission said that, in the absence of a mutually acceptable solution, these countermeasures would take effect automatically on July 14, or earlier if circumstances require.

"Tobacco industry accused of misleading govt, IMF for tax relief",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317869-tobacco-industry-accused-of-misleading-govt-imf-for-tax-relief,"KARACHI: The tobacco industry is facing criticism for allegedly manipulating data to pressure the government and IMF into reducing taxes, including a proposal to cut the Federal Excise Duty (FED) from Rs5,050 to Rs3,800 per 1,000 sticks, potentially making cigarettes cheaper and more accessible.
With the 2025-26 budget nearing, industry representatives argue that current tax targets are unachievable under the existing FED structure and claim that lower taxes would boost consumption and increase revenue, a claim public finance experts have called “flawed and deceptive”.
Adding to the controversy is the tobacco industry’s long-standing tactic of inflating the scale of illicit cigarette trade in Pakistan. A survey by the Institute for Public Opinion Research (IPOR), claimed that 54 per cent of cigarette brands sold in Pakistan are illicit, causing an annual loss of Rs300 billion in tax revenue.
While the industry projects Rs245 billion in tax collection by June 30, 2025, official data shows Rs240 billion has already been collected by May 15, with year-end estimates nearing Rs285 billion.
The industry also claims 54 per cent of cigarette brands in Pakistan are illicit, causing a Rs300 billion annual tax loss. However, a 2025 study by the Social Policy and Development Centre (SPDC) found that 76 per cent of cigarette sales come from the top 20 brands, 14 of which are registered with the FBR. According to SPDC, locally produced illicit cigarettes account for 14 per cent of the market and smuggled brands 21 per cent, making the actual illicit share closer to 35 per cent.
“Availability is not the same as consumption,” said Asif Iqbal, MD of SPDC, dismissing the industry’s inflated claims. He added, “These narratives are aimed at securing tax relief. Public policy should be based on facts, not industry lobbying. The focus must be on enforcement and closing regulatory gaps.”

"Gauff returns to French Open quarters, vows to ‘keep fighting’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317887-gauff-returns-to-french-open-quarters-vows-to-keep-fighting,"PARIS: Coco Gauff reached a fifth successive French Open quarter-final on Monday as the world number two brushed Russian 20th seed Ekaterina Alexandrova aside 6-0, 7-5.
Gauff raced through the opening set backed by three breaks of serve. Alexandrova put up more of a fight in the second set but Gauff eventually closed out victory in 82 minutes. “It feels great to be back in the quarters here, and really happy with how I played today and hopefully can keep going,” said Gauff.
The 21-year-old Gauff will play reigning Australian Open champion Madison Keys in an all-American quarter-final on Wednesday. Gauff´s 15 wins on clay this year are tied for the most alongside Elina Svitolina, another player still in the running at Roland Garros.
Former US Open champion Gauff puts her success on the surface down to her unwavering belief that she can turn a match in her favour no matter the score. She is hoping to make it third time lucky at the French Open after losing in the final in Madrid and Rome last month.
“I have learned in the last two tournaments, especially in Rome and Madrid, losing the opening set in the first round of both of those tournaments and making the final, it just shows you have to keep fighting for every match and keep fighting for every point,” said Gauff.
“Because anything can happen in a tournament. “So I think if I want to be more consistent on tour, I think that´s something I have to continue to do.” Gauff made her first Grand Slam final in Paris in 2022 at the age of just 18.
She was beaten comfortably by Iga Swiatek on that occasion but feels she is peaking at the right time again in her quest for a second major title. Swiatek has also knocked Gauff out each of the past two years at Roland Garros; in the quarter-finals in 2023 and then in the semi-finals a year ago.
“I think I´m less nervous going into matches, for sure, and knowing just the ups and downs of tennis and of a tennis match,” said Gauff. “I still feel the years here I feel like I get better with each match. I felt like that was something that I did in ´22 and last year as well, and something I´m doing here right now. “Yeah, I think if I can keep just making those details a little bit better, hopefully I can do even better than I did last year.”

Mixed fortunes witnessed in Lahore races,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317889-mixed-fortunes-witnessed-in-lahore-races,"LAHORE: The 40th Day Winter Meeting at the Lahore Race Club late Sunday evening delivered a balanced day of racing, with both favourites and underdogs sharing the spoils across six competitive events.
The day’s proceedings began with an upset as Rashid Prince galloped to a surprise win in the opening Shah Kot Plate, Division VI & VII. I Shall Lead, not widely backed, stunned punters by securing second place, while Dubai Love completed the surprises by finishing third.
In the second race, Little Master, who entered as the front-running favourite, dominated proceedings from start to finish. However, the places told a different story, with Lucky Macs claiming second and Thunder Man (KRC) securing third — both surprising many with their performances.
The third race turned into a showcase for outsiders. Qalandar, entered as a fluke, outclassed the competition to grab the win. Luckvir emerged as the unexpected runner-up, and Thunder Boy (KRC) — not listed among the top choices — earned third place, rounding off a race full of surprises.
Drama unfolded in the fourth race where the finish resulted in a dead heat between Elizabeth and Samore City — both considered long shots. Son of Sultan, a more familiar name to racegoers, came in third, just behind the unlikely winners.
The fifth race saw some stability return as the highly-favoured Luna Afzaal justified expectations with a commanding victory. However, Zuza, entered as a fluke, shocked by finishing second, while Wynx, who had been tipped for a top-two finish, could only manage third. The final race wrapped up the evening with Mr. Asia, a crowd favourite, living up to his billing with a well-timed burst to win. The places again saw surprises with Noon Princess and Leo Star finishing second and third respectively, both outperforming expectations.

Qatar table tennis says ‘prepared to escalate’ after chaotic vote,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317890-qatar-table-tennis-says-prepared-to-escalate-after-chaotic-vote,"DOHA: Qatar´s table tennis association has warned of possible legal action as it disputes the result of a stormy leadership election for the Olympic sport´s world governing body in Doha.
The Qatari association, whose president Khalil Al-Mohannadi narrowly failed to dislodge Sweden´s Petra Soerling as head of the International Table Tennis Federation, said it was “prepared to escalate” the matter.
Tuesday´s 104-102 vote to Soerling ended in such acrimony that the ITTF´s annual general meeting was suspended. The world body said the assembly was “disrupted by outsiders” after the election result was announced.
A Qatar Table Tennis Association spokesperson, in comments sent to AFP on Monday, said it was “actively reviewing all legal and procedural options... We believe there are sufficient grounds to question the validity of the election process”.
“We are also consulting with legal experts to ensure that, if necessary, we are prepared to escalate the matter through appropriate international sports arbitration channels,” the spokesperson said.
“The outcome of the election cannot be considered settled until all procedural questions have been independently reviewed,” the spokesperson added. On Thursday, the ITTF said it would investigate the disturbance by people, believed to be Mohannadi supporters, who “were neither delegates from member associations, nor members of the executive board, council, committees, or invited guests”.
It said the election was conducted “in strict accordance with the ITTF constitution and statutes” and that it “rejects the misconceived statement by some member associations to recognise any other result”.
After Tuesday´s vote, Soerling told Swedish daily newspaper Dagens Nyheter she felt unsafe and left the meeting with the help of staff from the Swedish embassy in Doha. The QTTA spokesperson said “at no point was her safety compromised”, while acknowledging that Soerling “may have felt uncomfortable, as many of us did in what was an emotionally charged and unexpected outcome”.
“We note that in highly politicised environments, it can sometimes benefit certain individuals to sensationalise events,” the spokesperson said, speculating that Soerling may have been “misquoted or misinterpreted”.

Women’s Emerging Asia Cup postponed due to adverse weather,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317891-women-s-emerging-asia-cup-postponed-due-to-adverse-weather,"LAHORE: The Asian Cricket Council (ACC) has announced the postponement of the Women’s Emerging Asia Cup 2025, which was scheduled to start on June 6 in Sri Lanka.
The decision was made following a formal request from Sri Lanka Cricket, citing concerns over adverse weather conditions and the spread of mosquito-borne chikungunya in the region. The ACC confirmed that new dates for the tournament would be announced soon, ensuring the safety and well-being of all participating teams, stated a message of ACC president Mohsin Naqvi.
The Women’s Emerging Asia Cup serves as a crucial platform for nurturing young cricketing talent across Asia, providing a pathway for future stars in the sport. The postponement, however, raises questions about the broader challenges in organising international women’s cricket events.

Man City’s Kovacic out of Club World Cup after surgery,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317892-man-city-s-kovacic-out-of-club-world-cup-after-surgery,"LONDON: Mateo Kovacic has undergone surgery on an Achilles injury and will miss the FIFA Club World Cup, Manchester City announced on Monday.
The Croatian midfielder, 31, played 42 games for the Premier League club during the recently concluded season, scoring seven goals. “Mateo will spend the summer rehabilitating from the operation and everyone at the club wishes him a speedy recovery,” City said in a statement. Fellow midfielder Rodri, who won the Ballon d´Or in 2024, made his return to action on May 20 after eight months out with a knee injury. But City manager Pep Guardiola has warned he will have to be managed carefully.
Guardiola´s team endured a disappointing 2024/25 campaign, finishing third in the Premier League and failing to win a trophy for the first time in eight years. The month-long tournament starts on June 14, with City opening their campaign against Moroccan club Wydad Casablanca in Philadelphia four days later.

Three things we learned from the Spanish Grand Prix,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317893-three-things-we-learned-from-the-spanish-grand-prix,"BARCELONA: Oscar Piastri has the composure and the talent, not to mention the car, to land Australia´s first Formula One drivers´ world championship in 45 years - leaving his rivals floundering in pursuit.
Only McLaren team-mate Lando Norris appears to have the package to deliver a sustained challenge, but he, like four-time champion Max Vestappen, cannot match the 24-year-old Melburnian´s consistency or cool under pressure.
AFP Sport looks at three things we learned from Sunday´s incident-filled race at a sizzling Circuit de Catalunya: Piastri leads McLaren surge After being beaten by Norris in Monaco, Piastri returned to his best with a demonstration of concentration, composure and technical excellence.
His fifth win of the season, in nine races, lifted him 10 points ahead of the 25-year-old Briton, who has won twice, and meant he had scored as many wins already this season as Alan Jones did for Williams on his way to the title in 1980.
His fellow Melburnian, now 78, was 34 when he won the championship with a tough, no-nonsense and hard-fighting approach to his racing - not unlike aspects of Red Bull´s Vestappen - and total commitment.
Jones, an admirer of Piastri´s “old head on young shoulders”, last month suggested Norris lacked the mental toughness required to beat his team-mate and Verstappen´s aggression, praising his compatriot as having “the mental strength not to put up with that crap”. It seemed Norris´s perfect weekend in Monte Carlo had rebuffed Jones´ comments and restored his mojo, but in Spain the studious Piastri was on top again in a tight contest, overshadowed by Verstappen´s red mist racing in the final laps. “This weekend´s been exactly the kind of weekend I was looking for,” said Piastri, whose two-tenths advantage for pole was the biggest this year.
Verstappen boils over While Piastri studied and progressed, Verstappen fell into old habits that revealed he struggles with a temper as quick as his car. His clashes with Charles Leclerc´s Ferrari and George Russell´s Mercedes came as a red mist engulfed him in the final laps after a Safety Car intervention.
His frustration with Red Bull´s decision to put him on hard tyres for the final five-laps sprint led to both collisions, but only the ramming of Russell on lap 64 of 66 was intentional.
He was universally condemned with 2016 champion Nico Rosberg suggesting he should have been ´black flagged´ and disqualified. His Red Bull team chief Christian Horner labelled Rosberg a “sensationalist” but Verstappen´s ´mea culpa´ on Instagram on Monday, having declined to comment after the race, was more honest.
“Our tyre choice to the end and some moves after the safety car restart fuelled my frustration, leading to a move that was not right and shouldn´t have happened,” he conceded. However, as Russell pointed out, he lost points for Red Bull and added three to the eight on his superlicence, to leave him within one point of a ban.
Toothless front wing ruling The weekend began amid speculation that a new rule restricting flexibility of the cars´ front wings might be a ´game-changer´ but it had little or no effect.
Seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, who finished a disgruntled sixth for Ferrari, extending a run of poor races, summed up when he said it was “a waste of everyone´s money - it´s changed nothing. Everyone´s wings still bend... They should have given it to charity.”

PHF announces power-packed squad for Nations Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317894-phf-announces-power-packed-squad-for-nations-cup,"ISLAMABAD: With eyes firmly set on international glory and a coveted spot in the prestigious FIH Pro League, the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has unveiled a formidable 20-member squad for the FIH Nations Cup, scheduled to kick off on June 15 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
The Greenshirts will depart for Malaysia on June 8, with the hopes and aspirations of a nation resting on their shoulders. As Pakistan hockey continues its climb back to the international elite, all eyes will be on Kuala Lumpur as this determined squad battles to reclaim the glory of yesteryears.
The squad, a strategic blend of experienced campaigners and promising new talent, is geared up to face off against some of the world’s strongest teams. This tournament not only offers a platform for fierce competition but also serves as a direct qualification pathway to the elite FIH Pro League -- a golden opportunity Pakistan are determined to seize.
The selection saw five changes making their way into the national side from the side that won bronze medal in the Champions Trophy held in China a few months back. Some new comers are also there, a move reflecting PHF’s focus on talent development and long-term planning.
The changes include Mohammad Abdullah, Abdul Mannan, Junaid Manzoor, Mohibullah, and Rana Abdul Waleed each bringing a unique flair and dynamism to the squad.
PHF Secretary Rana Mujahid announced the squad in the presence of PHF President Tariq Bugti and Head Coach Tahir Zaman, emphasizing that the selection was based purely on merit and rigorous performance evaluation during the training camp.
“Following the weeks of intense training and assessments, the head coach, in consultation with the team management, finalized the squad purely on the basis of players’ performances,” he stated.
Responding to questions about the absence of a formal selection committee, Mujahid clarified: “Just as we have empowered foreign coaches in the past to make key decisions, we have followed a similar approach with Tahir Zaman, who is an FIH High-Performance Coach. The team management comprising Zeeshan Ashraf and Mohammad Usman has been given full authority to lead this important assignment.”
Acknowledging the logistical and financial hurdles involved in participating in such international tournaments, PHF extended heartfelt thanks to the Ministry for Inter-Provincial Coordination, Secretary Mohyuddin Wani, and Pakistan Sports Board Director General Yasir Peerzada for their unwavering support, especially in securing air travel arrangements.
“It’s not easy in today’s economic climate to send a team abroad,” Mujahid added. “In addition to flights, PHF is bearing costs for hotel stays and daily allowances each player receives a substantial per diem while on tour. These efforts are only possible with the continued backing of our sponsors and partners.”
PTCL and other sponsors were also appreciated for stepping up to support national hockey, with PHF reiterating its commitment to expanding funding and resources for the sport at all levels.
PHF President Tariq Bugti also revealed that efforts are underway to bring a major international hockey event to Pakistan next year. “We are actively in contact with the FIH, pushing for hosting rights to a global tournament. The revival of international hockey on home soil remains a top priority.”
Meanwhile, Head Coach Tahir Zaman expressed confidence in the squad’s readiness and ambitions. “This team has undergone intense preparation and is capable of challenging the very best. Our mission is clear: win the Nations Cup and secure our place in the Pro League. The boys are motivated and fully prepared.”
Squad: Goalkeepers: Muneebur Rehman, Abdullah Ishtaq. Outfield players: Ammad Butt (Captain), Mohammad Abdullah, Sufyan Khan, Abdul Mannan, Ammad Anjum, Arshad Liaquat, Moin Shakil, Zakria Hayat, Ghazanfar Ali, Salman Razzak, Junaid Manzoor, Hanan Shahid, Rana Waheed, Afraz Khan, Abdul Rehman, Ahmad Nadeem, Mohibullah, Rana Waleed.
Team officials: Tahir Zaman (Head Coach), Mohammad Usman (Manager), Zeeshan Ashraf (Coach), Nadeem Khan Lodhi (Video Analyst), Aslam (Physio).
Tournament Fixtures: 	     June 15 – vs Malaysia.
June 16 – vs Japan.
June 18 – vs New Zealand.
June 20 – Semi-Finals.
June 21 – Final.

Australia’s Glenn ‘Big Show’ Maxwell calls time on ODIs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317895-australia-s-glenn-big-show-maxwell-calls-time-on-odis,"SYDNEY: Explosive Australian batsman Glenn Maxwell called time on his one-day international career Monday, but will continue in Twenty20 cricket with his eye on next year´s World Cup.
The 36-year-old, who played 149 ODIs, blasting 3,990 runs, said he was starting to feel the physical toll of the 50-over game. “I felt like I was letting the team down a little bit with how my body was reacting to the conditions,” said Maxwell, who was nicknamed “Big Show” for his all-action entertaining style of play.
“I had a good chat with (chair of selectors) George Bailey and I asked him what his thoughts were going forward. “We talked about the 2027 (50-over) World Cup and I said to him: ´I don´t think I am going to make that, it´s time to start planning for people in my position to have a crack at it and make the position their own´.
“I didn´t want to just hold on for a couple of series and almost play for selfish reasons.” His last game was Australia´s Champions Trophy semi-final defeat to India in early March, after which fellow veteran Steve Smith also quit the 50-over format.
The mercurial Maxwell´s strike rate of 126.70 is the second highest in ODI cricket where he has crunched four hundreds and 23 half-centuries. His rate of scoring is second only to West Indian heavy hitter Andre Russell, and Maxwell has also taken 77 wickets with his off-spin.
Perhaps his most memorable innings was at the 2023 World Cup against Afghanistan in Mumbai, when he was batting with Australia reeling at 91-7, chasing 293 to win. In a high-pressure situation and battling severe cramp in searing heat, Maxwell took control, slamming 201 from just 128 balls to take his team to victory.
He scored 179 of those runs in an unbroken 202 partnership with Pat Cummins, who contributed just 12 after coming at number nine. Australia went on to win the tournament, beating favourites India in the final at Ahmedabad.
Maxwell was also part of the Australia team that lifted the 2015 ODI World Cup. “Glenn will be known as one of the one-day game´s most dynamic players, who had key roles in two ODI World Cup victories,” said Bailey. “His level of natural talent and skill is remarkable. His energy in the field, under-rated ability with the ball and longevity has been superb.
“What else stands out is his passion for and commitment to playing for Australia. “Fortunately, he still has much to offer Australia in the T20 format. All things going well, he will be pivotal in the next 12 months as we build toward the World Cup early next year.”

South Africa’s Klaasen retires from international cricket,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317896-south-africa-s-klaasen-retires-from-international-cricket,"JOHANNESBURG: South African batsman-wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen announced on Monday that he was retiring from international cricket.
The big-hitting Klaasen, 33, earned a reputation as one of the most destructive batsmen in white-ball cricket. “Playing for the Proteas gave me the opportunity to meet great people who changed my life,” Klaasen said in a statement issued by Cricket South Africa.
Klaasen scored 2141 runs at an average of 43.69 in 60 one-day internationals, maintaining a strike rate of 117.05. His highest score of 174 was made off 83 balls against Australia at Centurion in 2023.
He scored 1000 runs at a strike rate of 141.84 in 58 Twenty20 internationals. He also played in four Test matches before he retired from red-ball cricket in 2024. His ability to score quickly made him a sought-after player in franchise competitions around the world.
He was signed by Indian Premier League team Sunrisers Hyderabad for a record 23 crore (US$2.69-million) for the 2025 season. He is expected to continue to be available for franchise cricket. Enoch Nkwe, South Africa´s director national teams, described Klaasen as “a true match-winner for South Africa. He was capable of changing the course of a game in a matter of overs.”
Klaasen was not among the players awarded a Cricket South Africa contract in April and the governing body said at the time that discussions regarding his future were ongoing. South African coach Shukri Conrad said after being appointed white-ball coach last month in addition to his role as Test coach, that he expected players to prioritise playing for South Africa above T20 leagues.

“This isn’t just about cricket; it’s about honouring the legacy of the game and the legends who gave their best years to it. The T20 format brings a whole new dimension of excitement, and Karachi is ready to welcome the world.” “The groundwork for a world-class event is already well underway,” Fawad elaborated. “We’ve been holding extensive planning sessions with security, logistics, and hospitality partners.

Bangladesh launches fresh reform bid,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317979-bangladesh-launches-fresh-reform-bid,"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s caretaker government launched a fresh bid on Monday to seek agreement between rival political parties on critical democratic reforms after a mass uprising last year.
The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted by a student-led revolt in August 2024, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
The National Consensus Commission is headed by Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held.
“Let’s not miss this opportunity”, Yunus said in a speech at the opening as a second round of meetings began. “The remaining differences can be narrowed”. Last month the consensus commission said political parties had failed to reach agreement.
Yunus has previously said he inherited a “completely broken down” system of public administration, and said it required a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to authoritarian rule.
He set up six commissions to do that work, overseen by the consensus commission, which he heads. On May 26, Ali Riaz, the commission’s vice president, said that despite marathon efforts -- stretching over 45 sessions with 38 political parties and alliances -- they had not reached a deal in the first round.
Several political parties, especially the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) have demanded an election date be set. Salahuddin Ahmed, a senior BNP leader, last week said there was growing impatience at the pace of progress made by the reform commission.
“How many times do they want to stage the drama of reforms?” he said. “A first launch, followed by a second... This is nothing but dancing with bananas”. Contentious issues include whether a prime minister can serve more than two terms, and the process for selecting the president.
Hasina’s rule saw widespread human rights abuses, and her government was accused of politicising courts and the civil service, as well as staging lopsided elections to dismantle democratic checks. Yunus has said polls could be held as early as December but that holding them later -- with the deadline of June 2026 -- would give the government more time for reform.

Iran says no nuclear deal if deprived of ‘peaceful activities’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317980-iran-says-no-nuclear-deal-if-deprived-of-peaceful-activities,"CAIRO: Iran said Monday it will not accept a nuclear agreement that deprives it of what it called “peaceful activities”, a reference to uranium enrichment, as it pressed the United States for guarantees it would drop sanctions.
Uranium enrichment has remained a key point of contention between the foes in talks to seal a nuclear deal, ongoing since April, with Iran defending what it says is its pursuit of a civil nuclear programme but with the US side calling it a “red line”.
Speaking in Cairo, where he met the UN nuclear watchdog’s chief Rafael Grossi, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said: “If the goal is to deprive Iran of its peaceful activities, then certainly no agreement will be reached.”
Araghchi insisted that Iran has “nothing to hide” on its nuclear programme. “Iran has a peaceful nuclear programme... we are prepared to provide this assurance to any party or entity,” he said.
The remarks came after Grossi of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Monday called for more transparency from Iran following a leaked report that showed Tehran had stepped up uranium enrichment.
The IAEA report showed that Iran has ramped up production of uranium enriched up to 60 percent -- close to the roughly 90 percent level needed for atomic weapons. “There is a need for more transparency -- this is very, very clear -- in Iran, and nothing will bring us to this confidence (besides) full explanations of a number of activities,” Grossi said ahead of meeting Araghchi.
Grossi added that some of the report’s findings “may be uncomfortable for some, and we are... used to being criticised”. Iran has rejected the report, warning it would retaliate if European powers that have threatened to reimpose nuclear sanctions “exploit” it.
“Some countries are trying to abuse this agency to pave the way for escalation with Iran. I hope that this agency does not fall into this trap,” Araghchi said of the IAEA. Iran meanwhile pushed for the United States to drop sanctions that have crippled its economy as a condition for a nuclear agreement with President Donald Trump’s administration.
Araghchi said on Saturday that he had received “elements” of a US proposal for a nuclear deal following five rounds of talks mediated by Oman. Both Araghchi and Grossi met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who praised the US-Iran talks and called for “de-escalation in order to prevent a slide into a full-fledged regional war”.
On Monday, Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei told a news conference: “We want to guarantee that the sanctions are effectively lifted.” “So far, the American side has not wanted to clarify this issue,” he said.
The US envoy in the nuclear talks said last month that Trump’s administration would oppose any Iranian enrichment. “An enrichment programme can never exist in the state of Iran ever again. That’s our red line. No enrichment,” Steve Witkoff told Breitbart News.
Following a phone call with Witkoff the day before about the ongoing nuclear talks, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty urged a peaceful solution and a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East, saying in Monday’s press conference that “the region is already experiencing enough problems and crises”.
He warned that military confrontation would create “a state of chaos from which no one will be spared”. Iran has vowed to keep enriching uranium “with or without a deal” on its nuclear programme.
The United States has sent Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal that the White House called “acceptable” and in Tehran’s “best interest” to accept, US media reported on Saturday. The New York Times, citing officials familiar with the diplomatic exchanges, said the proposal calls on Iran to stop all enrichment and suggests creating a regional grouping to produce nuclear power.

Gunmen kill 25 in restive central Nigeria state,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317982-gunmen-kill-25-in-restive-central-nigeria-state,"JOS, Nigeria: Gunmen killed 25 people in two attacks across north-central Nigeria’s Benue state over the weekend, local authorities told AFP Monday, the latest violence in a region known for deadly land disputes and reprisals.
Attackers killed 14 people on Sunday in the community of Ankpali, said Adam Ochega, chairman of the Apa local government council, warning that “there are still some threats here and there”. Muslim ethnic Fulani nomadic herders have long clashed with settled farmers, many of whom are Christian, in Benue over access to land and resources.
In a recent report, Amnesty International tallied 6,896 people killed over the last two years in Benue, part of Nigeria’s so-called Middle Belt, a mixed-religious region where such disputes often take on a sectarian dimension. A police spokeswoman confirmed the attack but did not provide a toll.
Contacted by telephone, resident Ajija Moses said the attackers stormed the community around 6:00 pm, blaming armed Fulani men who were “shooting sporadically”. In a similar attack Sunday evening on Naka village, of Gwer West local government area, 11 people were killed by what authorities said were suspected Fulani militias.

"Trump, Xi will ‘likely’ talk this week: White House",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317983-trump-xi-will-likely-talk-this-week-white-house,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping will likely hold a long-awaited call later this week, the White House said Monday, as trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies ratchet back up.
Trump reignited strains with China last week when he accused the world’s second-biggest economy of violating a deal that had led both countries to temporarily reduce huge tit-for-tat tariffs.
“The two leaders will likely talk this week,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters outside the West Wing when asked whether Trump and Xi would speak. Trump and Xi have yet to have any confirmed contact more than five months since the Republican returned to power, despite frequent claims by the US president that a call is imminent.
Trump even said in a Time Magazine interview in April that Xi had called him -- but Beijing insisted that there had been no call recently. Stock markets around the world mostly slid on Monday as the US-China tensions resurfaced.
Trump in early April introduced sweeping worldwide tariffs that targeted China most heavily of all, accusing other countries of “ripping off” the United States and running trade imbalances. Beijing and Washington last month agreed to slash staggeringly high tariffs on each other for 90 days after talks between top officials in Geneva.
But Trump and top US officials Washington officials last week accused China of violating the deal, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick saying Beijing was “slow-rolling” the agreement in comments to Fox News Sunday. Beijing rejected those “bogus” US claims on Monday, and accused Washington of introducing “a number of discriminatory restrictive measures.”
Trump has separately ramped up tensions with other trade partners, including the European Union, by vowing to double global tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50 percent from Wednesday.

Snakes on a plane: Indian smuggler caught with venomous vipers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317985-snakes-on-a-plane-indian-smuggler-caught-with-venomous-vipers,"MUMBAI: A passenger smuggling dozens of venomous vipers was stopped after flying into the financial capital Mumbai from Thailand, Indian customs officials said.
The snakes, which included 44 Indonesian pit vipers, were “concealed in checked-in baggage”, Mumbai Customs said in a statement late Sunday. “An Indian national arriving from Thailand was arrested,” it added.
The passenger, details of whom were not released, also had three Spider-tailed horned vipers -- which are venomous, but usually only target small prey such as birds -- as well as five Asian leaf turtles.
Mumbai Customs issued photographs of the seized snakes, including blue and yellow reptiles squirming in a bucket. The snakes are a relatively unusual seizure in Mumbai, with customs officers more regularly posting pictures of hauls of smuggled gold, cash, cannabis or pills of suspected cocaine swallowed by passengers.
However, in February, customs officials at Mumbai airport also stopped a smuggler with five Siamang gibbons, a small ape native to the forests of Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.

Judge convicts man who burned Quran in London,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317986-judge-convicts-man-who-burned-quran-in-london,"LONDON: A Turkish-born man who burned a Quranin London was on Monday found guilty of a religiously aggravated public order offence, in a case taken up by free-speech campaigners.
Hamit Coskun, 50, shouted “Islam is religion of terrorism” and “Quran is burning” as he set the book alight outside the Turkish consulate in London last February 13. District Judge John McGarva at London’s Westminster Magistrates’ Court found Coskun guilty of using disorderly behaviour “within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress”.
He was motivated by “hostility towards members of a religious group, namely followers of Islam”, said McGarva, who issued Coskun a £240 ($325) fine, with a statutory surcharge of £96.
“Your actions in burning the Quran where you did were highly provocative, and your actions were accompanied by bad language in some cases directed toward the religion and were motivated at least in part by hatred of followers of the religion,” said the judge.
State prosecutors insisted Coskun was not being prosecuted for burning the book. “He is being prosecuted for his disorderly behaviour in public,” said Philip McGhee, for the Crown Prosecution Service.
A passerby filmed the incident, which also showed a man, allegedly holding a knife or bladed item, approaching Coskun and appearing to slash out at him, the court heard. Coskun, an atheist who is currently claiming asylum in the UK, posted on social media that he was protesting against the “Islamist government” of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
His legal fees are being paid by the Free Speech Union (FSU) and the National Secular Society, which argued he was essentially being prosecuted for blasphemy, despite Britain’s free-speech guarantees. The FSU called the verdict “deeply disappointing” on its X account.

Flash floods and landslides in the annual monsoon rains have killed at least 30 people in India’s northeast states in the past week.

The army said in a statement that the “massive landslide, triggered by heavy rains, struck an army camp” around dusk on Sunday.

EU chief holds talks with US Republican leading Russia sanctions push,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317988-eu-chief-holds-talks-with-us-republican-leading-russia-sanctions-push,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: EU chief Ursula von der Leyen met Monday with Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator leading a push for tough new US sanctions on Russia, to discuss how to jointly increase the pressure on Moscow.
The pair met in Berlin to “discuss EU-US coordination on sanctions in response to Russia´s ongoing war of aggression against Ukraine”, said a European Commission statement issued after the meeting.
“Pressure works, as the Kremlin understands nothing else,” it said. “This is why the president welcomed that Senator Graham committed to ramping up pressure on Russia and moving ahead with the bill in (the US) Senate next week,” the statement added.
The Republican senator has put forward a proposal that could see 500-percent tariffs slapped on countries buying oil from Russia -- drawing interest from some in Europe as a potential model for action.
As Russia stalls on peace efforts, the European Union is readying an 18th round of sanctions against Russia -- though diplomats admit it is becoming increasingly difficult to agree on new areas to hit Moscow.
The new EU measures would notably target the defunct Baltic Sea gas pipelines Nord Stream 1 and 2, to pre-empt any attempt to bring them back online. They would also seek to list more shadow fleet vessels, lower the price cap set on Russian oil, and slap additional measures on Russia´s financial sector.
“These steps, taken together with US measures, would sharply increase the joint impact of our sanctions,” von der Leyen said in the statement. “Combined with actions targeting Russia´s shadow fleet limiting Russia´s ability to transport its oil, it´s an effective measure to dry up the Kremlin´s resources to wage the war.” The meeting between Graham and von der Leyen comes as negotiators from Ukraine and Russia are meeting in Turkey for a fresh round of talks.

UK to build attack subs as part of major defence review,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317989-uk-to-build-attack-subs-as-part-of-major-defence-review,"GLASGOW: Britain announced it will build 12 new attack submarines as it launched a major defence review Monday to move the country to “war-fighting readiness” in the face of “Russian aggression” and the changing nature of conflict.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned that “the threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,” as he launched the review in Glasgow.
“We face war in Europe, new nuclear risks, daily cyber-attacks, growing Russian aggression in our waters, menacing our skies,” he added. The Strategic Defence Review, which assesses threats facing the UK and makes recommendations, said that Britain is entering “a new era of threat”.
As a result, Starmer said his government aimed to deliver three “fundamental changes”. “First, we are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces,” he said.
“Every part of society, every citizen of this country, has a role to play, because we have to recognise that things have changed in the world of today. The front-line, if you like, is here,” he added.
Secondly, the prime minister insisted that UK defence policy will “always be NATO first”, and finally that the UK “will innovate and accelerate innovation at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow.”
The UK has been racing to rearm in the face of the threat from Russia and fears that US President Donald Trump will no longer help protect Europe. Starmer said it would serve as “a blueprint for strength and security for decades to come”, taking into account the increasing use of drones and artificial intelligence on the battlefield.
His government pledged in February to lift defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027 in the “largest sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the Cold War”.
And despite budget constraints, it aims for spending to rise to three percent in the next parliamentary term, due in 2029. The Labour government has said it will cut UK overseas aid to help fund the spending.
Based on the recommendations of the review, which was led by former NATO secretary general George Robertson, the government said Sunday that it would boost stockpiles and weapons production capacity, which could be scaled up if needed.
This includes Â£1.5 billion ($2 billion) for building “at least six munitions and energetics factories”, procuring 7,000 domestically built long-range weapons, and spending Â£6 billion on munitions over the current parliamentary term.
The government also said late Sunday that it would build up to 12 new attack submarines as part of its AUKUS military alliance with Australia and the United States. Currently the UK is set to operate seven nuclear-powered Astute Class attack submarines, which will be replaced by the 12 AUKUS submarines from the late 2030s.
The defence ministry also said it would invest Â£15 billion in its nuclear warhead programme and last week pledged Â£1 billion for the creation of a “cyber command” to help on the battlefield.
The last such defence review was commissioned in 2021 by the previous Conservative government, and was revised in 2023 after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While launching the new review, Robertson said it would tackle threats from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea, calling them a “deadly quartet”.
But in an op-ed article for The Sun newspaper, Starmer did not mention China, while warning that “The Kremlin is working hand in hand with its cronies in Iran and North Korea.” The softer rhetoric on China is in line with the Labour government’s efforts to thaw relations with Beijing, which reached new lows under former prime minister Rishi Sunak’s Conservative government. The review describes Russia as an “immediate and pressing” threat, but calls China a “sophisticated and persistent challenge”, according to The Guardian.

Polish PM calls for trust vote after nationalist wins presidency,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317990-polish-pm-calls-for-trust-vote-after-nationalist-wins-presidency,"WARSAW: Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Monday called for a parliamentary confidence vote in a bid to demonstrate continued support for his pro-EU government after a nationalist candidate won the presidential election.
In a televised address, Tusk said he would “ask for a vote of confidence in the lower house soon” in his coalition government. He voiced hope that he would be able to cooperate with president-elect Karol Nawrocki.
“As prime minister, I will not stop for a moment my work and our common struggle for the Poland of our dreams... free, sovereign, safe and prosperous,” Tusk said. “The presidential election has not changed anything here and will not change anything.”
Tusk’s government has had a majority in parliament since it took over from the Law and Justice (PiS) party following parliamentary elections in 2023. But there are internal divisions in the coalition which experts say could be exacerbated by Nawrocki’s victory.
Some analysts have predicted that the growing political tensions could bring down the government and prompt early parliamentary elections, which are not expected until 2027. PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski said just before Tusk spoke that Sunday’s election result was a “red card” for the government.

France probes terror motive after man shoots dead Tunisian neighbour,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317991-france-probes-terror-motive-after-man-shoots-dead-tunisian-neighbour,"NICE, France: French prosecutors Monday were probing a terror motive after a man who had posted racist videos shot dead his Tunisian neighbour and badly wounded a Turkish citizen in the south of the country.
The shooting late Saturday in Puget-sur-Argens in the Var region comes after a Malian man was stabbed to death in April in a mosque, also in southern France, as concern grows over hate crimes against Muslims.
The shooting was initially investigated by regional prosecutors as a suspected murder motivated by the victim´s ethnicity or religion. But French national anti-terror prosecutors (PNAT) announced Monday that they would be taking over the investigation.
The suspected killer, a 53-year-old who is French, fled the scene in a car but was arrested not far away after his partner alerted police. He posted videos with racist content before and after the shooting late on Saturday, according to regional prosecutor Pierre Couttenier. The Tunisian man killed, believed to be 35 years old, was shot five times. The Turkish citizen, 25, was wounded in the hand and hospitalised, the prosecutor said.

US pushes countries for best offers by Wednesday as tariff deadline looms,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317992-us-pushes-countries-for-best-offers-by-wednesday-as-tariff-deadline-looms,"WASHINGTON:  The Trump administration wants countries to provide their best offer on trade negotiations by Wednesday as officials seek to accelerate talks with multiple partners ahead of a self-imposed deadline in just five weeks, according to a draft letter to negotiating partners seen by Reuters.
The draft, from the office of the United States Trade Representative, provides a window into how President Donald Trump plans to bring to a close unwieldy negotiations with dozens of countries that kicked off on April 9 when he paused his “Liberation Day” tariffs for 90 days until July 8 after stock, bond and currency markets revolted over the sweeping nature of the levies.
The document suggests an urgency within the administration to complete deals against its own tight deadline. While officials such as White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett have repeatedly promised that several agreements were nearing completion, so far only one agreement has been reached with a major U.S. trading partner: Britain. Even that limited pact was more akin to a framework for ongoing talks than a final deal.
According to the draft document, the U.S. is asking countries to list their best proposals in a number of key areas, including tariff and quota offers for purchase of U.S. industrial and agricultural products and plans to remedy any non-tariff barriers.
Other requested items include any commitments on digital trade and economic security, along with country-specific commitments, according to the letter. The U.S. will evaluate the responses within days and offer “a possible landing zone” that could include a reciprocal tariff rate, according to the letter.
It was unclear to which specific countries the letter would be sent, but it was directed at those where negotiations were active and included meetings and exchanges of documents. Active negotiations have been under way with the European Union, Japan, Vietnam and India, among others.
A USTR official said trade negotiations were ongoing. “Productive negotiations with many key trading partners continue at a rapid pace. It is in all parties’ interest to take stock of progress and assess any next steps.”
‘REGARDLESS OF ONGOING LITIGATION’
Trump’s ambitious - and often frenetic - tariff policy represents a major part of his “America First” economic agenda as he seeks to reshape U.S. trade relationships, reduce trade deficits and protect American industries. Republican lawmakers are also banking on tariffs to add to federal revenue and offset the cost of the tax cut legislation now working its way through Congress.
The twists and turns in Trump’s tariff policies have taken investors on a rollercoaster ride. In May, U.S. stocks held their biggest rally of any month since November 2023, but that was after global indexes had cratered under the barrage of Trump’s tariff announcements through February, March and early April.
Stocks were little changed on Monday afternoon after Trump announced a surprise doubling of tariffs on steel and aluminum imports on Friday at an event in Pittsburgh. Meanwhile, the legality of the approach used for imposing the most sweeping of his tariffs has been cast into doubt.
Last Wednesday, the Court of International Trade ruled that Trump had overstepped his authority with tariffs devised under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, including the “Liberation Day” levies and earlier ones imposed on goods from Canada, Mexico and China related to Trump’s accusations that the three countries have facilitated the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. Less than 24 hours later, an appeals court temporarily paused that decision. The tariffs at the center of the legal dispute are expected to remain in effect for now while the case plays out.
The draft letter to trading partners warns them not to believe the tariffs will be sidelined if the court rules against Trump’s use of the IEEPA. “I should also note that regardless of ongoing litigation concerning the President’s reciprocal tariff action in U.S. courts, the President intends to continue this tariff program pursuant to other robust legal authorities if necessary, so it is important that we continue our discussions on these matters,” the draft says.
