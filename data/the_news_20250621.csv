Arrest only to be made over Rs50m tax fraud: Kayani,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323367-arrest-only-to-be-made-over-rs50m-tax-fraud-kayani,"ISLAMABAD: Giving a policy statement in the National Assembly, Minister of State for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kayani Friday said new safeguards against investigations and arrest had been introduced for citizens in tax fraud cases.
He said the new safeguards had been introduced on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif under which no arrests would be made during the inquiry process and any individual facing allegations would be given the opportunity for hearing. He said only the commissioner Inland Revenue would be authorized to permit investigations following the inquiry process.
Moreover, Kayani said arrests during the investigation stage would only be made in sales tax fraud of over Rs50 million but only after approval of by a three-member FBR committee comprising the FBR members.
He pointed out that Inland Revenue officers of assistant commissioner rank were already enjoying unsettled powers to arrest tax defaulters.
“On directives of the prime minister and after having inputs from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance, we decided to further safeguard the citizens,” he said.
Kayani said the government’s target was to make the current IMF programme the last one but it was possible only by enhancing exports and ensuring inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
“The government’s target is to make the current IMF program the last one and this will only be possible by enhancing exports and ensuring an inclusive and sustainable economic growth,” Bilal Kayani said during the budget debate.
Delivering his maiden speech in the National Assembly only a few days after assuming the charge of minister of state for finance and revenue, he said the budget for next financial year was aimed at further consolidating the economic gains, providing relief to the people and continuing the journey of reforms.
Minister for Finance and Revenue Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb was also present in the House.
Kayani said a critical aspect of the next year budget was tariff reforms, aimed at enhancing productivity of industries.
He said allocation for Benazir Income Support Program had been enhanced from Rs592 billion to Rs716 billion saying 10 million deserving families would be benefitting from the budget.
He said while the salaries of government employees had been enhanced by 10 percent, at the same time, the government employees have been provided with relief on taxes as was promised by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
He said as the government took over, there was double digit inflation — up to 38 percent — but the regime accepted the challenge.
“We have been able to reduce the inflation rate to more than our expectations due to the measures taken with the cooperation of our allies,” he said, adding the government had been achieving all the economic targets.
JUIF MNA Noor Alam Afridi called for further increase in the defence budget saying the proposed allocations were not sufficient in view of the prevailing tense situation in the region.
Afridi said the government should reduce the development budget and more allocations be made for the defence sector.
Participating in the discussion on the budget, Nafeesa Shah emphasized the need for extending support to the agriculture sector.
Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf, taking the floor, termed the budget balanced and said matters were moving towards improvement as a result of difficult decisions taken by the government.
He said over 115,000 Pakistani pilgrims performed Hajj this year.
He said Saudi Arabia had awarded the award of excellence to Pakistan for making excellent arrangements for Pakistani pilgrims. He said process had been started to make arrangements for the next year’s Haj, emphasizing that the Saudi guidelines will be fully followed.
Sardar Yousaf voiced serious concern over the denial of basic human rights and alleged discrimination against the people of Hazara, particularly in Mansehra district.
He said the region’s population of over 300,000 lacked access to clean drinking water, gas, and proper infrastructure.
He urged the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, led by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), to stop marginalizing the region and ensure fair treatment.
He also called for reconstruction of education and healthcare infrastructure destroyed in the past earthquakes and demanded prompt compensation for those affected by the Suki Kinari Dam project.
In his remarks, Junaid Akbar Khan said the budget carried nothing for the people. He said the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had rendered immense sacrifices in the war on terrorism.
Syed Rafiullah urged the government to review family pension reforms, emphasizing that there should be no limitations on pensions for spouses and disabled children.
Sahibzada Hamid Raza said health and education had been ignored in the budget.
Minister for Board of Investment Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, said economic indicators had improved and there was reduction in inflation and increase in remittances.
Saba Talpur proposed support to the farmers and reduction in the prices of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kesoo Mal Kheal Das said the government had imposed no tax on the agriculture sector.
He called for joint efforts to put the country on the path of progress and development and also urged the provincial governments to fulfill their responsibilities in providing facilities to people.

Sugar import may not help cut price,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323369-sugar-import-may-not-help-cut-price-situationer,"LAHORE: While the focus turns to importing sugar to stabilise supply or even reduce domestic prices, recent data regarding import costs suggests this might be a false hope, potentially leading to higher consumer burdens.
The persistent debate over sugar prices continues to stir public sentiment, particularly after federal government’s waking up to the reality of importing 0.5 million tons of refined sugar following export of commodity on wrong estimation of ample production. However, this move may be a futile exercise for controlling the skyrocketing domestic prices of sweetener in the backdrop of current dynamics of international sugar market.
According to a presentation by Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) to the Ministry of Industries and Production on June 18, 2025, the cost of imported refined sugar at Karachi Port stands at PKR 153 per kilogram without any duties or taxes. When only sales tax is applied, this figure rises to PKR 181 per kilogram. Crucially, if all applicable duties and taxes are levied, the cost of imported sugar soars to a staggering PKR 249 per kilogram.
More worryingly, government seems incapable to provide subsidy for reduction of imported sugar prices or withdraw some of taxes given the tough conditions of IMF loan programme.
Haroon Akhtar Khan, Special Assistant to the Prime minister on Industries and Production, acknowledged that prices may remain high, saying “there is a problem as under the IMF programme no subsidies can be given and neither any duties or taxes can be slashed.”

Pakistan recommends Trump for 2026 Nobel Peace Prize,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323370-pakistan-recommends-trump-for-2026-nobel-peace-prize,"ISLAMABAD: The government has decided to formally recommend President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize, in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis.
“The international community bore witness to unprovoked and unlawful Indian aggression, which constituted a grave violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, resulting in the tragic loss of innocent lives, including women, children, and the elderly. In exercising its fundamental right to self-defence, Pakistan launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos—a measured, resolute, and precise military response, carefully executed to re-establish deterrence and defend its territorial integrity while consciously avoiding civilian harm,” said an official press release.
It said: “At a moment of heightened regional turbulence, President Trump demonstrated great strategic foresight and stellar statesmanship through robust diplomatic engagement with both Islamabad and New Delhi which de-escalated a rapidly deteriorating situation, ultimately securing a ceasefire and averting a broader conflict between the two nuclear states that would have had catastrophic consequences for millions of people in the region and beyond. This intervention stands as a testament to his role as a genuine peacemaker and his commitment to conflict resolution through dialogue.
“The Government of Pakistan also acknowledges and greatly admires President Trump’s sincere offers to help resolve the longstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan—an issue that lies at the heart of regional instability. Durable peace in South Asia would remain elusive until the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions concerning Jammu and Kashmir.
“President Trump’s leadership during the 2025 Pakistan India crisis manifestly showcases the continuation of his legacy of pragmatic diplomacy and effective peace-building. Pakistan remains hopeful that his earnest efforts will continue to contribute towards regional and global stability, particularly in the context of ongoing crises in the Middle East, including the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Gaza and the deteriorating escalation involving Iran.”
Meanwhile, US President Trump made a series of bold statements during a media interview on Friday, claiming credit once again for preventing war between Pakistan and India, while also expressing frustration at not receiving a Nobel Prize for his efforts.
“I should get the Nobel Prize for stopping the Pakistan-India war,” Trump declared, alleging that the award is only given to liberals. “They should give me the Nobel Prize for Rwanda and if you look, the Congo, or you could say Serbia, Kosovo, you could say a lot of them. The big one is India and Pakistan. I should have gotten it four or five times. But they only give it to liberals. They won’t give it to me.”

Govt allows commercial import of five-year-old vehicles,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323371-govt-allows-commercial-import-of-five-year-old-vehicles,"ISLAMABAD: The government has allowed commercial import of old/used vehicles up to five years from the present three-year-old vehicles.
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance met under the chairmanship of Senator Saleem Mandviwalla here on Friday. Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul informed the Senate panel that the period for the import of old/used vehicles under the Baggage Scheme was not changed, and overseas Pakistanis could continue to import three-year-old vehicles under this scheme, adding that from September 1, the commercial import of five-year-old vehicles would be allowed.
However, there would be an additional tariff protection of 40 per cent on such vehicles in FY 2025-26, as the tariff would be restricted at 50 per cent from the earlier average tariff of 90 per cent.
In the next four years, the 40 per cent additional import tariff would be brought to zero on the import of used and old vehicles. In the future, the import of six to seven years old vehicles would also be allowed. The quantity and standards would be maintained to ensure that old and used vehicles do not create environment-related problems in the country.
Mandviwalla said the same time period of five years should apply to the import of vehicles under the baggage scheme as well as commercial import. The government should give the same treatment to overseas Pakistanis and commercial importers for the import of vehicles, he added. The commerce secretary said the gift scheme was being misused on the import of old and used vehicles.
Meanwhile, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenues met under the chairmanship of Syed Naveed Qamar, which granted approval for bringing over Rs10 million pension into the tax net at a rate of 5 per cent.The NA panel also approved amendments proposed in the Income Tax in the Seventh Schedule, which provides special treatment for the banking sector. The FBR has proposed five amendments for disallowing banks from incorporating expenses from the payment of taxes, including the rented building of banks and advances to non-performing loans.

Govt signs Rs1.275tr loans with local banks to ease circular debt,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323372-govt-signs-rs1-275tr-loans-with-local-banks-to-ease-circular-debt,"KARACHI: Pakistan has signed term sheets with 18 commercial banks for a Rs1.275 trillion ($4.50 billion) Islamic finance facility to help pay down mounting circular debt in its power sector, government officials said on Friday.
The government, which owns or controls much of the power infrastructure, is grappling with ballooning “circular debt”, unpaid bills and subsidies, that has choked the sector and weighed on the economy.
The liquidity crunch has disrupted supply, discouraged investment and added to fiscal pressure, making it a key focus under Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF programme.
Finding funds to plug the gap has been a persistent challenge, with limited fiscal space and high-cost legacy debt making resolution efforts more difficult.
“Eighteen commercial banks will provide the loans through Islamic financing,” Khurram Schehzad, adviser to the finance minister, told Reuters.
The facility, structured under Islamic principles, is secured at a concessional rate of 3-month KIBOR, the benchmark rate banks use to price loans, minus 0.9 percent, a formula agreed on by the IMF. “It will be repaid in 24 quarterly instalments over six years,” and will not add to public debt, Power Minister Awais Leghari said.
Existing liabilities carry higher costs, including late payment surcharges on Independent Power Producers of up to KIBOR plus 4.5 percent, and older loans ranging slightly above benchmark rates.
Meezan Bank, HBL, National Bank of Pakistan NBP and UBL were among the banks participating in the deal.
The government expects to allocate Rs323 billion annually to repay the loan, capped at Rs1.938 trillion over six years.
The agreement also aligns with Pakistan’s target of eliminating interest-based banking by 2028, with Islamic finance now comprising about a quarter of total banking assets.

Nadra amends registration rules to guard against fraud,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323373-nadra-amends-registration-rules-to-guard-against-fraud,"ISLAMABAD:  Following the directives of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) has made significant amendments to the National Identity Card Rules 2002.
The reforms aim to bolster the security of Pakistan’s identification system and curb fraudulent activities, including child trafficking.
The reform draft has received the federal cabinet’s approval, and the Nadra has issued an official notification.
Under the new regulations, obtaining a B-Form will now require mandatory registration of birth with the Union Council. While children under three years of age will not need biometric data or photographs, children between the ages of three and 10 will now be required to have a photo and an iris scan for their B-Form. For those aged ten to eighteen, a photo, biometric data, and an iris scan will all be mandatory.
A notable change is the issuance of a separate B-Form for each child, which will now also carry an expiry date. Although the existing B-Forms will remain valid, a new B-Form will be a prerequisite for passport applications. The Nadra asserts that these measures are crucial in preventing fake registrations and effectively combating child trafficking.
Furthermore, the Family Registration Certificate (FRC) has been elevated to the status of a legal document. The applicants will now be required to sign a declaration affirming the accuracy of the information provided, and FRCs can only be obtained based on the Nadra’s official records.
The citizens are also mandated to register any family members not yet listed in the system, with updates possible via the Nadra mobile app or by visiting a Nadra office. Men with multiple marriages will be required to provide complete details for each family under the FRC. In a move addressing gender preferences, women will now have the option to display either their father’s or husband’s name on their national ID card. Decisions regarding the confiscation, cancellation, or restoration of ID cards will be finalized within 30 days. To enhance service delivery, non-chip cards will now incorporate most features of smart cards, including bilingual (Urdu and English) details and a QR code, with no additional fees for this upgrade. Additionally, individuals who voluntarily report false information previously used in card issuance will be granted legal protection.

Gandapur threatens to dissolve KP Assembly,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323374-gandapur-threatens-to-dissolve-kp-assembly,"PESHAWAR: Issuing a stern warning to the federal government, Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Friday claimed that he had the authority to dissolve the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly at any time, and vowed to resist any attempts to oust the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)-led government through what he described as a “financial emergency-based takeover.” In a video message, Gandapur said the budget voting process in the KP Assembly was about to begin, but the party’s founding chairman had not been consulted. “I instruct all our MPAs not to participate in the budget voting,” he said. “If we do not pass the budget, they may use this as a pretext to impose a financial emergency and take over the province.”
Gandapur alleged that a conspiracy to remove the PTI government in KP had been underway since day one. “This is part of a broader plan. It is the governor’s constitutional duty to convene the budget session, but he has failed to do so. The conspiracy started right there.”
He added that the provincial government had presented the budget to PTI’s founding chairman for his input before finalisation. “It is his political right to have a say in the budget. We have consistently stated that we will act on his directives,” he said.
The chief minister sent a strong message to the federal authorities, asserting that they had no legal grounds to disqualify his government. “Let it be clear, the power to dissolve the assembly lies with me, and ultimately, with the party’s founder,” Gandapur declared.
Calling on PTI lawmakers to be prepared for decisive action, Gandapur vowed not to let “their conspiracies succeed.” He said, “Before they act, we will make moves they will never forget. We will take to the streets in full force for our constitutional rights. The movement we will launch will paralyse this entire system.”
The comments come amid a tense political standoff between the KP government and the federal administration over constitutional authority, governance and the treatment of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.

From planning to followup: PM fully in loop on Trump-COAS meeting,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323375-from-planning-to-followup-pm-fully-in-loop-on-trump-coas-meeting,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was fully briefed by Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir following the latter’s recent high-profile meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House, a senior source confirmed on Friday.
According to the informed source, the subsequent phone call made by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was also a continuation of the Washington engagement.
The source asserted that all developments, from the scheduling of the Trump-Munir meeting to its content and the followup diplomacy, were coordinated with Prime Minister Shehbaz and carried out in line with mutual policy decisions.
“Although some quarters are spreading disinformation to create mistrust, the reality is that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir are in close and regular contact,” the source said, adding that the civil and military leadership remain united in both strategy and execution.
The high level of coordination between the political and military leadership is not new. Recently, The News reported, citing well-placed sources, that the prime minister and the army chief (field marshal) remained in constant contact during the recent Pakistan-India military conflict. Their collaboration covered all key aspects, including military, diplomatic, and political responses.
“There was seamless coordination, a trust-based relationship underpinned by mutual respect and shared responsibility. It was a unified approach that ensured effective outcomes for Pakistan,” a source familiar with the inner workings of the country’s power corridors was quoted as saying by this newspaper.
Describing the depth of their cooperation, the source had noted, “It was a 24/7, real-time, two-way flow of information, with extensive consultations between the prime minister, the army chief, and their respective teams.”

‘Vulnerable’ US bases in Middle East,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323376-vulnerable-us-bases-in-middle-east,"ISLAMABAD: The most vulnerable American bases in the Middle East includes Al-Asad airbase in Iraq, Tanf in Syria, NSA Bahrain and Al-Udeid airbase in Qatar.
Recently, it was reported that the Iranian officials warned Qatar about possible attacks on the US bases in response to American strikes, putting US embassies and diplomatic facilities in the area at risk, stated an article in The Washington Post.
It’s to be noted that the maximum range of Iranian ballistic missiles is 2,000 kilometers, and almost all US military bases in the Middle East are under the radius of 2,000 kilometers of Iran.
Al-Asad airbase has faced many attacks from Iran and its allied groups in recent years. It is located 150 miles west of Baghdad and is jointly run by Iraqi and US air forces. The facility houses thousands of American service members.
After the US killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, Iran retaliated by launching 16 missiles at locations with US forces in Iraq, hitting al-Asad with 11 missiles, injuring numerous soldiers and causing significant damage. Iran also targeted a military facility in Irbil.
According to the reports, attacks on al-Asad by Iranian-backed militias continued, including missile and drone strikes as recently as August.
In Syria, the Trump administration announced a reduction of US military presence, cutting bases from eight to just one at Tanf, which is near the borders of Iraq and Jordan. The timeline for this change is not clear. A drone attack in January 2024 on Tower 22, a US outpost in Jordan, resulted in the deaths of three American soldiers and many injuries, marking the most severe attack on US forces since the fall of Kabul in 2021.
In the Persian Gulf, notable US military bases include Naval Support Activity, Bahrain, home to the US 5th Fleet, and al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which has over 10,000 troops. Other bases in the region include Camp Buehring and Ali al-Salem Air Base in Kuwait and al-Dhafra Air Base in the UAE.
The western media reported already that the US has also evacuated some staff from missions in Iraq and Israel.

Thanking the prime minister for receiving his telephone call, Secretary Rubio encouraged Pakistan, which enjoys excellent ties with Iran, to continue playing its role in the ongoing peace efforts with Iran. He shared his desire to enhance bilateral cooperation between Pakistan and the US, across all areas of shared interests.

He noted that the US was committed to working closely with Pakistan to promote regional as well as global peace and stability.
The two sides agreed that talks between Pakistan and the US must now be translated into tangible actions, across all areas.
During their warm and cordial conversation, PM Shehbaz conveyed his best wishes for President Donald Trump, the PM media office said in a statement. He praised the US president for his bold leadership and appreciated Secretary Rubio’s proactive diplomacy that played a pivotal role in helping Pakistan and India to arrive at a ceasefire understanding and averting a major catastrophe between the two nuclear-armed states.
The PM noted with great satisfaction the most cordial and productive discussion between President Trump and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir in Washington, earlier this week. He also stressed the need for frequent high-level engagements to build upon this positive momentum in Pakistan-US bilateral relations. In this regard, he reiterated his invitation to President Trump to undertake an official visit to Pakistan and said that he too, was looking forward to meeting President Trump at his earliest convenience.
The premier added that President Trump’s positive statements about Pakistan were most encouraging for a durable peace in South Asia, which could only be made possible by initiating meaningful dialogue between Pakistan and India.
In this context, he reaffirmed Pakistan’s willingness for talks with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, the Indus Water Treaty, trade and counter-terrorism.
The situation in the Middle East, particularly the Iran-Israel crisis, was also discussed, where the PM emphasised the need to find a peaceful resolution to the grave crisis, through dialogue and diplomacy.
He stated that Pakistan was ready to play a constructive role in any effort for peace in the current situation, which was deeply worrying, not only for the region, but for the entire world.

Separately, the ISPR said in a statement on Friday that Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, during his interaction with scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading international media outlets in Washington D.C. stated that Pakistan had been on the front lines of the global war against terrorism, and it had rendered immense sacrifices, both human and economic in pursuit of a safer and more secure world.
He underscored the immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship between Pakistan and the United States, built upon mutual respect, shared strategic interests, and economic interdependence. His comprehensive and candid exchanges with scholars, analysts, policy experts and representatives of leading media outlets included an evaluation of the long-standing Pakistan-US partnership. The COAS underlined the historical convergences between the two nations, particularly in areas such as counter-terrorism, regional security, and economic development.

The interaction with prominent US think tanks and representatives of the strategic affairs institutions, provided an opportunity to articulate Pakistan’s principled stance on key regional and global issues, and to deepen understanding of Pakistan’s strategic outlook. The army chief provided a detailed exposition of Pakistan’s balanced approach to regional and global conflicts, advocating for dialogue, diplomacy, and adherence to international law. He also highlighted Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to regional peace and stability, and its constructive role in fostering a rules-based international order.
The field marshal provided details of Maarka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos and elaborated on Pakistan’s perspective on terrorism, noting the malign influence of certain regional actors in sponsoring and perpetuating terrorism as a tool of hybrid warfare.
Asim Munir shed light on Pakistan’s remarkable untapped potential, particularly in the domains of information technology, agriculture, and its vast and underexploited reserves in the mining and mineral sectors. He invited international partners to explore collaborative opportunities in these sectors to unlock shared prosperity.
The participants noted the openness and clarity of the COAS’s perspectives and appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled policies.
The interaction was marked by a spirit of mutual understanding and was widely regarded as a positive step toward enhancing strategic dialogue between Pakistan and the United States. The engagement reflects Pakistan’s commitment to transparent diplomacy, international engagement, and the pursuit of peaceful coexistence through principled and proactive dialogue, the ISPR statement said.

"Pakistan triumphed over India militarily, diplomatically: Bilawal",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323379-pakistan-triumphed-over-india-militarily-diplomatically-bilawal,"KARACHI: Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari Friday said just as no enemy could defeat Pakistan due to the bravery of its armed forces, the country could not be vanquished on the diplomatic front either.
Addressing a large gathering of the party supporters who welcomed him at the Old Terminal Karachi Airport upon his return from a prolonged foreign tour, Bilawal said he had conveyed Pakistan’s message of peace, Kashmir, and the rights of Sindh during his visits to various countries as part of a diplomatic mission.
He thanked the people for coming in large numbers to receive him.
Bilawal said he travelled to different countries to represent Pakistan at the request of the president and prime minister.
“I took Pakistan’s narrative to Europe, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the United Nations.” Bilawal told the gathering that he had visited four different countries on the directives of the prime minister, where he conveyed to the international community the message of peace from Pakistan.
Referring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Bilawal said Pakistan demonstrated its ability to defeat a much larger enemy.
“Our armed forces inflicted a humiliating defeat on India, and we are proud of our military. The enemy could not defeat us on the battlefield. Similarly, on the diplomatic front, Pakistan emerged victorious while India failed.”
The PPP chairman said he represented Pakistan globally with the permission of the president and the prime minister.  “I carried the message of peace to the world on behalf of Pakistan. The issue of Kashmir is linked to Pakistan’s very existence. We raised our voice for Kashmir on every platform. From my grandfather, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, onwards, the PPP has always championed the cause of Kashmir.” This time, however, we are fortunate to have President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in leadership roles.” The PPP chairman declared that Pakistan won the war even at the diplomatic level, saying, “Pakistan stood with the truth while India stood with falsehood.  India’s narrative failed on international media platforms.”  Senior Sindh Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon also addressed the gathering.

Omar Ayub highlights six ‘key flaws’ in WB’s tariff reform modelling,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323380-omar-ayub-highlights-six-key-flaws-in-wb-s-tariff-reform-modelling,"ISLAMABAD: While Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan highlighted six major flaws in the World Bank’s modelling for envisaging import tariff reduction, the World Bank said Pakistan would have a positive impact of 6 percent boost in GDP, $8-15 billion increase in exports, and creation of 1 million jobs over five years.
However against the general perception of increasing imports at a rapid pace through tariff rationalisation resulting in escalation in trade deficit and flooding Pakistani markets with imports, the WB has estimated that imports would go up by only 6 percent while exports would increase by 14 percent over five years.
The WB stated that this model of envisaging tariff rationalisation does not cater to uncertainties on the political front, especially in the aftermath of the recent ongoing Iran-Israel conflict and increasing oil prices in the international market. The WB expects that the exchange rate movement would be undertaken in line with the free exchange rate.
During this briefing which was open for the media, it was conceded that these tariff reforms were front-loaded and envisaged to be implemented mostly in the first two years, knowing that the political government could implement hard decisions in the first couple of years after coming into power.
These projections as a result of the National Tariff Policy for 2025 - 2030 for Pakistan were shared by WB Economist Ms. Anna Twum with the Opposition Leader in the National Assembly along with other MNAs from the PTI here at the Parliament House on Friday morning.
Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan flagged six major flaws in the modelling of the WB to estimate results of these tariff reforms and stated the assumed variables are not applicable in Pakistan. “For instance, perfect competition, adopting a static model, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) contaminated data is being used. In addition, international bodies also use PBS data. This model is very specific to be used for assessing impact of tariff lines. It assumes that Tariff Reforms will have to take place. Political will and ability to push the reforms are not taken into account. The model does not take into account the geopolitical moves by foreign governments to impose counter veiling tariffs such as USA.”
In his sixth point, he said the government is incorrectly projecting increase in exports and increase in GDP based on this model which cannot be applied fully in case of Pakistan.

Lawmaker calls for reviving Aghaze Haqooqe Balochistan package,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323381-lawmaker-calls-for-reviving-aghaze-haqooqe-balochistan-package,"ISLAMABAD: National Party lawmaker Jan Muhammad Buledi in the Senate on Friday strongly advocated for the second phase of the Aghaze Haqooqe Balochistan Package (AHBP), citing ongoing insurgency and unrest among local youth.
During budget debates, Buledi noted Balochistan’s persistent issues: “There appeared effort to address Balochistan’s deep-rooted issues, which had been ignored in the proposed budget as well, as the province continues to face serious security, health, education issues and there is rampant corruption in provincial government departments like P&D and Finance departments.”
He criticised delayed development schemes: “Some on-going schemes in the province were started 15 years ago and one could not speculate when would these be completed, asking would this way, Balochistan be developed.”
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar responded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was personally overseeing initiatives, including four new Danish schools, emphasising the PM’s priority for Balochistan.
The session saw two opposition walkouts over ministerial absence and a quorum issue, later resolved after treasury members persuaded opposition senators to return.
Balochistan Awami Party Senator Danesh Kumar raised alarm about three Hindu girls and a minor boy reportedly abducted for forced conversion in Sanghar, Sindh: “Why such incidents happened in Sindh, where most of the Hindu minority lived?”
He appealed to the Muslim religious leaders to intervene to stop this injustice as well as to the chair to act and summon Sindh police chief to question him about such incidents.
Majlis-e-Wahadatul Muslimeen (MWM) Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas concurred: “Cases of abduction and forced conversion of minority girls were rampant throughout the country, especially in Sindh.”
Senator Abbas raised a strong objection over the Punjab government move to ban the entry of pedestrians into the processions of Muharram by dubbing the action as ‘unwarranted’, ‘bid’at’ in Islam. He questioned who had given the status of ‘faqih’ to the provincial government to call anything ‘bid’at’.
He charged unlike Sindh, Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial government of Punjab was creating hurdles for the Shia Muslims in performance of their rituals, being their fundamental rights, enshrined in the Constitution.
Senator Attaur Rehman said Islam did not allow acts of forced conversion and claimed that in Pakistan including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, not only minorities but also Muslim community is facing many injustices. He agreed that the governments concerned should be questioned over the issue raised by Senator Kumar.
Minister of State for Religious Affairs Kheal Das said that the police have presented the girls in a local court and noted that there is an unrest among Hindu community in Sindh over the issue and they are protesting. He emphasised that there should be some legislation over this matter as girls below the age of 18 years are being converted forcefully and married to Muslim boys. He urged the federal government to take immediate action.
Law Minister Tarar said Parliament had already passed the bill to establish the National Commission for Minorities Rights, which had been given quasi-judicial powers and would be headed by a minority member.

Attacks on peaceful nuclear programmes undermine NPT’s legitimacy: Italian scholar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323341-attacks-on-peaceful-nuclear-programmes-undermine-npt-s-legitimacy-italian-scholar,"ISLAMABAD: An Italian scholar and international affairs expert, Ms. Ludovica Castelli, has criticised the erosion of global non-proliferation norms, arguing that attacks on peaceful nuclear programmes undermine the legitimacy of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
She heads Italy’s Istituto Affari Internazionali and addressing here Friday at an in-house discussion here on Israeli aggression against Iran, hosted by the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS).
The experts called on regional actors, including Pakistan, to adopt a proactive, balanced, and calibrated diplomatic approach as the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel threatens to destabilise the wider Middle East and strain global security frameworks. They condemned Israel’s attack on Iran as a violation of international law and warned that continued hostilities could trigger a broader regional conflict with severe consequences for international peace and stability.
Ambassador Ali Sarwar Naqvi, executive director of CISS, described the Israeli operation as an “unprovoked” and “unprecedented aerial assault.” The offensive followed years of Israeli actions in Gaza and saw it as turning point in the broader Middle East conflict. Despite the hardships and prolonged curbs, Iran’s resilience, shaped by its history of enduring conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War, has left it better prepared for the current conflict, while the Israeli population, unaccustomed to direct external attacks, is facing fear, panic, and psychological distress, he noted.
Shams-Uz-Zaman detailed the technological and intelligence dimensions of Israel’s operation, he warned that Iran’s critical infrastructure remains vulnerable to future hybrid threats unless stronger cyber defences are implemented.
Ms. Castelli criticised the erosion of global non-proliferation norms, arguing that attacks on peaceful nuclear programmes undermine the legitimacy of the NPT. Although powerful states profess commitment to the treaty and the oversight of the IAEA, their actions often bypass these frameworks, weakening their credibility and encouraging secrecy among other countries, she maintained. Targeting states for legally permitted enrichment activities undermine the NPT’s core principle of equal access to peaceful nuclear technology and contributing to a fragile, inconsistent global non-proliferation system, she said via video link.
Jahandad highlighted how great power politics, particularly Russia’s preoccupation with Ukraine, have emboldened Israel to take aggressive action without fear of a pushback. He cautioned against viewing military power as a viable path to lasting political outcomes.

"No shortage of fuel, essential goods at Iran-Balochistan border: CM",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323342-no-shortage-of-fuel-essential-goods-at-iran-balochistan-border-cm,"QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has assured that there will be no shortage of fuel, food, or other essential goods in the border districts of the province adjacent to Iran, despite the ongoing regional situation.
Speaking to reporters after a session of the Balochistan Assembly on Friday, he said: “We will not allow any scarcity of essential supplies in the border areas”.
Bugti emphasised that the primary role of the government was legislation, and if the judiciary deemed any actions unconstitutional or illegal, it was the court’s prerogative to correct them. “It is our right to legislate. The courts are responsible for interpreting the laws. If something unconstitutional happens, it is the judiciary’s job to address it,” he added.
The chief minister said there were no differences within the Balochistan government, and no changes were expected in the provincial cabinet.
Regarding the Anti-Terrorism Act, Bugti expressed the government’s belief that it will help address the issues of missing persons and law and order in Balochistan.
On the provincial budget, he said the representatives of the people were present in the assembly, and it was the assembly’s prerogative to approve or reject the budget.
Responding to another question, the chief minister said Balochistan was facing an insurgency supported by India’s RAW-funded groups. “There are ups and downs in such situations. The government is actively working to improve security. We are converting ‘B’ areas into ‘A’ areas, and positive results will gradually emerge,” he added.

"Pakistani talent, Chinese technology invincible wall for peace: Mushahid",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323343-pakistani-talent-chinese-technology-invincible-wall-for-peace-mushahid,"ISLAMABAD: Condemning Israeli strikes on Iranian territory, Pakistan-China Institute (PCI) Chairman Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed called the attacks “a flagrant violation of international law and the UN Charter” and rejected narratives promoting a “new Cold War” or so-called China threat.
“Security is preserved through cooperation, not military blocs, or demonising countries through disinformation,” he stressed while delivering keynote address at the Pakistan-China Dialogue hosted by PCI under the auspices of “Friends of Silk Road”.
Leaders, diplomats, parliamentarians, students and scholars gathered at the Pakistan-China Dialogue, which focused on “strengthening mutual understanding between Pakistan and China and building a community with a shared future for neighbouring countries.”
Speakers celebrated the enduring “Iron Brothers” partnership, championed a multi-polar order based on the UN Charter, and highlighted President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as a catalyst for peace, prosperity and regional connectivity.
The dialogue was organised by Pakistan-China Institute together with a visiting high-level 5-man delegation from the Communist Party of China’s International Department (IDCPC) led by IDCPC Spokesperson & Chief of Information, Ambassador Hu Zhaoming.
Delivering the keynote address, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed observed that the global balance of economic and political power is shifting from West to East, heralding the Asian century.
He lauded China’s peaceful rise as a source of strength for developing nations across Asia, Africa and Latin America, and thanked Beijing for its unwavering support of Pakistan’s territorial integrity and sovereignty, especially last month in the face of Indian aggression.
Mushahid termed Pakistani talent and Chinese technology an invincible wall for peace, security and stability in South Asia.
Ambassador Hu Zhaoming, Spokesperson for the International Department of the Communist Party of China (IDCPC), described Pakistan as “etched in the deepest hearts of the Chinese people,” adding, “China and Pakistan are like two sides of the same coin—you cannot choose one without the other.”
Highlighting the BRI’s evolution since 2013, Ambassador Hu noted that over 150 countries now participate in the initiative, which uniquely “promotes China’s own inland development while fostering global connectivity.” He urged younger generations to “carry the torch of friendship forward.”
Speaking for the government of Pakistan, Dr Shezra Mansab Ali Kharal, Minister of State for Climate Change, argued that the current world order is “visibly fragmenting,” while China consistently advocates multi-polarity, non-intervention and equality among states. “The BRI embodies this vision,” she said, fostering a network of interdependent economies that choose dialogue over conflict.
Former Foreign Secretary Ambassador Aizaz Ahmad Chaudhry echoed the call for cooperative paradigms during what he called “a time of flux where wars erupt and rules collapse.”
President Xi Jinping’s philosophy of “win-win cooperation and mutual respect,” he said, offers the most promising foundation for a future world order when the dust settles.
From the legal perspective, Barrister Aqeel Malik, Minister of State for Law and Justice, emphasised that security and stability are paramount for CPEC’s success.

Pak mission dismantled India’s hostile narrative: Sherry,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323351-pak-mission-dismantled-india-s-hostile-narrative-sherry,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has returned to Karachi after leading what PPP Vice President and Senate Parliamentary Leader Sherry Rehman described as a “defining chapter” in Pakistan’s foreign policy.
Speaking at the Parliament House on Friday, she praised Bilawal’s leadership during the high-stakes international diplomatic mission, which spanned over two weeks and included 68 meetings. She said the mission successfully dismantled hostile narratives, particularly those propagated by India, and projected Pakistan as a mature and peace-seeking state.
“Chairman Bilawal presented Pakistan’s case with clarity, conviction, and calm under pressure,” she said. “This wasn’t just a trip — it was a global assertion of Pakistan’s commitment to peace, justice, and regional stability.”
She noted the contrast between Pakistan’s message of dialogue and India’s aggressive posturing. While India sought to frame Pakistan as a hub of terrorism, Bilawal questioned their claims and challenged the absence of credible evidence. “If India was ready to go to war over Pahalgam, where is the evidence and where is the response to our call for neutral investigation?” he asked.
Senator Sherry also criticised India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it a shocking and dangerous precedent. “India is weaponising water — even their own BJP manifesto supports cutting it off. Chairman Bilawal made it clear: Kashmir is a red line, but our path is peace.”
She said the delegation’s efforts changed international perspectives and introduced a new image of Pakistan — one rooted in diplomacy, restraint, and forward-looking leadership. “India came with bullets and threats, we came with dialogue and solutions,” she added.
Highlighting the broader diplomatic momentum, she also referenced Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir’s meeting with President Trump, calling it “historic” and a pivotal step in repositioning Pakistan’s strategic relations with the United States.
“Pakistan is not seeking war. We are a responsible, nuclear-armed nation aiming for regional peace,” she concluded. “This mission gave the world a glimpse of Pakistan’s new brand — one of maturity, strength, and diplomacy.”

JI demands OIC summit on Mideast,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323354-ji-demands-oic-summit-on-mideast,"LAHORE: Jamaat-e-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has urged the government to immediately convene an emergency summit of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Islamabad, in light of the deteriorating situation in the Middle East.
Speaking at Mansoorah on Friday, he said the recent acts of aggression in Gaza and Iran were being carried out under the patronage of the United States 	 a country he described as an enemy of the Muslim world. He stressed that the Muslim Ummah, along with peace-loving nations, must urgently adopt a joint strategy to counter US-Israeli aggression.
“After wreaking havoc in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US now appears determined to replicate the same destruction in Iran,” said Rehman. “It [the US] continues to support India’s blatant human rights violations in IIOJK. Without Washington’s backing, Israel holds no power 	 and yet, despite overwhelming international support for a ceasefire in Gaza, the US vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution aimed at ending the conflict. This is a deliberate push towards global warfare.”
The JI chief reaffirmed that the people of Pakistan stood firmly by the people of Iran. He called on the governments of Muslim countries to reject the fear of American pressure and boldly represent the sentiments of the Ummah.
Criticizing Islamabad’s silence, he noted that despite clear threats of an expanding war including Israel’s attacks on Iran and the US signaling deeper military involvement, the government has failed to take concrete steps. “The entire Muslim world is looking to Pakistan for leadership,” he said. “Islamabad must rise to the occasion and play a decisive role on the issues of Gaza and Iran. If the flames of war continue to spread, it will not only engulf the Middle East but also South Asia and beyond 	 a catastrophe that will be impossible to contain.”
He called on Muslim nations to set aside individual interests and unite for the collective good of the Ummah. “Only through unity we can thwart the sinister designs of anti-Islam forces,” he stated.

SHC allows access of Sindh Assembly speaker to Governor House as acting governor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323295-shc-allows-access-of-sindh-assembly-speaker-to-governor-house-as-acting-governor,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday directed the principal secretary to Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori to provide immediate access to the Sindh Assembly speaker, who is presently the acting governor of Sindh, to all rooms and other chambers of the Governor House, except the residential portion, to carry out his official business as the acting governor of the province under the Constitution.
The direction on a petition of Sindh Assembly Speaker Awais Qadir Shah who had approached the high court against denial of his access to various rooms of the Governor House to perform his official duties as the acting governor.
A counsel for the petitioner had submitted that Governor Tessori was presently outside the country and as such by the virtue of the Article 104 of the Constitution, the speaker of the Sindh Assembly had to perform the functions of the acting governor until the governor returned to Pakistan.
He submitted that the petitioner was being denied access to the Governor House and its offices, which had hampered him from performing his official duties as the acting governor.
The counsel submitted that the principal secretary to the Sindh governor had on numerous occasions denied access of the Sindh Assembly speaker to the Governor House and its offices despite being requested by the petitioner for performing his official duties.
The counsel requested the bench to direct the authorities concerned to provide unobstructed access to the petitioner to the Governor House and its offices for discharging duties as the acting governor of the province.
The Sindh advocate general (AG), who appeared on the court notice, was asked by the bench as to whether in his view there was an impediment for the acting governor to enter the Governor House in order to discharge his functions as the acting governor.
The AG said that the acting governor under the Article 104 of the Constitution supported by the definitions and sections of the Article 260 of the Constitution was legally entitled to use the Governor House and its rooms therein for discharging official business as the governor.
A division bench of the SHC comprising Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha and Justice Adnanul Karim Memon observed that it was admitted position that the governor of Sindh was outside Pakistan and under the Article 104 of the Constitution, the speaker of the provincial assembly shall perform the functions of the governor until the governor returned to Pakistan.
The bench observed that the petitioner’s counsel had informed it that today, the acting governor had called a meeting with high ranking officials at the Governor House, but the principal secretary to the Sindh governor refused access to the acting governor, which caused untoward situation.
The SHC observed that prima facie, it appears that under the Article 104 of the Constitution, the speaker of the provincial assembly could not be denied access to the Governor House in order to carry out his official business and the principal secretary to the governor had prima facie violated the Constitution by refusing the acting governor access to the Governor House.
The SHC directed the principal secretary of the Governor House to provide immediate access to the acting governor to all rooms and offices of the Governor House except any residential portion thereof in order to carry out his official business as the acting governor of Sindh under the Constitution.
The high court also issued notices to the chief secretary, principal secretary to the president of Pakistan and others and called their comments on June 23. The SHC in the meantime observed that the Sindh government was at liberty to look into the conduct of the principal secretary to the governor and take any action which it deeped appropriate in accordance with the law.

Your scent lingers on,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323297-your-scent-lingers-on,"June 21 marks the birth anniversary of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto (Shaheed Bibi). She was born on June 21, 1953, in Karachi. On that day, her father, Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, her mother, Begum Nusrat Bhutto, and the entire Bhutto family celebrated the immense joy her birth brought them. Shaheed Bhutto described this moment in detail in a letter he wrote to Shaheed Bibi on her 25th birthday, June 21, 1978, while on death row in Rawalpindi Jail. This letter was later published in book form under the title ‘My Most Beloved Daughter’.
In this letter, Shaheed Bhutto wrote that Shaheed Bibi was a deeply compassionate and sensitive child, so much so that she once cried the whole day and refused to eat after a pigeon died. To this same daughter, on her birthday, he gifted her “the hand of the people,” saying he had nothing else to give from his death cell. This remarkably kind-hearted Shaheed Bibi went on to confront some of the most ruthless and heartless colonial forces in the world to uphold that gift. She ultimately sacrificed her life for Pakistan and its people at the age of just 54.
Shaheed Bibi once wrote that during her final meeting with her father, a day before his execution, she promised him that she would carry forward his mission. After making this solemn vow to Shaheed Baba, she dedicated the next 30 years of her life to fulfilling it, enduring immense hardships and suffering until her martyrdom.
What was Shaheed Bhutto’s mission? Shaheed Bibi carried it forward as a well-defined program. His mission was to empower the people by giving them the right to make all decisions through democracy and to make the defense of the state of Pakistan impregnable. Shaheed Bhutto firmly believed that no democratic or political system can thrive in a militarily weak state. This was the essence of Shaheed Bhutto’s philosophy.
In light of recent Indian aggression against Pakistan and Israeli aggression against Iran, the importance of this philosophy is becoming increasingly clear. Democracy and the struggle for a strong, stable state must go hand in hand. The way Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto advanced this mission is truly unparalleled.
The era of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was marked by immense challenges, not only for the democratic forces of Pakistan but also for the security and sovereignty of the nation. Shaheed Bibi not only revived democracy by leading a peaceful yet determined struggle against two military dictators, but she also took extraordinary steps to strengthen Pakistan’s defense.
Today, on her birth anniversary, it is the most fitting moment to acknowledge and honour the exceptional contributions Shaheed Bibi made toward making Pakistan’s defense impregnable. It is widely recognized that Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was the political architect of Pakistan’s nuclear program, while Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto played the key role as the political architect of Pakistan’s modern missile program. She not only safeguarded her father’s nuclear legacy but actively advanced it. In 1974, when India conducted its first nuclear test, Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto finalized Pakistan’s nuclear program. Similarly, in 1988, after India tested its Prithvi missile, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto took decisive steps to make Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent operational and viable.
Just as Shaheed Bhutto used his diplomatic channels to acquire nuclear technology from France and other countries, Shaheed Bibi skillfully engaged with North Korea and China to obtain missile technology. In 1989, as Prime Minister, she established the Missile Technology Board, obtained blueprints from North Korea, and signed multiple defense agreements. It was during her tenure that Pakistan’s Hatf missile program was launched and successfully tested.
Moreover, the defense agreements she signed with China gave Pakistan a strategic edge over India in military technology, an advantage that endures to this day. When India exhibited aggression, Pakistan, under her guidance and legacy, responded in kind, leaving a mark India would not forget.
The most meaningful way to pay tribute to Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto on her birth anniversary is to recognize and salute her unparalleled efforts in fortifying the defense of Pakistan.
The Pakistan Peoples Party is the only political party in the country whose leadership has sacrificed their lives not only for the cause of democracy but also for the security and sovereignty of the state of Pakistan. During her exile, in a conversation with journalists in Washington in March 2005, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto said: “My father laid the foundation of Pakistan’s nuclear program. I brought missile technology from North Korea. I signed defense agreements with China. I am told that I am the only one who can secure modern weapons for Pakistan from other countries, I am the one who can bring F-16s from the United States and Mirage jets from France. But what have they done to us? The whole world knows. Still, despite all the hardships, we will not give up our struggle to restore democracy in Pakistan, nor will we abandon our mission to strengthen its security and defense. We live and die for Pakistan and its people. Even in exile, I am doing more for Pakistan through diplomacy than those in power.”
These words reflect not only her unwavering dedication to democratic ideals but also her tireless efforts to ensure Pakistan’s strategic strength, even when far from home, under pressure, and in exile.
Shaheed Bibi clearly advanced the mission of her Shaheed Baba through her actions. This mission encompassed both the democratic rights of the people of Pakistan and the security of the state. Today, that same mission is being carried forward by Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. Just as he continues to raise the flags of Pakistan’s victories on the diplomatic front, he is upholding the core agenda of the mission begun by Shaheed Bhutto and Shaheed Bibi.
Today, on the 72nd anniversary of Shaheed Bibi, we deeply miss her presence. As Ghalib beautifully expressed, “Aisa kahan se laaun ke tujh sa kahin jise” — Where could I find someone like you, whom I could call ‘like you’? Shaheed Bibi used to say that a person can be imprisoned or exiled, but an ideology cannot be. We continue to uphold this belief—that a person may be imprisoned, exiled, or even killed, but an ideology will always survive. The ideology of reconciliation that Shaheed Bibi championed for Pakistan and its people, as an alternative to revenge, will forever endure. As the poet says…
(Tere baad bhi guzray hain kuch log
Magar teri khushboo na gayi reh guzar se)
Even after you, some people did pass by,
But your fragrance never left the path.

PA budget debate overshadowed by acting governor getting access denied to Governor House,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323298-pa-budget-debate-overshadowed-by-acting-governor-getting-access-denied-to-governor-house,"The issue of Syed Awais Qadir Shah, the Sindh Assembly speaker who is currently the acting governor of Sindh, not getting access to the Governor House's office to chair a meeting on Sindh's law and order overshadowed the ongoing debate in the provincial legislature on the new Sindh government’s budget on Friday.
Concerned treasury and opposition legislators weighed in on the unusual incident indicating a clear tussle over the authority between the full-time governor, Kamran Khan Tessori, who has been off to Saudi Arabia for the past several days to perform Hajj, and the Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) Sindh government.
Reports said the bureaucracy and official staff of the Governor's secretariat did not grant access to the acting governor when he came to the Governor House on Friday to preside over a meeting on law and order along with the Sindh inspector general of police, Sindh home secretary and other relevant officials.
The staff reportedly told the acting governor that they did not have keys to the governor's office. The acting governor had to eventually move the Sindh High Court to get a favourable judicial order to get unhindered access to the governor's secretariat.
Commenting on the controversy in the house, senior PPP parliamentarian and former Sindh Assembly speaker Agha Siraj Khan Durrani opined that the office of the Sindh Assembly's speaker had been disgraced by not allowing the acting Sindh governor to enter the governor's secretariat.
""You don't have any right to dishonour our speaker,"" said Durrani, who earlier twice served as the Sindh Assembly speaker, while apparently referring to Governor Tessori without naming him. He suggested that a resolution should be moved in the House to condemn the incident.  Another senior PPP lawmaker and former provincial assembly speaker Nisar Ahmed Khuhro said that stopping the acting governor from using the governor's secretariat went against the Constitution that laid down the official procedures to execute such affairs. He emphasised that the Governor House in Karachi was not the personal property of anyone.
Khuhro said that the Governor House should not be under the unauthorised occupation of anyone.  Sindh Law and Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar disclosed that the Sindh Assembly speaker had become the acting governor 22 days back, but he hadn't been granted access to the governor's secretariat to perform his constitutional functions. He informed the legislators that as per the Constitution, the Acting provincial governor possessed the same privileges and authority as enjoyed by the full-time governor.
He said the office of the Sindh governor and its related secretariat were not reserved for any specific person, as they should be accessed by anyone who became the governor in accordance with the Constitution.
Lanjar said it was sorrowful that the speaker did not get access to the office of the governor on becoming the acting governor and was left with no option but to move the constitutional court in Sindh that ordered unlocking all the offices at the Governor House.
The Sindh law minister also read out in the House the court order issued in this regard. He urged the Sindh chief minister to take action against the erring staff behind the sorrowful incident in light of the court's order.
Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) MPA Taha Ahmed said the incident involving the acting Sindh governor had occurred merely because of a misunderstanding and a lack of coordination among officials concerned, as it was not advisable to give undue salience to this incident. He assured the House that they also fully honoured the acting Sindh governor. He said the incident had occurred due to a misunderstanding, and it should not be exploited to defame Governor Tessori.
Earlier, taking part in the general discussion on the new Sindh budget, Jamaat-e-Islami MPA Muhammad Farooq feared that Karachi could become the battleground for the world's first-ever war over the water crisis.
He urged the ruling PPP in Sindh to emphatically demand that the federal government provide sufficient budgetary support to complete the K-IV bulk water supply project for Karachi.

Governor House blames misunderstanding on acting governor’s part,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323299-governor-house-blames-misunderstanding-on-acting-governor-s-part,"A spokesperson for the Sindh Governor House has issued a clarification regarding the situation that arose during the visit of Sindh Acting Governor Syed Awais Qadir Shah to the Governor House on Friday.
The spokesperson claimed a misunderstanding occurred on part of the acting governor. Senior officials, including the home secretary, inspector general of Sindh, and DIGs of the East, West, and South zones, as well as officers from the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Special Branch, were already present in the conference room of the Governor's House for the scheduled meeting.
The spokesperson further clarified that an office designated for the Acting Governor had been prepared in advance, and had there been a timely request to use the main office, necessary arrangements would have been made immediately.
Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori, taking the matter seriously, has directed his principal secretary to conduct an impartial inquiry into the incident within 24 hours. He also emphasised that the Governor's House had always remained open for the public and he held the acting governor in high regard as the speaker of the Sindh Assembly as well as on a personal level.

"Mental health among youth has reached critical point, warn experts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323304-mental-health-among-youth-has-reached-critical-point-warn-experts,"Pakistan’s largest-ever “Mental Health Hackathon 2025” concluded successfully at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi, marking a significant step toward addressing the growing mental health challenges among the youth.
The two-day event, held on June 19 and 20 at the IBA City Campus, brought together 94 students from various universities across the country. The hackathon aimed to generate awareness and practical solutions for pressing mental health concerns, including stress, academic pressures, and workplace burnout. Participants proposed innovative solutions leveraging technology, mobile applications, and community programs to tackle these issues effectively.
Organised in collaboration with the Center for Entrepreneurial Development (CED) at the IBA and the Synapse Neuroscience Institute, the event highlighted the urgent need for collaborative efforts to support youth mental health.
Dr Akbar Zaidi, executive director of the IBA, emphasized that the central purpose of the event was to understand the mental well-being of young people and explore their perspectives.
Dr Ayesha Mian, founder and CEO of Synapse Neuroscience Institute, shared that a comprehensive collaborative strategy had been developed involving startup founders, students, and mental health professionals to bring collective insight and practical solutions to the forefront.
“Mental health among the youth has reached a critical point,” Dr Mian said. “Even a thousand psychologists are insufficient to meet the growing demand, which is why such events are essential in finding
viable solutions.”
Dr Lala Rukh Ejaz, Director of CED, described the Mental Health Hackathon 2025 not merely as an event but as the beginning of a nationwide movement dedicated to mental wellness. She noted that students’ innovative ideas and insights could drive positive changes in the country’s mental health landscape.

JI demands action against fraudulent allotments in cooperative societies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323305-ji-demands-action-against-fraudulent-allotments-in-cooperative-societies,"Karachi Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Emir Monem Zafar Khan has demanded a comprehensive action against the mafia operating in cooperative societies across Karachi.
Addressing a press conference outside the office of the corporate department on Friday, Zafar demanded that the government retrieve the land from the mafia and provide the plots to genuine allottees. He said that unfortunately the registrar office had become the epicentre of problems instead of resolving the issues.
Highlighting Scheme 33 and 45, he said that plots in a majority of societies were fraudulently captured by the mafia with the help of fake files and documentation. He said that the government's cooperative department was fully hands in gloves with the mafia against Karachiites.
The protesters had been left with no option but to take to the streets, he lamented dubbing the entire scenario as deep injustice and oppression.
He said that the land grabbers mafia was enjoying the shelter by the ‘system’ of the Pakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) government in Sindh.
He said that earlier, the people of Karachi were assured that the corrupt system would be eliminated. However, instead of uprooting the system, the head of the malicious network was installed in Islamabad, the JI leader alleged.
He shed light on the modus operandi of the system and told the media how administrators were appointed on political bases to capture the land and sell it off to fake allottees.
Following the intervention by a court of law, the government held fake elections to pave the way for the land grabbing mafia, he added.
Zafar held the PPP government responsible for the prevailing crises and urged the affected people to continue their agitation as resistance against the mafia was the only way forward.
He said the JI believed in peaceful democratic struggle and would continue its drive for the rights of Karachi and its residents. However, he said, the situation birthed several questions such as why the National Accountability Bureau or any other watchdog institution was not taking any action against the mafia.
He demanded the government take action against those responsible for grabbing plots in cooperative societies. He also warned the government of agitation and protest outside the CM House and the Governor House if the issue was not addressed.
He said the JI would take up the issue on all available forums. “We will also approach the judiciary,” he said.
He announced that the JI would take up all the matters concerning Karachi and Karachiites. He announced that a big protest demonstration would be held on Saturday outside the Sindh Assembly building to call for an increase in the development funds for Karachi.

Bilawal has clearly presented Pakistan’s stance on global stage: Sharjeel,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323307-bilawal-has-clearly-presented-pakistan-s-stance-on-global-stage-sharjeel,"Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Friday said that today, the world regards Pakistan’s green passport with respect.
He stated that while Pakistan’s brave armed forces were fighting the enemy on one front, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was simultaneously and vigorously representing Pakistan’s stance on the global stage.
Addressing a public gathering on the occasion of Bilawal’s arrival at Karachi Airport, Minister for Information, Transport, and Mass Transit Sharjeel Inam Memon said Bilawal had clearly presented Pakistan’s stance at every international forum, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and other European countries. He added that Pakistan is a peaceful nation and at the forefront of the global fight against terrorism.
He said India unjustly imposed war on Pakistan, even though Pakistan did not desire conflict. Pakistan repeatedly demanded concrete evidence from India on the Kashmir issue, but India failed to provide any, yet it continued its aggression.
Memon said Pakistan’s army, air force, navy, federal and provincial governments, political parties, and the youth on social media all demonstrated unity and gave a befitting response to India. He added that today, India stands embarrassed on the global stage, and the determination with which Chairman Bilawal has raised and defended the Kashmir issue is unmatched in recent history. He said that we can proudly state that Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto made Pakistan a nuclear power, and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto provided the country with missile technology, achievements that have made Pakistan’s defence invincible and ensured that no enemy dares to cast an evil eye on the nation.

The purpose of this protest is the restoration of the Health Allowance, which has been frozen since 2015.

Belgian envoy hails law on minority rights,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323268-belgian-envoy-hails-law-on-minority-rights,"Islamabad : Ambassador of the Kingdom of Belgium to Pakistan Idesbald Van der Gracht on Friday appreciated Pakistan’s positive reform trajectory and welcomed the recent enactment of the National Commission for Minority Rights Act, 2025, which establishes a statutory body to safeguard the rights of religious minorities.
He also expressed Belgium’s continued support for Pakistan’s efforts to strengthen democratic institutions, protect vulnerable communities, and advance social justice.
The ambassador was speaking to Federal Minister for Law & Justice and Human Rights Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar during a meeting here.
They agreed to reaffirm the strong and friendly ties and vowed to continue close collaboration in areas of mutual interest, particularly in promoting human rights, legal development and inclusive policy reform.
The meeting reflected the mutual desire to strengthen cooperation in the fields of law, human rights and governance.
The minister highlighted recent legislative reforms, including over 110 amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, aimed at improving access to justice for ordinary citizens. These reforms reflect the government’s strong commitment to legal modernization and inclusive governance.
He also informed the Ambassador about the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2025 which sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 for both boys and girls.
This legislation represents a significant step toward aligning Pakistan's legal framework with international child rights standards, and efforts are underway to encourage similar reforms across all provinces.
The minister also addressed the findings of the Global Gender Gap Report 2025, expressing concern that the data presented does not fully or accurately reflect the realities on the ground, owing to methodological limitations and gaps in data collection.
To address this, the Ministry is actively engaging in consultations with relevant stakeholders, research institutions and development partners to identify and correct disparities in national data.
The collaborative approach aims to ensure that future reporting is based on comprehensive and verified indicators, aligned with the progress being made across sectors.
The minister said discussions were ongoing in Parliament regarding a potential policy shift on the death penalty, including consideration of a bill proposing life imprisonment in place of capital punishment for select offences.
This reflects the government’s openness to aligning national laws with evolving global human rights principles, he said.

Pak-Uzbek joint working group to boost blue economy,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323269-pak-uzbek-joint-working-group-to-boost-blue-economy,"Islamabad : Pakistan and Uzbekistan have agreed to form a joint working group to deepening maritime cooperation with a focus on unlocking the untapped potential of the blue economy, green shipping and creating a robust trans-regional trade architecture connecting Central Asia to the Arabian Sea.
This was revealed in a meeting between Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry and Ambassador of Uzbekistan Alisher Tukhtaev.
Both sides emphasised the urgency of building sustainable maritime linkages to support shared economic growth, regional connectivity and long-term prosperity through ocean-based industries. The both sides explored avenues for joint ventures in key blue economy sectors, including marine fisheries, aquaculture, seafood processing and coastal tourism, all poised to generate high returns in Gulf, African and Southeast Asian markets.
Mr Chaudhry stressed the importance of integrating Uzbekistan into maritime ecosystem through ports like Gwadar and Karachi offering cost-effective and efficient access to global markets. Uzbekistan can invest in improving road infrastructure and connectivity to Gwadar port underlining its commercial viability and alignment with global sustainability goals, he suggested.
A proposal was made by the minister to develop a trade corridor, linking Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan’s dry ports with Pakistan’s seaports via road and rail networks.
This initiative, potentially unlocking over $20 billion in trade, would serve as a strategic artery for landlocked Central Asian economies, accelerating their access to the maritime domain, it was observed.
The meeting also discussed integrated logistics solutions bonded warehouses, multimodal transport systems and smart port infrastructure as enablers of efficient cross-border trade. Synergy with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was recognised as vital for expanding Uzbekistan’s reach to a $6 trillion regional market.
Responding to the minister’s proposal, both sides agreed to convene fast-track consultative meetings involving technical experts. These sessions will identify Uzbekistan's specific maritime needs and determine Pakistan’s potential offerings to support them, said a statement.

Islamabad records 49°C ‘feel like’ temp,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323270-islamabad-records-49-c-feel-like-temp,"Islamabad : Islamabad sweltered under extreme conditions on Friday, with the heat index or ‘feel like’ temperature soaring to a blistering 49°C, despite the actual mercury peaking at 43°C.
The index, which combines air temperature with humidity, underscores the intensifying heat stress faced by residents.
However, relief is on the horizon.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department forecast light rain across parts of the country, including the capital, which could temporarily ease the oppressive conditions.
For Saturday, the PMD predicts dust storms and thundershowers in Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, upper Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, with the latter two also likely to receive isolated heavy downpours.
In the meantime, authorities have advised the public to limit outdoor activity during peak daylight hours, stay hydrated, and avoid direct sun exposure to reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses.

Pakistan leads Erasmus again with 114 scholarships,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323272-pakistan-leads-erasmus-again-with-114-scholarships,"Islamabad : For the fourth year running, Pakistan has taken the global lead in Erasmus Mundus scholarships—and this time, it’s rewriting the record books.
In 2025, 114 Pakistani students secured spots in the prestigious EU-funded Erasmus+ Joint Masters programme, including an unprecedented 66 women, who now make up nearly 58 per cent of the country’s cohort.
They are part of a global pool of 2,176 students from 137 countries selected through a rigorous and highly competitive process, highlighting not only Pakistan’s academic edge but also its growing commitment to gender equity in international higher education.
Close behind were India (96 scholars), Bangladesh (95), Mexico (93), Nigeria (75) and Brazil (73), reflecting a strong South-to-South showing in this year’s selections.
Last year, a total of 2,603 students from 137 countries were selected for the Erasmus Mundus scholarships, with 189 being from Pakistan. They included 100 men, 88 women and one non-binary person.
The Erasmus Mundus Joint Masters scholarships—among the most coveted worldwide—enable students to study at multiple European universities and graduate with joint or multiple degrees.
Funded by the European Union, the programme covers tuition, travel, visa costs and living allowances.
The EU Delegation in Islamabad congratulated Pakistan’s awardees, calling the feat a “proud moment” and a testament to the country’s academic talent.
The programme typically includes coursework, research, internships and a jointly supervised thesis, developed and delivered by a consortium of universities and partners across at least three countries—bridging cultures, disciplines and careers.

JI to host digital youth summit tomorrow,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323273-ji-to-host-digital-youth-summit-tomorrow,"Islamabad : Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) is set to host Pakistan’s largest-ever Digital Youth Summit at the Jinnah Convention Centre in Islamabad this Sunday.
Announcing the event at a press conference on Friday, JI Information Secretary Shakil Ahmed Turabi and Head of the JI Media Cell Salman Sheikh shared key details about the summit and its national significance.
Turabi said the summit will feature a keynote address by JI Emir Hafiz Naeem ur Rehman, who is expected to unveil a comprehensive roadmap for the youth of Pakistan.
So far, over 12,000 young men and women have registered for the event, with more than 50 percent of them being female. Organizers have urged all registered participants to ensure their attendance at the summit.
Describing it as a historic and first-of-its-kind digital event, Salman Sheikh said the primary aim is to promote a positive national narrative and empower Pakistani youth in the digital age.
“Youth are being deliberately pushed toward hopelessness and unproductive pursuits. Through this summit, we aim to counter that trend by equipping the younger generation to use digital platforms responsibly and productively,” Sheikh stated.
He emphasized that in recent times, social media has blurred the lines between political opposition and anti-state rhetoric, creating confusion and polarization. The summit will address these critical challenges by fostering dialogue and promoting awareness on the responsible use of digital tools.

Early construction of check dams in South Waziristan sought,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323279-early-construction-of-check-dams-in-south-waziristan-sought,"WANA: A Jirga of the Ahmadzai Wazir tribe here on Friday reiterated full support for the timely and transparent construction of five government-approved check dams in South Waziristan.
Organised under the banner of the Wana Welfare Association (WAWA), the jirga took place at the District Press Club Wana, which was attended by a large number of tribal elders, religious scholars, legal experts, political figures, civil society members and business leaders.
Among the prominent attendees were Malik Tariq Khan, Malik Jamil, Malik Saifullah, Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Saifur Rehman Wazir and Maulana Mehmood Alam Wazir, all of whom expressed strong backing for the initiative.
The participants vowed that no impediment would be allowed to disrupt the construction of the five check dams approved for Zalai area of Birmal tehsil. They also resolved that contractors would not be pressured for commissions, no undue interference would be tolerated in the execution process, and full protection would be provided to engineers and laborers working on the sites.
Addressing the jirga, WAWA president Rehmatullah Wazir provided detailed insights into the project, revealing that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, with the personal involvement of Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, had approved funding worth Rs1 billion for the construction of the dams. He assured that the work would begin soon and be carried out with a focus on transparency, sustainability, and quality.
Rehmatullah said that the steadily declining groundwater level in South Waziristan had become a critical issue, impacting not just agriculture but also daily life due to the growing scarcity of drinking water. He said WAWA’s research had identified 46 potential sites across Wana where further check dams could be built in the future, and these had already been added to long-term development plans.

Hindko Academy publishes 10th issue of journal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323280-hindko-academy-publishes-10th-issue-of-journal,"PESHAWAR: The Gandhara Hindko Academy has published the 10th issue of its Hindko literary and cultural journal dedicated to the Hazara division.
“Sargi Da Tara” is one of the 10 regular publications the academy, run by the Gandhara Hindko Board, brings out to promote the Hindko language and culture. This journal covers the literary and cultural landscape of the Hazara division, where Hindko is spoken as the first language in the districts of Haripur, Abbottabad, and Mansehra,” said Muhammad Ziauddin, head of the academy’s executive committee and General Secretary of the board, while unveiling the latest issue.
He said the board has been working since 1993 for the preservation and promotion of Hindko, which, according to official statistics, is the second main language in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the sixth most widely spoken language in the country.
“The Gandhara Hindko Academy was established in Peshawar in April 2015 under a public-private partnership to preserve and promote Hindko language and culture,” said the research scholar.
“But later, we expanded our efforts to include other Pakistani languages, especially those lacking official support,” he said, and added that the academy had published works in 11 Pakistani languages so far.
Ziauddin listed the Hindko journals published by the academy as Hindko Adab, Gandhara, Hindkowan, Sarkhail, The Gandhara Voice, Fatima, Taarey, Mother, Sargi Da Tara, and Kotal Rang.
He said that while Sargi Da Tara was dedicated to Hazara, Kotal Rang focused on the Kohat district.
“In addition to these, the academy supports magazines in Saraiki, Kohistani, and Khowar, the languages which lack official patronage but need to be preserved and promoted. These include Gomal Rang (Saraiki), Watan (Kohistani), and Khowar Nama (Khowar),” Ziauddin added.

No cop from KP posted against top slot anywhere in country,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323281-no-cop-from-kp-posted-against-top-slot-anywhere-in-country,"PESHAWAR: Not a single officer from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is currently posted as inspector general of police anywhere in the country.
Though there are a number of officers who served as IGP for sometime, they are currently either officers on special duty (OSDs) or posted as additional IGs.
“There are a number of officers of the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) in grade 21 but none of them could get the top slot in any province or other force,” said an official.
He added there were around 16 slots of IGPs, including provincial police officers and heads of Federal Investigation Agency, Intelligence Bureau, National Highways and Motorway Police, Railways Police, Frontier Constabulary and other forces. None of the incumbent bosses belong to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Salahuddin Mahsud, who was the senior most officer from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, retired a few months back. He twice remained IGP in KP and served as IGP Azad Jammu and Kashmir as well as Commandant Frontier Constabulary.
Akhtar Hayat Khan, a PSP officer of the 22nd CTP, who served as IGP KP for almost two years is currently OSD.  Muhammad Saeed Wazir from 23rd CTP, who remained IGP in Gilgit-Baltistan, is currently posted as additional IGP in Balochistan. Two of his batchmates are currently Provincial Police Officers.
Sohail Habib Tajik, who remained IGP in AJK twice and is from 24th CTP, is currently joint secretary in the Interior Ministry. His batchmates are also heading forces.
Another officer from KP, Qazi Jamil, is currently posted in the Intelligence Bureau. He remained IGP Islamabad a few years back.
Also, Dar Ali Khattak remained IGP GB a year ago and is currently serving in NHMP.
There are a number of other PSP officers from KP in grade 21, who are eligible for the top slot, but are still serving as number two or OSDs. These officers included Kashif Alam, Mohammad Ali Babakhel, Mazhar Kakakhel, Muhammad Tahir, Abbas Ahsan and Muhammad Jafar.
Apart from KP, there are many PSPs from other provinces who are in grade 21 but are yet to get the top slot.

The IGP also directed police officials to ensure the security of Chinese engineers and workers engaged in development and energy projects in different parts of Hazara division.

Three of family die as snow falls on tourists,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323283-three-of-family-die-as-snow-falls-on-tourists,"MANSEHRA: Three members of a family, including a man and his teenage son, were buried alive when a massive chunk of snow fell on them near Naran in the Kaghan valley on Friday.
“We had come from Mughalpura, Lahore, on a recreational trip. While taking photos at the Sohni Waterfall, a massive chunk of snow detached from a glacier and rolled down on us, burying three members of my family under the snow,” Mohammad Shafique, a survivor, told reporters at the Naran Police Station.
According to police and eyewitnesses, the family was visiting the popular tourist site when the incident happened. Police and local residents rushed to the site and, after hectic efforts, managed to recover the bodies from beneath the snow.
The deceased were identified as Tahir Mehmood, 42, his son Abu Bakar, 13 and Taib Shafique. Mohammad Shafique and other family members escaped unhurt.
“It happened so suddenly that we had no time to react. The mass of snow detached and came crashing down, burying my son, brother-in-law, and his son within seconds,” Shafique said.
He thanked the police and local authorities for retrieving the bodies and shifting them to the Basic Health Unit in Naran. The SHO Naran, Israr Shah, told reporters that arrangements were being made to transport the bodies to Lahore via ambulances provided by Rescue 1122.
He urged tourists to exercise caution when visiting waterfalls, riversides, and glacier zones.

PHC seeks response on FIR registered under Peca,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323284-phc-seeks-response-on-fir-registered-under-peca,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday issued notices to the federal government and relevant authorities, seeking their response on a petition challenging the registration of an FIR against a local lawyer under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Abdul Fayyaz heard the case. During the proceedings, Justice Ali questioned how the police could register a case under Peca, stating that such matters fell under the Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) jurisdiction. “How can a Station House Officer (SHO) register such a case?” he asked.
The petitioner, Advocate Roman Shah, appeared before the court. Justice Arshad Ali inquired why the FIR was lodged against him, to which Shah replied that he had been booked under Peca but was unaware of the specifics. Justice Fayyaz also noted, “Peca falls under the FIA’s domain-how did the SHO register the FIR?”
Shah informed the court that he had obtained interim bail. The assistant attorney general stated that the petitioner had allegedly posted content on social media against a senior security official. Justice Arshad Ali questioned Shah, “Why do you share such things that create problems?” Shah denied the allegations, claiming the account was fake. “These days, fake accounts are created with people’s pictures. This is not my account, and I have no knowledge of this post,” he said.
The bench issued notices to the federal government and other parties, seeking their responses in the case.

PHC reserves verdict on petition against placement of names on ECL,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323285-phc-reserves-verdict-on-petition-against-placement-of-names-on-ecl,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Friday reserved its verdict on a petition field by two persons against the placement of their names on the Exit Control List (ECL) following their deportation from Iran.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Abdul Fayyaz heard the case. The petitioners, Fawad and Haris, were represented by Noor Wali Khan Advocate and Roshan Khattak Advocate.
The court was informed that Haris, who had applied for a UK student visa and was granted one, and Fawad, who was traveling to Saudi Arabia, were both deported from Iran.
Their lawyers argued that deportation from one country did not legally restrict entry into another.
Haris faced further complications when he was denied banking services after being told his name was on the passport control list. During proceedings, Justice Arshad Ali questioned the assistant attorney general (AAG), asking why the petitioners were being barred from traveling. “Why are you stopping them? Let them go. There are no job opportunities here,” he remarked.
The AAG responded that the petitioners were attempting to travel illegally and could engage in anti-state activities abroad. Justice Arshad Ali countered, “Those traveling illegally don’t usually need passports.”
The AAG disclosed that a review committee had been formed to evaluate such cases, but the petitioners’ lawyers stated their requests for name removal had gone unheeded.
After hearing arguments, the bench reserved its judgment.

Abbottabad and Haripur facing severe water crisis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323288-abbottabad-and-haripur-facing-severe-water-crisis,"ABBOTTABAD: A critical water shortage, fueled by persistent dry weather and plummeting water levels, is causing severe hardships across the Abbottabad and Haripur districts in the Hazara Division.
The crisis has left Abbottabad city and its suburban villages without clean drinking water for over 10 days, escalating into a humanitarian emergency.
Taps have run dry, forcing residents-particularly women and children-to walk miles daily, carrying heavy containers to fetch water from distant springs and streams.
Tensions are high, with reports of clashes erupting over scarce water supplies, raising concerns about public order.
Local social activist and advocate Obaidur Rehman Abbassi warned of a deteriorating law and order situation and called for urgent intervention by the district administration.
The crisis stems from critically low water levels affecting tube wells, hand pumps, and local rivers, including the Harno and Haro.
Areas like Nawansher, previously known for abundant water, are now completely dry.
The crucial Jander Bari site, earmarked for a new water supply scheme, is also facing critically low water levels.
Residents in mountainous areas, including Lora, Sleg, and Nagri Tutia,l have protested against alleged unequal water distribution by the Public Health Department, leaving many struggling to find drinking water. Despite repeated complaints, local representatives have offered no solutions.
Haripur district also faces significant agricultural risks due to water scarcity, threatening vast cultivated lands.
The water crisis is particularly acute at Khanpur Dam, where water levels have plummeted to 1,921 feet-just 11 feet above the dead storage level of 1,910 feet.
This critically low level has forced a near-complete halt to the dam’s water supply to Islamabad.
Officials report a dangerous imbalance: the daily inflow is only 16 cusecs, while the outflow (including 96.18 cusecs to the Capital Development Authority and Rawalpindi Cantonment Board) stands at 127 cusecs.
At this rate, the remaining water could be depleted within approximately 25 days.
Dam authorities attribute the crisis to insufficient rainfall in the catchment areas, with exposed rocks and mounds now visible within the reservoir.
They warn that without heavy rain in the next 10 to 15 days, water levels could fall to the dead storage level.
The situation demands immediate intervention from district administrations and provincial authorities to manage water distribution, mitigate public suffering, prevent unrest, and address the looming threat to agriculture.Relief now depends heavily on significant rainfall in the coming weeks.

Over the next two days, traditional rival teams from Chitral and Gilgit will engage in a series of exciting and fiercely contested polo matches.
A large number of tourists from across the country and abroad have reached Shandur to witness the event.
Speaking on the occasion, KP Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Syed Fakhar Jihan said that the Shandur Polo Festival was not merely a sports event, but a vibrant cultural celebration that introduces the world to Pakistan’s peaceful atmosphere, breathtaking landscapes and rich heritage.
He added that Shandur Polo was a treasured cultural sport played at an altitude of 12,000 feet, drawing polo enthusiasts and tourists from around the globe.
The minister warmly welcomed the players and visitors to Shandur, stating that such festivals were a message of peace to the world and a reflection of the love Pakistanis have for their culture.
Highlighting the significance of the event, the Minister said that the annual polo contest between Chitral and Gilgit promotes unity, harmony, and brotherhood between the two regions. A total of seven teams from each side are participating in the tournament.
Barrister Saif also spoke on the occasion and hailed the officials concerned for making excellent arrangements.
“The KP government is committed to promoting traditional sports alongside modern games,” he said, adding under the leadership of Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur, efforts were being made to equip sports grounds with modern facilities across the province to foster healthy and positive activities among the youth.

Profiling of NCP vehicles in Kohistan begins,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323290-profiling-of-ncp-vehicles-in-kohistan-begins,"MANSEHRA: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has launched the profiling of non-customs-paid (NCP) vehicles in the three districts of Kohistan to prevent their use in any subversive or terrorist activities.
“A non-customs-paid vehicle was used in the attack on a coach carrying Chinese nationals to the Dasu dam site in Bisham in the past. That’s why the government has now initiated the profiling of such vehicles,” Akhtar Nawaz, the excise and taxation officer of Upper Kohistan, told reporters on Friday.
The Khyber Pakh-tunkhwa Excise and Taxation Department has issued a circular warning NCP vehicle owners in Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, and Kolai-Palas districts to complete the profiling process by September this year or face legal consequences.
The circular has also been shared on the official social media pages of the Upper Kohistan district administration to ensure wide dissemination of the directive. According to the circular, vehicle owners across the three districts are directed to report to the Excise and Taxation check post in Sholgara, located on the Karakoram Highway in Lower Kohistan, to have their vehicles profiled. Nawaz explained that owners will need to provide personal details along with the vehicle’s chassis number, model, and colour, and the data will be uploaded to the Excise and Taxation Department’s central database in Peshawar.

Rupee falls against dollar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323203-rupee-falls-against-dollar,"KARACHI: The rupee maintained its downward trend against the dollar in the interbank market on Friday.
The rupee closed at 283.7 per dollar, down 0.02 per cent from the previous close of 283.64.
In the open market, the rupee also fell, trading at 285.74 against the dollar, compared with 285.69 in the previous session.
Dealers said the local unit continued to weaken due to increased demand for dollars for imports and other payments.
The rupee declined, despite an increase in the foreign exchange reserves.
“Pakistan’s forex reserves crossed the $17 billion mark, signalling improved external sector stability and supporting currency sentiment,” said Chase Securities in a note.
The central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $46 million to $11.722 billion as of June 13.
Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of $1.8 billion during the 11 months of the fiscal year ending in June, in contrast to a deficit of $1.6 billion in the same period last year.
However, the country’s current account turned into a $103 million deficit in May from a $47 million surplus in April, driven by higher imports and a decline in exports.
The SBP forecasts the current account to remain in surplus for FY25. However, due to an uncertain global trade environment and a projected strong demand for imports, the current account is expected to shift to a moderate deficit in FY26. Despite weak net financial inflows so far, the SBP anticipates that its foreign exchange reserves will increase to approximately $14 billion by end June 2025.

Steel industry warns tariff cuts could lead to shutdowns,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323204-steel-industry-warns-tariff-cuts-could-lead-to-shutdowns,"ISLAMABAD: The steel industry has warned the government of potential shutdowns due to the implementation of the National Tariff Reduction Policy over the next two years. Industry leaders argue that the average import tariff on steel products is set to be reduced from 55 per cent to 44 per cent in the Finance Bill 2025-26.
“If the tariff is further reduced to 38 per cent on average -- planned for 2026-27 -- we will have no option but to shut down our operations,” said steel industry executives during a press conference on Friday. Following the closure of Pakistan Steel Mills, private players in the sector collectively invested over Rs1 trillion, with each unit contributing between Rs40 billion and Rs50 billion. Industry representatives warned that the government’s policy trajectory risks turning the country into a “trading economy”.
In a joint media briefing, Abbas Akberali, patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSP) and chairperson of Amreli Steels, along with PALSP Chairperson Javed Iqbal, Vice Chairperson Illayus Aziz Malik and Secretary General Wajid Bokhari, called on the government to exempt the steel sector from tariff rationalisation for one year. They urged authorities to engage with the industry to develop a 10-year roadmap to reduce the cost of doing business, enabling local producers to compete with global giants like China.
They demanded a reduction in electricity tariffs from 14 cents to 7 cents per kWh and lower prices for gas and furnace oil to ensure a level playing field. Amreli Steels alone has downsized 25 to 30 per cent of its workforce in recent years; other companies have made similar cuts.
While some recent government measures, such as reduced electricity costs and lower interest rates, have brought limited relief, both remain among the highest in the region. The industry welcomed the gradual withdrawal of tax exemptions for the former Fata and Pata regions but questioned whether the move would survive the budget process, recalling last year’s reversal at the eleventh hour.
Industry leaders criticised the government for delegating the task of tariff rationalisation to individuals, some of them foreign, who, they argue, lack an understanding of Pakistan’s industrial realities and the steel sector’s operational environment. They said key ministries, including Commerce and Industries, were being sidelined in the tariff decision-making process. They also stressed that the government should have first introduced reforms to incentivise local iron ore extraction alongside tariff cuts. This, they argued, would help boost raw material availability, cut production costs, enhance product quality, and improve international competitiveness.
Globally, steel remains a heavily protected industry. India, currently the world’s second-largest steel producer, recently increased support for its sector. Bangladesh, too, protects its steel industry with tariffs as high as 89.92 per cent. In comparison, Pakistan offers far less protection, ranging between 43 to 57 per cent. Moreover, while Bangladesh levies only a nominal sales tax on steel, amounting to a few thousand taka per tonne, Pakistan imposes a sales tax of Rs38,000 per tonne.
Consequently, Bangladesh’s largest steel mill has a production capacity of 2.4 million tonnes, while Pakistan’s largest unit, with a capacity of 1.1 million tonnes, remains closed. The government’s proposed tariff reductions threaten to exacerbate this disparity, they said. Local producers are also contending with the region’s highest power rates, even after a recent reduction from 17 to 14 cents per kWh. In contrast, power in China costs just 7 cents. Coupled with high interest rates and massive currency devaluation, which has more than doubled working capital requirements, these factors have severely eroded competitiveness. Industry leaders urged the government to first improve Pakistan’s standing on global ease and cost of doing business indices before exposing local firms to international competition. Pakistan currently ranks 110th out of 140 countries. “Before opening up our market to the world’s leading steel producers, we must at least aim to improve our ranking to 50,” they said.

Stocks close flat amid cautious activity,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323205-stocks-close-flat-amid-cautious-activity,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) ended the last day of the week flat with a slightly positive closing, as investors preferred the cautious activity despite earlier gains in the session.
The benchmark KSE-100 index closed higher by 20.65 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 120,023.24 points, up from 120,002.59 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 120,828.86 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 119,872.16 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said, “Stocks showed recovery on receding fears after the White House delayed a decision on US involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict.”
He said that investor interest led by blue chip oil scrips as investors weigh the federal cabinet’s approval of Rs1.275 trillion bank loan under circular debt management plan and government deliberation for privatisation of SOEs played a catalytic role in the positive close at the PSX.
The KSE-30 index increased by 91.5 points or 0.25 per cent to 36,533.23 points from 36,441.73 points.
Traded shares dropped by 183 million shares to 421.643 million shares from 604.536 million shares. The trading value decreased to Rs15.651 billion from Rs20.442 billion. Market capital expanded to Rs14.536 trillion against Rs14.523 trillion. Of the 468 companies active in the session, 178 closed in green, 245 in red and 45 remained unchanged.
Nabel Haroon, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the KSE-100 index traded in the positive zone for most of the trading session on news that the Trump administration has decided to exercise restraint and will decide on US action in the Israel-Iran conflict within two weeks.
However, due to a lack of confidence surrounding the conflict, the KSE-100 index came down during the latter hours of the trade to close on a flat note.
Top positive contributions to the index came from HUBC, SYS, UBL, OGDC, MLCF and PPL, as they cumulatively contributed +168 points. Whereas, the top negative contributions to the index came from PKGP, TRG, FFC, PSEL, EFERT and MCB, as they cumulatively contributed -180 points.
Traded value wise TRG (Rs1.5 billion), PSO (Rs885 million), MLCF (Rs589 million), OGDC (Rs574 million) and HUBC (Rs485 million) dominated the trading activity
The highest increase was recorded in Macter International Limited, which rose by Rs56.53 to Rs621.82 per share, followed by Hoechst Pakistan Limited, which increased by Rs47.74 to Rs3,198.50 per share. A significant decline was noted in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which fell by Rs1,239.31 to Rs11,153.83 per share, Pakistan Services Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs47.41 to Rs941.11 per share.
Analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala at JS Global said the market started the session on a weak note, with sentiment remaining cautious throughout the day. Volumes remained dull, with limited activity on the main board. However, the positive takeaway was that the index managed to close above the psychological 120,000 mark.
“We advise investors to maintain a cautious stance, with a focus on risk management and selective buying,” he advised.
WorldCall Telecom remained the volume leader with 42.791 million shares, which closed lower by 4 paisas to Rs1.45 per share. TRG Pak Ltd, with 26.664 million shares, followed it, which closed lower by Rs5.12 to Rs56.68 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included Pervez Ahmed Co, Yousuf Weaving, K-Electric Ltd, Sui South Gas, Ist Capital Sec, Dewan Cement, Invest Bank, and Pak Refinery.
In the futures market, 316 companies recorded trading, 108 of which increased, 200 decreased and 8 remained unchanged.

Crude sinks 2% as Trump delays decision on Iran strike,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323206-crude-sinks-2pc-as-trump-delays-decision-on-iran-strike,"HONG KONG: Oil prices tumbled on Friday and equity traders fought to end a volatile week on a positive note after Donald Trump said he would consider over the next two weeks whether to join Israel’s attacks on Iran.
Speculation had been swirling that Trump would throw his lot in with Israel, but on Thursday he said he would decide “within the next two weeks” whether to involve the US, giving diplomacy a shot to end the hostilities.
While tensions are sky high amid fears of an escalation, the US president’s remarks suggested the crisis could be prevented from spiralling into all-out war between the Middle East foes.
Since Israel first hit Iran last Friday, the two have exchanged deadly strikes and apocalyptic warnings, though observers said the conflict has not seen a critical escalation.
European foreign ministers were due to meet their Iranian counterpart on Friday in Geneva.
In a statement read out by White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, the president said: “Based on the fact that there’s a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks.”
Leavitt added: “If there’s a chance for diplomacy the president’s always going to grab it, but he’s not afraid to use strength as well.”
Both main oil contracts were down around 2.0 percent from Thursday but uncertainty prevailed and traders remained nervous.
“Crude still calls the shots, and volatility’s the devil in the room -- and every trader on the street knows we’re two headlines away from chaos,” said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.
“Make no mistake: we’re trading a geopolitical powder keg with a lit fuse.
“President Trump’s two-week ‘thinking window’ on whether to join Israel’s war against Iran is no cooling-off period – it’s a ticking volatility clock.” Stocks were mixed following a public holiday in New York, with Hong Kong, Taipei, Mumbai and Bangkok all up with London, Paris and Frankfurt.
Seoul’s Kospi led the gains, rising more than 1.0 per cent to break 3,000 points for the first time in nearly three-and-a-half years.
The index has risen every day except one since the June 4 election of a new president, which ended months of political crisis and fuelled hopes for an economic rebound.
Tokyo fell as Japanese core inflation accelerated, stoked by a doubling in the cost of rice, a hot topic issue that poses a threat to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ahead of elections next month.
There were also losses in Shanghai, Sydney, Singapore, Manila and Jakarta.
The Middle East crisis continues to absorb most of the news but Trump’s trade war remains a major obstacle for investors as the end of a 90-day pause on his April 2 tariff blitz approaches with few governments reaching deals to avert them being imposed.
“While the worst of the tariffs have been paused, we suspect it won’t be until those deadlines approach that new agreements may be finalised,” said David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar.
“Until then, as news emerges regarding the progress and substance of trade negotiations, these headlines could have an outsize positive or negative impact on markets.”

Sugar prices exceed govt-set Rs164 per kg in most cities: PBS,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323207-sugar-prices-exceed-govt-set-rs164-per-kg-in-most-cities-pbs,"KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: Refined sugar continues to retail above the government’s official price of Rs164 per kilogram, with data showing average rates ranging between Rs175 and Rs188.7 across major cities.
According to official price monitoring data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics on Friday, the highest average sugar price was recorded in Islamabad at Rs188.7 per kg, followed closely by Rawalpindi at Rs186.31, and Khuzdar at Rs185. In comparison, Karachi, Lahore and Hyderabad reported relatively lower but still non-compliant average prices of Rs182.84, 180, and 177.32 respectively.
Nearly all surveyed urban centres were found to be selling sugar at inflated prices, suggesting ineffective enforcement of price controls and continued strain on consumer budgets.
The state-mandated price was fixed at Rs164 per kg earlier this year in a bid to control inflation. However, the government has consistently failed to ensure compliance.
The PBS data also showed that weekly inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI), increased by 0.27 per cent for the combined consumption groups during the week ended on June 19.
According to PBS data, the SPI for the week under review in the above-mentioned group was recorded at 310.35 points as compared to 309.51 points during the past week.
As compared to the corresponding week of last year, the SPI for the combined consumption group in the week under review witnessed a decrease of 2.06 per cent.
The weekly SPI with the base year 2015-16 =100 covers 17 urban centres and 51 essential items for all expenditure groups.
The SPI for the lowest consumption group of up to Rs17,732 witnessed an increase of 0.05 per cent and went up to 299.58 points from last week’s 299.44 points.
The SPI for consumption groups of Rs17,732-22,888; Rs22,889-29,517; Rs29,518-44,175 and above Rs44,175, went up by 0.05 per cent, 0.10 per cent, 0.13 per cent and 0.42 per cent respectively.
During the week, out of 51 items, prices of 23 (45.101 per cent) items increased, 08 (15.69 per cent) items decreased and 20 (39.21 per cent) items remained stable.
The items, which recorded major increase in their average prices on a week-on-week basis included LPG (14.86 per cent), potatoes (3.75 per cent), diesel (3.10 per cent), gur (2.25 per cent), chicken (2.17 per cent), sugar (2.13 per cent), petrol (1.88 per cent), mustard oil (1.12 per cent), powdered milk (0.97 per cent), rice basmati broken (0.84 per cent), cooked daal (0.68 per cent), and tea prepared (0.39 per cent).
The commodities which recorded major decrease in their average prices on a week-on-week basis included eggs (9.53 per cent), tomatoes (5.62 per cent), garlic (1.03 per cent), pulse gram (0.35 per cent), vegetable ghee 2.5kg (0.17 per cent), cooking oil 5 litre (0.03 per cent) and bananas and firewood (0.01 per cent).
Year-on-year basis, the commodities that witnessed decrease included onions (63.22 per cent), tomatoes (56.11 per cent), electricity charges for q1 (41.63 per cent), garlic (32.58 per cent), pulse mash (19.09 per cent), potatoes (17.97 per cent), tea Lipton (17.93 per cent), wheat flour (14.16 per cent), chicken (6.0 per cent), pulse masoor (5.87 per cent), rice IRRI-6/9 (4.47 per cent) and chilies powder (3.86 per cent).
The commodities which recorded an increase in their average prices on year-on-year basis ladies sandal (55.62 per cent), pulse moong (28.9 per cent), sugar (26.19 per cent), powdered milk (25.93 per cent), lpg (21.77 per cent), eggs (17.9 per cent), beef (15.74 per cent), vegetable ghee 2.5kg (13 per cent), vegetable ghee 1kg (12.73 per cent), bananas (12.47 per cent), gur (10.85 per cent), firewood (10.8 per cent) and cooked daal (10.64 per cent). —AFP

Global equity funds log biggest outflows in three months on Mideast tensions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323208-global-equity-funds-log-biggest-outflows-in-three-months-on-mideast-tensions,"Global equity funds recorded net outflows of $19.82 billion for the week ended June 18, the largest in three months, as escalating Middle East tensions and lingering uncertainty over US trade policies dampened investor sentiment
Investors divested a net $19.82 billion from global equity funds during the week, according to LSEG Lipper data.
US equity funds led regional outflows with net sales of $18.43 billion, their steepest withdrawal in three months. Asia saw outflows of $2.86 billion, while Europe recorded net inflows of $640 million.
Despite broader outflows, equity sectoral funds attracted $573 million in net inflows, the fourth straight week of purchases.
Tech and industrials led sectoral gains with a net $1.5 billion and $752 million in inflows, respectively, while financials saw nearly $1.5 billion of net outflows.
Global bond funds were popular for the ninth consecutive week, attracting around $13.13 billion in net inflows.
Euro-denominated bond funds drew $3.07 billion in net inflows, following $7.97 billion of inflows in the prior week. Investors also lapped up short-term and high-yield bond funds, which garnered $2.93 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively.
In contrast, investors pulled out a net $2.7 billion from money market funds after about $4.1 billion of net sales in the previous week.
Demand for gold and precious metals commodity funds surged to the highest in two months during the week as these funds received $2.84 billion in net inflows.
Emerging market bond funds attracted net inflows of $2.5 billion, with demand extending to an eighth successive week. Investors, however, withdrew $234 million from equity funds, according to data for 29,726 funds.

"Under shadow of Trump warning, Africa pioneers non-dollar payments systems",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323209-under-shadow-of-trump-warning-africa-pioneers-non-dollar-payments-systems,"NAIROBI: Africa’s push for local currency payments systems -- once little more than an aspiration -- is finally making concrete gains, bringing the promise of less costly trade to a continent long hobbled by resource-sapping dollar transactions.
But efforts to move away from the dollar face strong opposition and the threat of retaliation from US President Donald Trump, who is determined to preserve it as the dominant currency for global trade.
The move by Africa to create payments systems that do not rely on the greenback mirrors a push by China to develop financial systems independent of Western institutions. Countries like Russia, which face economic sanctions, are also keen for an alternative to the dollar.
But while that movement has gained a sense of urgency due to shifting trade patterns and geopolitical realignments following President Trump’s return to the White House, African advocates for payment alternatives are making their case based on costs.
“Our goal, contrary to what people might think, is not de-dollarisation,” said Mike Ogbalu, chief executive of the Pan-African Payments and Settlements System, which allows parties to transact directly in local currencies, bypassing the dollar.
“If you look at African economies, you’ll find that they struggle with availability for third-party global currencies to settle transactions,” he said.
Africa’s commercial banks typically rely on overseas counterparts, through so-called correspondent banking relationships, to facilitate settlements of international payments. That includes payments between African neighbours.
That adds significantly to transaction costs that, along with other factors like poor transport infrastructure, have made trade in Africa 50 per cent more expensive than the global average, according to the UN Trade and Development agency.
It is also among the reasons so much of Africa’s trade -- 84 per cent, according to a report by Mauritius-based MCB Group -- is with external partners rather than between African nations.
“The existing financial network that is largely dollar-based has essentially become less effective for Africa, and costlier,” said Daniel McDowell, a professor at Syracuse University in New York specialising in international finance.

HOMEGROWN SYSTEMS
According to data compiled by PAPSS, under the existing system of correspondent banks, a $200 million trade between two parties in different African countries is estimated to cost 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the value of the deal.
The shift to homegrown payments systems could cut the cost of that transaction to just 1.0 per cent.
Systems like PAPSS allow a business in one country, Zambia for example, to pay for goods from another like Kenya, with both buyer and seller receiving payment in their respective currencies rather than converting them into dollars to complete the transaction.
Using currencies like the Nigerian naira, Ghanaian cedi or South Africa’s rand for intra-Africa trade payments could save the continent $5 billion a year in hard currency, Ogbalu told Reuters.
Launched in January 2022 with just 10 participating commercial banks, PAPSS is today operational in 15 countries including Zambia, Malawi, Kenya and Tunisia, and now has 150 commercial banks in its network.
“We have also seen very significant growth in our transactions,” Ogbalu said, without providing usage data.
The International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private sector lending arm, has, meanwhile, started issuing loans to African businesses in local currencies.
It views the switch as imperative for their growth, relieving them from the currency risks of borrowing in dollars, said Ethiopis Tafara, IFC's vice-president for Africa.
“If they are not generating hard currency, a hard-currency loan imposes a burden that makes it difficult for them to succeed,” he said.

GEOPOLITICS AND THE TRUMP FACTOR
Africa’s campaign to boost regional payments systems has found a platform at the Group of 20 major economies, with South Africa leading the charge as holder of the G20’s rotating presidency.
It held at least one session on boosting regional payments systems when South Africa hosted a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors. And South Africa wants it to follow up the talk with concrete actions. The next meeting of G20 finance officials is scheduled for mid-July.
“Some of the most expensive corridors for cross-border payments are actually found on the African continent,” Lesetja Kganyago, South Africa’s central bank governor, told Reuters during a G20 meeting in Cape Town in February.
“For us to function as a continent, it’s important that we start trading and settling in our own currencies.”
Talk of moving away from the dollar -- either for trade or as a reserve currency -- has drawn aggressive reactions from President Trump, however.
After BRICS -- a grouping of nations including Russia, China, India and Brazil along with Africans like South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia -- weighed reducing dollar dependence and creating a common currency, Trump responded with threats of 100 per cent tariffs.
“There is no chance that BRICS will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, or anywhere else, and any Country that tries should say hello to Tariffs, and goodbye to America!,” he wrote on Truth Social in January.
In the months since, Trump has demonstrated his willingness to use tariffs to pressure and punish allies and foes alike, a strategy that has upended global trade and geopolitics.
No matter its intentions in moving to more local currency transactions, Syracuse University’s McDowell said Africa will struggle to distance itself from more politically motivated de-dollarisation efforts, like those led by China and Russia. “The perception is likely to be that this is about geopolitics,” he said.

Shipping firm Maersk temporarily pauses Haifa port calls,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323210-shipping-firm-maersk-temporarily-pauses-haifa-port-calls,"COPENHAGEN: Container shipping company Maersk said on Friday it had temporarily paused vessel calls at Israel’s Haifa port, amid the country’s escalating conflict with Iran.
The Danish company said it had not experienced any further disruptions to its scheduled operations in the region.
Haifa port, which was privatised in 2022, is owned 70 per cent by India’s Adani Ports while the remaining 30 per cent is held by Israel’s Gadot Group.
Adani Ports is the ports operating arm of Adani Group, led by billionaire Gautam Adani. Including Haifa port, the company operates four ports outside Indian waters.
A spokesperson for the Adani Group did not immediately respond to Reuters’ email and text messages requesting comment.
Israel has been hitting Iran from the air since last Friday in what it describes as an effort to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Iran has denied plans to develop such weapons and has retaliated by launching counterstrikes on Israel.

What if Iran tries to close the Strait of Hormuz?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323211-what-if-iran-tries-to-close-the-strait-of-hormuz,"Israeli aerial bombardment has wiped out much of Iran’s ballistic missile capability and decapitated its military command, but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has refused to stop fighting, even promising “irreparable damage” to the US if it intervenes in the conflict in support of its staunch ally, reports Bloomberg.
This has stoked speculation that Iran’s leadership may reach for another way to pressure its enemies to relent -- blocking or effectively closing the Strait of Hormuz to shipping. This narrow waterway at the mouth of the Persian Gulf handles around a quarter of the world’s oil trade. So if Iran were able to deny access to the giant tankers that ferry oil and gas to China, Europe and other major energy consuming regions, it would send oil prices shooting higher and potentially destabilise the global economy. Iran has targeted merchant ships traversing the choke point in the past, and has even threatened to block the strait. The UK issued a rare warning to mariners days before Israel began bombarding Iran, saying increased tensions in the region could impact shipping, while Frontline Ltd, one of the world’s largest oil-tanker operators, said it would be more cautious about offering its vessels to haul cargoes from the Persian Gulf.

Where is the Strait of Hormuz?
The waterway connects the Persian Gulf to the Indian Ocean, with Iran to its north and the United Arab Emirates and Oman to the south. It’s almost 100 miles (161 kilometers) long and 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, with the shipping lanes in each direction just two miles wide. Its shallow depth makes ships potentially vulnerable to mines, and the proximity to land -- Iran, in particular -- leaves vessels open to attack from shore-based missiles or interception by patrol boats and helicopters.
The strait is essential to the global oil trade. Tankers hauled almost 16.5 million barrels per day of crude and condensate from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Iran through the strait in 2024, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The strait is also crucial for liquefied natural gas, or LNG, with more than one-fifth of the world’s supply -- mostly from Qatar -- passing through during the same period.

Could Iran really block the Strait of Hormuz?
Iran would have no legal authority to order a halt to traffic through Hormuz, so would need to achieve this by force or the threat of force.
If its navy tried to bar entry to the strait, it would likely be met with a strong response from the US Fifth Fleet and other Western navies patrolling the area.
But it could cause severe disruption without a single Iranian warship leaving port. One option would be to harry shipping with small, fast patrol boats. Or it could launch drones and fire missiles toward ships from coastal or inland sites. That could make it too risky for commercial ships to venture through.
Similar tactics have been employed successfully by the Houthi militia in Yemen to disrupt traffic through the Bab el Mandeb strait leading into the Red Sea on the other side of the Arabian peninsula. The Houthis have mostly fired missiles and drones at ships after warning owners of vessels linked to the US, the UK and Israel that they will be attacked if they approach the area.
A US-led force in the Red Sea is seeking to protect shipping there. But the number of ships sailing through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden was still down about 70 per cent in June compared with the average level of 2022 and 2023, according to Clarkson Research Services Ltd, a unit of the world’s largest shipbroker. This has forced vessel operators to reroute their traffic around the southern tip of Africa instead of going through the Suez Canal -- a lengthier and more expensive journey for ships traveling between Asia and Europe.
Closing the Strait of Hormuz would quickly hit Iran’s own economy as it would prevent it from exporting its petroleum. And it would antagonize China, the biggest buyer of Iranian oil and a critical partner that’s used its veto power at the UN Security Council to shield Iran from Western-led sanctions or resolutions.
When has Iran disrupted shipping?
Iran has used harassment of ships in the Gulf for decades to register its dissatisfaction with sanctions against it, or as leverage in disputes.
In April 2024, hours before launching a drone and missile attack on Israel, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized an Israel-linked container ship near the Strait of Hormuz. Iran released the ship’s crew the following month, according to trade publication Lloyd’s List. Tehran claimed that the MSC Aries had violated maritime regulations, but analysts pointed to its Israeli ownership connection as a motive.
When it seized a US-bound tanker in April 2023, Iran said the ship had struck another vessel. But the move appeared to be retaliation for the seizure off Malaysia’s coast of a ship loaded with Iranian crude by US authorities on the grounds of sanctions violations.
In May 2022, Iran seized two Greek tankers and held them for six months, presumably a response to the confiscation by Greek and US authorities of Iranian oil on a different ship. The cargo was eventually released and the Greek tankers freed. So, too, was the oil on a tanker that Iran said it impounded in January “in retaliation for the theft of oil by the US.”

Has Iran ever closed the Strait of Hormuz?
Not so far. During the 1980-88 war between Iraq and Iran, Iraqi forces attacked an oil export terminal at Kharg Island, northwest of the strait, in part to provoke an Iranian retaliation that would draw the US into the conflict. Afterward, in what was called the Tanker War, the two sides attacked 451 vessels between them. That significantly raised the cost of insuring tankers and helped push up oil prices. When sanctions were imposed on Iran in 2011, it threatened to close the strait, but ultimately backed off. Commodore Alireza Tangsiri, head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps naval forces, said shortly before the MSC Aries seizure that Iran has the option of disrupting traffic through the Strait of Hormuz, but chooses not to.

How did the US and allies respond to threats to Hormuz shipping in the past?
During the Tanker War, the US Navy resorted to escorting vessels through the Gulf. In 2019, it dispatched an aircraft carrier and B-52 bombers to the region. The same year, the US started Operation Sentinel in response to Iran’s disruption of shipping. Ten other nations -- including the UK, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain -- later joined the operation, known now as the International Maritime Security Construct. Since late 2023, much of the focus on protecting shipping has switched away from the Strait of Hormuz and onto the southern Red Sea, the region’s other vital waterway, and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connects it to the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean. Attacks by the Iran-backed Houthis on shipping entering or exiting the Red Sea became a greater concern than the Strait of Hormuz.

"FTO orders FBR to suspend shop sealing, train field staff",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323213-fto-orders-fbr-to-suspend-shop-sealing-train-field-staff,"LAHORE: In a major relief for Tier-I retailers across Pakistan, the Federal Tax Ombudsman (FTO) has directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to halt the sealing of shops and address critical technical issues plaguing the Point of Sale (POS) system.
Dr Asif Mahmood Jah, the FTO, issued a detailed ruling in favour of the formal retail sector following a complaint lodged by the Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP) through its legal counsel Advocate Ahmed Naseer. The complaint highlighted serious concerns, including POS system failures, high integration costs, profile disconnections, missing invoice uploads and poor coordination between the FBR and its automation arm PRAL.
The FTO instructed that no Tier-I retail outlets be sealed until all technical faults -- such as profile expiry issues leading to POS disconnections and automatic version changes -- are fully resolved. It further recommended that the FBR consult with CAP on future POS-related glitches and enforcement strategies to ensure mutual understanding and smoother compliance.
The ombudsman also noted a lack of technical training among the FBR’s field officers, which limits their ability to resolve systemic issues. Enhanced coordination with PRAL was advised to bridge this gap.
The FTO also directed the FBR to establish an advance warning system to alert Tier-I retailers of impending POS disconnections, token expiries or automatic shutdowns to avoid abrupt operational disruptions. It also recommended that POS security tokens should remain valid for a minimum of five years, with sufficient prior notice given before expiry.
A longstanding issue raised by retailers -- the absence of a bulk download feature in the POS system -- was acknowledged by the FBR, which has since submitted a change request form (CRF). The FTO urged swift implementation of this feature.
The ruling confirmed that invoices often fail to sync with FBR servers, with retailers receiving ‘fake disconnect’ errors despite their systems functioning normally. While the FBR attributed this to substandard third-party software, the FTO stressed the need for both technical and administrative solutions.
The complaint also revealed that some integrators charge as much as Rs10 per invoice or up to Rs1 million annually, creating a significant financial burden. In response, the FBR clarified that PRAL’s services as a Licensed Integrator would now be provided free of cost under SRO 69(I)/2025.
To ensure ongoing accountability and system improvement, the FTO advised the FBR to conduct quarterly meetings with key stakeholders, especially CAP, to monitor POS performance and resolve issues in real time.
This decision is expected to ease pressure on thousands of Tier-I retailers who voluntarily integrated with the FBR’s POS system but faced persistent technical challenges, financial losses, and undue enforcement actions. The FTO emphasised that resolving these issues is essential for strengthening tax compliance and advancing Pakistan’s retail documentation drive.

Ton-up Jaiswal makes England toil in first Test as India take control,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323229-ton-up-jaiswal-makes-england-toil-in-first-test-as-india-take-control,"LEEDS: India´s Yashasvi Jaiswal marked his first Test innings in England with a superb century and captain Shubman Gill hit an unbeaten fifty as the tourists took control of the series opener at Headingley on Friday.
India dominated the bulk of the morning´s play after being sent into bat, only to lose two wickets in quick succession as they ended the session on 92-2.
By tea on the first day of the opening Test in a five-match series, India were firmly back in control on 215-2, with 23-year-old opener Jaiswal 100 not out.
Gill, in his first innings as skipper since succeeding the retired Rohit Sharma, was also in fine form on 58 not out.
The pair had so far shared an unbroken partnership of 123 in 25.2 overs, with India going through the second session without losing a wicket.
England captain Ben Stokes´ decision to bowl, which may have been influenced by the fact the last six Tests at Headingley have all been won by the team batting second, meant England did not have to face India´s star paceman Jasprit Bumrah at the start of the match.
It also gave England a chance to strike an early blow against an India top order without experienced batsmen Rohit and Virat Kohli after the pair retired from Test cricket within days of each other last month.
But an England attack without retired greats James Anderson and Stuart Broad and missing injured express quicks Jofra Archer and Mark Wood, rarely threatened on a good pitch.
Chris Woakes, sidelined by an ankle problem earlier in the season, returned to take the new ball in place of the injured Gus Atkinson, with Brydon Carse given a home debut in the other change to the England side that beat Zimbabwe recently.
Jaiswal and Rahul seized on anything loose as India made a stylish start to their quest for just a fourth Test series win in England after their triumphs in 1971, 1986 and 2007.  With India´s openers approaching a century partnership, England made a double strike.
Rahul, on 42, drove loosely at a wide ball from Carse and edged to Joe Root at first slip
Moments later, number three Sai Sudharsan joined the long list of batsmen who have made a duck on Test debut when a glance off Stokes was well caught by diving wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.
But India´s third-wicket duo seized back the momentum with a century stand full of sublime stroke-play.

Australia drop struggling Labuschagne for first West Indies Test,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323230-australia-drop-struggling-labuschagne-for-first-west-indies-test,"SYDNEY: Australia on Friday dropped Marnus Labuschagne for the opening match of their three-Test tour of the West Indies after a poor run of form while Steve Smith is out injured.
Teenager Sam Konstas and Josh Inglis come into the starting XI for the opening match in Barbados starting on Wednesday.
Labuschagne opened the batting in the World Test Championship final loss to South Africa last week but managed scores of only 17 and 22 on a challenging Lord´s pitch.
His last hundred for Australia in Test matches was in July 2023, against England at Manchester. Since then, Labuschagne has averaged 24.7 with the bat, in 16 matches.
“Marnus at his best can be a really important member of this team,” chair of selectors George Bailey said.
“He understands his output hasn´t been at the level we, or he, expects.
“We will continue working with him on the areas of his game we feel he needs to rediscover. We continue to value his skill and expect him to work through the challenge positively.”
Smith injured his finger while fielding in the slips at Lord´s. He left the field and did not return, watching South Africa´s winning run chase from the pavilion.
“Steve needs more time for the wound to heal so we´ll give him another week´s rest and assess his functionality after that,” Bailey said.
The 19-year-old Konstas will earn his third cap for Australia, and his first since January.
He made a blistering debut against India in December, blasting 60 from just 65 balls opening the batting and playing a number of audacious scoop shots against Jasprit Bumrah.
Konstas managed only 53 runs in his next three innings, but the teenager´s raw talent has selectors excited.
Inglis will also make his third appearance in Test cricket, having made 102 on debut against Sri Lanka in January.
Bailey said the batting order and final team would be determined closer to the first Test.

Pakistan upset France to reach Nations Cup final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323232-pakistan-upset-france-to-reach-nations-cup-final,"ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic and emotionally charged semi-final that will go down as one of the most memorable encounters in recent hockey history, Pakistan defied the odds and stunned World No.10 France in a nail-biting penalty shootout to storm into the final of the Nations Cup Hockey Tournament at the National Stadium in Kuala Lumpur on Friday.
With nerves of steel and hearts brimming with determination, the Greenshirts edged past France 3-2 on penalties, after the match ended in a thrilling 3-3 deadlock at the end of regulation time. The victory marked a major statement from Pakistan, showcasing their grit, skill and revival on the global hockey stage.
The match was nothing short of a rollercoaster. Pakistan, who trailed earlier, roared back in the third quarter, turning the tide through a flurry of breathtaking counterattacks and clever playmaking. Rana Waheed Ashraf, the heartbeat of Pakistan’s revival, sliced through the French defense to set up an easy finish for Afraz in the 39th minute, narrowing the margin to 2-1.
Moments later, Mohammad Sufyan unleashed a thunderbolt from a penalty corner, leveling the score at 2-2 and electrifying the Pakistan bench. Then came the moment of magic -- Hamaduddin, with a swift field goal, stunned the French camp to put Pakistan 3-2 ahead, and for a moment, it seemed victory was firmly in their grasp.
However, drama unfolded in the dying minutes. With just three minutes left, France were awarded a highly controversial penalty corner following a video referral that overturned the on-field umpire’s decision for a free hit. Victor stepped up and converted, bringing France level at 3-3 and forcing the match into a shootout.
As pressure mounted, it was Pakistan’s young goalkeeper Muneeb who stood tall. Displaying nerves of steel and superb reflexes, he pulled off decisive saves during the penalty shootout, securing a 3-2 victory and booking Pakistan’s ticket to the final.
Rana Waheed Ashraf, whose relentless energy and creative brilliance ignited Pakistan’s comeback, was deservedly named Man of the Match. His tireless efforts symbolised the fighting spirit of a team on a mission to reclaim its lost glory.
Interestingly, just a day before the semi-final, Head Coach Tahir Zaman had taken his players through intensive penalty shootout drills, anticipating a close contest. That preparation paid rich dividends as Pakistan held their nerves when it mattered the most.
Now, with momentum on their side and a rejuvenated belief in their abilities, Pakistan stand just one step away from lifting the Nations Cup, a triumph that would mark a major milestone in the country’s hockey resurgence.

During the summit, Gilani met with FIFA Secretary General Mattias Grafstrom, who reaffirmed FIFA’s commitment to advancing football in Pakistan. Grafstrom assured the PFF of continued support in strengthening both technical and administrative infrastructure across the country.

Shaheen eyes BBL brilliance,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323234-shaheen-eyes-bbl-brilliance,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s left-arm pace sensation, Shaheen Shah Afridi, has set a unique target ahead of his stint in the Big Bash League (BBL), revealing his aspirations during an appearance on The Surge Podcast hosted by former Australia captain Aaron Finch.
Afridi, known for his explosive opening spells, expressed his trademark hunger for early breakthroughs: “I wish to maintain my tradition of taking a wicket in the first over in the Big Bash as well.”
Looking ahead to high-profile matchups in the BBL, Afridi singled out some formidable targets: “I’ll try to get all three, Babar Azam, David Warner, and Steve Smith, out in the BBL — not just one,” he stated with a smile. Afridi shared admiration for Australian stalwart David Warner, calling him “a legendary player and a very good human being.” Yet, the respect comes with fierce competition: “Playing against him is always a challenge, but if I get his wicket, that moment will be special for me.”
Excited by the opportunity to experience the unique cricketing culture Down Under, the left-armer highlighted the learning curve and conditions: “The Big Bash is always a challenging league; the bouncy pitches in Australian grounds help fast bowlers.” The Gabba, often referred to as a fortress for Australian cricket, holds a special place in Afridi’s imagination. “I wish that when I run in to bowl at the Gabba, the fans chant ‘Shaheen Afridi’,” he mused, adding that “Mitchell Johnson’s brilliant spell at the Gabba is very memorable.”   Afridi is eager to embrace the broader experience as well: “I will get an opportunity to learn a new culture in the BBL; the Gabba is a fantastic ground.”

NBA great Vlade Divac injured in Montenegro motorcycle crash,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323236-nba-great-vlade-divac-injured-in-montenegro-motorcycle-crash,"BELGRADE: Former basketball star and LA Lakers centre Vlade Divac was recovering on Friday after breaking his hip in motorcycle accident in Montenegro, hospital staff told AFP.
The 57-year-old was injured late Thursday after falling from his motorcycle near the coast, said hospital spokeswoman Ljubica Mitrovic.
“Divac was immediately brought to the hospital in Risan, where doctors conducted thorough examinations,” she said, referring to a town about 47 kilometres (29 miles) west of the capital Podgorica.
“Unfortunately, it was confirmed that he had suffered a hip fracture. Surgery was performed.”
Divac is in a stable condition at the hospital.
Drafted into the NBA in 1989 by the Los Angeles Lakers, the towering centre became one of the first European players to make an impact in the league.
He played seven seasons for the Lakers before moving on to the Charlotte Hornets then the Sacramento Kings, and eventually finishing his NBA career back with the Lakers.
Mentored by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Magic Johnson, he quickly adapted to the NBA and became the first player born and trained outside the United States to play more than 1,000 games in the league.
A silver medallist in Olympic basketball with both Yugoslavia and later Serbia, he was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2019 and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2010.
He played 117 games for the national team of Yugoslavia and later Serbia and Montenegro, winning World Championship titles in 1990 and 2002, and was also crowned European champion in 1989, 1991, and 1995.  The hospital has asked the public and media to respect Divac’s privacy during his recovery.

Salah among nominees for PFA Player of the Year award,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323237-salah-among-nominees-for-pfa-player-of-the-year-award,"LONDON: Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah was among six players nominated for the Professional Footballers’ Association Men’s Player of the Year award on Friday.
The 33-year-old played a key role in Liverpool’s Premier League title triumph last season with 29 goals and 18 assists.
The Egypt star was voted Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers’ Association -- securing almost 90 percent of the votes, marking the biggest winning margin this century -- and is the firm favourite to land the PFA prize.
Salah is joined on the shortlist by Liverpool team-mate Alexis Mac Allister, Arsenal’s Declan Rice, Cole Palmer of Chelsea, Newcastle striker Alexander Isak and Manchester United midfielder Bruno Fernandes.
Palmer, who won the PFA Young Player of the Year award for 2023-24, was a surprise choice for the list given his struggles for Chelsea last season.

Three-time world champion figure skater Sakamoto to retire,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323238-three-time-world-champion-figure-skater-sakamoto-to-retire,"TOKYO: Japan’s three-time world figure skating champion Kaori Sakamoto said Friday she will retire after the Winter Olympics in February.
“I think it’s better for me to make this a clean break than to continue for two or three years,” said the 25-year-old, who won team silver and singles bronze medals at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.
“I’ll be 29 at the Olympics (in 2030) so I thought that’s not possible,” Sakamoto told reporters at an event in Kobe.
“I want to finish every competition with no regrets, so I want to seek perfection more than ever before,” she said.
Sakamoto finished second at the world championships in Boston in March, missing out on becoming the first woman in 65 years to win four consecutive world crowns.
She said after Boston that the experience would help her as she looked forward to the Milan Cortina 2026 Olympics.

Liverpool agree for Bournemouth’s Kerkez: reports,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323239-liverpool-agree-for-bournemouth-s-kerkez-reports,"LONDON: Liverpool have agreed to sign Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez in a deal worth a reported Â£40 million ($54 million), according to reports on Friday.
Kerkez is due to travel to Merseyside for a medical before completing his move to the Premier League champions.
The 21-year-old caught Liverpool’s eye last season with his fine form for Bournemouth, including two goals and five assists in 38 Premier League appearances.
Liverpool sporting director Richard Hughes brought Kerkez to Bournemouth from AZ Alkmaar during his time at the Vitality Stadium.
Serbia-born Kerkez began his career at Hungarian outfit Gyor before moving to AC Milan, where he failed to make an appearance for the Serie A club.
He joined Dutch side AZ Alkmaar in 2022, arriving in the Premier League with Bournemouth a year later.
Kerkez’s impending arrival at Anfield raises questions about the future of Liverpool left-back Andrew Robertson, who has been linked with Atletico Madrid.
Kerkez will become Liverpool’s latest signing in a busy summer transfer window for boss Arne Slot.
The Reds have already secured the signature of Netherlands right-back Jeremie Frimpong from Bayer Leverkusen to replace Trent Alexander-Arnold, who has joined Real Madrid.
Liverpool are also on the verge of signing Leverkusen’s Germany playmaker Florian Wirtz after reportedly agreeing a fee that could rise to a British record Â£116 million.
Wirtz is believed to have undergone a medical with Liverpool on Friday ahead of the official confirmation of his transfer.

Foreign keepers to play in South Korea after 27 years,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323240-foreign-keepers-to-play-in-south-korea-after-27-years,"SEOUL: South Korean football will lift a ban on foreign goalkeepers that has been in place in the domestic game since 1999, officials said on Friday.
The rule was originally brought in over fears that local goalkeepers were not getting enough playing time in the K League, which had fewer teams than it does now.
South Korean football bosses announced the change following a board meeting of the Korea Professional Football League (K League) in Seoul on Thursday.
“Starting in 2026, clubs will be permitted to register foreign goalkeepers,” a press release said.
“The K League previously restricted their participation beginning in 1996 and introduced a full ban in 1999 to encourage the development of domestic goalkeepers, as most clubs at the time relied on foreign players in the position.”  The change will apply to K League 1 and K League 2.

PSG stunned by Botafogo after Messi lights up Club World Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323241-psg-stunned-by-botafogo-after-messi-lights-up-club-world-cup,"PASADENA, United States: European champions Paris Saint-Germain suffered a shock 1-0 Club World Cup defeat to Brazilian side Botafogo on Thursday after Lionel Messi lit up the tournament with a brilliant free-kick winner for Inter Miami.
Atletico Madrid and Palmeiras also won as the second round of group matches began, but it was Botafogo who stole the headlines.
A first-half goal from Igor Jesus proved the difference as last year’s Copa Libertadores winners all but sealed a place in the knockout rounds from Group B in front of 53,699 fans at the Pasadena Rose Bowl in California.
PSG are one of the favourites for FIFA’s 32-team tournament after a dazzling season which culminated with a scintillating 5-0 demolition of Inter Milan in the Champions League final.
But their hopes of securing a victory which would have seen them become the first side into the last 16 were stymied by a resilient performance from their opponents from Rio de Janeiro.
“A lot of people wondered, but we showed how strong Botafogo is,” goalscorer Jesus said after the win, which kept all of South America’s representatives unbeaten at the competition in the United States.
“It was a difficult game and we had to defend well, and we did our job and scored a goal.”
Botafogo took the lead against the run of play on 36 minutes as Jefferson Savarino’s through ball split the PSG defence and released Jesus.
He then did brilliantly to wrongfoot the covering Willian Pacho before sweeping a shot that took a slight deflection past goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma on its way into the net.
“We knew it was going to be a very difficult match -- they defended very well,” said PSG coach Luis Enrique.
“This Club World Cup is very intense and difficult and all the teams are highly motivated, especially when they’re playing against us.”
Botafogo’s win leaves them firmly on course for the last 16, with a final group game against Atletico to come on Monday.
Atletico bounced back from a 4-0 loss to PSG as Diego Simeone’s side beat Seattle Sounders 3-1.
Pablo Barrios scored twice, including an 11th-minute opener which crashed in off the underside of the crossbar.
Belgian Axel Witsel came off the bench at half time and almost immediately made it 2-0, nodding in from close range after a Marcos Llorente shot was tipped onto the woodwork.
Albert Rusnak quickly pulled one back for Seattle, only for Barrios to score again for 3-1.
Botafogo top Group B with six points, with PSG and Atletico each on three and Seattle facing probable elimination after two defeats.
Earlier, Messi scored a trademark free-kick to secure a 2-1 comeback win for Inter Miami against Porto in Atlanta in Group A.
The Argentine superstar found the top corner with a set-piece nine minutes after half time to clinch a surprise victory for the MLS side and give them a strong chance of progressing. Samu Aghehowa’s early penalty gave Porto the lead and they had the better of the first half.
But Telasco Segovia blasted Miami level and then Messi’s free-kick helped them claim a noteworthy scalp.
“It’s a huge joy, the whole team made a big effort, we worked really well,” Messi told broadcaster DAZN.
“It’s a really important win for us and we have to enjoy it.
“You can see that we want to compete and today we competed against a really good European team.”
Javier Mascherano’s Inter Miami have four points from two games, meaning they are level atop the group with Palmeiras. The Brazilians beat Egypt’s Al Ahly 2-0 at MetLife Stadium outside New York.  A Wessam Abou Ali own goal gave Palmeiras a 49th-minute lead before Flaco Lopez doubled their advantage 10 minutes later.
The match was then suspended in the 63rd minute because of a weather warning, with players and fans instructed to take shelter because of a nearby storm before the action eventually resumed.  A draw between Inter Miami and Palmeiras on Monday will send both teams into the last 16.

US refuses visa for members of Senegal women’s basketball team: Dakar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323242-us-refuses-visa-for-members-of-senegal-women-s-basketball-team-dakar,"DAKAR: The United States rejected multiple visas for members of the Senegal women’s basketball team which was scheduled to train in America, according to Dakar officials, as Washington tightens border controls and reportedly mulls a travel ban extension.
The tense border situation has caused consternation for some athletes and fans who plan to attend the 2026 FIFA World Cup and the 2028 Olympics in the United States.
Senegal is among 36 nations that the United States is considering adding to a travel ban barring entry to its territory, according to an internal administration memo.
In a heated post, Senegalese Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko said on Facebook Thursday that he had been “informed about the refusal to issue visas to several members of the Senegalese women’s national basketball team”.
He said that he had instructed the minister of sports to cancel what was to have been a 10-day training camp in the United States.
According to Babacar Ndiaye, president of the Senegalese Basketball Federation, the United States only renewed visas for “those who held old visas and rejected new requests”.
A total of 12 visas -- five for players and seven for the team’s staff -- were rejected, according to a federation statement late Thursday.
Les Lionnes had been slated to train in the United States ahead of the Afrobasket 2025 tournament in Ivory Coast, which begins in July.
A spokesperson for the US State Department told AFP that it was not able to comment on individual cases, while the US Embassy in Senegal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Seven arrested in London over Iran embassy ‘altercation’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323310-seven-arrested-in-london-over-iran-embassy-altercation,"LONDON: Seven men were arrested on suspicion of assault after an “altercation” on Friday outside Iran´s embassy in London left two men injured, police said.
London´s Metropolitan Police banned protestors from gathering in the area in west London after seven men were arrested “on suspicion of grievous bodily harm”.
Protestors opposing Iran´s clerical leadership had gathered outside the embassy in west London since Sunday, hanging up flags from the nation´s ousted monarchy alongside some Israeli flags.

"More than 53,000 evacuated in central China over heavy rain",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323311-more-than-53-000-evacuated-in-central-china-over-heavy-rain,"BEIJING: Tens of thousands of people have been evacuated in the central Chinese province of Hunan due to heavy rain, Beijing´s state media said on Friday, as the country endures a summer of extreme weather.
State news agency Xinhua said that as of 5:00 pm (0900 GMT) on Friday, more than 53,000 people have been evacuated across Hunan.
Areas in the province are expected to experience torrential rain, with the downpour in some isolated areas predicted to be “extremely heavy”, Xinhua said, citing local weather departments.
Some parts of Hunan have seen precipitation exceeding 400 millimeters (16 inches) since Wednesday, the state-run news agency said.
The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) also warned that southern and central parts of the country will experience heavy rain on Saturday, pointing to “significant threat of mountain flood disasters” in some areas, Xinhua reported.
The warning comes days after nearly 70,000 people in southern China were evacuated after heavy flooding caused by Typhoon Wutip.
And last month, swathes of northern and central China sweltered under record May heat, with temperatures rising well above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in several major cities.
China has endured spates of extreme weather events from searing heat and drought to downpours and floods for several summers running.
The country is the world´s largest greenhouse gas emitter but also a renewable energy powerhouse, seeking to cut carbon dioxide emissions to net zero by 2060. Torrential rains last August, triggered by Typhoon Gaemi, which moved from the Philippines and Taiwan to make landfall in eastern China, killed at least 30 people and left dozens missing.

Australian trial says tech for social media teen ban can work,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323312-australian-trial-says-tech-for-social-media-teen-ban-can-work,"SYDNEY: Australia´s world-leading ban on under-16s joining social media sites cleared a big hurdle Friday as a trial found digital age checks can work “robustly and effectively”.
Sites such as Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok and X could face fines of up to Aus$50 million (US$32 million) for failing to comply with the legislation, which was passed in November.
They have described the law -- which is due to come into effect by the end of this year -- as vague, rushed and “problematic”.
There has been widespread concern over children´s use of online platforms as evidence shows that social media can have negative effects on children´s mental and physical health.
Digital age verification systems -- which would be critical to the ban -- can work, said the interim findings of an independent Age Assurance Technology Trial, conducted for the government.
“These preliminary findings indicate that age assurance can be done in Australia privately, robustly and effectively,” it said.
There are “no significant technological barriers” to deploying age checking systems in Australia, said the trial´s project director, Tony Allen.
“These solutions are technically feasible, can be integrated flexibly into existing services and can support the safety and rights of children online,” he said in a statement.
In a separate interview with Australia´s Nine Network, Allen said preventing children circumventing age verification tools was a “big challenge”, however.
“I don´t think anything is completely foolproof,” he said.
There are a “plethora” of approaches to age verification but no single solution to suit all cases, said the trial report, in which 53 organisations took part.

Venice divided ahead of billionaire Bezos’ ‘wedding of the century’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323313-venice-divided-ahead-of-billionaire-bezos-wedding-of-the-century,"ROME: Venice is divided ahead of next week’s celebrity wedding of US tech-tycoon Jeff Bezos and Laura Sanchez, with some looking forward to the glitz and glamour, while others fear it will turn the scenic city of gondolas and palazzi into an amusement park.
Many details of the wedding are still under wraps - including the precise day it will happen - but it is certain that scores of stars from film, fashion and business will arrive to see Bezos tie the knot - provided they can get past the protesters.
One group has plastered banners on the city’s famous Rialto Bridge reading “No space for Bezos!” and threatened peaceful blockades, complaining that the medieval and Renaissance city needs public services and housing, not celebrities and over-tourism.
“Bezos arrogantly believes he can take over the city and turn it into his own private party venue,” said Tommaso Cacciari, a leading light of the “No space for Bezos” campaign.
Mayor Luigi Brugnaro and regional governor Luca Zaia, on the other hand, argue that the wedding will bring an economic windfall to local businesses, including the motor boats and gondolas that operate its myriad canals.
Eleven years ago actor George Clooney married human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in Venice, turning the city into Hollywood on the Adriatic with a weekend of lavish celebrations.

Thousands protest in Iraq against Iran-Israel war,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323314-thousands-protest-in-iraq-against-iran-israel-war,"BAGHDAD: Thousands of supporters of powerful Iraqi cleric Moqtada Sadr rallied on Friday in Baghdad and other cities against Israel´s war with Iran, AFP correspondents said.
“No to Israel! No to America!” chanted demonstrators gathered after Friday prayers in the Sadr City district of Baghdad, Moqtada Sadr´s stronghold in the capital, holding umbrellas to shield themselves from Iraq´s scorching summer sun.
“It is an unjust war... Israel has no right” to hit Iran, said protester Abu Hussein.
“Israel is not in it for the (Iranian) nuclear (programme). What Israel and the Americans want is to dominate the Middle East,” added the 54-year-old taxi driver.
He said he hoped Iran would come out of the war victorious, and that Iraq should support its neighbour “with money, weapons and protests”.
In Iraq´s southern city of Basra, around 2,000 people demonstrated after the prayers, according to an AFP correspondent.
Cleric Qusai al-Assadi, 43, denounced Israel´s use of Iraqi airspace to bomb Iran. “It is a violation of Iraq´s sovereignty,” he said, warning against “a third world war against Islam.”
Echoing the views of Sadr, Assadi said that Iraq should not be dragged into the conflict.
In a statement earlier this week, Sadr condemned “the Zionist and American terrorism” and the “aggression against neighbouring Iran, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen”, referring to Israel´s military operations in those countries.
Sadr, who once led a militia fighting US-led forces after the 2003 invasion, retains a devoted following of millions among the country´s majority community of Shiite Muslims, and wields great influence over Iraqi politics.
He has previously criticised Tehran-backed Iraqi armed factions, who have threatened US interests in the region if the United States were to join Israel in its war against Iran.
Iraq is both a significant ally of Iran and a strategic partner of Israel´s key supporter, the United States, and has for years negotiated a delicate balancing act between the two foes.
It has only recently regained a semblance of stability after decades of devastating conflicts and turmoil.

"Russia might try to take Ukrainian city of Sumy, says Putin",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323315-russia-might-try-to-take-ukrainian-city-of-sumy-says-putin,"SAINT PETERSBURG: Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday he did not “rule out” his forces attempting to seize the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy, casting fresh doubt over the prospect of peace talks between Moscow and Kyiv.
Ukraine said Putin´s comments showed “disdain” for the peace process.
Diplomatic efforts to end the three-year conflict have stalled in recent weeks and Kyiv has accused Moscow of deliberately sabotaging a peace deal to prolong its full-scale offensive on the country.
Russia currently occupies around a fifth of Ukraine and has claimed four Ukrainian regions as its own since launching its assault in 2022, in addition to Crimea, which it captured in 2014.
The Sumy region is not one of the regions Moscow has formally annexed, although Russian forces have recently made inroads there for the first time in three years.
At Russia´s flagship economic forum in Saint Petersburg, Putin suggested Moscow could take Sumy as part of the creation of a “buffer zone” along the border and repeated his denial of Ukrainian statehood.
“We have no objective to take Sumy, but in principle I do not rule it out... They pose a constant threat to us, constantly shelling the border areas,” Putin said.
“I consider Russians and Ukrainians to be one people. In that sense, all of Ukraine is ours,” he told attendees, when asked why his army was entering areas Moscow did not claim as its own.
“There is a saying: wherever a Russian soldier sets foot, that is ours.”
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga described Putin´s comments as “deranged” and called for Kyiv´s allies to slap “devastating sanctions” on Russia.
“The only way to force Russia into peace is to deprive it of its sense of impunity,” he wrote in a post on X.

Thai PM meets army commander in attempt to defuse political crisis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323316-thai-pm-meets-army-commander-in-attempt-to-defuse-political-crisis,"BANGKOK: Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra held make-up talks on Friday with an army commander she criticised in a leaked phone call as she struggled to defuse a crisis threatening to topple her government.
The daughter of controversial billionaire ex-PM Thaksin Shinawatra and in office for less than a year, Paetongtarn is facing calls to quit or announce an election as anger flares over the call with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.
Her main coalition partner, the conservative Bhumjaithai party, pulled out on Wednesday, saying she had insulted the country and the army and leaving her government on the point of collapse.
She suffered another blow on Friday as reports emerged that another coalition partner was threatening to quit unless she stepped down as prime minister.
The crisis has sent the Thai stock market plunging to a five-year low and comes as the kingdom struggles to fire up its sluggish economy, with US President Donald Trump´s threatened trade tariffs looming.
Paetongtarn, 38, visited troops in northeast Thailand on Friday to patch things up with Lieutenant General Boonsin Padklang after she was caught disparaging him as an “opponent” during the call with Hun Sen.
Boonsin commands Thai forces along the border with Cambodia, where a long-running dispute flared into deadly clashes last month, and Paetongtarn´s criticism of him drew accusations of disloyalty from right-wing nationalist critics.

Over 400 asylum seekers on Greece’s Gavdos island: coastguard,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323317-over-400-asylum-seekers-on-greece-s-gavdos-island-coastguard,"ATHENS: Over 400 asylum seekers have landed at the small island of Gavdos near Crete, a new entry point increasingly used by migrant smugglers in past months, the Greek coastguard said on Friday.
The asylum seekers arrived in separate groups over the last 24 hours, with the largest including over 350 people off Gavdos, the coastguard told AFP.
The migrants´ fishing boat was detected by an EU border agency Frontex vessel on Thursday. A Greek coastguard vessel and four nearby cargo ships participated in the rescue operation.
The asylum seekers are to be transferred to a temporary reception centre in Paleochora in Crete for registration and identification.
On Thursday morning, another group of about 40 migrants was spotted on a coast of Gavdos by the coastguard. They were also transferred to the camp in Crete, according to an official statement.
No details have been released so far regarding the migrants´ nationalities.
Located at the external borders of the EU in the southeastern Mediterranean, Greece is one of the main gateways to Europe for people fleeing war and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and the Indian subcontinent.
According to UN figures, over 14,000 people have arrived by sea this year, compared to over 54,000 in 2024.

UK MPs vote in favour of assisted dying bill in historic step,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323318-uk-mps-vote-in-favour-of-assisted-dying-bill-in-historic-step,"LONDON: Britain´s parliament took a historic step towards allowing euthanasia on Friday when MPs backed contentious legislation that would introduce assisted dying for terminally ill people.
Lawmakers in the lower House of Commons chamber voted 314 in favour to 291 to send the proposal to the upper House of Lords for further scrutiny following four hours of emotional debate.
The outcome sparked celebrations among supporters gathered outside parliament who say legalised euthanasia will give people with an incurable illness dignity and choice at the end of their lives.
But opponents attending a neighbouring counter-protest said they feared vulnerable people could be coerced into dying and urged lawmakers to focus on improving palliative care instead.
The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill would allow assisted suicide in England and Wales for adults who have been given less than six months to live.
They would have to be able to administer the life-ending substance themselves, and any patient´s wish to die would have to be signed off by two doctors and a panel of experts.
A change in the law would see Britain emulate several other countries in Europe and elsewhere that allow some form of assisted dying, including Belgium and the Netherlands.
Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, who proposed the legislation, told on Friday´s so-called third reading debate that a law change would “offer a compassionate and safe choice” for terminally ill people.

Most of Europe’s bathing waters safe for swimming: report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323319-most-of-europe-s-bathing-waters-safe-for-swimming-report,"COPENHAGEN: More than three quarters of bathing waters monitored in the European Union, Albania and Switzerland were of “excellent” quality in 2024, the 27-member bloc´s environment agency said on Friday.
All but four percent met the EU´s minimum standard (“sufficient”) and just 1.5 percent were of “poor” quality, the European Environment Agency said in its annual update on the beaches, rivers and lakes that are tested for faecal contamination.
Overall, Europe´s bathing waters were of the same standard in 2024 as in the year before.
The EEA monitors more than 22,000 bathing areas for bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and intestinal enterococci, caused essentially by pollutant run-off from livestock farms and household sewage pipes.
“Europeans can confidently bathe in the vast majority of the EU´s bathing sites that meet the EU´s bathing quality standards,” European Environment Commissioner Jessika Roswall said.
The best bathing waters last year were in Cyprus, where 99.2 percent were of excellent quality, followed by Bulgaria with 97.9 percent, Greece with 97 and Croatia with 95.2.
The EU-wide average was 85 percent.
Albania came bottom in the ranking, with just 16 percent of excellent quality bathing waters -- a drop of more than 25 percentage points over the space of a year.  Poland was second from bottom at 58.1 percent -- a slight improvement from 2023.

US appeals court allows Trump control of National Guard in Los Angeles,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323320-us-appeals-court-allows-trump-control-of-national-guard-in-los-angeles,"SAN FRANCISCO, United States: A US appeals court on Friday ruled that President Donald Trump could continue control of National Guard troops in Los Angeles, over the objections of California Governor Gavin Newsom.
Trump ordered the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops and hundreds of Marines into Los Angeles this month in response to protests over federal immigration sweeps -- a move opposed by city leaders and Newsom.
A lower court judge had last week ordered Trump to return control of the California National Guard to Newsom, saying the president´s decision to deploy them to protest-hit Los Angeles was “illegal.”
But a three-judge panel of the US Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that Trump was within his rights when he ordered 4,000 members of the National Guard into service for 60 days to “protect federal personnel performing federal functions and to protect federal property.”
“Affording appropriate deference to the President´s determination, we conclude that he likely acted within his authority in federalizing the National Guard,” they said in their 38-page ruling.
Trump celebrated the decision in a post on Truth Social Thursday night, calling it a “BIG WIN.”

Israeli forces kill 60 Palestinian aid seekers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323321-israeli-forces-kill-60-palestinian-aid-seekers,"GAZA CITY, Palestinian Territories: Gaza´s civil defence agency said 31 Palestinian aid seekers were among at least 60 people killed on Friday by Israeli forces, the latest in a string of deadly incidents near aid distribution sites.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that five people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 26 others near a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, an Israeli-controlled strip of land that bisects the Palestinian territory.
Thousands of Palestinians have gathered there daily in the hope of receiving food rations, as famine looms across Gaza after more than 20 months of war.
The Israeli army told AFP that its troops in the Netzarim area had first fired “warning shots” at “suspects” approaching them.
When the individuals continued advancing, “an aircraft struck and eliminated the suspects in order to remove the threat,” the army said.
Elsewhere in the territory on Friday, Bassal said 14 people were killed in two separate strikes in and around the central city of Deir el-Balah, and 13 others in three Israeli air strikes in the Gaza City area.
One of those strikes, which killed three people, hit a phone charging station in the city, Bassal said.
In southern Gaza, two people were killed “by Israeli gunfire” in two separate incidents, he added.
Meanwhile, Israel may have fallen short of its human-rights obligations under a cooperation deal with the EU over its offensive in Gaza, a review of the agreement found on Friday, upping pressure on Brussels to take action.
Israel´s conduct in the Palestinian territory was likely not in line with the principles laid out in the EU-Israel Association Agreement, which forms the basis for trade ties, according to the audit drafted by the EU´s diplomatic service.
“On the basis of the assessments made by the independent international institutions... there are indications that Israel would be in breach of its human rights obligations,” said the document seen by AFP.
Representatives of the EU´s 27 member states were handed the report on Friday.
The text cited Israel´s blockade of humanitarian aid for Gaza, the high number of civilian casualties, attacks on journalists and the massive displacement and destruction caused by the war among the possible rights violations.
The EU´s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, is to present its findings to foreign ministers from the bloc´s 27 nations in Brussels on Monday.
But what action might follow is unclear, as the outbreak of Israel´s war with Iran threatens to scupper the necessary consensus among EU member states for Brussels to take any significant step.

US judge orders release of pro-Palestinian activist Khalil,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323322-us-judge-orders-release-of-pro-palestinian-activist-khalil,"NEW YORK: A US judge ordered on Friday that Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil be released from immigration custody, a major victory for rights groups that challenged what they called the Trump administration’s unlawful targeting of a pro-Palestinian activist.
Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests against Israel’s war on Gaza, was arrested by immigration agents in the lobby of his university residence in Manhattan on March 8. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has called the protests antisemitic and vowed to deport foreign students who took part.
Khalil condemned antisemitism and racism in interviews with CNN and other news outlets last year. Khalil, a legal permanent resident of the United States, says he is being punished for his political speech in violation of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment.
US District Judge Michael Farbiarz of Newark, New Jersey, ruled on June 11 the government was violating Khalil’s free speech rights by detaining him under a little-used law granting the US secretary of state power to seek deportation of non-citizens whose presence in the country was deemed adverse to US foreign policy interests.
But the judge declined on June 13 to order Khalil’s release from a detention center in Jena, Louisiana, after President Donald Trump’s administration said Khalil was being held on a separate charge that he withheld information from his application for lawful permanent residency.
Khalil’s lawyers deny that allegation and say people are rarely detained on such charges. On June 16, they urged Farbiarz to grant a separate request from their client to be released on bail or be transferred to immigration detention in New Jersey to be closer to his family in New York.
Khalil, 30, became a US permanent resident last year, and his wife and newborn son are US citizens.
Trump administration lawyers wrote in a June 17 filing that Khalil’s request for release should be addressed to the judge overseeing his immigration case, an administrative process over whether he can be deported, rather than to Farbiarz, who is considering whether Khalil’s March 8 arrest and subsequent detention were constitutional.

Pro-Palestinian activists break into UK’s largest air base,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323323-pro-palestinian-activists-break-into-uk-s-largest-air-base,"LONDON: Pro-Palestinian activists broke into the UK´s largest air force base in southeast England and vandalised two planes in an act condemned by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as “disgraceful” on Friday.
“The act of vandalism committed at RAF Brize Norton is disgraceful,” Starmer said on X after campaign group Palestine Action posted a video claiming to show its activist breaking into the Royal Air Force base in Oxfordshire.
In the video posted on X, the activists appear to spray a plane with red paint while roaming the base on scooters.
“Palestine Action break into RAF Brize Norton and damage two military aircrafts,” claimed the group, which has been behind several stunts protesting the UK´s role in the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

Macron says Europe must become ‘space power’ again,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323324-macron-says-europe-must-become-space-power-again,"LE BOURGET, France: President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that Europe must again become a global space power, warning that France risked being squeezed out of the global low-orbit satellite constellation market.
Macron spoke at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget outside the French capital a day after France more than doubled its stake in satellite operator Eutelsat, the EU rival to Elon Musk´s Starlink.
Macron called for more investment as the European space industry struggles to remain competitive in the face of US and Chinese rivals.
“SpaceX has disrupted the market, Amazon is also getting involved. China is not far behind, and I think we all need to be very clear-headed,” Macron said.
Europe must become “a space power once again, with France at its heart”, he said.
He warned that Europeans were “on the verge of being completely” squeezed out of the low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation market.
Orbiting just a few hundred kilometres above the Earth, low Earth orbit satellite networks can play a crucial role in various fields including telecommunications, emergency response, space exploration, and defence.
Growing geopolitical tensions have forced countries to focus on the independence of their satellite infrastructure.
Macron said France and its partners should not be reliant on non-European constellations in low orbit, calling it “madness”. He called non-European players to team up with France.
