NA okays Rs4.814tr grants dismissing opposition’s 430 cut motions,https://e.thenews.com.pk/detail?id=413610,"ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly has approved all the 136 demands for grants of different ministries and divisions for the next fiscal year while rejecting cut motions moved by opposition members on Tuesday and Wednesday.On Wednesday, the House approved 31 demands for grants amounting to Rs4.814 trillion, dismissing all 430 cut motions related to the Finance and Revenue Division, Human Rights Division, Interior Division and National Food Security and Research Division.With the National Assembly set to pass the Finance Bill, 2025 on Thursday, Opposition Leader Omar Ayub rejected the federal budget during the debate on cut motions, calling it “dead on arrival”.Opposition members heavily criticized the performance of Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), labeling it the most corrupt organisation. They accused FBR officials of colluding with smugglers and tax evaders, severely undermining revenue collection efforts.Omar Ayub claimed that oil worth Rs550 billion was smuggled from Iran annually, with 72,000 18-wheeler trucks—each carrying 30,000 litres—entering Pakistan. He also dismissed the government’s claims of reduced inflation, stating that purchasing power continues to shrink, pushing 44 percent of the population below the poverty line.He blamed the PMLN government (2013-18) for inflating capacity payments from Rs450 billion to Rs2,200 billion due to dubious power purchase agreements with the independent power producers (IPPs).JUIF’s Aliya Kamran, while moving her cut motion, highlighted tax evasion issues, stating that the FBR lacks transparency and accountability. PTI’s Shandana Gulzar accused the government of falsifying economic data and pursuing anti-people policies.In his response, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb expressed satisfaction over improved economic indicators, including rising foreign reserves, lower inflation, and a reduced policy rate. He cited independent surveys confirming increased business and investor confidence.Aurangzeb noted that federal expenditures for the next fiscal year would rise by less than two percent, compared to 10-13 percent in previous years. He emphasized ongoing FBR reforms aimed at enhancing transparency through digitisation.Winding up the debate on the Interior Division’s cut motions, Minister of State Talal Chaudhry stated that Pakistani passports now include advanced security features to prevent forgery. He added that AI systems at airports and seaports ensure no one can travel abroad without valid visas and documents.Human Rights Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, concluding discussions on his division’s cut motions, announced that Pakistan’s National Commission for Human Rights has been granted “A” status by international organisations for the first time. He highlighted strengthened legislation protecting women, children and minorities.National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain outlined measures to boost agricultural productivity, including ensuring fertilizer supply and price control. He noted that wheat and sugarcane prices have been deregulated to ensure farmers receive fair market rates.Hussain confirmed that cotton sowing targets have been met, with production expected to reach 10 million bales. Additionally, 1,000 agricultural graduates have been sent to China for advanced training to modernise the sector.

"Arrest of taxpayers without sales tax assessment illegal, rules SC",https://e.thenews.com.pk/detail?id=413604,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court (SC) has declared that initiating criminal cases and making arrests of taxpayers without determining sales tax liabilities is illegal.A three-member SC bench comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, and Justice Aqeel Abbasi issued a detailed judgment in the case. The court ruled that before initiating any criminal proceedings against a taxpayer, tax liability must be determined, and the right to appeal must be granted.“Arrests made without a hearing and civil proceedings are a violation of the Constitution,” said the judgment, adding that starting criminal proceedings at the preliminary stage was against the principles of justice.The court noted that registering direct cases on tax evasion constituted abuse of authority, adding that it was essential to establish tax liability under the law before prosecution begins. “The Directorate of Intelligence can only gather information but does not have the authority to prosecute,” the detailed judgement held. The court ruled that investigations could only commence after the tax department declared an amount due.“Before any criminal action is taken against a defaulter, the service of order, right to appeal, and final decision must be ensured,” said the judgment, adding that arrests based on mere notice or preliminary inquiry violate the Constitution.The detailed judgment declared the criminal jurisdiction of FBR’s Directorate of Intelligence ineffective, upheld all relevant high court decisions and dismissed all appeals.  “All such cases, arrests and trials are nullified and that all related proceedings must be stopped immediately,” the detailed judgment concluded.

Imran opposes surplus budget under IMF condition,https://e.thenews.com.pk/detail?id=413603,"PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly passed the 2025-26 provincial budget without the approval of party founder Imran Khan, leading to intense backlash against Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur from within the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). Several party leaders and workers have labeled the move a deviation from party policy and disobedience of leadership.On social media, PTI activists criticized Ali Amin Gandapur, calling him and other PTI MPAs “traitors”. The key question now being raised is why Imran Khan wanted a briefing on the KP budget and what changes he intended to make.Credible sources within the PTI told this correspondent that party patron-in-chief Imran Khan was not happy with the inclusion of Rs157 billion in surplus in the KP budget as per the IMF demands. He believes that the federal government is pushing the country further into debt and that this money should be spent on public welfare. Imran Khan has categorically opposed keeping any surplus to appease the IMF, and for this reason, he wanted a direct briefing on the provincial budget to redirect the surplus towards other development projects.Sources further revealed that during former chief minister Mahmood Khan’s tenure, PTI had also refused to include a surplus budget. With this move, the KP government has potentially jeopardized Pakistan’s ongoing negotiations with the IMF just days before the scheduled board meeting.Adviser to the Chief Minister on Information, Muhammad Ali Saif, confirmed to this correspondent that Imran Khan had raised concerns regarding the surplus budget, saying: If the province has a surplus, why would the federal government provide it with funds?He added that Imran Khan was not angry, but he wanted more funds to be allocated to education, health and environment.  A senior PTI leader, speaking to The News on the condition of anonymity, alleged that some party figures deliberately provided Imran Khan with false information, telling him that the 157 billion rupees surplus was kept solely on the IMF’s demand, when in reality, that was not the case. There had already been a surplus in the current fiscal year, and the surplus in the upcoming year was designed in the province’s best interest. The provincial government has not received any specific target from the IMF in this regard.He added that Imran Khan was also misinformed that the province returns the surplus funds to the federal government, while in reality, these resources remain under provincial control. Severe disagreements have now erupted within the PTI over the budget. Dr. Shahbaz Gill admitted that the approval process was flawed and stated that the party’s political committee had not given final authorization to the budget. Former provincial finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra stated during a TV program that although he was part of the committee formed by Imran Khan to review the budget, he was never consulted beforehand — only after the budget was passed his input was sought.A member of PTI’s political committee told The News that a unanimous decision was made on June 22 that the budget must not be passed without consulting Imran Khan. If meeting him wasn’t possible, approval should have been delayed until June 30 to maintain pressure on the federal government. However, CM Ali Amin Gandapur ignored this consensus and had the budget approved in the Assembly on June 24, even though no other provincial assembly had passed its budget by that date. “What was the urgency?” the committee member asked.Senior lawyer and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja wrote on X, “Imran Khan had clearly instructed that no budget be approved without his consultation and approval. The June 24 approval was against party consensus and the chairman’s directive.”Chief Minister Gandapur defended his actions by saying that not approving the budget could have triggered a constitutional crisis in the province. He claimed that the federal government was conspiring to impose Governor’s Rule in KP and that such preparations were already underway. Gandapur added that Imran Khan never instructed him to dissolve the assembly, and he had wanted to consult him, but was not allowed to meet him.Adviser to the CM on Finance, Muzzammil Aslam, told this correspondent that the IMF has not set any surplus target for the provincial government. He explained that over Rs100 billion are already in provincial coffers for the current fiscal year, and this amount is expected to reach Rs125 billion by June 30.He clarified that the surplus is not returned to the federal government but is allocated to debt servicing and other funds. He said that the budget figures are not absolute, but estimates. For the current year, the province has a surplus budget of Rs2,119 billion, while the federal government is expected to transfer Rs1,800 billion under the NFC Award, electricity royalties and other heads. The Rs157 billion surplus mentioned in the budget is based entirely on estimates.Muzzammil Aslam emphasized that the surplus is the province’s savings, which can be used to launch major development projects. He further explained that when the federal government collects less revenue, provinces also receive fewer funds. The federal government aimed to collect Rs12,900 billion in taxes this year but has only managed Rs11,700 billion so far, leading to fewer transfers to provinces.  He concluded by saying that the budget was prepared in line with Imran Khan’s vision and instructions, and if Khan wishes to make any changes, they will be incorporated.

He said that the budget figures are not absolute, but estimates. For the current year, the province has a surplus budget of Rs2,119 billion, while the federal government is expected to transfer Rs1,800 billion under the NFC Award, electricity royalties and other heads. The Rs157 billion surplus mentioned in the budget is based entirely on estimates.Muzzammil Aslam emphasized that the surplus is the province’s savings, which can be used to launch major development projects. He further explained that when the federal government collects less revenue, provinces also receive fewer funds. The federal government aimed to collect Rs12,900 billion in taxes this year but has only managed Rs11,700 billion so far, leading to fewer transfers to provinces.  He concluded by saying that the budget was prepared in line with Imran Khan’s vision and instructions, and if Khan wishes to make any changes, they will be incorporated.

Trump’s Iran oil post raises trade hopes in Pakistan,https://e.thenews.com.pk/detail?id=413572,"SituationerBy Zebunnisa BurkiKARACHI: Trump’s surprise nod to China buying Iranian oil has triggered cautious optimism in Pakistan, where economists and policymakers say the move could lower oil prices, ease import pressures and potentially revive the long-stalled Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline — if sanctions are meaningfully relaxed.On Tuesday, US President Donald Trump appeared to have taken an unexpected policy U-turn regarding US sanctions on Iran, giving China the green light to carry on buying its oil. Trump’s Truth Social post, a surprise to both domestic and global audiences, said that China can “continue to purchase oil from Iran” and that “hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the US, also”.According to Bloomberg, this move could be an effort “to send positive signals to Beijing as he seeks a new tariff deal, and could potentially ease legal risks around China’s buying of Iranian oil, but its impact on actual oil flows is unclear”. But does this affect Pakistan? And if so, how?For macroeconomist Ammar Habib Khan, this means that “sanctions on Iran will slowly be removed as Trump believes more in trade. For Pakistan, that would mean formal trade, he says, explaining that otherwise Pakistan’s trade with Iran “was informal, through smuggling”.Analysing Trump’s Iran oil post, Dr Sajid Amin, senior economist at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), says that it suggests the “US may relax sanctions, while not fully removing them in the near future”.Either way, says Dr Amin, this is a “positive step for Iran, China, and the world. While China was already buying oil from Iran, it can do so more easily and on a large scale” now.Coming to Pakistan, Dr Amin says this could have “direct and indirect implications both”. In the near term, he says, “Pakistan is likely to have indirect benefits. Improved oil supply to the biggest global oil buyer, China, means less pressure on oil prices. We already saw a 6.0 per cent drop in oil prices after this statement. This means a lower import bill for Pakistan, as oil is one of the heaviest components of imports”.Former finance minister Dr Miftah Ismail agrees that sanctions will be lifted, something he says Trump had been hinting at. According to him, that means Iran will then “be able to sell its oil without hindrance to any country. China already buys oil from Iran”.For Pakistan, that would translate into the country being “in a position to build a pipeline,” says Dr Ismail, who adds a caveat: “provided international financial institutions are willing to finance it”. He also says that Pakistan, too, will be able to buy oil from Iran.Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, who heads SDPI, takes a more cautious view of the situation. Talking to The News, he says that as far as Pakistan and its gas pipeline with Iran goes, “the sanctions being lifted off the pipeline depends more on how Iran takes its nuclear programme ahead and what terms and conditions are placed or agreed to in any negotiations (if there are negotiations) it has with the US and other Western countries or if Iran stays or not in the NPT”.Dr Suleri feels that it is “too early right now to talk about whether this softer stance towards Iran that the US had would have any effect on Pakistan’s gas pipeline too. The one positive Pakistan can claim is that oil prices have come back down, so that will be a relief to both domestic consumers as well as the government, which has to put out more than Rs1 trillion in Petroleum Development Levy”.Speaking to Geo’s Shahzeb Khanzada on Wednesday night, public policy scholar Dr Adil Najam said that Iran’s economy opening up would have “a seismic effect on Iran” and would “change the equation for everyone: Pakistan, the region, the Arab world, and China and Russia too. It would also affect Europe with whom Iran has had a trade relationship, which, however, is limited”.But the biggest different for Iran in case this happens is that it will be able to claim that “it won”, he added.For Pakistan, he said it is worth noting that among our neighbours, we have no equal trade relations with anyone, other than China, but China is a different case from everyone else. “So this way, Pakistan will get a neighbour with whom it can trade”, said Dr Najam who also felt that “this will not be confined to oil or gas. We will be gaining a market with whom we can trade without smuggling”.Last year, the Pakistani government had indicated that it would want to request a sanctions waiver for the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project from the Trump administration.The Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline agreement, signed in 2009, envisions a 2,775-kilometre pipeline — 1,172 kilometres of it running through Iran, with the remainder to be built in Pakistan — to supply Iranian gas to Pakistan. While Iran has completed construction on its side with an investment of $2 billion, work on the Pakistani section has yet to begin.US sanctions on Iran extend to the pipeline project, and Washington has so far refused to grant Pakistan a waiver, effectively stalling progress. Islamabad has repeatedly sought US approval to move forward with construction.Meanwhile, China has responded to Trump’s post regarding Iranian oil by saying that it will be prioritising its national interests. “China will take legitimate measures to safeguard its energy security based on its own national interests” was the response from China’s foreign ministry spokesperson during a press briefing on Wednesday.According to a report published this month by Deutsche Welle (DW), Iran remains a major player in the global energy landscape. The US Energy Information Administration says that Iran has the world’s second-largest proven natural gas reserves.Iran also holds the world’s third-largest crude oil reserves — roughly 9.0 per cent of the global total. According to the Belgium-based data analytics firm Kpler, the country extracts about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil and an additional 1.3 million barrels of condensate and other liquids daily. Of this total, around 1.8 million barrels are exported.Iran is also in the top three largest oil producers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with energy exports accounting for a significant portion of the country’s government revenue and foreign exchange earnings.Despite international sanctions, China has continued to be a key buyer of Iranian oil. Reuters figures show Chinese imports of Iranian crude reached 1.71 million barrels per day in March.

In the near term, he says, “Pakistan is likely to have indirect benefits. Improved oil supply to the biggest global oil buyer, China, means less pressure on oil prices. We already saw a 6.0 per cent drop in oil prices after this statement. This means a lower import bill for Pakistan, as oil is one of the heaviest components of imports”.Former finance minister Dr Miftah Ismail agrees that sanctions will be lifted, something he says Trump had been hinting at. According to him, that means Iran will then “be able to sell its oil without hindrance to any country. China already buys oil from Iran”.For Pakistan, that would translate into the country being “in a position to build a pipeline,” says Dr Ismail, who adds a caveat: “provided international financial institutions are willing to finance it”. He also says that Pakistan, too, will be able to buy oil from Iran.Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, who heads SDPI, takes a more cautious view of the situation. Talking to The News, he says that as far as Pakistan and its gas pipeline with Iran goes, “the sanctions being lifted off the pipeline depends more on how Iran takes its nuclear programme ahead and what terms and conditions are placed or agreed to in any negotiations (if there are negotiations) it has with the US and other Western countries or if Iran stays or not in the NPT”.Dr Suleri feels that it is “too early right now to talk about whether this softer stance towards Iran that the US had would have any effect on Pakistan’s gas pipeline too. The one positive Pakistan can claim is that oil prices have come back down, so that will be a relief to both domestic consumers as well as the government, which has to put out more than Rs1 trillion in Petroleum Development Levy”.Speaking to Geo’s Shahzeb Khanzada on Wednesday night, public policy scholar Dr Adil Najam said that Iran’s economy opening up would have “a seismic effect on Iran” and would “change the equation for everyone: Pakistan, the region, the Arab world, and China and Russia too. It would also affect Europe with whom Iran has had a trade relationship, which, however, is limited”.But the biggest different for Iran in case this happens is that it will be able to claim that “it won”, he added.For Pakistan, he said it is worth noting that among our neighbours, we have no equal trade relations with anyone, other than China, but China is a different case from everyone else. “So this way, Pakistan will get a neighbour with whom it can trade”, said Dr Najam who also felt that “this will not be confined to oil or gas. We will be gaining a market with whom we can trade without smuggling”.Last year, the Pakistani government had indicated that it would want to request a sanctions waiver for the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project from the Trump administration.The Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline agreement, signed in 2009, envisions a 2,775-kilometre pipeline — 1,172 kilometres of it running through Iran, with the remainder to be built in Pakistan — to supply Iranian gas to Pakistan. While Iran has completed construction on its side with an investment of $2 billion, work on the Pakistani section has yet to begin.US sanctions on Iran extend to the pipeline project, and Washington has so far refused to grant Pakistan a waiver, effectively stalling progress. Islamabad has repeatedly sought US approval to move forward with construction.Meanwhile, China has responded to Trump’s post regarding Iranian oil by saying that it will be prioritising its national interests. “China will take legitimate measures to safeguard its energy security based on its own national interests” was the response from China’s foreign ministry spokesperson during a press briefing on Wednesday.According to a report published this month by Deutsche Welle (DW), Iran remains a major player in the global energy landscape. The US Energy Information Administration says that Iran has the world’s second-largest proven natural gas reserves.Iran also holds the world’s third-largest crude oil reserves — roughly 9.0 per cent of the global total. According to the Belgium-based data analytics firm Kpler, the country extracts about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil and an additional 1.3 million barrels of condensate and other liquids daily. Of this total, around 1.8 million barrels are exported.Iran is also in the top three largest oil producers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with energy exports accounting for a significant portion of the country’s government revenue and foreign exchange earnings.Despite international sanctions, China has continued to be a key buyer of Iranian oil. Reuters figures show Chinese imports of Iranian crude reached 1.71 million barrels per day in March.

The US Energy Information Administration says that Iran has the world’s second-largest proven natural gas reserves.Iran also holds the world’s third-largest crude oil reserves — roughly 9.0 per cent of the global total. According to the Belgium-based data analytics firm Kpler, the country extracts about 3.3 million barrels of crude oil and an additional 1.3 million barrels of condensate and other liquids daily. Of this total, around 1.8 million barrels are exported.Iran is also in the top three largest oil producers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), with energy exports accounting for a significant portion of the country’s government revenue and foreign exchange earnings.Despite international sanctions, China has continued to be a key buyer of Iranian oil. Reuters figures show Chinese imports of Iranian crude reached 1.71 million barrels per day in March.

We will be gaining a market with whom we can trade without smuggling”.Last year, the Pakistani government had indicated that it would want to request a sanctions waiver for the Pakistan-Iran gas pipeline project from the Trump administration.The Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline agreement, signed in 2009, envisions a 2,775-kilometre pipeline — 1,172 kilometres of it running through Iran, with the remainder to be built in Pakistan — to supply Iranian gas to Pakistan.
