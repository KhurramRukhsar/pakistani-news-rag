"Aurangzeb pledges tax, energy and SOE reforms","KR
Stresses need to stop fiscal bleeding as pension bill crosses Rs1tr
Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday reaffirmed the government's resolve to implement structural reforms to achieve long-term economic growth and stability.
Speaking at the ""National Workshop on Transitioning to Defined Contribution Pension Schemes"", organised by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan, the minister said that the government was committed to reforming the areas of taxation, energy and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
He emphasised that a major reform initiative introduced in the current year pertained to the tariff structure, aimed at transforming Pakistan into a more competitive economy. This includes gradually dismantling the wall of protection that has long hindered industrial growth.
The minister noted that such steps would help domestic industries advance and enable the export sector to become more robust and globally competitive. The government has also taken several measures to address public finance issues, particularly to reduce debt servicing costs, not just through the decline in policy rate, but also through broader fiscal measures.
Muhammad Aurangzeb underscored the importance of pension reform as a key component of the broader fiscal strategy and recalled that the government had taken a significant step in that direction last year.
""As of July 1, 2024, we announced that all new entrants to the federal government and civil service will move to a defined contribution scheme,"" he said, adding that it was a necessary move before even beginning to address the legacy issue of unfunded liabilities.
The minister stressed the need to stop fiscal bleeding as in this year's budget the pension bill alone crossed Rs1 trillion. He called pension reform not only a matter of fiscal responsibility but it was also essential to ensure long-term macroeconomic sustainability, predictability in government finances and to manage costs effectively.
He highlighted that the shift from defined benefit to a defined contribution pension model had significant implications at the individual level. ""This transition isn't just a fiscal adjustment; it's about empowering employees to take ownership of their retirement savings.""
The finance minister pointed out that the government in the FY26 budget proposed a 7% increase in pensions, which was aligned with prevailing inflation trends to protect their purchasing power. The government has also recommended a progressive taxation measure. ""We have proposed a 5% tax on the annual pension income exceeding Rs10 million, which has been submitted to parliament for approval.""
The minister said that those steps reflected a balanced approach, providing relief to pensioners while also ensuring that high-income recipients contribute fairly to national resources.

Budget debate remains inconclusive,"US
Treasury, opposition benches continue to trade verbal barbs
The treasury and opposition benches traded verbal barbs during general debate on provincial budget on Tuesday.
Opposition MPAs accused the Sindh government of ignoring their constituencies in the allocations for development schemes.
The general debate on budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 continued for the second consecutive day on Tuesday with Deputy Speaker Naveed Anthony in the chair.
Government members termed the budget balanced and people-friendly despite tough economic conditions. However, the opposition described it as 'the darkest budget in Sindh's history', alleging that opposition constituencies were deliberately ignored.
Yousuf Baloch of PPP praised Sindh chief minister and his team for formulating a budget 'keeping public interest in view'. Arooba Rabbani claimed that special attention was given to education and health in the budget. Fahim Patni of MQM-P accused the government of neglecting public issues in his constituency, stating that only the ruling elite would benefit from the budget. Other MQM-P members also accused the Sindh government of ignoring Karachi and failing to provide basic facilities in their constituencies.
PPP members Sarfraz Shah, Pir Mujeeb-ul-Haq, Seema Khurram, Nasir Qureshi, and Jam Shabbir Ali praised the budget and demanded the completion of development projects in various districts.
PPP's Faqir Sher Mohammad proposed converting large RO (reverse osmosis) plants in Thar from diesel to solar energy. He mentioned that many plants are non-functional due to diesel shortages.
Nasir Qureshi of MQM-P criticised the health budget, saying it seemed to reflect hostility towards Hyderabad. He pointed out that there is no hospital in Nawabshah, which is why the President of Pakistan had to be taken to Karachi. He also said that the cardiology department of the Paretabad Hospital is non-functional and demanded an increase in ICU beds at Civil Hospital Hyderabad.
There were several heated exchange of words between government and opposition members during the session. PPP's Saadia Javed's speech met with protests from MQM-P and PTI members. The deputy speaker later appealed for peace in the house and ordered the removal of unparliamentary remarks. PTI's Sajid Hussain called the budget 'unrealistic and anti-people', while MQM-P's Anil Kumar questioned the absence of schemes for minorities.
PPP members Ali Ahmed, Shah Hussain Shirazi, Sher Muhammad Khan Mugheri, Ejaz Swati, and Heer Soho described the budget as a milestone in Sindh's development and defended the ongoing projects in various sectors. Jamaat-e-Islami member Mohammad Farooq also referenced the advisory committee's recommendations and termed the arrest of the opposition leader as political revenge. The session saw continued sarcasm and accusations exchanged between PPP and PTI members, which at times escalated into altercations.
During PPP member Ejaz Khan Swati's speech, PTI members created a commotion. Some PPP members used the words of prisoner number 420 for the founder of PTI. The deputy speaker remarked that no one should be called 'Prisoner 420' and that members should address the speaker when speaking.
During this time, repeated exchange of harsh words occurred between PPP and PTI members. JI's Mohammad Farooq reminded the assembly that the decisions made in the advisory committee were meant for everyone and noted that only one leader is currently in jail. PPP ministers continued to mock the PTI chief in subtle terms.

Lack of local govts complicates 'khula' cases,"HK
Even when family courts issue 'khula' decrees, women have to wait months before Union Councils are able to finalize
In Punjab, the country's most populous province, the lack of a fully functional local government system has created serious challenges for women seeking divorce. Over the past five years, where the rate of khula has steadily increased, divorced women often face months of delay in obtaining their khula certificates from Union Councils (UCs) even after family courts have issued official decrees.
Punjab is divided into ten divisional headquarters where over 230 family courts are operational. Lahore alone has 30 to 35 family courts, with the city leading in terms of the number of active family courts, followed by Multan, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, and Bahawalpur. Despite receiving court verdicts, many women must wait extended periods for Union Councils to issue the necessary legal certificates, highlighting the pressing need for reform in the local governance structure of Punjab.
Samara Babar, who has been pursuing a khula for over two years — first through the Union Council and later through the family court, shared her ordeal. ""For an entire year, the UC kept giving me the runaround. Sometimes the secretary wasn't available, and other times the person responsible for serving notices was absent. Eventually, I filed a case in the family court, which issued an ex parte decision last month since my husband never appeared in court. If the local bodies were functional, I wouldn't have had to wander from office to office for a simple divorce,"" she lamented.
Former Professor of Philosophy at the Government College University Lahore, Dr Javed Iqbal Nadeem, attributed rising khula rates to unequal distribution of household responsibilities and authority. ""Though society claims to uphold equal rights for men and women, post-marriage dynamics often turn oppressive. When a man is employed, women tend to sacrifice their careers, but the reverse is rarely true. Educational disparity also contributes to marital conflict, as more women than men are pursuing higher education. Parents often marry off educated daughters swiftly to undereducated men, who struggle to cope. This leads to frequent disputes and, eventually, divorce,"" said Dr Iqbal.
According to records obtained from the Punjab Local Government Department, Union Councils in Lahore alone issued over 11,000 khula certificates in 2021, over 13,000 in 2022, over 14,000 in 2023, and more than 16,000 in 2024. As of May 2025, over 3,800 certificates have already been issued. Records obtained by The Express Tribune revealed that Lahore tops the list of cities with the highest number of khula cases, followed by Faisalabad and Rawalpindi.
Advocate Mian Zeeshan Hanif Bhandara, who handles khula cases, confirmed a daily influx of divorce cases in family courts. ""The number of khula petitions filed by women has doubled compared to divorce cases filed by men. Although we encourage women to think carefully before filing, in most cases, emotional and financial conflicts including demands for separate housing or disputes over property lead women to seek khula. A khula case typically takes six to nine months for court processing. If the opposing party does not appear, the court issues a unilateral (ex parte) decision in favor of the woman,"" explained Bhandara.
Director of the Local Government Department, Muhammad Umair, explained that once a family court has issued a khula decree, the department sends monthly notices to the husband. ""If no response is received within 90 days, the khula certificate is issued in compliance with legal requirements. In 95 per cent of the cases, the men do not respond at all,"" revealed Umair.

Karachiites brave another hot and humid day,"RO
Some respite expected tomorrow amid light drizzle forecast
The metropolis braved scorching heat on Tuesday, with temperatures shooting up to 39.9°C at the official weather station due to stalled sea breeze, according to the weatherman.
The heatwave persisted throughout the day and the conditions were exasperated by 53% humidity. Some neighbourhoods of the city reported even higher temperatures: 40.7°C at Jinnah Terminal and 40.5°C in Gulistan-e-Jauhar.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecasts that sea breezes will resume today (Wednesday), bringing slight respite from the scalding heat.
Starting Tomorrow (Thursday), light rain showers and drizzle are expected during morning and nighttime hours, triggered by low-level cloud cover moving in from the Arabian Sea.
PMD's Early Warning Centre reports a humid air mass prevailing over eastern Sindh, contributing to the discomfort. Karachi can expect stronger-than-usual winds on Wednesday and Thursday, while the rest of the province may continue to experience hot and dry conditions.
According to Anjum Nazeer Zaigham of the PMD, the current heat spell results from a low-pressure system over Indian Gujarat that has disrupted normal sea breeze patterns, leading to elevated temperatures in Karachi for the past two days.
On Tuesday, the temperature had already crossed 39°C by 11 am, as a low-pressure system disrupted standard weather patterns, causing sea breezes to either stall or slow significantly.
However, these breezes are expected to return by Tuesday evening, with light rain showers and drizzle likely on Thursday during the early morning and nighttime hours.

Regional conflict derails Pakistan-Russia train,"US
.
The departure of Pakistan Railways' first freight train to Russia has been cancelled due to regional instability triggered by the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, railway sources confirmed on Friday.
The cargo train was scheduled to depart from Lahore on June 22 (Sunday) but has been postponed indefinitely due to border closures between Pakistan, Iran and other transit countries affected by the conflict.
According to PR officials, the freight train was intended to be the first of its kind, aiming to travel from Lahore to the Russian city of Astrakhan.
The train was to depart with sixteen freight wagons loaded with a variety of goods destined for Russia, with plans to increase the number of containers to thirty and eventually fifty in phased operations.
The launch of the cargo train was part of PR's broader strategy to strengthen trade connectivity between South Asia and Central Asia, facilitating direct overland exports and imports with Russia, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan.
""Due to the Iran-Israel conflict and related security risks, the train cannot be dispatched at this time. It will only depart once the war ends and the situation stabilises,"" railway sources said.
The proposed route of the freight train included transit through Iran, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan before reaching Russia.
The trade corridor was expected not only to enable Pakistani exports but also to bring in goods from Russia and Central Asian countries such as Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan.

Trump demands Iran's unconditional surrender,"AE
US president says won't kill Khamenei 'for now'
President Donald Trump said the United States would not kill Iran's supreme leader ""for now"" and appeared to demand Tehran's surrender, as US ally Israel traded fire with its arch foe for a fifth day on Tuesday.
The comments marked a dramatic escalation in Trump's rhetoric against Iran and its leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, fuelling questions as to whether Washington would join Israel's attacks after insisting it had no hand in the campaign.Israeli warplanes targeted drone and missile sites with at least two waves of strikes in western Iran on Tuesday, the military said.
It also said it had killed senior Iranian commander Ali Shadmani in an overnight strike on a ""command centre in the heart of Tehran"", just four days after his predecessor, Gholam Ali Rashid, was killed in Israel's initial surprise attack.
The attacks drew retaliatory fire from the Islamic republic, with explosions heard over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and air raid sirens sounding around Dimona, a southern town home to a nuclear power plant. There were no immediate reports of hits.
Days after a senior US official said Trump had told Israel to back down from plans to assassinate Khamenei, the US president appeared to put the option back on the table with a post on his Truth Social platform.
""We know exactly where the so-called 'Supreme Leader' is hiding. He is an easy target, but is safe there — We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,"" Trump said.
""But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin,"" he added, later posting a message saying: ""UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER!""
Trump had said earlier in the day that he wanted ""a real end"" to the conflict.
A White House official said Trump was convening a meeting of his National Security Council Tuesday to discuss the conflict.
Despite mounting calls to de-escalate, neither side has backed off from the aerial blitz that began Friday, when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign targeting Iranian nuclear and military facilities.
Iranian media reported several explosions Tuesday in the central city of Isfahan, home to nuclear facilities. Blasts were also heard across Tehran.
The Iranian armed forces warned residents in the Israeli cities of Tel Aviv and Haifa to evacuate ""for the sake of their lives"", warning of ""punitive operations"" to come.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had launched an attack targeting Israeli air bases.
Residential areas in both countries have suffered deadly strikes since the fighting broke out, and foreign governments have scrambled to evacuate their citizens.
A cyberattack on Tuesday crippled Sepah Bank, one of Iran's main state-owned banks, the Fars news agency reported.
Fearing the violence, many residents have fled Tehran.
On Tuesday, long queues stretched outside bakeries and petrol stations as the remaining residents rushed to stock up on fuel and basic supplies.
Security checkpoints have been set up across the capital, adding to the atmosphere of tension as authorities monitor movement in and out of key districts.
Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said the United States was deploying ""additional capabilities"" to the Middle East, with a US aircraft carrier reportedly heading to the region.
Even before Trump's remarks about Khamenei, China had accused him of ""pouring oil"" on the conflict.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu of being ""the biggest threat to the security of the region"".
At a G7 summit in Canada, leaders including Trump had called Monday for ""de-escalation"", while stressing Israel had the right to defend itself and that ""Iran can never have a nuclear weapon"".
After decades of enmity and a prolonged shadow war, Israel said its surprise air campaign aimed to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons -- an ambition Tehran denies.
The UN's nuclear watchdog said there appeared to have been ""direct impacts on the underground enrichment halls"" at Iran's Natanz facility.
Israel has maintained ambiguity regarding its own atomic activities, but the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) says it has 90 nuclear warheads.
The conflict derailed a running series of nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington in recent weeks, with Iran saying after the start of Israel's campaign that it would not negotiate with the United States while under attack.
Since Friday, at least 24 people have been killed in Israel and hundreds wounded, according to Prime Minister Netanyahu's office.
Iran said on Sunday that Israeli strikes had killed at least 224 people, including military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. It has not issued an updated toll since then.
Netanyahu said Israel's campaign was ""changing the face of the Middle East, and that can lead to radical changes inside Iran itself"".

CB refuses partial seat allocation,"DE
SIC counsel continues arguments in reserved seats case
A constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a request by the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) to allocate reserved seats to the PTI in proportion to 39 MNAs who had declared themselves to be affiliated with the party while filing nomination papers for the Feb 2024 elections.
The eleven-member CB, led by Justice Aminuddin Khan, heard the petitions challenging the SC's July 2024 majority order for allocation of reserved seats to the PTI.
On January 13, 2024, a three-member SC bench upheld the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) December 22, 2023 order declaring the PTI's intra-party polls null and void.
Later, the PTI candidates had to contest the February 8, 2024 general elections as independents.
Eighty such independent candidates reached the National Assembly and later joined the SIC in an apparent bid to claim reserved seats for women and minorities. The ECP, however, refused to allocate the seats to the party, a decision that the SIC challenged in the Supreme Court.
On July 12, 2024, a full bench of the apex court through a majority of 8 to 5 resurrected the PTI as a parliamentary party, noting that 39 of the lawmakers who had submitted certificates of their affiliation with the PTI along with their nomination papers were already PTI lawmakers.
The SC ruled that the remaining 41 lawmakers who had not submitted the affiliation certificates at the time of nomination papers' submission could do that now within a period of 15 days.
At the last hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had observed that the majority decision declared 41 candidates as unaffiliated with any party and the ECP was right in the case of 41 and wrong in the case of 39. The SIC's counsel requested allocation of reserved seats to the PTI based on the 39 MNAs.
During the hearing on Tuesday, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar asked if the ECP had declared all 39 lawmakers as belonging to the PTI.
Justice Mandokhail noted that based on the ratio of 80 seats, around 22 or 23 reserved seats should be allocated. Justice Mazhar asked, ""If 39 members have been declared as part of the PTI, then why haven't the reserved seats been allocated according to that proportion?""
The ECP director general (law) said seats would be allotted based on an overall figure of 80. To a query of Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, he replied that the seats have not been allotted to any other party so far.
The ECP's lawyer argued that parliament had enacted a law after the SC's July 13 verdict, stating that once a political affiliation was declared in the nomination papers, it could not be changed. He added that the law was applied retrospectively, and a review petition on the matter was still pending.
Later, the Supreme Court's constitutional bench formally dismissed the request to enforce its decision regarding the allocation of reserved seats to PTI for the 39 assembly members.
Earlier, Faisal Siddiqui responded to the objection regarding the extension of the timeline for reserved seats. He stated that after the 2018 elections, the ECP issued a fresh schedule.
Employing a pun, he said when BAP — the Balochistan Awami Party, which is generally regarded as the king's party — came forward, the schedule was issued. ""After all, Baap is Baap (a father is a father),"" he added.

Poll finds public turning to AI botsfor news updates,"US
.
People are increasingly turning to generative artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT to follow day-to-day news, a respected media report published Tuesday found.
The yearly survey from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found ""for the first time"" that significant numbers of people were using chatbots to get headlines and updates, director Mitali Mukherjee wrote.
Attached to Britain's Oxford University, the Reuters Institute annual report is seen as unmissable for people following the ways the media is changing.
Just seven percent of people report using AI to find news, according to the Institute's poll of 97,000 people in 48 countries, carried out by YouGov.
But the proportion is higher among the young, at 12 percent of under-35s and 15 percent of under-25s.
The biggest-name chatbot — OpenAI's ChatGPT —  is the most widely used, followed by Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama.
Respondents appreciated relevant, personalised news from chatbots.
Many more used AI to summarise (27 percent), translate (24 percent) or recommend (21 percent) articles, while almost one in five asked questions about current events.
Distrust remains, with those polled on balance saying AI risked making the news less transparent, less accurate and less trustworthy.
Rather than being programmed, today's powerful AI ""large language models"" (LLMs) are ""trained"" on vast quantities of data from the web and other sources -- including news media like text articles or video reports.
Once trained, they are able to generate text and images in response to users' natural-language queries.

"Kneecap court controversy, critics","US
Irish trio remain unbothered by recent legal woes
Irish rappers Kneecap are ""unfazed"" by their legal problems and controversies kicked up by their anti-Israel pro-Palestinian statements, friend and film director Rich Peppiatt told AFP.
Peppiatt helped create the Kneecap phenomenon with his 2024 semi-fictionalised film about the hip-hop group from Belfast, who are now playing major festivals around the world.
The trio made headlines by projecting the words ""F*** Israel, Free Palestine"" during their gig at US festival Coachella in April, while lyricist Mo Chara is set to appear in a London court on a terror charge on Wednesday.
Chara, whose real name is Liam Og O Hannaidh, is accused of displaying a flag of Lebanon-based and anti-Israel militant group Hezbollah — a banned organisation — at a gig last year.
""Even through all the controversy at the moment, they just shrug their shoulders and get on with it,"" Peppiatt told AFP. ""They are just completely unfazed by anything.""
The former journalist first encountered Kneecap in a pub in Belfast in 2019 and was struck by their local fanbase, eventually convincing Chara, Moglai Bap and DJ Provai to appear in the film about their lives.
""They've always been controversial at a local level, and they've always bounced back from it,"" Peppiatt continued.
""The amount of times in the last six years I've heard 'that's the end of Kneecap' because of something they've said or done, and all it's done is propelled them to the next level,"" he said.
British colonialism
Kneecap started out as an overtly political project, with the group singing in Irish in defence of their language and protesting British rule in Northern Ireland.
Their high-energy gigs, prolific drug-taking and the violent undercurrent of Belfast life were captured in Peppiatt's film Kneecap, which premiered at the Sundance film festival in 2024 to rave reviews.
The dark comedy, music and occasional surrealist digression means it has been frequently compared to 1996 hit Trainspotting, which Peppiatt mentions as an influence.
Drawing an estimated six million people to cinemas worldwide on a budget of just £3 million ($4 million), it was a debut hit for the London-born director.
""You certainly don't make a film about an Irish-language rap band no one's heard of, and who have never released an album, thinking it's going to be a hit,"" Peppiatt, who recently obtained Irish nationality through his wife, told AFP.
But he says it tapped into larger themes that people identify with, from the loss of local languages to the struggle in many countries against colonial-era influences.
""One useful thing about British colonialism is that when you've taken over a third of the world, if you make a film 50 or 100 years later, and it's all about 'f*** the British', you find an audience for it,"" he joked.
As for the question of whether his film created Kneecap the band, or whether the band made his film, he said it was a bit of both.
""I felt that they were going to break through. Obviously the film's accelerated that,"" he said.
Kneecap the film will hit screens in France and South Korea on Wednesday in the final stages of its international release.
Palestinian cause
Kneecap's support for the Palestinian cause and their denunciation of Israel's devastating war in Gaza, Peppiatt said, was in line with Irish public opinion.
""There's always been a very close connection between the Irish cause and the Palestinian cause,"" he said. ""Where they're from in West Belfast, there are as many Irish flags as there are Palestinian flags.""
But critics see the group as going too far and accuse them of embracing violent extremists.
One video of a gig appears to show a band member shouting ""Up Hamas, up Hezbollah"".
Another from a 2023 performance, which was also assessed by British police, appears to show one of them urging fans to kill British lawmakers, leading to a public apology to the families of murdered MPs.
Kneecap have called on fans to show up outside court on Wednesday in support of Chara and have labelled his prosecution ""political policing"".
Peppiatt told AFP he did not always agree with the way the group expressed themselves.
""Where they slipped up for me at Coachella was saying 'f*** Israel', that's a very broad statement to make that incorporated a lot of people who don't believe in what's happening there (in Gaza),"" he said.
""When you're friends with people you're allowed to disagree, and I do disagree with them on some things.""

PPP workers decry favouritism,"HK
Criticism was also directed at the repeated nomination of weak candidates in Rawalpindi
Discontent is growing among Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) workers in Rawalpindi over being sidelined during Eidul Azha celebrations, particularly regarding selective meetings with President Asif Ali Zardari.
During a press conference, PPP Rawalpindi Cantonment President Malik Qasim Idrees, Punjab Council Member Banaras Chaudhry, Tauqeer Abbasi, Nasir Mir, and Abdul Rehman Tokli voiced strong concerns over what they termed a conspiracy to block dedicated workers from meeting the President. They specifically accused Presidential spokesperson and former MPA Aamir Fida Paracha of creating hurdles and discouraging grassroots members from accessing leadership.
The party leaders said they were deeply disappointed by the demoralisation of loyal male and female party workers and alleged that a deliberate conspiracy had kept PPP's allied organisations from meeting the President. They claimed that former Baitul Maal MD Aamir Paracha failed to communicate the true sentiments and grievances of party workers to the leadership, which has harmed the party's unity.
Criticism was also directed at the repeated nomination of weak candidates in Rawalpindi.

Investor demands Victoria's Secret overhaul its board,"IE
Luxury brand has been accused of underperforming
Activist investor Barington Capital Group is pushing Victoria's Secret to alter its board and end a recently adopted ""poison pill"" plan, according to a letter to the lingerie maker's shareholders on Monday.
The New York-based hedge fund, which owns more than 1 per cent of the company, said Victoria's Secret has underperformed its competitors and lost over $2.4 billion in shareholder value since its spin-off in 2021 from former parent company L Brands.
On Sunday, Reuters reported, citing sources, that Barington wants the company to replace most or all of its board and end the ""poison pill"" plan that it adopted in May to protect the company from hostile takeovers.
""Barington has not sought to engage with us, but we look forward to discussing their views with them,"" a Victoria's Secret spokesperson said.
""We are confident that executing our strategy under the new and experienced leadership team will continue to unlock value for our shareholders,"" the spokesperson added.
Its shares, which have lost more than half of their value so far this year amid waning demand, were up about 3 per cent in morning trade.
Victoria's Secret requires a reconstituted board comprising directors with ""proven experience in brand revitalisation, operational execution, international expansion, and shareholder value creation,"" James Mitarotonda, Barington's founder and CEO, said in the letter.
The investment firm said the retailer should focus on core categories and initiatives, like bras and the Angels campaign, and accelerate growth in digital and international markets.
Barington highlighted concerns about the company's leadership, and said Chief Executive Hillary Super, who took over in September 2024, has limited public company experience, and that the rest of the board lacks the necessary experience to revitalise the iconic brand.
Victoria's Secret, with a market capitalisation of about $1.45 billion currently, adopted the poison pill plan to fend off Brett Blundy's investment firm, which increased its stake in the company to around 13 per cent.
Barington's pressure puts Victoria's Secret in a ""precarious position"" as it tries to fend off other activist investors and restore confidence in CEO's turnaround plan, eMarketer analyst Rachel Wolff said, adding that investors' growing dissatisfaction with leadership could force a change at the company's management level.
Barington previously pushed for changes at L Brands, which split into Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works.
Earlier this year, Barington mounted its first full-blown boardroom challenge since 2015 when it tried to put three directors on the board of casket maker Matthews International but ended up losing the vote.

High hopes on shaky ground,"US
Budgets reliance on expanding tax net without shifting any burden onto poor is not going to inspire confidence
Punjab's Rs5.35 trillion budget for FY26 boldly prioritises development over austerity, with no new taxes and a record 47% surge in the Annual Development Programme to Rs1.24 trillion. But beneath the ambitious veneer lie formidable execution risks and structural tensions.
The budget's core is inclusive development, with a 21% increase in the education spending to Rs812 billion, and a 17% raise in healthcare spending, including Rs72 billion of the total Rs630 million health budget going to the Nawaz Sharif Institute of Cancer Treatment and Research.
Wages and pensions are also up by 10% and 5%, respectively, and the minimum wage has been set at Rs40,000. Roads and other infrastructure -— always a PML-N priority — will also get significant funding. But while these numbers may suggest a keen desire to invest in the province, funding sources are, at best, unreliable.
Much like Sindh, the Punjab budget is dependent on timely transfers from the federal government.
Unlike Sindh, the Punjab government is claiming a Rs740 billion surplus, equivalent to almost 14% of the total budget, and well in line with the IMF's expectations. Even if there is a significant revenue shortfall, the projected surplus could easily absorb it.
Still, surplus or not, potentially delayed federal transfers and the consistently underwhelming performance of the Punjab Revenue Authority may create unnecessary headaches in the coming fiscal year.
The PTI-led opposition has also questioned the opacity of the revenue projection required to post a surplus and highlighted the need for monitoring of the planned expenditure.
Other experts have also noted that both agriculture and the environment are underfunded.
The budget, as presented, could lay the groundwork for notable long-term growth and social gains, but its reliance on expanding the tax net without shifting any burden onto the poor is not going to inspire confidence in too many people.

Metro fare cut sparks funding debate,"US
CDA defends 100% fare hike as necessary response to rising fuel, maintenance costs
The recent rollback of the Metro Bus fare from Rs100 to Rs50, following public outcry and the prime minister's intervention, has offered immediate relief to thousands of commuters in Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
But behind the applause lies a more complex challenge: how to sustain quality public transport while keeping it affordable for the masses. Initially, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) defended the 100% fare hike as a necessary response to rising fuel and maintenance costs.
The aim was to maintain the Metro's standards, cleanliness, punctuality, air conditioning, and consistent service, which many consider superior to other public transport options. However, the sudden doubling of fares triggered backlash from students, daily-wage earners, and elderly citizens who rely on the Metro for their essential travel.
""I spend Rs3,000 a month just commuting to work,"" said Ghulam Abbas, a construction worker. ""That's a major hit to my grocery budget."" Similarly, schoolgirl Asma shared with this scribe how she considered skipping lunch to manage travel costs.
The government ultimately reversed the decision on June 5, reinstating the original Rs50 fare.
Commuters welcomed the move, and for many, it reaffirmed faith in responsive governance. But this solution, while popular, raises an important question: can the Metro sustain quality service on its current fare model? Metro drivers, too, expressed concerns, not just about wages, which remained unchanged, but about increasing frustration from both management and passengers. ""The fare change came overnight,"" said driver Zahid Khan. ""We didn't get more pay, and now we're blamed when people are angry about delays or crowded buses.
From a sustainability standpoint, experts argue that rather than doubling fares in one go, a phased or incremental approach would have been more practical and politically acceptable. ""Even a Rs10-20 quarterly increase, spread over time, would be easier for people to absorb and for the authority to justify,"" noted a senior urban transport planner.
While affordability is vital, especially during times of inflation, so is the long-term health of the transit system. A sharp rollback without any adjustment plan may risk underfunding maintenance, delaying upgrades, or cutting services in the future.
Already, questions are being raised about whether buses will continue to be as clean, on time, and safe if funding gaps widen. Senior citizens like Rukhsana Bibi, who travel regularly for medical needs, suggested middle-ground solutions. ""Maybe there could be concession passes for students, pensioners, and laborers, while others could pay slightly more.""
Such targeted subsidies could help balance the financial model without punishing the most vulnerable riders.
Raziq Ali, who travels daily from Jinnah Garden to Islamabad G-7, and Hasnain Raza, a frequent commuter from Gulberg Greens, both agree that the Metro Bus is an affordable and comfortable option. However, they warned that a sudden 100% fare increase would push many to switch to bikes, which are cheaper but come with safety risks and are uncomfortable in bad weather.
A gradual, balanced fare increase, aligned with inflation, fuel costs, and service improvements, can ensure the Metro's long-term sustainability without burdening commuters. This would help maintain vehicle conditions, service quality, and fair employee pay.

10-year-old boy killed in illegal LPG shop blast,"US
The body was shifted to Liaquat University Hospital for postmortem
A child died and his father sustained minor injuries in a blast which occurred in a shop filling liquified petroleum gas in cylinders in blatant violation of the government's laws and regulations. The incident, which also reflects complete indifference of the district administration in clamping down this illegal trade, happened in Tando Yousuf, area of Hyderabad.
The explosion's sound was heard even in distant areas. The location of the incident also happens to be near the railway crossing.
The deceased has been identified as 10-year-old Umar Hussain. His father Hussain, family members and neighbours later staged a sit-in demonstration outside the SSP office demanding arrest of the shop's owner. The protesters dispersed after the police assured them of action.
The body was shifted to Liaquat University Hospital for postmortem. Later an FIR was registered on Hussain's complaint nominating Kamran alias Kalu, Ilyas Qureshi and Zahid Rajput for the explosion. The suspects could not be arrested by the evening. According to the complainant, they are residents of Gujrati mohalla where they confront frequent gas outages and low pressure issues. He said they are often compelled to use the LPG to cook food in their home's kitchen.

Contaminated water deepens health crisis,"US
Alongside stomach ailments, locals are also exposed to eye and skin diseases
The supply of contaminated water in Karachi and across Sindh has become a serious public health concern, affecting millions of people each year not only through stomach diseases but also through skin and eye ailments.
According to medical experts, more than 50,000 children and adults die every year due to water-borne illnesses in Pakistan. The World Health Organization (WHO) has reported that 70 per cent of diseases in the country stem from the use of polluted water. In Karachi alone, approximately 20,000 children die every year from various illnesses linked to unsafe water.
Dr Shumail Zia, a skin specialist, noted a significant rise in fungal skin infections due to contaminated water, especially tinea corporis, folliculitis, and eczema; conditions which are exacerbated by the high salt content in polluted water. ""There is an urgent need to raise public awareness about the health risks associated with using contaminated water, particularly in developing countries like Pakistan, where access to clean water is limited. Contaminated water contains various bacteria, viruses, fungi, chemicals, and toxins that severely damage the skin. When such water comes into direct contact with the skin, whether during bathing or washing, it can trigger a range of skin disorders including fungal and bacterial infections, impetigo, cellulitis, scabies, and dermatitis,"" said Dr Zia, who advised people to always use clean water, maintain hygiene, avoid self-medication on affected skin, and consult a dermatologist when symptoms appear.
Similarly, Dr Zia Iqbal, an ophthalmologist, revealed that the use of contaminated water was equally dangerous for the eyes. ""When bacteria, viruses, chemicals, and other harmful components present in contaminated water come into direct or indirect contact with the eyes, various types of eye diseases can develop. Some of these diseases are superficial, such as conjunctivitis, which cause temporary discomfort, while some diseases, such as trachoma or corneal ulcers, can cause permanent vision loss.
Lack of public awareness, failure to follow hygiene rules, and limited access to health facilities further increase the spread of these diseases,"" highlighted Dr Iqbal. It is worth noting that most of the water filtration plants of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KW&SC) have been in a state of disrepair since decades. Due to an inadequate amount of chlorine in the water, deadly water-borne diseases like Naegleria are on the rise with each passing year.
In this regard, People's Labour Union General Secretary Mohsin Raza confirmed that the KW&SC had nine filter plants, out of which only three were in working condition, while the remaining six were in disrepair since many years. ""For 645 million gallons of water, 240 cylinders of chlorine should be available monthly, but only 150 cylinders are being supplied.
Hence, 40 per cent less chlorine is being mixed. Due to a lack of water, the filter plant of the NEK Old Pump House has dried up, and chlorine cannot be added to a dry place. Water without chlorine is also coming from another side to the NEK pumping station, which is from the K3 system. Hence, water without chlorine is supplied to the public,"" said Raza.

Heavy fines imposed over traffic rules' violations,"US
Violations of route permits for three-wheelers will carry a Rs5,000 penalty, doubling for repeat offenders
In a move to strengthen traffic enforcement, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has proposed significant increases in traffic fines as part of 2025-26 Finance Bill.
The new measures introduce stricter penalties across various violations, with particular focus on three-wheelers and underage drivers.
For the first time, the budget creates a dedicated category for three-wheeled vehicles, including rickshaws and loaders. Fines for these vehicles will now range from Rs200 to Rs10,000 depending on the offense.
Violations of route permits for three-wheelers will carry a Rs5,000 penalty, doubling for repeat offenders.
The government has also cracked down on fraudulent licenses, proposing fines between Rs5,000 and Rs10,000 for those caught driving with fake documents.
Additionally, penalties for underage driving will see substantial increases, with fines for motorcycle riders under 18 rising from Rs1,000 to Rs3,000, and small car drivers under 18 facing increased fines from Rs2,000 to Rs5,000.
Officials stated these measures aim to improve road safety and discipline across the province. APP

Red Bull warned FIA of potential trickery,"US
Verstappen arrived in Montreal with 11 penalty points
Red Bull spoke to Formula One's governing body before the Canadian Grand Prix to warn them that Max Verstappen's rivals might try and lure the Dutch driver into a one-race ban, according to team boss Christian Horner.
Four-times world champion Verstappen arrived in Montreal with 11 penalty points on his super licence, following a collision with Mercedes' George Russell in Spain, and 12 triggering an automatic suspension.
He will not shed any points until after Austria, Red Bull's home race, on June 29.
Horner revealed after Sunday's race that Red Bull spoke to race director Rui Marques after a drivers' meeting on Friday to express their concern and ask him to watch out for any potential trickery.
""I think that it was inevitable that there was going to be some potential gamesmanship,"" Horner told reporters.
""It's something that we raised after the driver's briefing with the race director, just so that they were mindful of it as well, because it was clear that that kind of stuff goes on.
""We just said to him 'Look, could they please keep an eye on it because there's been obviously comments have been raised in the media'.""
Russell said after qualifying on pole that he had more penalty points to play with than Verstappen and that could work to his advantage.
After the Briton won on Sunday, with Verstappen second, Red Bull protested.
A subsequent stewards document rejecting the protest revealed that Red Bull had claimed unsportsmanlike behaviour by Russell when the safety car was deployed.
Red Bull argued that Russell braked unnecessarily and erratically behind the safety car along the back straight and complained over the team radio that Verstappen had gone past when not allowed to.
Red Bull said the radio message ""displayed unsportsmanlike intent"" and Russell's braking had taken Verstappen by surprise, leaving him no alternative but to overtake momentarily.
They also suggested that onboard cameras showed Russell looking in his mirrors before braking ""to force (Verstappen) to overtake to force an infringement.""
Russell denied it, said he was not trying to force an investigation and Mercedes pointed out they had not lodged any complaint. The stewards accepted there had been no unsportsmanlike conduct.
Russell and Verstappen have a simmering rivalry and Red Bull have protested twice in the space of five races against the Mercedes driver.

Envisages Rs42 billion surplus; pay rises 10%, pensions up 7%
The Balochistan government unveiled Rs1028 billion surplus budge for the fiscal year 2025-26, outlining ambitious plans to boost education, healthcare, infrastructure, and law and order across the province and envisaging long-term growth, public welfare, and institutional strengthening.
Finance Minister Mir Shoaib Nosherwani presented the budget in the provincial assembly, chaired by Speaker Abdul khaliq Achakzai. Out of the total outlay, Rs642 billion had been allocated for non-development expenditures and Rs249 billion for development initiatives.
In his budget speech, Finance Minister Nosherwani said that the total expenditures for the next financial year had been estimated at Rs986 billion, with the volume of current operating expenditure dropping from Rs43 billion to Rs33 billion.

The provincial government set the target of generating Rs226 billion in revenues, while a development grants of Rs66.5 billion for federally-funded projects, and Rs38 billion as Foreign Projects Assistance (FPA) had been estimated, according to the budget documents.
""The provincial government successfully spent the entire development budget for the current fiscal year,"" the minister stated. In the next fiscal year, he added, the development budget of Rs 249.5 billion would be spent on about 3,633 ongoing and 2,550 new projects.

The budget also includes Rs18.5 billion for establishing Safe City projects in Quetta and other major urban centres. These projects aimed at enhancing surveillance, policing, and emergency response systems.
In line with global environmental concerns, a grant of Rs500 million had been allocated to the newly-established Balochistan Climate Change Fund, which would support climate resilience, conservation, and green development initiatives.

PSX ends bearish over profit-taking pressure,"KR
Policy rate status quo, weak rupee fuel downtrend; index falls 254 points
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a volatile trading session on Tuesday, mirroring global market trends amid escalation in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. The KSE-100 index swung between the high of 666 points and low of 409 points, before closing down by 254 points at 121,971.
Investor sentiment remained fragile as concerns over the Israel-Iran conflict, a weakening rupee and the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) decision to maintain its policy rate weighed on the market. The index saw early gains following the monetary policy announcement, but profit-taking set in towards the close of the session. Trading activity remained robust at 1.15 billion shares.
According to Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp, stocks closed lower amid a global equity rout, driven by geopolitical uncertainty and the State Bank's decision to leave the policy rate on hold due to the inflationary impact of the Israel-Iran conflict. He added that a weakening rupee, alongside rising imports, fuelled the negative close at the PSX.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 254.32 points, or 0.21%, and settled at 121,971.04.
In its review, Topline Securities commented that the PSX witnessed a volatile session, closely tracking global market cues. The benchmark index oscillated within a wide range, touching the intra-day high of 666 points and low of 409 points, before settling at 121,971, down 254 points.
Amid growing geopolitical uncertainty surrounding tensions between Iran and Israel, investors opted to stay cautious, leading to a lack of clear direction throughout the session. Sentiment remained fragile as the market struggled to find a firm footing, it said.
On the upside, index heavyweights UBL, HBL, Systems Limited and OGDC provided support by contributing 219 points. However, losses in Pakgen Power, Lucky Cement, Engro Holdings and Hub Power offset gains, dragging the index down by 291 points, Topline added.
Arif Habib Limited Deputy Head of Trading Ali Najib remarked that the KSE-100 index posted a marginal decline of 0.21% day-on-day, closing just below the 122k mark at 121,971.
The session resumed on a positive note post Monday's monetary policy committee announcement of ""no change"". However, at the day's high at 122,892, profit-taking kicked in, which pushed the index into negative territory. Due to the selling, the KSE-100 broke the 122k level, he noted.
On the macro front, high-level tariff negotiations were held between Pakistan and the United States, with both sides expressing the commitment to expediting a trade agreement. Moreover, the external account saw pressure in May with a current account deficit of $103 million, in contrast to a $47 million surplus in April, Najib added.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the market opened on a positive note, quickly touching the high of 122,891 in early hours of trading. However, profit-taking pressure erased all gains, pulling the index into the red.
Trading was dominated by small-cap stocks, which reflected speculative short-term interest, he said. ""The broader trend remains uncertain, with investors exercising caution ahead of key developments. We advise them to maintain a defensive approach and avoid aggressive exposure for now,"" the analyst added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 1.15 billion shares compared with Monday's tally of 1.22 billion. The value of shares traded was Rs28 billion. Shares of 473 companies were traded. Of these, 193 stocks closed higher, 244 fell and 36 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 239.8 million shares, inching down one paisa to close at Rs1.61. It was followed by Pervez Ahmed Consultancy with 97.5 million shares, falling Rs0.05 to close at Rs3.88 and Sui Southern Gas Company with 49.9 million shares, gaining Rs1.54 to close at Rs44.82. Foreign investors bought shares worth Rs28.1 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

LHC seeks legal status of May 9 plotters,"US

The Lahore High Court (LHC) has sought details by June 19 regarding the legal status of those PTI leaders who participated in a meeting where the party's founding chairman, Imran Khan, allegedly instructed party members to target military installations in the event of his arrest.
In the meantime, the division bench, headed by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, also directed the prosecution to conclude arguments on the bail pleas filed by Imran Khan in multiple cases registered against him in connection with the May 9 riots. The court asked for a list of all meeting participants to determine who had secured bail or who had been arrested.
At the start of proceedings, a list containing the names of witnesses of the May 9 incidents, who had recorded their statements, was submitted before the court.
The court was apprised of all details about the cases in which those witness statements had been recorded.
The law officer informed the court that this was not a routine case and that different methods had been used to collect evidence. He maintained that, under the law, it is not necessary for a person inciting violence to be directly involved in acts of arson.
Anyone inciting the public to violence would face the same consequences as those committing arson or disrupting law and order, he added.
The law officer further argued that any person whose instructions lead the public to gather and cause disruption or destruction would be held equally responsible.

The summit in Astana brought together Xi with the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Under Russia's orbit until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the five Central Asian states have courted interest from major powers including China, the European Union and the United States since becoming independent.
At the summit, the group signed a pact of ""eternal"" friendship as Xi called for closer ties with the resource-rich region.
""We should... strengthen cooperation with a more enterprising attitude and more practical measures,"" said Xi in comments carried by state news agency Xinhua.
Central Asia is also seen as a key logistics hub, given its strategic location between China, Russia, the Middle East and Europe.
Speaking as Western leaders gathered on the other side of the world for the G7 in Canada, Xi refreshed his criticism of US President Donald Trump's trade policies.
""Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners,"" Xinhua quoted him as saying.
While Central Asian leaders continue to view Russia as a strategic partner, ties with Moscow have loosened since the war in Ukraine.
China has also shown willingness to invest in massive infrastructure projects in the region, part of its Belt and Road initiative that uses such financing as a political and diplomatic lever.

"Taxes on hybrid cars, solar panels being withdrawn","PK
NA committee rejects 18% ST on imported solar panels
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance on Tuesday unanimously rejected the proposed 18% sales tax on the import of solar panels, while the government also announced the withdrawal of another controversial measure to increase sales tax on hybrid vehicles, reversing both the anti-environment initiatives.
The committee in its meeting, chaired by Pakistan Peoples Party's (PPP) National Assembly member (MNA) and former finance minister Syed Naveed Qamar, also raised questions on the proposed new bill, the Digital Presence Proceeds Act 2025 but did not announce its judgment.
The rejection of the 18% sales tax on import of solar panels and its parts, as announced by Qamar, is the first such rejection by the committee after it started discussing the Finance Bill. Unlike the Senate, the decisions of the National Assembly or its standing committee are binding in case of the Finance Bill.
The government had estimated Rs20 billion in revenues from the 18% sales tax on the import and supply of photovoltaic cells, whether assembled or not. Since the IMF had not endorsed the proposal, the rejection by the committee will not have any adverse implications for the IMF programme.
During the committee meeting, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Langrial argued that sales tax had already been levied on the local assembly of the solar panels; therefore, the rejection of the import stage tax could put the local industry at a disadvantage.
However, he could not give firm figures about the share of the local industry in the total sales but said that a very few percentage was supplied locally. ""If the government did not accept our rejection, the National Assembly will veto it,"" Qamar said.
Qamar asked the government to find other ways for incentivising the local industry. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said that the era of giving subsidies had ended. On that Qamar reminded him that the government had just announced subsidies in the budget for electric vehicles.
In the budget, the government had imposed 1% to 3% car engine levy to raise Rs10 billion for funding the electric vehicles. ""It is a cross subsidy on electric vehicles"", Aurangzeb said. ""It is still a subsidy funded by someone else,"" retorted Qamar.
The government has long been trying to discourage the use of solar panels – a source of cheaper electricity – over the government-sold expensive grid-based power. ""No political party in the National Assembly has supported the 18% tax and the government will have to withdraw it,"" Qamar said. The finance minister acknowledged the feedback.
Hybrid cars
Meanwhile, the government on Tuesday announced the withdrawal of the proposed increase in the sales tax rate from 12.5% to 18% on hybrid cars of up to 1800 cc. This would result in a loss of Rs7 billion potential revenue.
The reduced sales tax rate of 12.5% on the hybrid cars would stay, FBR Chairman Langrial stated. Although, he told the committee, the finance minister had announced it in the budget speech, the tax would not be increased.
It is the second time in the past one year when the government announced to increase the sales tax rate on hybrid cars but subsequently withdrew it before the approval of the budget by the National Assembly. Under the automobile policy, the government cannot increase the rate till June 2026.
However, the FBR chairman refused to withdraw the proposed increase in the sales tax rate for middle income group's up to 850 cc cars. In the budget, the government has proposed to increase the sales tax rate on 850 cc cars from 12.5% to 18%.
Langrial said that if a person can buy a Rs3 million small car, he can also pay 18% sales tax. It seems that after the budget small cars will become expensive but the luxurious SUVs will become cheaper, remarked MNA Usama Mela of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).
The committee had a heated discussion on the issue of giving policing powers to the FBR and the fear of its abuse by the taxmen. The entire Finance Bill is like declaring martial law on businesses, remarked PPP MNA Nafisa Shah.
However, the chairman FBR took an exception to labelling the bill as a piece of martial law work. ""The harsh words like martial law have been used but I want to clarify that I work for the democratic government,"" Langrial said, before opting to leave the meeting hall.
The standing committee also showed its discomfort over giving FBR's authority to the local police to trace the non-tax paid cigarettes and confiscate those. The members observed that this would give another window to the police to extract money from the people. ""Poor people smoke to relieve stress but the rich can afford diet coke,"" Sharmila Faruqi remarked.
The committee also questioned the government's new bill, the Digital Presence Proceeds Act. The bill has been introduced to charge 5% tax on the value of online payments made to foreign digital companies like Netflix and Amazon.
FBR Member Dr Najeeb Memon said that the quantum of foreign payments was much more than Rs300 billion and the government could easily get Rs15 billion in revenues. He said that the credit card payments to firms like Netflix and Amazon stood at Rs300 billion this year. The size of tax-free sales by Temu was also Rs4 billion.
The committee members called for bring the bill as a separate law instead of making it part of the Finance Bill.

Tarbela water levels drop dangerously low,"HK
Tarbela Dam's full storage capacity is 1,550 feet
Water levels in the Tarbela Dam have dropped to dangerously low levels, posing a serious challenge to electricity generation due to a lack of rainfall.
A continuous decline in water inflow is being recorded at the dam owing to the ongoing dry spell. Currently, the water level at Tarbela stands at 1450.85 feet, which is just 48 feet above the dead level of 1402 feet.
According to a spokesperson, if the current situation persists, a further decline in the water level is feared. Although all power generation units at the dam are operational, electricity production remains limited. The inflow of water into the dam is 177,400 cusecs, while the outflow is at 151,800 cusecs. Despite all 17 power generation units being functional, they are producing only 1,413 megawatts of electricity at present, far below their total generation capacity of 4,888 megawatts. Water storage is critically low.
Tarbela Dam's full storage capacity is 1,550 feet, but the current level is almost 100 feet below that mark.
Water experts and officials from the Ministry of Energy have warned that if weather conditions do not improve soon and rainfall does not begin, water levels may drop even further. This could not only affect irrigation but also result in a significant reduction in power generation.

"K-P fully met IMF targets, says CM","US
Gandapur reveals province's revenues stand at Rs125b
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur said the K-P government has fully met the International Monetary Fund (IMF) targets while it is working on a dedicated provincial power transmission line to provide locally produced electricity to industries at subsidized rates.
Over the next three years, 500 MW of hydropower projects will be completed. To support energy needs at the grassroots level, 132,000 deserving households will be provided solar systems free of cost or at subsidized rates, the K-P CM added.
He shared these views during a meeting with a delegation of the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE), led by its newly elected President Kazim Khan.
Gandapur revealed that the province's own revenues stood at Rs125 billion. He highlighted that the current provincial government exercised strict financial discipline and effective monitoring, which enabled the establishment of a Debt Management Fund with an investment of Rs150 billion during the current fiscal year, with another Rs150 billion are to be added in the next fiscal year, generating significant profit for the province.
Talking about the province's Annual Development Programme (ADP), the CM noted that the throw-forward of the ADP stood at 13.5 years when his government took over, which has now been reduced to four years.
He said that due to poor planning in the past, delays in the completion of development projects over the last 15 years led to cost escalations amounting to a loss of Rs450 billion. The current government has prioritized the completion of ongoing schemes over launching new ones, successfully completing 541 development projects during the past year. He added that the government has presented a balanced and progressive budget for 2025-26 fiscal year.
Gandapur said the new ADP will lay the foundation for projects to be completed within the next three years. A total of Rs195 billion has been allocated for the ADP in the next fiscal year, which will be enhanced to Rs250 billion. For the current fiscal year, Rs120 billion was allocated, all of which has been released, followed by an additional Rs35 billion under ADP Plus.
Discussing his government's 15-month performance, the K-P chief minister mentioned that Rs72 billion in arrears were cleared across various departments, including public universities.

Is Iran really an existential threat to Israel?,"PK
Rather Israel's expansionist policies, uncritical Western backing threatens long-term peace in Middle East
The dominant Western narrative portrays Iran as a looming existential threat to Israel.
This framing is not just misleading — it distracts from the deeper roots of regional instability. In truth, it is not Iran that poses a threat to Israel's survival, but rather Israel's own expansionist policies and its uncritical Western backing that threaten long-term peace in the Middle East.
To understand the current tensions, we must revisit history. The creation of Israel in 1948, following the horrors of the Holocaust, was not simply a humanitarian response. It was also a colonial project rooted in Zionism — a political ideology that sought to establish a Jewish state on land already inhabited by Arab Muslims and Christians. The result was mass displacement, the destruction of hundreds of villages and the forced exile of Palestinians, whose descendants remain stateless to this day.
Israel quickly evolved into a militarised and apartheid state. The 1967 war was a turning point, after which Israel occupied the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Golan Heights. Despite international law clearly prohibiting settlement in occupied territories, Israel has relentlessly expanded its settlements, turning the dream of a two-state solution into a distant illusion. Palestinians in Gaza lived under a suffocating blockade until recently when it was reduced to rubbles following the October 7 attack.
Iran's hostility towards Israel must be understood in this broader historical and strategic context. While its rhetoric is often inflammatory, Iran's postures are largely reactive — an attempt to counterbalance a nuclear-armed Israel that has repeatedly carried out airstrikes, assassinations and cyber operations inside Iranian territory. Israel has also supported proxy conflicts in Lebanon and Syria, and routinely violates the sovereignty of its neighbours with impunity.
The idea that Iran poses an existential threat to Israel does not hold up against the facts. Israel enjoys military superiority, including undeclared nuclear weapons, and receives billions of dollars in aid from the US annually. It is a regional hegemon with powerful global alliances. In contrast, Iran faces crippling sanctions, international isolation and internal political unrest.
This narrative of threat, however, serves a convenient purpose. It allows Israel to deflect attention from its ongoing occupation and the systemic discrimination against Palestinians. It enables Western powers to continue supporting Israel under the guise of protecting democracy in the Middle East — despite the fact that Israel governs millions of Palestinians who have no right to vote in the state that controls their lives.
Of course, Iran's conduct is not without criticism. Its support for armed groups and its theocratic model invite scrutiny. But to paint it as the singular aggressor in the region while ignoring Israel's long record of expansionism, oppression and refusal to negotiate is intellectually dishonest and over-simplification of the ground realities.
This distorted framing also has dangerous consequences. It sustains cycles of violence, sidelines calls for justice and pushes the region further into militarised stalemates. As long as Israel continues to act with impunity, peace will remain elusive. Military victories may bring temporary calm, but they cannot substitute for the moral and political courage required to resolve the core issue: the denial of Palestinian rights and sovereignty.
If the world genuinely seeks peace in the Middle East, it must stop indulging Israel's victimhood narrative while ignoring its role as an occupying power. It must also recognise that justice — not domination — is the only path to lasting peace. The two-state solution, once a global consensus, is slipping away as settlements expand and extremism grows on all sides.
Iran is not Israel's existential threat. Israel's real crisis is moral and political: a refusal to acknowledge the suffering it has inflicted, and a failure to envision a future based on coexistence rather than conquest. Peace is never the product of silence imposed by force. It flows only from justice. And justice begins by recognising that a secure Israel cannot be built on the ruins of a stateless Palestine.

Man kills sister for 'honour' in Rawat,"US
In separate incident, four suspects stab taxi driver to death over old dispute
A man and a woman were killed in two separate incidents in different areas of Rawalpindi on Tuesday.
According to the police, a man, along with his sister's brother-in-law, allegedly murdered her in the name of honour. The victim, Zehrish Bibi, wife of Faisal Mehmood, was shot dead after being subjected to violence inside her home.
Assistant Sub-Inspector Asad Ali stated that the police were on a routine patrol when they heard gunshots and shouting coming from the Dhok Irfan Ali area. Upon reaching the scene, the policemen saw two armed men fleeing the residence of Mehmood. Inside the house, they discovered Zehrish lying dead on a sofa, fatally wounded.
Police identified the suspects on the run as Nafees Akhtar, the victim's brother, and Naveed Kiyani, her brother-in-law. The two allegedly conspired to kill her in the name of honour, disapproving of her interactions with others. Zehrish Bibi is survived by her husband, who works as a tandoor operator at a private hotel, and two young childrena three-year-old daughter and a one-and-a-half-year-old son.
The police have registered a case and launched a search to arrest the suspects.
On the same day, four suspects stabbed a taxi driver, Mazhar Hussain, to death in a bazaar. The assailants fled after committing the crime.
The police said that one of the suspects was identified as Ilyas, adding that the suspects killed Hussain over an old dispute. A murder case has been registered based on the complaint filed by the victim's sister, Saghira Bibi.

Russian strikes kill 14 in Kyiv,"US
.
Russia launched dozens of drones and missiles at Kyiv in the early hours of Tuesday, killing at least 14 people and wounding dozens of others, as negotiations faltered between Kyiv and Moscow.
President Volodymyr Zelensky described the latest overnight barrage as ""one of the most horrific attacks"" on Kyiv since the Kremlin launched its brutal invasion of Ukraine more than three years ago.
Zelensky said a total of 440 drones and 32 missiles were launched in the strikes nationwide and urged the international community not to ""turn a blind eye"".
""Our families had a very difficult night. One of the biggest attacks from the very beginning of the war,"" Zelensky said at the G7 summit in Canada.
""We need support from our allies,"" he added.
AFP journalists saw smoke billowing over the capital's skyline at dawn and a multiple-storey housing block gutted by the attack. Rescue workers were scrambling to find any survivors buried beneath the rubble.
""It was probably the most hellish night in my memory for our neighbourhood,"" 20-year-old student Alina Shtompel told AFP.
""It is indescribably painful that our people are going through this right now.""
More than three years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Moscow has stepped up attacks despite efforts by the United States to broker a ceasefire.
Talks have stalled. Moscow has rejected the ""unconditional"" truce demanded by Kyiv and its European allies, while Ukraine has dismissed Russia's demands as ""ultimatums"".
Zelensky had been hoping to speak with Donald Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit, but the US leader cut short his visit, amid the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran.
Russia hit some 27 sites in Kyiv overnight and some residents were left without electricity, officials said.
""The total number of dead is now 14 after the enemy attack on the capital last night,"" Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Telegram.
""The search and rescue operation continues,"" he added.
The Russian defence ministry said it had carried out precision strikes on ""military-industrial facilities in the Kyiv region,"" in a statement similar to those releases after major attacks.
Germany vowed in response to ""increase the pressure"" on Russia. The strike showed that ""Russia is using diplomacy merely as a facade,"" the foreign ministry wrote on X.
French President Emmanuel Macron accused his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin of exploiting the international climate to carry out a deadly attack on Kyiv.
""It shows the complete cynicism of President Putin, who is using the international context to step again attacks against civilians,"" Macron told reporters in Canada.
Ukrainian cities are targeted by Russian air strikes almost daily. Kyiv has responded with attacks on Russian territory.
Four people were killed on Tuesday in drone strikes on Russia's border regions of Belgorod and Kursk, the regional governors said.
Dozens of residents took shelter in a metro station in central Kyiv, sleeping on mats, exchanging information on attack or reassuring pets, AFP journalists reported, while drones buzzed and explosions echoed out over the city.
""I was asleep. There was a loud bang. The window was smashed, and glass rained down on me,"" Sergii, a Kyiv resident, said.
Residential buildings, educational institutions and ""critical infrastructure facilities"" were all hit, Interior Minister Igor Klymenko said.

Real Effective Exchange Rate improves to 97.81 in May,"US
Represents 1.5% drop from previous month's figure of 99.30, according to AKD Securities
Pakistan's Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) index, a crucial indicator of trade competitiveness, improved to 97.81 in May 2025, according to a report released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
This represents a 1.5% drop from the previous month's figure of 99.30, according to AKD Securities.
The decrease in REER, which measures the value of a currency against the weighted average of several trade partner currencies, suggests that Pakistan's exports have become more competitive in the international market. An index value below 100 typically indicates the currency is undervalued, making the country's goods and services cheaper for foreign buyers.
""Both PKR depreciation and lower inflation vs trading partners have contributed to the decline in REER index in recent months,"" said Maaz Azam, Head of Research at Optimus Capital.
The Pakistani rupee weakened 0.37% against the US dollar, ending the month of May at an exchange rate of 282.02. This development is likely to be viewed favourably by exporters as a more competitive exchange rate can help boost sales and support the country's external account.
On Tuesday, the rupee weakened against the US dollar by 0.08% in the inter-bank market. By the end of trading, the local currency stood at 283.41, down 24 paisa compared to the previous close at 283.17.
Globally, the US dollar edged up, while most other currencies traded within narrow ranges as investors stayed cautious amid persistent Middle East tensions and upcoming central bank policy announcements.
Meanwhile, gold prices in Pakistan declined on Tuesday, mirroring a drop in the global market. In the domestic market, the price of gold per tola fell Rs1,000 to settle at Rs361,300. Likewise, the price of 10 grams of gold dipped Rs857 to Rs309,756, according to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA).
Internationally, gold prices also moved lower, falling $16 to $3,398 per ounce (including a $20 premium), as reported by the APSGJA.
Interactive Commodities Director Adnan Agar stated that gold prices remained largely stable, with future movements depending on potential involvement of the US in the Iran-Israel conflict. He noted that if the US decided to intervene, gold prices could see a sharp increase; otherwise, the market was expected to remain steady.

PM asked to save value-added sector,"US
Exporters demand restoration of Final Tax Regime, Export Facilitation Scheme
Pakistan's $11 billion export-oriented value-added industry, which contributes nearly one-third of total exports, has issued a strong SOS appeal to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, saying that recent budgetary measures are set to derail export-focused sectors at a critical time.
In a joint statement, Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association, Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers Association, the Surgical Instruments Manufacturers Association, Sialkot Chamber of Commerce and others demanded the immediate revival of the Final Tax Regime and restoration of the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) in its original structure.
They expressed concern that despite the government's slogan of export-led growth, the reality on the ground was entirely the opposite. ""The government always talks about promoting exports, but in practice, no department seems to be on board.""
They pointed out that in the budget speech, the finance minister uttered the word ""export"" only once and that too in a negative context in order to impose duty on imported yarn under the EFS.
Addressing the prime minister, the joint statement said, ""We urge you to intervene immediately and convene an emergency meeting with leading export associations before this budget is passed. If this situation persists, Pakistan's most reliable foreign exchange earning sector will suffer irreparable damage."" In such a policy environment, they cautioned, the government's vision of taking exports to $100 billion under Uraan Pakistan was simply not possible.
Industry leaders categorically said that they were not asking for subsidies, exemptions or special treatment, but just wanted a level playing field to compete globally. International buyers are actively seeking long-term clarity and stability in the EFS framework as Pakistan has a chance to attract businesses being diverted from China.
The Final Tax Regime has been replaced by complex procedures, audits and refund hurdles.

Matthew Perry death doctor to plead guilty,"IN
Salvador Plasencia was charged with actor's overdose
The main doctor charged in connection with the drug overdose of American-Canadian actor and Friends star Matthew Perry is expected to enter a guilty plea in the coming weeks, the US Justice Department said on Monday.
Salvador Plasencia ""has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, which carries a statutory maximum sentence of 40 years in federal prison,"" the department said in a statement.
The second doctor in the case, Mark Chavez, pleaded guilty last October to conspiring to distribute ketamine in the weeks before the actor was found dead in the hot tub of his Los Angeles home in 2023.
Perry's lengthy struggles with substance addiction were well-documented, but his death at age 54 sent shockwaves through the global legions of Friends fans.
A criminal investigation was launched soon after an autopsy discovered the actor had high levels of ketamine – an anesthetic – in his system.
Plasencia allegedly bought ketamine off Chavez and sold it to the desperate star at hugely inflated prices.
Jasveen Sangha, the alleged ""Ketamine Queen"" who supplied drugs to high-end clients and celebrities, is charged with selling Perry the dose that killed him.
She has pleaded not guilty.
Comedic television series Friends, which followed the lives of six New Yorkers navigating adulthood, dating and careers, drew a massive global following and made megastars of previously unknown actors.
Perry's role as the sarcastic man-child Chandler brought him fabulous wealth, but hid a dark struggle with addiction to painkillers and alcohol.
In 2018, he suffered a drug-related burst colon and underwent multiple surgeries.
In his 2022 memoir Friends, Lovers and the Big Terrible Thing, Perry described going through detox dozens of times.
""I have mostly been sober since 2001,"" he wrote, ""save for about sixty or seventy little mishaps.""

Current account slips back into $103m deficit,"US
Remittances offset trade gap, but gains remain fragile amid FDI drop, oil risks
Pakistan recorded a current account deficit of $103 million in May 2025, narrowing from a deficit of $235 million in the same month last year but reversing the $47 million surplus seen in April 2025.
Although Pakistan posted a rare current account surplus of $1.8 billion during the first eleven months of FY25 — marking a significant turnaround from the $1.6 billion deficit recorded in the same period last yearexperts caution that underlying external sector vulnerabilities remain a cause for concern.
""The trade deficit expanded in May 2025, increasing to $3.2 billion compared to $2.2 billion in the same period last year,"" wrote AHL. The overall trade balance posted a deficit of $27 billion in 11MFY25, up from $23 billion during the same period last year.
""We expect the country to post a current account surplus of $1.6 billion in FY25 after 14 years,"" said the brokerage house. ""This growth is mainly due to an increase in remittances by 26% year-on-year to $38.1 billion, in our view.""
The surplus was largely driven by a sharp 26% year-on-year jump in workers' remittances, which soared to $38.1 billion. This inflow has helped cushion the impact of a widening trade deficit, as goods imports surged by 11% to $54.1 billion, outpacing the modest 4% growth in goods exports that stood at $29.7 billion.
Exports faced a fresh blow in May 2025, slipping by 19% year-on-year to $2.4 billion, while technology exports, once seen as a potential growth engine, edged down 1% to $329 million. This underperformance underscores Pakistan's struggle to diversify and expand its export base.
Nasheed Malik of Topline Securities noted that Pakistan recorded monthly IT exports worth $329 million in May 2025, reflecting a slight decline of 1% year-on-year but an increase of 4% on a month-on-month basis. These exports were also higher than the 12-month average of $314 million. Notably, this marked the first year-on-year decline in IT exports after 19 consecutive months of growth. Export proceeds averaged $16.5 million per day in May 2025, up from $15.9 million in April 2025.
Cumulatively, IT exports reached approximately $3.5 billion during 11MFY25, showing a strong 19% year-on-year increase. This impressive growth is attributed to several key factors: the expansion of Pakistani IT companies' client base globally, especially in the GCC region; the relaxation by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) of the permissible retention limit in Exporters' Specialised Foreign Currency Accounts from 35% to 50%; the allowance of equity investment abroad through these accounts; and the stability of the Pakistani rupee, which has encouraged exporters to repatriate a larger portion of their earnings.
Pakistani IT firms have also been actively engaging with international clients, as demonstrated by their participation in major global events such as LEAP 2025 in Saudi Arabia and Web Summit Qatar 2025, said Malik.
A significant development in FY25 is the SBP's introduction of a new category — Equity Investment Abroad (EIA) — specifically for export-oriented IT companies. Under this provision, IT exporters can now acquire equity stakes in foreign entities by utilising up to 50% of the proceeds from their specialised foreign currency accounts. This measure is expected to further boost the confidence of IT exporters and incentivise the repatriation of export earnings to Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the services sector remains in deficit, posting a gap of $2.7 billion for the period, as service exports failed to offset persistent import demand. The primary income deficit, largely reflecting profit repatriation and interest payments on external debt, stood at a hefty $7.9 billion in 11MFY25.
Adding to the concern is the sharp decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, which dropped to $1.98 billion, indicating foreign investors' cautious stance amid Pakistan's challenging economic and political landscape.
Analysts warn that the recent surplus is not structural but cyclical, heavily reliant on remittances and import compression. ""If imports rebound or remittance growth slows, the surplus could swiftly reverse,"" a market observer noted.
The outlook for the external account remains uncertain, with potential risks stemming from volatile global oil prices and rising debt servicing needs, both of which could strain Pakistan's fragile external position.
In May 2025, Pakistan's primary income deficit narrowed significantly by 47% year-on-year to $777 million, compared to $1,478 million in May 2024, largely due to the absence of hefty profit repatriation recorded in the same period last year. However, on a month-on-month basis, the deficit widened by 31%.
Meanwhile, the balance on secondary income improved by 12% year-on-year, rising to $3.9 billion in May 2025 from $3.5 billion in May 2024, supported by strong inflows such as workers' remittances. On a month-on-month comparison, however, secondary income declined by 13% from $3.5 billion recorded in April 2025.

Key Muslim states condemn Israel,"US
.
Amid growing regional instability, 20 Muslim countries including key regional stakeholders such as Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Egypt issued a joint statement on Tuesday condemning the recent Israeli military strikes on Iran and proposed a nuclear free Middle East.
The joint communiqué, released by Foreign office here, termed the Israeli attacks — launched on June 13 — ""a violation of international law"" and a threat to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran. The statement came against the backdrop of spiraling tensions following Israel's sustained military actions targeting Iranian facilities and assets, raising fears of a wider regional conflict. The statement was signed by the foreign ministers of Algeria, Bahrain, Brunei, Chad, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.
The joint statement categorically rejected and condemned Israel's recent attacks on the Islamic Republic of Iran since the 13th while emphasizing the necessity of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, adhering to the principles of good neighbourliness, and peaceful settlement of disputes.
""The imperative need to halt Israeli hostilities against Iran, which come during a time of increasing tension in the Middle East, and to work towards de-escalation, to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire and restoration of calm, while expressing great concern regarding this dangerous escalation, which threatens to have serious consequences on the peace and stability of the entire region,"" according to the joint communiqué.
The key highlight of the joint statement was the urgent necessity of establishing a Middle East Zone Free of Nuclear Weapons and Other Weapons of Mass Destruction, which shall apply to all States in the region without exception in line with relevant international resolutions, as well as the urgent need for all countries of the Middle East to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
Israel, though never publicly has denied or acknowledged, does have nuclear weapons and is not signatory to the NPT.
The ministers expressed ""grave concern"" over what they called a ""dangerous escalation"" that risks destabilizing the entire Middle East and called for an immediate halt to Israeli hostilities. They urged all parties to work toward de-escalation, a comprehensive ceasefire, and the restoration of regional calm.
In a strongly worded caution, the statement emphasized the importance of refraining from attacks on nuclear facilities under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, warning that such acts not only breach international law but also violate the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
The foreign ministers called for a ""swift return to negotiations"" to resolve issues surrounding Iran's nuclear program, describing diplomacy and dialogue as the only viable pathway to peace.
The statement also underscored the importance of preserving freedom of navigation in international waterways, amid rising fears that any military spillover could disrupt vital trade routes in the Persian Gulf and beyond.
Reaffirming their commitment to a peaceful resolution, the ministers concluded: ""Military means cannot bring about a lasting solution to the ongoing crisis.""
The joint declaration signals growing frustration in the Muslim and regional bloc over Israel's aggressive posture, and is likely to increase pressure on the international community to intervene diplomatically before the conflict engulfs the broader Middle East.

Featured on Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia list, Nadeem's triumph proves Pakistani youth need only right support
In a nation often weighed down by crises, it takes a single act of brilliance to uplift the collective spirit — and Arshad Nadeem delivered that moment of glory.
\With a staggering 92.97-meter throw that not only secured Olympic gold but shattered records in Paris 2024, Nadeem catapulted Pakistan into global sporting headlines. More than just a medal, his achievement rewrote the narrative of Pakistani athletics and gave the country its first individual Olympic gold in history — a first of any colour in over three decades.
Now featured on Forbes' 30 Under 30 Asia list in the Entertainment and Sports category, Nadeem's triumph has proven that Pakistan's youth need only the right support and belief to compete at the world stage.
Forbes described his performance as a ""stunning show"", but for Pakistanis, it was nothing short of a national reset.
His feat is being celebrated at home through more than just headlines. With over Rs153 million awarded by the Punjab and Sindh governments and commendations from various institutions, the recognition is befitting of his historic win.
A road in Islamabad now bears his name, and a commemorative stamp released by Pakistan Post on Independence Day ensures his legacy is etched in both memory and material.
Arshad Nadeem's story is a lesson in resilience, in rising above structural shortcomings to put Pakistan on the global sporting map.
His journey from Mian Channu to the Olympic podium tells the world that Pakistan is a reservoir of untapped athletic potential.
As the country basks in his glory, the onus is now on our institutions to channel this momentum. If nurtured right, Nadeem's legacy can be a turning point for the sporting industry.

'The Simpsons' creators discuss long-running animation's legacy
With more than 750 episodes, a feature film, comics, and its catchphrases embedded in the pop-culture across nearly four decades, The Simpsons continues its legacy, remaining one of the most loved shows on television.
At this year's Annecy Animation Festival, The Simpsons creators joined to celebrate the long-running show, which has recently been greenlit for more episodes. The re-order will see it cross 40 seasons.
""The fans are as intense as ever. In fact, more intense. When we were here last, we got a pretty great response. But this time, it's completely nuts,"" series creator Matt Groening told Variety during an interview at the festival.
Since 1989
The buzz, achieved by the series, is perhaps due to the fact that The Simpsons has never taken a hiatus since its debut, carving a solid base with its consistency.
""We've been on the air since 1989,"" Groening said. ""The show goes year-round. The fact that we're here in France to celebrate the show means we're going to be a week behind.""
While the show has been a mainstay on TV, streaming has only amplified its impact. ""Being on Disney+ has been somewhat rejuvenating for us,"" Matt Selman said. ""Not that we realised we needed rejuvenation, but we appreciate it.""
The audience doesn't have to wait for reruns on TV or buy DVDs. It's all available with just one click. ""Now instead of the kids watching it on local TV in the afternoon, they can just watch it all, all the time, all day, all forever,"" Selman added. ""We really have that super connection to young people.""
While the connection with young people has always been there for the show, their access to it wasn't always easy. Many parents didn't allow their children to watch The Simpsons due to the show's mature elements and cartoon violence. But the allure of the forbidden always outweighs restrictions. And The Simpsons's relevance among the younger audience through the decades is just one proof piece of evidence for that.
""One of the best things that ever happened in the course of the show was that some people forbade the show,"" Groening recalled. ""It became this exotic, forbidden thing. Bart Simpson Underachiever T-shirts were once controversial and banned in schools. So when we did a Lisa Simpson Overachiever T-shirt, but we got in trouble for that because it said 'Damn I'm Good.'""
New seasons
The new four seasons will have 17 episodes each, instead of the usual 22.
""Work has a way of expanding to fill the time available,"" Groening said. ""But if you know that you have four seasons to think about, it changes how you approach storytelling.""
However, the show, which has seen entire distribution and marketing methods evolve through the times, has never quite stayed limited to TV. It has expanded into music, games, and even merchandise such as lunchboxes. For the creators, even the merch becomes part of the storytelling.
""It is storytelling,"" said Groening. ""Even merchandise – even a lunch box – we try to tell a little story, and include a little joke. We try to avoid what's called in the biz a 'label slap,'"" he added. ""We actually try to have jokes on everything.""
Silverman pointed out the meta humour they include via the characters, ""Even comment on what we're doing, you know, like our characters being on a lunch box – it's sort of making some observation about being on a lunch box.""
Selman, on the other hand, brought up the satire vs commercialisation argument. ""The show was always sort of able to have its cake and eat it too, in terms of selling a lot of merchandise but also satirising the phenomenon of over-merchandising. It was like, 'Look, can you believe we're doing this?'""
The creators cite an example from the show when in an early episode, they showed Krusty Flakes on a kitchen table with the cereal's slogan 'Because only sugar has more sugar.'
When the team later attempted to develop a healthier cereal in the real world, ""there was not a single cereal company in America that would put it out,"" as Groening said,
Editing process
The makers also discussed the editing process of the show. They pointed out the struggles of getting the pacing right since otherwise, the whole episode collapses.
""If a show is cut really tight and the jokes don't breathe, the scenes seem too fast-paced,"" Selman said. ""None of it really seems as funny or as engaging.""
""This is the kind of thing we agonise over,"" Groening added.
It's fantastic to see the makers, who have already seen and done it all for decades, not rest on their laurels after all the decades. They are constantly adapting and evolving with the times and learning to expand and understand and be on the same page with the real-world surroundings. Undoubtedly, this approach is the cause of the success of The Simpsons.

Senators call for fiscal reforms,"US
PPP, MQM clash during NA debate on budget
Lawmakers in the Upper House on Tuesday called for providing more relief to the common man and stressed the need to address rising poverty, national debt, agricultural decline, and institutional inefficiencies while reaffirming their support for national defense and unity in the face of regional challenges.
While participating in the general discussion on Budget 2025-26, Senator Kamran Murtaza said that during every budget exercise, two types of approaches emerge — one focused on ideological vision and the other aimed at immediate public relief.
He stressed that the major challenge in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan remains the law and order situation, which demands concrete and sustained measures.
""We stand united with our armed forces and remain loyal to the country,"" he stated.
Highlighting socio-economic concerns, Senator Murtaza said nearly half of the population is facing extreme poverty and lacks access to essential items such as food and medicine.
He emphasized the need to tackle overpopulation wisely and called for empowering the youth through technical education and skills development.
He criticized the budget, citing a decline in crop yields and the deteriorating state of agriculture. ""Farmers are struggling, and taxes are being levied on those already burdened,"" he remarked. He urged the government to review its policies and provide greater relief to the underprivileged.
Senator Saadia Abbasi also expressed reservations about the federal budget, stating that the country faces a multitude of challenges including trade imbalances, climate change impacts on agriculture, inadequate infrastructure reforms, mismanaged debt, and stagnating industrial growth.
Meanwhile, the debate on Pakistan's proposed budget for the upcoming fiscal year in the National Assembly intensified on Tuesday as tensions flared between PPP and MQM members.
PPP's Shazia Marri, in her address, called criticised the government's failure to announce minimum wages for workers and called for a reasonable increase in government employees' salaries.
Her speech took an unexpected turn when a heated exchange broke out between PPP and MQM members, escalating tensions in the assembly.
As Shazia stressed the importance of Karachi remaining an integral part of Sindh, MQM's Asiya Ishaq approached PPP members, leading to an intervention by Aseefa Bhutto, Sahar Kamran, and others.
This led to a tense exchange of harsh words between both parties. Javed Hanif remarked, ""You people have abandoned Karachi, and now you threaten us.""

K-P utilises Rs120b ADP budget for current fiscal,"US
CM's advisor says province also incurred uplift expenditures exceeding Rs150b
K-P Chief Minister's Advisor on Finance and Interprovincial Coordination Muzzammil Aslam told the K-P Assembly that the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government not only successfully completed the Annual Development Program (ADP) worth Rs120 billion for the ongoing fiscal but also incurred development expenditures exceeding Rs150 billion.
Responding to questions during the provincial assembly's budget session, the CM's aide said the current government, prioritizing public welfare, introduced financial reforms, curtailed expenditures, increased revenues, and succeeded in presenting a surplus budget — a first in the province's history. He further noted that the government had secured Rs150 billion in a debt fund to gradually pay off the province's debts.
The finance advisor emphasized the need for the federal government to fulfill the province's financial rights, adding that Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur had forcefully and effectively advocated for the protection of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's constitutional and financial rights in relation to the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award.
As a result of these efforts, positive outcomes are emerging, and the federal government is now preparing to announce the 11th NFC Award, said Aslam.
Drawing attention to the challenges in the education sector, he highlighted that although the out-of-school children situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was better than in other provinces, 30% of children in the province were still out of school — a concerning reality. In light of this, the government is declaring an ""education emergency"" to ensure that every child has access to education, the K-P CM advisor said.

ICC ready to back WTC four-day Tests,"US
Shorter matches to be sanctioned for 2027-29 cycle
The International Cricket Council is ready to sanction four-day Tests in the World Test Championship to help smaller nations to play more games and longer series.
In the next WTC cycle, which begins with Sri Lanka hosting Bangladesh in a two-Test series on Tuesday, only five-day Tests are permitted by the ICC which has led to an emphasis on truncated series. Of the 27 Test series to be played among the nine countries contesting the 2025-27 WTC, 17 will feature just two matches, there will be six three-match series and England, Australia and India will all play one five-match Test series against each other.
During discussions last week at the WTC final at Lord's, the ICC chair, Jay Shah, is understood to have expressed his support for four-day Tests, with a view to sanctioning them in time for the 2027-29 WTC cycle. England, Australia and India would still be permitted to schedule five-Test series of five-day matches for the Ashes, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the newly named Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, the first iteration of which begins with the first Test between England and India at Headingley on Friday.
The ICC first sanctioned four-day Tests for bilateral contests in 2017, with England playing Zimbabwe over four days at Trent Bridge last month after four-day Tests against Ireland in 2019 and 2023, although introducing them for the WTC would be a significant change and could lead to longer series.
Many smaller nations are reluctant to host Tests due to the time they take out of the schedule and the cost, but a move to four-day cricket would enable an entire three-Test series to be played in less than three weeks. In four-day Tests the playing hours are extended to mandate a minimum of 98 overs per day rather than 90 overs to mitigate the time lost.
South Africa's threadbare itinerary despite being crowned world champions in the thrilling final against Australia at Lord's last week has further highlighted the issue, and focused minds on the need for change.
Temba Bavuma's squad travel to India for a two-Test series in November but will not play a Test at home until October 2026.

Balochistan saves Rs16b via austerity measures,"US
Minister Noserwani also praised the parliamentary decorum maintained in the Balochistan Assembly
Balochistan Minister for Finance and Minerals Mir Shoaib Nosherwani said the provincial government has saved Rs16 billion by reducing non-essential expenditures, including refraining from the purchase of new vehicles under its austerity policy.
He made these remarks while speaking to the media following the presentation of the provincial budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 in the Balochistan Assembly.
He said the government is committed to adopting austerity measures by reducing non-developmental expenditures.
He said in a move to address the longstanding concerns of government employees, the chief minister has formed a special committee led by Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar. The committee will review employee-related matters and formulate comprehensive recommendations.
He said, ""The committee will begin its work soon and offer practical solutions to the challenges faced by public sector employees.""
Minister Noserwani also praised the parliamentary decorum maintained in the Balochistan Assembly, highlighting the constructive role of both government and opposition members.
""Balochistan Assembly has a proud tradition of respectful debate, and all members uphold the dignity of this house,"" he noted. In education, the minister announced several key developments including reopening of 3,200 closed schools across the province, addressing a major gap in basic education infrastructure. APP

Officials told to explain Nankana encroachments,"IN
Notices issued by ETPB secretary
The Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) has issued show-cause notices to three officers over their alleged failure to prevent encroachments and unauthorised construction on trust properties in Nankana Sahib.
The action came over findings presented in a report prepared following a visit to Nankana Sahib by the ETPB secretary under directives of a commission established on the orders of the Supreme Court.
The report highlighted widespread encroachments and unauthorised structures on ETPB properties found over the past six months with photographic evidence.
The officers served notices are Deputy Administrators Adnan Ahmad Hassan and Ejaz Ahmad, and Security Supervisor Arsalan Naeem.
According to the report, the officials had failed to fulfill their core administrative responsibilities of safeguarding trust properties from encroachment and illegal occupation. It noted that the officers had neither identified the encroachments in time nor taken effective action to prevent or remove them.
After reviewing the report, the ETPB chairman concluded that disciplinary action could be taken under the Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, 2020. The possible punishments include dismissal from service.
The officers have been directed to submit a written explanation within 10 days, justifying why disciplinary action should not be taken against them. They have also been given the option to appear in person to present their defence.
Failure to respond within the stipulated time may result in ex parte proceedings.
The show-cause notices were issued by ETPB Secretary Fareed Iqbal with the approval of the chairman.

Reko Diq to be linked to rail network by 2028,"US
Committee formed to review financing requirements
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday set a deadline of 2028 for the expansion of the Pakistan Railways network to strategic Reko Diq and directed for the formation of a ministerial committee to present recommendations about financing requirements in this regard.
Shehbaz chaired a meeting on railways upgradation and linking Reko Diq with the rail network. He directed the authorities concerned to link Reko Diq with the railways network by 2028 to meet the requirements of the future transportation and cargo services.
The prime minister also directed for forming an inter-ministerial committee to look after the financing matters for the upgradation and development of Pakistan Railways and to present recommendations with regard to financing required for the network's extension to Reko Diq.
During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the upgradation of the Main Line (ML)-1 and ML-3 and the overall development of the Pakistan Railways. The prime minister noted that the Pakistan Railways served as a backbone for the country's economy and communication.
""The Pakistan Railways is a cheap, fast and environment-friendly source of transportation,"" Shehbaz said, adding that linking Reko Diq with railways would boost the mines and mineral sector of Balochistan and create new employment opportunities for the people of the area.
The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Cheema, Maritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, Minister of State for Railways Bilal Kayani, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi and others.

Excise misses tax target by 52 per cent,"SA
Motor Branch of dept successfully met its targets in categories of new vehicle, motorcycle registrations, transfer fee
The Excise, Taxation, and Narcotics Control Department has failed to meet its property tax and professional tax collection targets for the fiscal year 2024-25 across the Rawalpindi Region as the department has only achieved 48% of its target, falling short by a significant 52%.
In contrast, the Motor Branch of the department successfully met its targets in the categories of new vehicle and motorcycle registrations, transfer fees, and token taxes, achieving a remarkable 150% of its revenue target in those areas. Total revenue collection for the Rawalpindi region stood at Rs680 million.
Due to the department's complete failure in collecting domestic and commercial property taxes, professional taxes, and luxury taxes, the Director General of Excise has ordered the cancellation of weekly Sunday holidays. Starting this Sunday and continuing until the beginning of the new fiscal year, Excise offices will remain open on Sundays to boost revenue recovery.
In a controversial move to increase tax collection, the department has started issuing revised property tax bills by changing the names on previously taxed residential units.
One such case involves Advocate Najma Malik, who reported that despite paying Rs150,000 in property tax under her name, a new notice of Rs157,000 was issued under her husband's name, based on signage outside the house. She has challenged the new notice with the previous tax receipt.
As part of its ongoing crackdown on defaulters, the department has sealed 241 property units and recovered Rs3.1m in overdue taxes.
Excise Inspectors have been directed to leave their offices and collect taxes directly in the field.
However, with only 12 days remaining before the end of the fiscal year, achieving the collection targets for property tax, luxury tax, and professional tax seems increasingly unlikely, leaving the department far from meeting its financial goals.

People don't want women in showbiz: Nausheen Shah,"PK
Actor shared her thoughts on overcoming cultural prejudices
It may be 2025, but that has not stopped a large majority of the Pakistani population from frowning upon the women in their family taking up a career in showbiz – or at least, that is how established actor Nausheen Shah feels about this thorny subject.
""People are still worried about being associated with women who are in showbiz,"" remarked the Jaane Jahan actor during a recent appearance on a local talk show. ""Or rather, they are not worried about just knowing them; they are worried about being related to them. Let me be clear on that!""
Nausheen remains convinced that despite a thriving showbiz industry that churns out dramas like clockwork, societal norms still dictate that it is unacceptable for a woman's image to be so readily available for public consumption, making it difficult for an aspiring female actor to break into the field.
""The reason behind it is people's behaviour and our mindset,"" continued the actor. ""The nature of our job is to be in the public eye. To be in the public eye so much – especially for women – is something that people just don't accept.""
Elaborating on a widespread desire to preserve a woman's modesty and shield her from the public gaze, Nausheen added, ""[People] don't want the daughter or the daughter-in-law of the family coming on TV with 200,000 people watching her. Lots of people think this way. Your own families can sometimes disown you. Your chachas and tayas can end up saying, 'What is this? Why are you doing this?'""
Opening up about how not even she was spared her family's censure before embarking on a career in acting, Nausheen revealed, ""For instance, when I started acting, my mother was absolutely against it. She was absolutely devastated. This happens everywhere, and this is normal.""
One reason Nausheen, whose career transitioned from modelling to acting, was able to progress in her career and overcome such biases, is her stance on boundaries and how to stick by them. ""It is extremely important,"" declared the Mera Pehla Pyar actor. ""If you don't know this, then how will you survive? You need to make sure that people understand. If someone is not listening to you, you need to do something about it!""
Despite the overarching prejudice against women taking up a career in the media and balancing motherhood in the mix, Nausheen remains convinced that both men and women have their own battles to fight in any career path, without one having it any harder than the other.
""A woman is naturally more inclined to care for her children, and a father's way of showing love is different,"" mused the actor. ""But I think that in today's day and age, both men and women have their own struggles equally.""

Israel kills over 50 Gazans near aid site,"US
Internet, fixed-line communication services down
Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli forces on Tuesday killed more than 50 Palestinians near an aid centre in the territory's south, the latest such incident amid severe shortages after more than 20 months of war.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that at least 53 people were killed and some 200 wounded as thousands of Palestinians gathered to receive flour at a World Central Kitchen (WCK) centre in the southern city of Khan Yunis.
""Israeli drones fired at the citizens. Some minutes later, Israeli tanks fired several shells at the citizens, which led to a large number of martyrs and wounded,"" he said.
In Rafah, also in southern Gaza, the civil defence said four people were killed by Israeli fire, and two others by Israeli shelling near a hopstial in Gaza City in the north.
GHF said in a statement that its teams had distributed two million meals on Tuesday ""without incident"", and nearly 28 million since it started operating.
At Gaza City's Al-Ahli hospital, one of the last remaining functioning health facilities in the territory's badly hit north, Amer Abu Safiya told AFP there was little doctors could do to treat a wound on his hand.
""Every day we are being bombed... Al-Ahli Hospital has been destroyed. Medical services are halted. As you can see, there's nothing to wrap around my hand, and there's no medication"", he said, holding up his swollen hand while laying down on a makeshift bed in the hospital's backyard.
OCHA said its humanitarian partners in Gaza ""continue to warn of the risk of famine in Gaza, amid catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity"".
The Palestinian Authority said internet and fixed-line communication services were down in central and south Gaza on Tuesday, following an attack on the territory's main fibre optic cable it blamed on Israel.
It's the third time in less than a week that internet was partly or fully down in Gaza due to damage on telecoms infrastructure.

'Water scarcity eroding agricultural capacity',"US
CM announces funds for geotagging affected areas
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has called for immediate and sustained efforts to protect land and natural resources for future generations.
In her message on the World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, the CM warned that the unchecked effects of climate change, deforestation and growing water scarcity are rapidly eroding agricultural capacity and degrading soil fertility across Punjab. ""Drought is not just a layer of sand, it is the signal of a looming environmental crisis,"" she said.
Underscoring her government's commitment to environmental protection, the CM announced that the Punjab government has allocated special funds in the 2025-26 budget for geotagging water-stressed areas.
She said new filtration plants will be installed and existing ones repaired to ensure access to clean water across the province.
CM Maryam Nawaz highlighted Punjab's leadership in climate action, noting the introduction of Pakistan's first comprehensive Climate Policy aimed at addressing the challenges posed by environmental degradation.
She also reaffirmed the government's resolve to expand the Plant for Pakistan campaign, which is focused on greening barren lands. ""Every tree is a symbol of life in drought-hit regions. We will not let the earth suffocate, changing our habits is the only way to change the environment,"" she added.

Empty seats as Chelsea win CWC opener,"US
They defeated Los Angeles FC 2-0 in a largely empty stadium
Chelsea began their Club World Cup campaign with a 2-0 victory against Los Angeles FC in a largely empty stadium on Monday as Brazilian giants Flamengo also got off to a winning start and a Benfica comeback denied Boca Juniors in a stormy encounter.
As the inaugural 32-team tournament gradually kicks into gear in the United States, Chelsea followed fellow European heavyweights Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich by claiming three points in their first group outing.
Yet while UEFA Champions League winners PSG were ominous against Atletico Madrid on Sunday, and Bayern put 10 past Auckland City, the Premier League team were more solid than spectacular against LAFC in Atlanta.
Pedro Neto and Enzo Fernandez got the goals for Enzo Maresca's side in the Group D match before nearly 50,000 empty seats at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium — not a great look for the tournament organisers.
New signing Liam Delap made his debut as a substitute and helped set up Fernandez's strike, with Chelsea hoping to reestablish themselves among the elite after their recent UEFA Conference League triumph and Champions League qualification.
Maresca said it was a ""very good result"" and was happy with Delap's display following his recent arrival from Ipswich Town.
""The good thing about Liam is he knows the way we want to play, so the process is quite quick,"" said the Italian.
""The environment was a bit strange, the stadium was almost empty, not full,"" added Maresca when asked about the crowd, as just over 22,000 attended the 71,000-capacity venue for a game played at 3:00 pm local time on a Monday.
LAFC were late qualifiers for the tournament, beating Club America in a play-off last month to replace banned Mexican side Club Leon.
Chelsea went ahead just after the half-hour mark when Nicolas Jackson released Neto and the Portuguese winger turned inside LA defender Ryan Hollingshead before beating goalkeeper Hugo Lloris with a powerful strike.
Former Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud came on at half time for the Americans and Steve Cherundolo's team improved in the second half.
However, Delap entered the fray for Chelsea and made the killer second goal, crossing for the arriving Fernandez to control and finish.
Dominant Flamengo
Chelsea's next game will be against Flamengo, who began their campaign by easing to a 2-0 win against Esperance of Tunisia in Philadelphia. Uruguayan international Giorgian de Arrascaeta gave the Brazilian giants a 17th-minute lead from an assist by Luiz Araujo, who made it 2-0 with 20 minutes remaining.
It was a dominant display from Flamengo, who fielded a strong side featuring several Brazil internationals and gave a debut to Italy midfielder Jorginho following his arrival from Arsenal.
Jorginho will face former club Chelsea when the teams meet in their second match on Friday. Flamengo coach Filipe Luis is also an ex-player at Stamford Bridge.
There were vast sections of empty seats at Lincoln Financial Field too, with just 25,797 fans in a stadium that can hold close to 70,000.
Stormy
In contrast, there was close to a full house, and a raucous atmosphere, in Miami as Boca and Benfica played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Group C.
The majority of the crowd was backing Boca and the Argentines roared into a two-goal lead, Miguel Merentiel and Rodrigo Battaglia both scoring in the first half.
Two-time European champions Benfica were given a lifeline in first-half stoppage time when Boca's Carlos Palacios mistimed a challenge on Nicolas Otamendi and after a VAR review — which included a red card for protesting from the already substituted Boca midfield Ander Herrera — a penalty was awarded.
Veteran Angel di Maria converted from the spot to make it 2-1, but Benfica then had Andrea Belotti sent off in the 71st minute after a wild, high-footed kick into the head of Ayrton Costa.
But with six minutes remaining the Portuguese side equalised as Otamendi headed in to make it 2-2.
A disappointing result for Boca was compounded by a late red card for Nicolas Figal, who was dismissed for an ugly challenge on Florentino Luis.
""We're left with a bitter taste because we thought we could have won it,"" said Boca's Battaglia.

Key projects put on ice for another year,"US
Despite plans to launch 10 major initiatives, none have started due to persistent delays
After a year-long campaign filled with lofty promises and bold slogans about launching ten state-of-the-art mega projects to address the city's core problems and essential needs, these much-publicised initiatives have now been postponed. Initially planned for the current fiscal year 2024-25 — already strained by a deepening economic crisis — the projects have been unceremoniously deferred to the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26.
Over the past 12 months, the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), the District Council, District Administration, and Municipal Corporation have all failed entirely to initiate a single one of these projects.
The projects have been pending for 17 years, and continuous delays have caused their estimated costs to surge by 100 to 300%, with a further 25% increase expected after budget approvals.
Among these mega projects are the Lai Expressway, sewerage water tunnel and treatment plant, Ghazi Brotha water project, new large-diameter steel pipeline from Rawal Dam for additional water supply, Mother and Child Hospital, Ring Road, three large commercial parking plazas, underpasses from Mareer Chowk to Liaqat Bagh Chowk, Doodhcha Dam, and Chehan Dam water supply scheme. All these projects were initially prepared between 2008 and 2012 but were sidelined due to frequent changes in political governments.
The 22-kilometer Lai Expressway was launched in 2008, with its foundation stone laid by then-President General Pervez Musharraf. However, despite 17 years having passed, it remains incomplete. Its initial estimated cost of 1.7 billion rupees has now escalated to 11 billion rupees.
The Mother and Child Hospital is a 12-year-old project. Although the state-of-the-art building housing 13 operation theaters was completed, the project has been shut down for the last three years. Originally costing Rs900 million, the building was completed with an OPD inauguration planned for April 30, 2022.
However, the government was dissolved on April 10, and the project stalled. Since then, windows, cabinets, doors, iron grills, and machinery have been stolen, and the expansive building has become a shelter for bats, dogs, cats, and snakes. While an additional Rs25m was allocated, work stoppage has caused losses to soar to approximately Rs150m.
The sewerage water tunnel and treatment plant, originally estimated at Rs3b and now costing over Rs6b, has been stalled for four years. Similarly, the Chehan Dam water supply scheme has been repeatedly promised throughout the year, but as the fiscal year ended, it too was pushed into the new budget. Its cost has risen from Rs600m to 650m.
The Rawal Dam new pipeline and commercial parking plaza projects have proved to be mere publicity stunts. The Ghazi Brotha water project, crucial to meeting the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad's water needs for 100 years, was also neglected again this year. Without Ghazi Brotha, the water crisis of the twin cities cannot be resolved. The project cost has inflated from Rs8.7b to Rs20b over 10 years.
The Doodhcha Dam and Ring Road projects have become deadlocked due to extreme delays. Their completion deadlines have expired repeatedly, and now they too have been pushed into the new fiscal year.
Because of the severe financial crisis, the District Municipal Corporation failed to launch any significant development scheme during the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25.
However, District Development Committee convener and MNA Engineer Qamar-ul-Islam claims that record-breaking roads have been constructed this year, and with a record development budget in the new fiscal year, all mega projects will finally be initiated.

Spending on water projects to fall short of target,"US
Govt utilised Rs79.4b by end of May vs FY25 allocation of Rs142.6b
The government is expected to widely miss the target for fund utilisation on water sector projects in the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25.
An amount of Rs142.6 billion had been allocated for water projects under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for FY25. The estimated expenditure by the end of May was Rs79.4 billion, revealed the Annual Plan 2025-26 while reviewing the performance in FY25.
In view of the strategic importance of the water sector, the FY25 development programme comprised 59 projects with total approved cost of Rs2,298.3 billion. Despite various challenges in the way of implementation, efforts were made to accelerate the water sector programme.
By the end of June 2025, out of the 59 projects, 23 schemes worth Rs163.5 billion are expected to be completed or closed. These include 10 projects in Balochistan, six in Sindh (canals, small dams and drainage), four in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), two in Punjab and one scheme of the Ministry of Water Resources.
Work is progressing on Mohmand Dam, having power generation capacity of 800 megawatts, water storage capacity of 0.676 million acre feet (MAF) and 18,233 acres of command area, and on Diamer Bhasha Dam (4,500 MW of electricity and 6.4 MAF of water storage).
The Annual Plan FY26 is aligned with the National Water Policy (2018), Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Uraan Pakistan, where the government is targeting several megaprojects for enhancing the country's water storage capacity.
Out of the total allocation of Rs133.424 billion for the Water Resources Division, the share of water sector development programme is Rs101.979 billion. Of this amount, Rs79.6 billion has been earmarked for the construction of large, medium and small dams including Rs68.5 billion for two megaprojects – Diamer Bhasha and Mohmand Dams.
Apart from that, work on Nai Gaj Dam costing Rs47 billion will be expedited with the allocation of Rs500 million. The project is aimed at developing the command area of about 28,800 acres in Dadu district of Sindh. Similarly, Rs300 million has been allocated to Naulong Multipurpose Dam for the development of 47,000 acres of command area in Jhal Magsi district of Balochistan.
To irrigate 286,100 acres of land in K-P, the Chashma Right Bank Canal (Lift-cum-Gravity Canal) project is being initiated with an allocation of Rs100 million for FY26. Total cost of the project is Rs189.606 billion.
To meet water demand in the metropolitan city of Karachi, the K-IV project will be given priority for timely completion. It has been given Rs3.209 billion for FY26.
To ensure the availability of water to Karachi through the Greater Bulk Water Supply (K-IV) project, the implementation of a scheme titled ""Water Requirement for K-IV Project – Improvement of Kalri Baghar Feeder and Keenjhar Lake – Plain Cement Concrete Lining of Kalri Baghar Feeder Upper Phase-I"" costing Rs39.943 billion (with 50% PSDP share of Rs19.971 billion) will be expedited. For this, Rs10 billion has been set aside.
An amount of Rs1.875 billion has been allocated for remodeling the pat feeder canal system in Balochistan district of Naseerabad. The Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) had approved the project on July 27, 2023 at a cost of Rs61.793 billion. The project is envisaged to provide due share of the province under the Water Apportionment Accord 1991.
The Kachhi Canal Project (remaining works), Dera Bugti district, Balochistan is nearing completion, after which the irrigated command area will be increased from 72,000 acres to 102,000 acres. An amount of Rs100 million has been allocated for the project.
The Kachhi Canal – Restoration of Flood Damages 2022 Project is aimed at restoring irrigation water supply to Dera Bugti, which had been affected due to the damage caused by 2022 floods. In FY26, Rs698.1 million has been allocated for the project.

"Medvedev, Tsitsipas advance in Halle","US
The Russian seed eased past home hope Daniel Altmaier 6-3 6-3
Russian third seed Daniil Medvedev eased past home hope Daniel Altmaier 6-3 6-3 at Germany's Halle Open on Monday, looking to find form in his Wimbledon tune-up after early round losses at the Australian Open and French Open.
Bouncing back after a quarter-final exit in Den Bosch last week, the former US Open winner and 2022 Halle finalist needed just an hour to beat the German, converting three of six break point opportunities and saving both break points he faced.
Altmaier saved two match points on Medvedev's serve but was ultimately beaten on the third, as the twice Wimbledon semi-finalist closed out his opening Halle match and inched closer in his chase for a first grass-court title since Mallorca in 2021.
Stefanos Tsitsipas, unseeded at an event for the first time since 2018 ATP Masters 1000 in Cincinnati, edged past Italy's Luciano Darderi 6-4 3-6 7-6(5) in a gruelling first-round battle.
Tsitsipas broke for a 3-2 lead in the first set and held off a late charge from Darderi to take it 6-4. The Italian hit back in style, breaking early for 3-0 and racing to a 6-3 second set to force a decider.
The final set was tight throughout, with Darderi earning five break points but unable to convert. Tsitsipas kept his composure and clinched the match in a tense tiebreak, needing four match points to seal victory.
It was his first event with coach Goran Ivanisevic, who joined his team after a second-round exit at Roland Garros. Tsitsipas, a former world number three, is now ranked 25th, his lowest position since 2018.
The Greek is looking to resurrect his career and Wimbledon holds particular importance for the 26-year-old, with the fourth round his best showing so far.
Alexander Bublik, Halle 2023 winner, dispatched France's Alexandre Muller 6-4 6-4. The Kazakh broke late in the first set and struck early in the second, dominating on serve to wrap up the match in exactly one hour.
Bublik, who reached the French Open quarter-finals two weeks ago before losing to eventual runner-up Jannik Sinner of Italy, will next face either Halle defending champion Sinner or Germany's Yannick Hanfmann, who play on Tuesday.
Last year's runner-up Hubert Hurkacz of Poland withdrew from the event due to injury, with Dutchman Jesper de Jong taking his place in the main draw.
Alcaraz in disbelief
Carlos Alcaraz says he still looks back on his extraordinary French Open triumph over world number one Jannik Sinner with a sense of disbelief, as the Spaniard prepares to shift focus to his bid for a hat-trick of Wimbledon titles.
The 22-year-old fought back from two sets down and saved three successive match points in an unlikely 4-6 6-7(4) 6-4 7-6(3) 7-6(10-2) victory against the Italian in a match that mesmerised the Paris crowd.
""(There are) a lot of videos from that match, from that moment, match point down and I still watch it sometimes, and I still don't believe that I come back from that moment,"" Alcaraz told reporters.
""So sometimes it's difficult to realise that I'm in this position, that I won the French Open, watching the videos from 40-love, in that moment. So I'm still watching those videos.""
The five-times Grand Slam champion recharged his batteries with a short trip to Ibiza but is back in harness ahead of his campaign at Queen's Club, where he faces countryman Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in his opener on Tuesday. Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam of the season, runs from June 30 to July 13.

EWEC: linking South Asia with central and west Asia,"US
Study is seminal contribution to academic literature on regional connectivity, economic partnership
A recently published RAND corporation study in partnership with Islamabad based think-tank makes a strong case for linking South Asia with Central and West Asia through a network of energy, infrastructure and digital corridors.
The study titled, ""Examining the Feasibility of an East West Economic Corridor (EWEC) for South and Central Asia"", is based upon primary sources and interviews of experts from main stakeholder nations in EWEC.
The senior policy practitioners, politicians, business tycoons, academics and infrastructure experts participated in the study, making it one of the seminal contributions to the academic literature on regional connectivity and economic partnership.
Most important aspect of the feasibility study was the complete consensus amongst the Indian and Pakistani respondents about the value of trade and economic connectivity as a vehicle for sustainable peace in the region. The linkage of EWEC with CPEC and other regional and international connectivity initiatives like International North South Transport Corridors (INNSTC) and BRI was also acknowledged as a win-win formulation that should link all these economic corridors in a mutually beneficial equation.
The study also analysed past examples of success and failure of economic corridors between countries as well as continents. An interesting fact that emerged from the analysis of past corridors was the need for generating economic activity in the countries being served with these corridors, in the absence of which, a simple transport corridor might not generate any economic activity other than resources extraction, much like what happened in the African countries through the rail and road corridors that resulted in resource curse for the whole African continent.
The study cautioned against the unviable connectivity, pointing out that the true economic value of a corridor was a function of its high Social Internal Rate of Return Index (SIRR).
In Pakistan the average SIRR of such corridors was 52% whereas the same was 74% in India. The economic corridor becomes socially viable when the cost of capital for developing a corridor is lower than the SIRR. The past successful examples of such corridors include Trans-European Transport Network which was operationalised in 1996 in EU, and comprised nine networked corridors.
In Asia Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program (GMSECP) began in 1992 as a trade facilitation corridor. Established in 1992, GMSECP focused on trade facilitation for first 15 years before construction of infrastructure in 2008. The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Program (CAREC), established in 2001, also initially focused on trade facilitation before developing into a road and railway connectivity corridor after 20 years.
The cases of some unsuccessful regional corridors include Turkmenistan Afghanistan Pakistan India (TAPI), Turkmenistan Afghanistan Pakistan (TAP), Iran Pakistan India (IPI) and the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC 1997, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka).
According to scholars like Kapell ((Kapell, p.275) quoted in the study, the lack of success of regional corridors like IPI, TAPI and BIMSTEC was a result of Indian failure in three areas. This included failure to increase regional trade; failure to benefit the region through its supply chains; and inability to balance its development needs with the geopolitical preferences of global powers like USA. India's troublesome relations with Pakistan were also identified as a major contributor towards the failure of past regional connectivity initiatives.
The study, however, identified certain current developments that might facilitate EWEC in future. These include a growing Indian economy in search of markets; an improved regional connectivity amongst Central Asian States and a desire to link up with South Asia; an Afghan Interim Government in search of economic opportunities through transit fees of corridor; and a realisation in Pakistan to leverage its locational advantage to earn geo-economic dividends. Mindful of the inhibitors like Indo-Pak tensions, competing geopolitical interests of global powers, access to capital issues and unstable Afghanistan, the study recommends an incremental approach for realising the EWEC vision.
According to that approach the EWEC development should be sequenced in a manner that trust is built first through regional organisations like East West Economic Corridor Association (EWECA), where a research and advocacy group, representing each member country of EWECA i.e. Afghanistan, India, Iran and CARs, would be created to conduct research on several aspects of the proposed corridor to forge consensus through technical, financial and advocacy studies. Second mandate of the EWECA would be to manage geopolitical tensions both within and outside the region, somewhat like the ASEAN model. The third mandate would be promotion of connectivity projects through project management and financing access help.
To make EWECA friction free and effective, the governance structure of the organisation should be equitable and participative, with each member having a vote for decision making through consensus. One of the important conclusions of the study was the consensus amongst Indian and Pakistani respondents about the financing institutions that included Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) amongst others like ADB and World Bank. The importance of an entente cordiale amongst China and the US was highlighted as a desired concomitant of the regional corridors.
The network of proposed corridors includes TAPI, IPI, Trans Afghan Railways (Extending till CARs like Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajkistan, Kyrghzstan) and intra-CAR corridors like Tengez-Galkynysh linking with this network. This network would include road & railway lines, gas pipelines, telecommunications & digital highways, and trade facilitation infrastructure along the network of roads & railways.
The network of corridors would enable trade, commerce and energy supply between South Asia and Central Asia with the potential to link up with the European and West Asian markets. The Central Asian states would also be big beneficiaries linking up with warm water ports of Arabian Sea.
Corridors like CAREC, TAPI, INSTC and IPI would also get a new lease of life through EWEC besides linking BRI and CPEC in a mutually beneficial equation. The EWEC is proposed to be implemented in phases starting with small standalone projects with the trust building and assuagement of the geopolitical tensions as the precursors of the concept.

Ex-senator surrenders in murder case,"PK
Defence counsel stated that their client had voluntarily withdrawn the bail request
Senior PML-N leader and former senator Chaudhry Tanveer Ahmed Khan surrendered before the Rawalpindi Bench of the Lahore High Court in connection with the murder case of former provincial parliamentary secretary Chaudhry Adnan.
Appearing before Justice Sadaqat Ali Khan, Tanveer withdrew his pre-arrest bail application, which the court then formally disposed of. Following the withdrawal, Civil Lines Police took Chaudhry Tanveer into custody and involved him to the investigation.
Defence counsel stated that their client had voluntarily withdrawn the bail request to ensure transparency in the investigation and to fully cooperate with the police.
""Our bail was not rejected — we withdrew it ourselves to facilitate a fair inquiry. We will present all evidence proving our innocence,"" said the lawyer.
Chaudhry Adnan, who was a close relative of Chaudhry Tanveer, was shot dead on February 8, 2024 — three days after the general elections — near Jinnah Park Chowk in the Civil Lines area. His family lodged an FIR accusing Chaudhry Tanveer, his brother Chaudhry Changez (a member of the Cantonment Board), and his son Barrister Daniyal (a sitting MNA).

Hostel warden accused of threatening students,"IN
Students demand inquiry into hostel admin's role, protection for whistle-blowers
Protesters from Aurat March Islamabad have accused the warden of the International Islamic University (IIUI) hostel of threatening students who raised their voices against the brutal and unjust murder of 22-year-old Emaan Afroz, which occurred two months ago.
The protesters were outraged over the delay in arresting the accused, despite the availability of key evidence.
On Monday, Aurat March activists staged a demonstration outside the National Press Club, condemning the federal police for months of alleged negligence in investigating the case. Protesters claimed that CCTV footage identifying the accused was shared with Islamabad police soon after the incident, but no meaningful action was taken. ""We were repeatedly told the police were close to arresting him, yet nothing happened,"" said a representative of the protest.
Later in the day, following the pressure from the protest, Islamabad police announced the arrest of the accused, identified as Feroz, a resident of Jhang district, who had been absconding since the incident.
Addressing a press conference at the Rescue 15 headquarters, DIG Operations Muhammad Jawad Tariq confirmed the arrest. He revealed that the accused had unlawfully entered the girl's hostel, ""Kainaat Girls Hostel,"" with the intent to commit a crime and opened fire, resulting in Emaan's death.
The DIG further stated that Feroz is a repeat offender with prior records in rape and motorcycle theft cases. The arrest came after multiple police teams, led by SSP Operations and SSP Investigations, used a combination of human intelligence and technology, including Safe City surveillance footage and the accused's sketches, to trace and apprehend the accused.
""Islamabad police successfully solved this blind murder case. The accused will be presented in court with solid evidence to ensure he receives the punishment he deserves,"" the DIG said, adding that the investigation is still ongoing.

JI slams govt's 'false narrative of progress',"US
.
Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has blasted the federal and provincial governments, claiming that 44 per cent of the population was living below the poverty line while the ruling elite continued to project an illusion of good governance through expensive media campaigns.
Addressing a press conference on Tuesday at the party headquarters in Mansoora, the JI chief denounced the recently announced national budget as ""anti-people"" as it burdened citizens with excessive taxes while offering little relief. He accused the government of using global oil prices as an excuse to increase fuel rates, arguing that a 40 per cent reduction in petrol prices could be achieved if the petroleum levy were abolished.
""The government's wasteful spending and luxurious lifestyles must end if we want to put the country on the path of real development,"" he said.
Naeem also slammed the meagre allocation of funds in the education sector, pointing out that despite budgetary claims, the privatisation of public schools indicated a lack of genuine investment in education. He further lambasted the political leadership across provinces, saying, ""The uncle rules at the centre, the niece in Punjab and their allies in Sindh, all engaged in a scripted political wrestling match"".

'Supreme Court judges not passive interpreters of text',"US
Justice Shah says judges must not fall prey to the lure of small, short-term benefits
Judges of the Supreme Court are not passive interpreters of text, rather they are the custodians of liberty, equality, and institutional independence.
""[The Supreme Court] is the ultimate guardian of fundamental rights and the final sentinel against executive or legislative overreach,"" said a 15-page judgement authored by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and endorsed by Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi, who is also a member of the constitutional bench.
According to the verdict, SC judges are to act with integrity and courage, to resist all encroachments, external or internal, that threaten to erode the autonomy of the judiciary or subvert the rule of law.
""The judges must not fall prey to the lure of small, short-term benefits, whether of elevation, power, or personal comfort that may accrue if they speak the language of authority rather than that of the Constitution. Such benefits are illusory and transient.
'The true reward of a judge lies in preserving the dignity of the institution and the trust of the people. It is also the solemn duty of judges of this Court to call out, with moral clarity and institutional courage, those among their ranks who surrender to the power of the day at the cost of constitutional principles.
""Critique from within, when rooted in fidelity to the Constitution, is not disloyalty, it is the highest form of service to the judicial institution,"" the verdict added.
The division bench led by Justice Shah dismissed a petition filed by the Federal Public Service Commission which rejected the fresh appointment of a female civil servant on the post of assistant professor (Obstetrics & Gynaecology) just because she changed her domicile after marriage.
Highlighting the ""real role"" of the Supreme Court and its judges in the last two pages of decision, Justice Shah noted that history is a vigilant witness which does not remember those who accommodate power, but those who stand resolute in defense of principle.
""The jurisprudential legacy of a judge is not built on appeasement but on principled defiance when the soul of justice is imperiled. Courts must never become tools of expediency. Rather, they must be lighthouses of constitutional morality and guardians of democratic integrity,"" he said.
Justice Shah stated that history will not absolve judges who abandon their constitutional duty; it will remember them not as dispensers of justice, but as collaborators in injustice.
He noted that the Supreme Court is not merely a forum for resolving disputes; it is the constitutional conscience of the nation, tasked with producing progressive and principled jurisprudence that breathes life into the Constitution and bridges the distance between law and the lived realities of the people.
""The court must remain alive to the evolving aspirations of society and innovate new remedies to advance justice,"" says the judgement.
The case
The court held that a married woman retains the legal discretion, choice or agency to either adopt her husband's domicile or retain her own. In the present case, the respondent, by her own volition, opted to adopt her husband's domicile, which is legally permissible.
""It is also important to note that permitting the change of domicile may affect the mechanism of transfer and seniority as well.
""Disregarding seniority undermines bureaucratic impartiality, violates constitutional guarantees of due process and equality (Article 4 and 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 and breeds cynicism within the service. The erosion of seniority norms weakens administrative stability.
""Allowing post-induction changes in domicile would not only undermine the quota system but also open avenues for manipulation, enabling individuals to shift provincial affiliation for personal advantage, thereby diluting the constitutional promise of provincial parity.
""The freezing of domicile thus serves the larger constitutional purpose of federal harmony and administrative fairness within the civil service structure of Pakistan,"" it said.
The court noted that additional attorney general's contention that permitting the respondent's change of domicile would destabilize the civil service structure would have been correct if the respondent remained in the same service structure. However, the ""direct recruitment"" of in-service candidates involves new pay scales, distinct terms, and a separate seniority list.

Vehari locality submerged in sewage for six months,"US
Drainage repair work abandoned midway
Residents of W-Block, a densely populated area of Peoples Colony in Vehari, have been living in unsanitary and hazardous conditions for the past six months due to overflowing sewage and a completely broken drainage system.
The prolonged crisis has pushed the local population into physical, mental, and social distress, with no substantial relief in sight from the authorities.
The alleged negligence and apathy of the Municipal Committee Vehari have turned the area into a hzardous zone, while government claims of development remain confined to paperwork.
Locals reported that when repair work finally began, the contractor abandoned the project midway, leaving behind dangerous open trenches in which several children have suffered injuries.
Residents stated that they have been forced to live amid unbearable stench, mud, and disease-ridden surroundings for half a year.
Repeated complaints, including both written and verbal to the municipal committee have fallen on deaf ears. Temporary, half-hearted responses have either been influenced by favoritism or led nowhere.
Elderly residents heading to mosques are forced to wade through filthy water. The affected community says their demand is simple: a clean and livable environment. But what they're facing instead is a threat to public health, children's safety, and the dignity of senior citizens.
The situation has impacted all aspects of daily life, disrupting educational activities, social interaction, children's outdoor playtime, elderly walks, and even women's mobility to the market.
The victims have appealed to higher authorities to immediately take notice and ensure the drainage system is repaired, the streets reconstructed, and the community rescued from the looming health hazards.

Unfortunate rather than acting as honest broker, Trump believes in showcasing bias for Israel, against Iran
President Donald Trump, perhaps, has a lopsided plan in the name of peace for the Middle East. It is quite unfortunate that rather than acting as honest broker, credible to his stature of a superpower's leader, Trump believes in showcasing bias for Israel and contempt for Iran, as he warned the Islamic Republic of dire consequences in days to come.
This is brinkmanship and will certainly not lead to a perpetual peace as the US president wants it to be as he called for ""real end"" to the conflict and not ""just a ceasefire"".
The point is any baby step towards de-escalation shall begin with pacifying both the sides to return from the brink and not with a carrot and stick approach in extreme coercion.
Thus, Trump's initiative to send in either his Vice-President, JD Vance, or the Mideast envoy, Steve Witkoff, to Iran is mired in confusion, and necessitates some plain-talking.
The G7 summit, nonetheless, could not carry the momentum as the members appeared non-committal to an instant de-escalation. The stance from Canada that Israel has ""right to defense"" without mentioning the ""aggression"" that was unleashed on Iran by the Jewish state has led to some crippled diplomacy. Moreover, the G7's conviction that Iran ""can never have a nuclear weapon"" was out of context at a time when an existential crisis is at hand, and Tehran has officially reiterated more than once that it has no plans for a nuclear weapon.
Tehran has rightly condemned the double-talk; and surprisingly, a statement from 20 Muslim nations has come to its rescue, condemning Israel's recent military attacks and a call for de-escalation and swift return to negotiations for a sustainable agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme.
The way forward is an immediate cessation of hostilities, and for that to happen, the onus rests with the United Nations. The world body has once again not led from the front, and the Middle East is slipping into the abyss of an unpredictable crisis. Last but not least, the Israeli threat to 'vanish' Tehran, as panic takes roots in the capital, must be attended to instantly, before it gets too late.

G7 rallies behind Ukraine,"US
.
Group of Seven powers, holding talks on Tuesday at a summit that Donald Trump left early, promised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky fresh support as Russia stepped up attacks on its neighbour.
The US president, who has had a volatile relationship with Zelensky and had been due to meet him, flew out of the summit in the Canadian Rockies late Monday to return to Washington to focus on the Israel-Iran conflict.
Zelensky arrived at the wooded mountain resort of Kananaskis after Russia ravaged Kyiv with one of the worst bombardments since it invaded in February 2022, killing at least 10 people in the capital.
PM Mark Carney, the host of the summit, welcomed Zelensky and announced Can$2 billion ($1.47b) of military support, including drones and helicopters, for Ukraine. ""This underscores the importance of standing in total solidarity with Ukraine,"" Carney told him.

In some tribal areas, baby girls fate is sealed before she can even open her eyes
Many claim daughters are a blessing.
They gush about how much they love their sisters. They insist women deserve respect. But the truth hits the moment — day zero — a girl is born.
No fireworks, no mithai, no praise, no photos, no phone calls — just silence, sometimes laced with regret and disappointment.
And in rural districts like Torghar (K-P) or Kech (Balochistan), she might not even be registered. It's like she didn't arrive at all.
The air turns heavy when it's 'just a girl'.
The in-laws' mood curdles. The same people who cheered your wedding now weigh your worth.
The mother-in-law rattles off how many grandsons her other daughters-in-law have brought into the family. Expect taunts, quiet snubs or worse if you fail to deliver sons.
Boys get new clothes, toys and gold; girls often get hand-me-downs or knockoffs. Aqeeqahs and other traditional feasts for baby girls are often modest or skipped altogether while boys get lavish celebrations.
Boys are called Shahzaib or Zarrar — names echoing honour, legacy and strength — while girls' names are chosen perfunctorily, almost like ticking off a task.
The chromosome that determines a baby's sex comes from the father, not the mother — right? But she bears the consequences of his ignorance, ego and entitlement.
Some men remarry after two or three daughters, convinced a new wife will deliver the prize; some erupt in rage; some walk away; others push their wives time and again until a son arrives. One man I know kept trying until the ninth child. When he finally had a son — born with a disability — the unease behind the congratulations was hard to miss.
Disturbingly, some still opt for illegal sex-selective abortions. Thanks to pressure, most gynecologists now refuse to reveal gender — a tiny and hard-fought victory. But even if a girl survives the womb, what awaits her next?
She tastes it in nutrition. She feels it in healthcare. If there's only enough for one child's food or treatment, the boy gets it; girls get leftovers and their coughs can wait. It's worse in poor households where every rupee must be defended. Even the same parents who lovingly feed and treat their sons think twice about wasting (as they see it) a doctor's visit on a feverish daughter.
Before school even begins, her training starts: not in books, but in chores. She helps her mother sweep, cook and care for siblings. She's taught silence and endurance while the boy beside her is told to lead, speak and aim higher (much like training one to crawl while urging the other to fly). No one sees how it chips away at her mind and confidence.
In some tribal areas, her fate is sealed before she can even open her eyes. Newborn girls are informally engaged to cousins or tribal allies, tiny futures locked in without consent. It's not fate; it's a choice we keep making as a society.
Let's stop pretending these injustices are confined to rural pockets. Urban hypocrisy just wears better clothes. Let's not pretend only the uneducated enable this or that the gender gap in child survival is natural, cultural or economic. We engineer it by preference and prejudice.
Change doesn't need another national campaign or billboard with smiling girls. It needs shame! Shame in the hearts of families who treat their sons like heirs and their daughters like consolation prizes. Shame in the voices of husbands who blame women for the biology they themselves pass on. Shame in a society that keeps girls alive, but never lets them thrive.
Until we begin to see the birth of a daughter as a cause for celebration -— not restraint, not regret — we'll remain a nation guilty of waging a quiet war on half our future.

Man killed by robbers outside bank,"IN
The police said they were examining CCTV footage from the area and had launched a manhunt for the murderers
A 50-year-old man was shot dead while resisting a robbery by men on a motorcycle outside a bank on Ravi Road on Tuesday.
The victim, Iftikhar, had arrived at the spot to deposit Rs1.6 million. He worked as a clerk in a nearby grain market and was on his way to deposit cash in the bank. According to the police, the assailants opened fire when Iftikhar resisted their attempt to rob him. ""The citizen had come from a nearby grain market to deposit Rs1.6 million in the private bank,"" a police spokesperson said. ""When the robbers attempted to snatch the money, he offered resistance, prompting them to open fire."" The victim was shifted to Mayo Hospital but he succumbed to his injuries.
The police spokesperson said Iftikhar worked at a shop and regularly handled cash transactions for the grain market. The attackers fled without taking the money after shooting the victim.
The police handed over the amount to the grain business owner. DIG Operations Faisal Kamran stated that investigations were being conducted from all angles, including murder and attempted robbery.
The police said they were examining CCTV footage from the area and had launched a manhunt for the murderers.

Strategic communication,"PK
De-escalation of India-Pak conflict only possible when both sides military officials engage
What was lacking in the May 7-10 armed conflict with India was strategic communication — something that is responsible for the prevailing stand-off between Pakistan and India. When the DGMOs of the two countries contacted each other after the ceasefire, it reflected strategic communication between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
De-escalation of the conflict was only possible when the military officials of the two sides entered into strategic communication.
What is strategic communication and how is it essential in the context of de-escalation and consequent talks between two adversaries? Why did the strategic communication, an established phenomenon in the Indo-Pak relations since 1980s, break down in a crisis situation and how can it be revitalised in the months to come?
According to AI, ""Strategic communication is a purposeful approach to using communication to achieve specific organizational goals, whether that's influencing stakeholders, driving change, or improving brand perception. It involves planning, executing, and evaluating communication strategies to ensure they effectively reach and engage the intended audience.
This includes understanding the audience, crafting clear and consistent messages, and using appropriate channels to deliver them."" According to sompplr.com, ""Strategic communications is a specialized approach to distributing and receiving information. It means communicating the best message, through the correct channels, to the right people, at the right time and using feedback from this process to stay focused on company goals.""
In his speech before the 22nd Asia Security Summit Shangri-La dialogue held on May 31, Pakistan's Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza said, ""Strategic communication matters. Misconception, narrative warfare and information distortion are the oxygen for escalation. Strategic understanding must precede crisis management.
Mechanisms cannot function in a vacuum of trust or amid systemic asymmetries. Durable crisis management requires a foundation of mutual restraint, recognition of red lines and equilibrium, not dominance."" Strategic communication cannot take place in isolation and requires 10 conditions: mutual trust, confidence, political will, determination, sharing of information, transparency, monitoring, verification, time-management and mechanism for de-escalation of an armed conflict.
Looking at different conflict zones — Kashmir, Ukraine, Gaza, Yemen, Iran and Israel — one can say that strategic communication failed to yield positive results because the parties involved lacked proper strategic communication and crisis management mechanism. In conflicts which are not violent but reflecting trade and tariff issues, strategic communication requires dialogue and diplomacy to work out a plausible solution. In the case of Pakistan's intra-state water conflicts, strategic communication involving IRSA, federal government and provinces is essential to deal with misconceptions and misunderstanding particularly between Sindh and Punjab.
Needless to say, strategic communication is an art and science which is used by the stakeholders to prevent and manage a conflict to take a critical shape. India's suspension of Indus Water Treaty is a classic example of breakdown of strategic communication between the two neighbours. Likewise, the Shimla Pact of July 1972 — which transformed the ceasefire line of 1948 to the line of control and contained various elements to establish peace between India and Pakistan following the December 1971 war — was under the threat of unilateral revocation but got saved because both parties wanted to maintain it.
In this scenario, strategic communication is an innovative idea which is useful for the parties concerned to keep a treaty or an agreement in tact alongside ensuring that it also deals with the challenge of crisis management. Henceforth, strategic communication in the context of the May 7-10 Indo-Pak armed conflict needs to be examined from three sides.
First, the breakdown of strategic communication happened when India took an extreme step in retaliation to the Pahalgam terrorist attack of April 22, blaming it on Pakistan. Despite Pakistan's condemnation of that terrorist attack which killed 26 tourists and its proposal to conduct a neutral international inquiry, the Modi government went ahead with its unilateral judgment by launching missile and drone attacks against Pakistan on May 7.
Had there been strategic communication between India and Pakistan, there would have been no escalation in the wake of the Pahalgam attack. One wonders why despite military CBMs between India and Pakistan, like the hotline between DGMOs, New Delhi used military option against Islamabad. It means the Indian side had given up on the option of using strategic communication at the highest level like direct talk between the Prime Ministers of the two countries or military chiefs. That led to the outbreak of a dangerous crisis which only got de-escalated with the announcement of a ceasefire on May 10 by US President Donald Trump through a tweet. It means strategic communication to defuse a dangerous crisis situation added an external power to the situation.
Second, after the ceasefire, India refused to accept there was any external role and argued that the two sides only agreed to stop fighting when their military high-ups decided to cease fire. It means despite its earlier avoidance of strategic communication as a fundamental requirement to manage a military crisis, India opted for that technique. But the question is, for how long will the Indo-Pak stand-off continue and how can strategic communication, which led to the ceasefire, help the process of crisis management, conflict management and ultimately conflict resolution? Given the situation and ground realities prevailing since April 22, the fragility of strategic communication would continue to threaten the holding of ceasefire.
Third, there is no shortcut to ensuring a sustained ceasefire unless the two sides agree to resume the process of dialogue. More than Pakistan, India will suffer because of the prevailing stand-off due to the severe economic ramifications in the form of closed airspace and threat of declining foreign investment in case of resumption of the armed conflict. Only by adhering to basic requirements of strategic communication and crisis management, Pakistan and India can do away with the prevailing stand-off.
It's pertinent to mention here that the stand-off between the government and the opposition in Pakistan is also because of the absence of strategic communication between the two.

Juice industry seeks tax reduction,"US
This indicates that the juice industry has hit the Laffer Curve
The Fruit Juice Council — a body representing the formal juice industry – has demanded the government to reduce the FED rate on the juice industry to 15%.
The current 20% FED (on top of existing 18% GST) has stalled the juice industry's growth and in FY2024-25 the government's revenue projections fell short of its own expectations.
This indicates that the juice industry has hit the Laffer Curve (where the taxation is so high that it results in sharp decline of sales, ultimately affecting government revenue).
In line with local regulations, fruit drinks have minimum 5% fruit content, nectars have 25%- 50% fruit content and pure juices have 100% fruit content.

"Solar panel, hybrid car tax rejected","US
Finance body rejects 18% tax on solar imports; hybrid vehicle tax hike withdrawn
A National Assembly panel on Tuesday unanimously rejected the 18% sales tax on solar panel imports, while the government announced it would withdraw another controversial proposal to increase in sales tax on hybrid vehicles, rolling back two controversial budget measures viewed as anti-environment.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance also raised questions about the proposed Digital Presence Proceeds Act 2025 but did not issue a final decision. The meeting was chaired by Pakistan People's Party (PPP) MNA and former finance minister Syed Naveed Qamar.
""The committee unanimously rejects the 18% sales tax on import of solar panels and its parts,"" Qamar said after detailed discussion. Unlike the Senate, the National Assembly and its standing committee's decisions are binding in the case of the Finance Bill. This was the committee's first formal rejection since it began reviewing the Finance Bill.
The government had projected Rs20 billion in revenue from the 18% sales tax on the import and supply of photovoltaic cells, whether assembled or not. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) had not endorsed the tax, and its rejection by the committee will not affect the IMF programme.
FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial said a sales tax already applied to locally assembled solar panels, and exempting imports could hurt the domestic industry. However, he failed to provide reliable data on local production's share in total sales and admitted local supply was minimal.
""If the government doesn't accept our rejection, the National Assembly will veto it,"" said Qamar, urging alternative means to support local producers.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said the era of subsidies had ended, to which Qamar responded that the government had just announced subsidies for electric vehicles in the same budget.
""It is a cross-subsidy on electric vehicles,"" said Aurangzeb. ""It is still a subsidy funded by someone else,"" replied Qamar. The budget introduced a 1% to 3% engine levy to raise Rs10 billion for electric vehicle subsidies.
The government has long sought to reduce reliance on solar energy, which provides cheaper electricity than costly grid power. ""No party in the National Assembly supports the 18% solar tax. The government must withdraw it,"" Qamar said. The finance minister acknowledged the feedback.
Hybrid tax withdrawn
The government also announced it would withdraw the proposed increase in sales tax on hybrid cars up to 1800cc, maintaining the current 12.5% rate. The reversal will cost an estimated Rs7 billion in potential revenue.
""The 12.5% sales tax on hybrid cars will remain,"" said the FBR chairman. He said that although the tax hike had been announced in the budget speech, it would not be increased.
This marks the second time in a year that the government proposed raising the tax on hybrid vehicles, only to backtrack before the budget's approval by the National Assembly. Under the current auto policy, the tax rate on hybrid cars cannot be increased before June 2026.
However, Langrial said the government would proceed with raising the sales tax on small cars up to 850cc, often purchased by middle-income buyers. The government has proposed a sales tax rate increase from 12.5% to 18%.
Langrial argued that buyers of Rs3 million cars could afford to pay 18% sales taxes.
""It seems small cars will become more expensive while luxury SUVs get cheaper,"" remarked Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Usama Mela.
FBR powers spark controversy
The committee also held a heated debate over proposals to expand the Federal Board of Revenue's policing powers, warning of potential abuse.
""The Finance Bill is like declaring martial law on businesses,"" said PPP MNA Nafisa Shah.
Langrial objected to the comparison. ""Harsh words like martial law have been used, but I want to clarify that I work for a democratic government,"" he said before leaving the meeting room.
Committee members also opposed giving police the authority to trace and seize untaxed cigarettes under FBR directives. They warned the measure could open new avenues for bribery. ""Poor people smoke to relieve stress, but the rich can afford diet coke,"" quipped MNA Sharmila Faruqi.
Digital tax plan questioned
The committee also questioned the Digital Presence Proceeds Act, a new bill aimed at taxing online payments to foreign digital companies like Netflix and Amazon. The bill proposes a 5% tax on the value of such payments.
FBR Member Dr Najeeb Memon said annual foreign payments exceeded Rs300 billion, with potential to raise Rs15 billion in tax revenue. He said credit card payments to Netflix and Amazon alone hit Rs300 billion this year, while Chinese e-commerce platform Temu made Rs4 billion in tax-free sales.
Committee members urged the government to introduce the digital tax measure as a separate law, not as part of the Finance Bill.

Healthy crowds and Messi mania lift CWC,"PK
Some 61,000 fans packed the Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday
The expanded Club World Cup has kicked off with healthy crowds, ""Messi mania"" and a festival atmosphere in Miami, giving an early vindication to world football body FIFA after fears of empty stands and global disinterest.
FIFA controversially awarded Lionel Messi's Inter Miami a backdoor route into the tournament, ensuring the sport's biggest name would be there after he propelled soccer to new heights in a country often ambivalent to the world's most popular game.
Some 61,000 fans packed the Hard Rock Stadium on Saturday to watch the Argentine and teammates play Egyptian giants Al-Ahly in a goalless draw.
Another strong crowd turned out on Sunday for the clash between Paris St Germain and Atletico Madrid, which ended in a one-sided 4-0 win for the Champions League winners.
However, Bayern Munich's 10-0 demolition of semi-professional Auckland City underscored the worrying gulf in quality between some of the competing clubs.
But the opening weekend largely delivered what FIFA had hoped for: vibrant crowds and global representation.
South American supporters made their presence especially felt.
More than 1,000 Boca Juniors fans in blue and gold turned Miami Beach into a party strip on Sunday ahead of their opening match, singing club anthems and waving flags in scenes reminiscent of a World Cup carnival.
""Wherever you go, Boca is here,"" Gaston San Paul, a fan who flew in from Entre Rios in Argentina, told Reuters.
""Wherever we are we do this,"" he added, referring to the ""Banderazo"" (flag party), a fan gathering destined to mark territory ahead of a game.
Boca and Real Madrid games were among the top early ticket sellers, according to FIFA, which said that top markets after the US were Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.
Talk of empty stands was at least provisionally dismissed as well as heightened anxiety in the immigrant-heavy Miami area following recent federal immigration raids.
At the heart of the opening weekend buzz was Messi, whose presence has elevated Inter Miami's profile and guaranteed global glamour for the tournament.
$1 billion deal
Messi, who received a standing ovation before kickoff, was unable to find the net against Al-Ahly but provided flashes of brilliance in a tightly contested, physical match.
FIFA is banking not only on Messi's star power but also on a radical new broadcast strategy.
The tournament is being streamed for free worldwide by DAZN in a $1 billion deal.
That agreement followed Saudi Arabia's SURJ Sports Investment, a subsidiary of the country's Public Investment Fund (PIF), acquiring a minority stake in DAZN for a reported $1 billion - another marker of the kingdom's growing investment footprint in sport.
The partnership, one of the largest broadcast packages in football history, is central to FIFA's push to maximize digital engagement and position the Club World Cup as a global spectacle ahead of the 2026 World Cup in North America.
The $1 billion prize money, which ensures a hefty $125 million for the winners, was an obvious incentive for the European clubs.
""There's a lot of money at stake. If you have the chance to earn a lot of money at a tournament, you should take the chance,"" former Bayern legend Karl Heinz Rummenigge said in the run-up.
DAZN has yet to provide viewership data.
While the crowds gave FIFA reason to be cheerful, the Bayern Munich v Auckland City match raised awkward questions about the tournament's balance as the German champions obliterated their opponents 10-0.
Despite the lopsided contest in Cincinnati, the overall mood among organizers was one of optimism, calling the opening weekend a resounding success.
Many Floridians, however, did not know a global soccer event was taking place in their state.
""There is a World Cup? Hockey?,"" said one person working in a restaurant in Miami Beach.
""This tournament is new, and it is different. It is the very first time clubs and players from all over the world have had the chance to face each other in competitive matches on a global stage,"" FIFA said, referring to the 32-club format after the previous editions featured seven.

Willing to give my blood for this team: Rabada,"US
He bagged nine wickets in South Africa's victory over Australia in WTC Final
South African fast-bowling ace Kagiso Rabada delivered both with the ball and in spirit during the World Test Championship (WTC) 2025 final against Australia, crediting mental resilience and team unity for their historic victory.
""There are normally two voices in your head, the one that doubts and the one that believes. The second is the one that we keep feeding, especially in big moments like this, the World Test Championship final,"" Rabada told reporters at Lord's.
""That's why you saw the performances you saw. It's a testament to our team this season,"" he added.
In a tense five-day encounter that spanned 10 gripping sessions, South Africa started strong by bowling out Australia for 212. However, they stumbled to 138 all out in their first innings, surrendering the advantage.
A critical second-innings bowling display turned the tide again, with South Africa reducing Australia to 73 for 7 at one stage. Though Australia recovered to post 282, it was still a manageable target on a flattening pitch.
Head coach Shukri Conrad praised the bowling unit — and Rabada in particular — for setting up the win.
""Where did we turn it around? Obviously, that bowling performance, because we could easily have fallen asleep in the field and then they would have gotten away from us in a big way,"" Conrad said. ""As for KG — that's why he's the superstar. He knew we had one chance at it.""
Rabada, however, humbly deflected the praise when asked about his stature in South African cricket.
""I don't see myself as a star,"" he insisted, despite being fourth on South Africa's all-time wicket-takers list and boasting the best strike rate among bowlers with over 200 Test wickets. ""I see myself as someone who's willing to give my blood for this team and continue working hard and improving. That's me as a cricketer, always wanting to improve and playing for the badge with a lot of pride.""
""I've been working extremely hard, and those second-innings spells, those are the ones that count more, when you're a bit tired. You could be behind the game, or you could be ahead of the game. This time, we're behind the game. But I think it was just about staying calm and looking at what's in front of us. That's the way I see myself.""

"'Lack of funds from govt, PSB is crippling for snooker'","US
PBSA makes urgent appeal to govt to rescue the sport
The Pakistan Billiards and Snooker Association (PBSA) is facing a severe financial crisis due to lack of any funding from the government or the PSB during the past one year which has jeopardised the survival of snooker as a sport and has put the participation of national players in the upcoming international competitions at serious risk.
The PBSA has urgently appealed to the government and the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) to take notice of the situation and immediately release funds for the federation which is not only one of the most efficient and hardworking federations in the country, but has also brought a huge number of laurels to Pakistan through the untiring efforts of its cueists and its officials.
Highlighting the gravity of the financial crisis, the association stated that both the domestic circuit and Pakistan's international representation in snooker are under serious threat if the funds are not released by the PSB. ""Since July 2024, the Pakistan Sports Board has not provided any financial support, despite Pakistani players delivering exceptional performances on the world stage last year,"" the PBSA said in its appeal.
In 2024, Pakistan won a gold medal at the World Snooker Championship held in Doha, Qatar, and added to its achievements with a silver and bronze at the World 6-Red and World Cup Snooker Championships, another gold medal at the World Men's Snooker Championship, a gold and bronze at the 3rd SAARC Snooker Championship, and a bronze at the Asian Men's and U-21 Championships.
The PBSA emphasized that all expenses for these events were borne by the association through its own limited resources - an arrangement that is no longer sustainable. Due to the current lack of financial support, Pakistan's participation in several major upcoming international events is now uncertain. These include:
Asian Team & 6-Red Championship (SL, June 2025)
Commonwealth Games (Mauritius, Jul 2025)
World U-17, U-21, and 6-Red Championships (Bahr, Jul 2025)
World Games (Chi, Aug 2025).

HCSTSI slams FBR arrest powers in budget,"US
Hyderabad traders call new tax law clause 'draconian' and 'economic terrorism'
Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders & Small Industry (HCSTSI) Acting President Ahmed Idrees Chohan has strongly condemned the inclusion of a new Section 37AA in the Sales Tax Act under the Federal Budget 2025-26.
He called the amendment draconian and unconstitutional, saying it allows Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officers to arrest any businessman, industrialist, CEO, or director merely on suspicion, without a warrant. He termed it the most dangerous legal provision in Pakistan's history.
Chohan said the section empowers FBR officers to arrest and detain individuals for up to 14 days without court approval or a judicial warrant.
""This violates justice and assaults constitutional rights and damages business freedom. What kind of financial reform instills fear among investors by allowing tax officials to arrest people?"" he asked. ""Is being an industrialist now a crime in Pakistan?""
He questioned whether the government wants to promote business or drive investors abroad to business-friendly countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Malaysia, or the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where no such arrest clauses exist.
While the world promotes ease of doing business, Pakistan appears to treat entrepreneurs like criminals, he said. The HCSTSI leader said such arbitrary arrest powers don't exist in any developed or developing country.
""If someone is evading taxes, a judicial system already exists. The FBR isn't a judicial body or law enforcement agency. It has no authority to arrest,"" he added.
Chohan labelled Section 37AA as ""economic terrorism"" and a deliberate act of ""capital destruction"". He warned that if the clause remains, Pakistan's business community will feel unsafe and foreign investment will stay away.

Karachi among world's 'least liveable cities' in global index,"US
City only Pakistani metropolis to feature in Economist list
Karachi has once again been ranked among the five least liveable cities in the world, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), an affiliate of The Economist.
In its latest Global Liveability Index, the metropolis placed 170th out of 173 cities evaluated globally, securing an overall score of 42.7 out of 100, with 100 representing the highest level of liveability.
The only Pakistani city to appear in the rankings, Karachi continues to fare poorly on key indicators. It was placed just above Dhaka (Bangladesh), Tripoli (Libya) and Damascus (Syria), which rounded out the bottom of the list.
The annual report evaluates cities across five key categories: health care, stability, culture and environment, education, and infrastructure. It is primarily used by companies to determine hardship allowances when relocating employees to different regions.
At the other end of the spectrum, Copenhagen claimed the top position with a near-perfect score of 98. Vienna and Zurich followed, each scoring 97.1, while Melbourne and Geneva earned scores of 97.0 and 96.8, respectively.
Karachi's low standing in the EIU ranking reflects a broader pattern.
In previous years, it has consistently been compared with cities facing conflict, economic instability or infrastructural collapse. In last year's index, it appeared alongside Lagos, Tripoli, Algiers and Damascus. In the 2022 report, Karachi ranked 169th out of 173.
Concerns about Karachi's deteriorating urban environment are not new. A report released by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in October last year found that the overall liveability of Pakistani cities is declining.
Urban centres, particularly Karachi, were described as becoming increasingly inefficient, scoring poorly on global competitiveness indices due to challenges such as congestion, pollution and poor urban planning.

Snyder loyalists target new 'Superman' film,"US
Director James Gunn claps back at trolls
When it comes to established superheroes, few things get fans more worked up than a new addition to a beloved franchise, and the upcoming Superman film is no exception.
As per Variety, since the announcement of director James Gunn's DC Universe (DCU) replacing Zack Snyder's DC Extended Universe (DCEU), a segment of devoted Snyder fans has launched a negative campaign against the new direction, including upcoming DCU projects. The latest backlash has targeted Superman, the first film in Gunn's DCU, set for release on July 11. A Snyder supporter took to Reddit to encourage users to spoil and review-bomb the film.
However, director James Gunn remains unmoved by all the negativity. Responding directly to one of the posts, Gunn wrote, ""I think we will survive. I'm not sure the eight people that listen to that guy (I'm going to go out on a limb and guess it's a guy) are going to impact the course of events.""
The comment quickly drew attention online, sparking a variety of fan reactions. Many supported Gunn's stance and condemned the negativity. One user noted, ""Let's be honest. James and Zack are friends. I loved Zack's movies and I will probably love James Gunn's movies too."" Another added, ""As a Snyder fan, that's trash. Let people enjoy the movie — we had a good run with the DCEU."" A third pointed out, ""Funny thing is the majority of Snyder fanboys aren't even CBM fans. They just get annoyed when others like a movie.""
Despite isolated online campaigns, Superman — starring David Corenswet, Rachel Brosnahan, Nicholas Hoult, and others — is tracking to open strongly at the box office. It follows the DCU's animated debut Creature Commandos and precedes titles like Peacemaker season 2, Lanterns, Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow, and Clayface.
Gunn's confident response, paired with the supportive fan reaction, suggests that online trolling may not derail anticipation for the upcoming DCU reboot.

Juice industry urges cut in FED to boost revenue,"US
.
The Fruit Juice Council (FJC), representing the formal juice industry, has urged the government to reduce the 20% Federal Excise Duty (FED) on juices to 15% to generate higher revenue than the outgoing financial year.
The current 20% FED, in addition to 18% GST, has stalled industry growth. In FY2024-25, government revenue projections fell short, suggesting the industry has hit the Laffer Curve — where high taxation leads to lower sales and declining revenue. Under local rules, fruit drinks must have at least 5% fruit content, nectars 25-50%, and pure juices 100%. These juices are healthier due to their fruit content. Punjab and Sindh Food Authorities permit the sale of fruit-based juices in schools while restricting other beverages.
Due to falling sales, fruit procurement dropped below 2017 levels. Only 20,233 tonnes of mangoes were purchased last year compared to 31,000 tonnes in 2017-18, hurting farmers and pulpers.
While the government claims it supports a documented economy, such policies contradict that goal. The 20% FED and 18% GST are driving consumers toward low-priced, low-quality, and potentially unsafe options from the undocumented sector, which continues to grow.
The budget also proposes capping the chilling charge adjustment at 5% instead of 10%, further burdening manufacturers.

GST hike feared to hit auto sales,"PK
Suzuki MD says 18% tax will impact jobs, push up vehicle prices
Pak Suzuki Motor Company has cautioned the government that the proposed increase in general sales tax (GST) in the budget for fiscal year 2025-26 may result in a significant decline in sales of the auto industry, which will negatively impact original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) as well as vendors.
Discussing the negative impact of 18% GST, Pak Suzuki Managing Director Hiroshi Kawamura said that it would also affect employment across the automotive value chain, according to sources.
He mentioned that economic growth was sustainable with 12% sales tax and any further increase would impact the entire auto industry. At present, around 2.5 million direct and indirect jobs are being provided by the automobile industry. ""This number may further increase if 12.5% GST continues in this category,"" he said.
Hiroshi Kawamura held a meeting with Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Industries Haroon Akhtar Khan on Tuesday to review the impact of the budget and the proposed new tariff policy.
""The impact of higher sales tax is always borne by customers,"" Kawamura remarked. He voiced concern over the proposed increase in sales tax on vehicles below 850cc engine capacity from 12.5% to 18%, warning that such measures could adversely affect the sector.
He stated that the tax hike could lead to higher vehicle prices, reducing affordability and dampening market demand. The price increase may also hinder industry growth and increase pressure on production.
In response, the PM aide reiterated the government's resolve to support the auto industry as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was committed to the sector's growth and was aware of the challenges.
""Progress demands unity and collaboration. The auto industry is a vital source of employment and local manufacturing strength,"" he remarked.
Haroon Akhtar assured the MD that the PM would not allow the sector to falter and pledged continued engagement with industry stakeholders to help navigate challenges and seize growth opportunities.
Separately, the PM special assistant held a meeting with Master Changan Motors CEO Danial Malik to discuss the strategic challenges faced by the auto industry and potential implications of the budget.
They deliberated on the importance of transitioning to New Energy Vehicles (NEVs), especially electric vehicles, as a national priority. Malik stressed the need for sustained policy support and industry-friendly measures to ensure a stable and growth-oriented environment.
Haroon Akhtar reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing a sustainable and modern auto policy aligned with global trends. He announced that the EV policy would be unveiled soon.
""The prime minister envisions a globally competitive auto industry,"" he said. ""Our EV policy will provide a comprehensive framework for infrastructure development, investment incentives and policy facilitation."" He added that special incentives would be offered to promote the adoption of EVs, which would support long-term industrial growth and environmental sustainability.

Gulf crisis: Imran defers protest for 2 weeks,"US
Nation awaits statements from PM, president, and field marshal regarding Pakistan's policy on conflict
In view of an ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel, PTI Parton-in-Chief Imran Khan has decided to defer his party's planned protest movement by two weeks, said the former prime minister's sisters on Tuesday after a meeting with him at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail.
""Imran Khan has postponed the protest movement for two weeks in light of global circumstances,"" said Noreen Khanum and Uzma Khan while talking to the media outside the prison.
According to them, the nation is awaiting statements from the prime minister, the president, and the field marshal regarding Pakistan's policy on the conflict.
On June 1, Imran announced the launch of a nationwide protest movement against the PML-N-led ruling coalition, declaring that he would lead the campaign from behind bars. The announcement was conveyed by PTI Senator Ali Zafar following his meeting with Imran.
Addressing the media outside the prison, the senator had said the former PM had decided that the waiting game was over and the party would now take to the streets in a well-organised countrywide campaign. However, he had not disclosed when the movement would be started.
Noreen noted that although the PTI founder had not met anyone for a week, he was well-informed about international affairs. ""He said global developments will affect Pakistan and that all Pakistanis must unite at this time,"" adding that Imran is concerned over both internal and external situations.
She said Imran Khan called the proposed budget elite-culture-driven and pro-rich.
""Conditions for the poor have deteriorated significantly. The salaried class is bearing the entire tax burden, and poverty will further increase.
""33 lakh (3.3 million) educated people have left Pakistan in the past three years. Each person who leaves takes about $30,000 with them, causing also a loss of foreign exchange.""
She said Imran Khan has instructed that K-P's budget will only be passed after his consultation with K-P CM Ali Amin Gandapur and other PTI leaders who are scheduled to meet him.

"Humid weather, power outages life threatening for chronic patients","US
Dr. Sarwar advised vulnerable groups to avoid unnecessary exposure to heat
The ongoing spell of humid weather coupled with prolonged power outages has become a nightmare for patients suffering from chronic illnesses in the metropolitan city. Doctors at Civil Hospital report that heart patients, diabetics, individuals with high blood pressure, and epilepsy patients are increasingly being rushed to emergency wards in deteriorating conditions.
Dr. Imran Sarwar, the Emergency In-charge at the Civil Hospital, told The Express Tribune that currently, nearly 40 per cent of all emergency admissions are individuals already battling conditions like diabetes, hypertension, epilepsy, or those on extended bed rest. ""Due to the extreme heat and persistent load shedding, their health is deteriorating rapidly,"" he said.
He explained that the hot and humid climate worsens the condition of chronically ill patients, particularly due to dehydration, which leads to electrolyte imbalance. This in turn causes spikes in blood sugar and blood pressure levels. ""Epilepsy patients are arriving with complaints of seizures, and many require immediate dextrose infusion to stabilise their condition,"" Dr. Sarwar added.
He further noted that such patients cannot be sent home after basic treatment and must be kept under observation for six to 24 hours, adding an extra burden on emergency department. ""Healthy individuals may not feel the impact of this weather as much, but those with pre-existing conditions are particularly vulnerable.""
Dr. Sarwar advised vulnerable groups to avoid unnecessary exposure to heat, consume hydrating foods like milk, yogurt, watermelon, and cucumber, and carry a water bottle when stepping outside. He emphasised the importance of covering one's head while outdoors.
He also advised special caution for diabetics. ""While we recommend juices and fruits for the general public, diabetic patients must avoid sugary fruits and packaged juices,"" he said. Apples are a better option, while fruits like bananas, chikoo (sapodilla), and mangoes should be consumed in limited quantities.
He also mentioned that vitamin C sachets may be helpful, but must be taken only after consulting a doctor.
Dr. Sarwar urged authorities to take urgent steps to mitigate the impact of heat and electricity shortages on vulnerable patients, as the city's healthcare infrastructure struggles to cope with the seasonal surge in cases.
