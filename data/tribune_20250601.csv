Hamas pledges to free 10 living hostages,"US
.
Hamas announced on Saturday that it had submitted its response to a ceasefire proposal from US envoy Steve Witkoff, saying 10 living hostages would be freed from Gaza under the deal.
The White House had said the latest proposal for a deal was approved in advance by Israel, which on Friday warned Hamas to either accept the deal and free the hostages ""or be annihilated"".
The group did not explicitly say it had accepted the version of the proposal it received on Thursday, which had also reportedly included a provision for the release of 10 living hostages and a truce of at least 60 days.
In a statement on Saturday, Hamas said it had ""submitted its response to US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff's latest proposal to the mediating parties"".

Loadshedding is another story. Don't even get me started on that.
Feeling oppressed and nauseous while heading to work? Read the morning paper and you'll find yourself in a mixed state of agony and amusement. As baffling as it sounds, you'll come across news updates that will not only leave you questioning your sanity but will also have you asking yourself: ""Do these people really know what they're talking about?""
Let me give you an example. The apex court will be hosting a symposium on judicial reforms where focus will be on encouraging the use of technology to modernise our judicial system and make it more efficient as a result.
Now, on the face of it, sounds like the need of the moment. I, sitting on my chrome horse, can engage in this revolutionary discussion all I want while sipping on my expensive cold coffee.
But you do realise that for modern technology to be utilised efficiently, you need tech literate court staff? Not only tech literate, you need court staff that knows basic English, and knows how to use a computer (which of-course utilises the English language). Also, court staff should be tech literate enough to navigate their way through daily tech troubles to ensure regular tasks don't require calling the IT guy all the time. Not only this, you also require uninterrupted access to high-speed internet which of course, in our country, is a myth.
At the slightest of convenience, the not-so-smart officials sitting in telecommunication offices will shut the internet down in the name of 'national security'. Good luck running the system with no internet. 'Sir, system down hai' is a haunting sentence we've all heard.
Loadshedding is another story. Don't even get me started on that.
Sir(s), you cannot engage in judicial reforms and talks about digitising the judiciary until you hire court staff and clerks who have knowledge of everything I've mentioned above. And all of us recognise the fact that no sane degree holder will work as court staff unless a) you pay them well and b) you don't keep blaming them for actions of the higher-ups (reported fact).
In other funny news, over 3,800 vehicles owned by senior bureaucrats and police officials were seen violating traffic laws in Lahore with impunity. Will these people ever be held accountable? Never. They own us. Laws don't apply to them; laws only apply to the slaves who pay taxes. Democratic republic? Not by a country mile. I am sure this is the case all over the country, not just Lahore.
A child is a reflection of their parents. Next time you see citizens violating traffic laws, don't be surprised, instead, call up your MPA and give him a schooling (assuming the looking-busy-doing-nothing official answers).
A spokesperson for a forum in Karachi which focuses on young parliamentarians stated that it is for the youth, and specifically the youth parliamentarians, to play their role in ""modernising legislation"" and ""assisting the marginalised communities"".
Are these the same marginalised communities you want to help which persistently get labelled as traitors and terrorists each time they voice their political dissent?
Also, respected spokesperson/to whom it may concern, what youth are you referring to? The wise and smart youth have already left the country and the rest are in the process of leaving. Brain drain is real and the sooner we accept the sooner we'll be able to retain skilled labour. About time we accepted the fact that the youth have lost hope in the system. The wise have left, the naïve have stayed.
The system has failed us and continues to fail us, every day. We all know how this works but because it has always been about the money and about power, we all continue to be willfully blind to this.
By the way, I did my job (that I get paid to do), where is my promotion? Where's my fancy title? Do I get to throw a party too?

Pentagon chief warns of imminent China threat,"US
Asks Asian allies to spend more on defence
US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth warned on Saturday that China was ""credibly preparing"" to use military force to upend the balance of power in Asia, vowing the United States was ""here to stay"" in the region.
The Pentagon chief made the remarks at an annual security forum in Singapore as the administration of US President Donald Trump spars with Beijing on trade, technology, and influence over strategic corners of the globe.
China's embassy in Singapore blasted the speech, accusing Washington of escalating tensions in the region and ""profiting from creating risks of war"".
""The threat China poses is real and it could be imminent,"" Hegseth said at the Shangri-La Dialogue attended by defence officials from around the world. Beijing is ""credibly preparing to potentially use military force to alter the balance of power in the Indo-Pacific"", he said.
Hegseth warned that the Chinese military was building the capabilities to invade Taiwan and ""rehearsing for the real deal"".
Hegseth described China's conduct as a ""wake-up call"", accusing Beijing of endangering lives with cyber attacks, harassing its neighbours, and ""illegally seizing and militarising lands"" in the disputed South China Sea.

Livestock sold by weight in Charsadda's village,"US
Bulls are sold at Rs900/kg, buffalo at Rs680/kg
As Eid-ul-Azha approaches, livestock markets across the country, including in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, are drawing large crowds. However, skyrocketing animal prices have made it increasingly difficult for the middle class to fulfill the ritual of sacrifice.
In response to this challenge, traders in Nesata, a village in Charsadda district, have introduced an innovative pricing model — selling sacrificial animals based on weight. According to local sources, the rate for bulls is Rs900 per kilogram, while buffaloes are being sold at Rs680 per kilogram.
This weight-based pricing model, known locally as 'wazan per sale', is proving to be cost-effective. Traders claim that buyers can save between Rs50,000 to Rs70,000 compared to conventional market prices.
As a result, a significant number of people are flocking to Nesata to purchase animals after verifying their weight on a computerized scale. Sellers have installed digital weighing machines near the livestock markets, allowing buyers to get an accurate reading of the animal's weight before making a purchase.
If a buyer finds the total price beyond their budget after the weighing, they are free to walk away - though they are required to pay a Rs100 fee for the weighing slip.
The trend is gaining popularity, particularly among residents of Peshawar and nearby areas, who are now traveling to Nesata for more transparent and potentially economical livestock purchases.
Located just two kilometers from the Charsadda Motorway Interchange, Nesata is fast becoming a hotspot for buyers seeking fairly priced sacrificial animals ahead of Eid.
Meanwhile, with the disbursement of salaries to public and private sector employees, Eid shopping in the city has seen a significant surge. Markets are experiencing a dramatic increase in foot traffic, severely impacting the flow of traffic across major commercial areas.
Alongside traditional Eid shopping, the purchase of sacrificial animals for Eid-ul-Azha is also gaining momentum. On Saturday, both shopping malls and livestock markets across the city witnessed heavy crowds.

OPEC+ oil producers plan big hike,"US
Increase of 411,000 bpd for July as Saudi Arabia, Russia seek to win back market share
The world's largest group of oil producers, OPEC+, stuck to its guns on Saturday with another big increase of 411,000 barrels per day for July as it looks to wrestle back market share and punish over-producers.
Having spent years curbing production – more than 5 million barrels a day (bpd) or 5% of world demand – eight OPEC+ countries made a modest output increase in April before tripling it for May, June and now July.
They are spurring production despite the extra supply weighing on crude prices as group leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia seek to win back market share as well as punish over-producing allies such as Iraq and Kazakhstan.
The eight countries held an online meeting on Saturday to set July production. They also discussed other options, an OPEC+ delegate said. On Friday, sources familiar with OPEC+ talks had said they could discuss an even larger hike. In a statement OPEC+ cited a ""steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories"" as its reasoning for the July increase.
Its increased supply is weighing on crude prices, squeezing all producers, but some more than others, including a key group of rivals – US shale producers, analysts say. ""Three strikes from OPEC+, and none were softballs. May warned, June confirmed, and July fires a shot across the bow,"" said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad and a former OPEC official.
Since April, the OPEC+ eight have now made or announced increases totalling 1.37 million bpd, or 62% of the 2.2 million bpd they aim to add back to the market. Higher summer oil demand favours increasing output at this time, OPEC+ officials including Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak have said. Algeria was among a small number of nations that requested a pause in the output hikes on Saturday.

India — indiscretion or prudence,"US
PM Modi's intentions about Pakistan have always been questionable.
Hans Morgenthau's Politics Among Nations: The Struggle for Power and Peace is a book on political science published in 1948. The author has outlined six principles of political realism in this book. It is interesting to see Prime Minister Narendra Modi's actions and Indian state behaviour against Pakistan in view of these principles. The six principles are: 1) politics like society in general is governed by objective laws that have roots in human nature; 2) a statesman sees certain problems of foreign policy under certain circumstances; 3) key concept of interest defined as power is an objective category and is universally valid; 4) universal moral principles cannot be applied to actions of the state; 5) political realism refuses to identify the moral aspirations of a particular nation with the moral laws that govern the world; and 6) there is a profound difference of policymaking in different schools of thought.
I would like to start with the last principle. The nature of a man, the nature of society, and the nature of the politics all three combine to produce a typical school of thought and the consequential nature of the state behaviour which aims at the realisation of any evil or good. In this context, it is important to correctly understand the motives and ideological preferences of the man, PM Modi of India, who drives the process of policymaking. If, through his actions, he represents illiberalism, autocracy, nationalism, protectionism and territorial revisionism, then he represents the dark force of regional politics that seeks war and not peace.
To view the Indian state behaviour in light of the 5th principle of political realism is to see how India under the Modi-led government has deprived the people of occupied Kashmir of justice, freedom, equality, dignity and security - which are some of the moral laws that are universally applicable and govern the world.
The 4th principle of political realism speaks of the universal moral principles such as honesty, respect for life, justice, fairness, compassion, empathy and forgiveness. It's not just India but its partner and ally Israel that practices this principle of political realism and considers that these universal moral principles cannot be applied to the actions of their states.
The third principle of realism, which identifies with interests being defined as power, showcases Indian political realism being practiced under the dark shadows of the Modi-led government for over a decade now. When history is written, the chronicles of this short war between India and Pakistan will buzz with PM Modi's motives, ideological preference and appetite for resorting to violence for his own political gains.
Since Modi has come to power, the direction of Indian foreign policy has gone in no other way but the resolution of Pakistan-India conflicts through war-making. PM Modi's intentions about Pakistan have always been questionable. His anti-Muslim rhetoric earns him praise and political points from the Indian electorate, but the policies that result from his motivational speeches, diplomatic directions and political dictates throw up an interesting question: Will his Pakistan-specific policies be politically successful and sustainable in the long run?
The second principle of political realism talks of policymaking as circumstantial. Currently, the government policies and the politics between India and Pakistan are a popular topic of global discussion and at the centre of global debate. Leadership of both countries is being critically viewed, as what they decide and do would mean the implementation of peace or the commencement of war. This pause in fighting that some of us consider as ceasefire has created a much-needed space for the leadership of both countries for reflection and clarity on the circumstances and the regional and global environment under which fighting a war may or may not be a preferred option.
PM Modi of India is not backing off, and the hatred that he brews against Pakistan is a reflection of a political leader who is bent upon seeking war and not peace as an end. One can contextualise the politics of the Indian PM as an outcome of political realism, but he must carefully consider the consequences of his actions and avoid the Indian state policy from being driven by lust for conflict, self-interest and power maximisation.
Ironically, the majority in Pakistan believe that there will remain little likelihood for reconciliation or room for compromise in Indian politics as long as India, under PM Modi, continues to behave as a regional hegemon and treats Pakistan as unequal. However, Pakistan may be unequal in size and strength, but it is not unequal in its resolve — something that Pakistan proved in its response through Operation Bunyan Marsoos.
The first principle of political realism suggests that ethical norms can be drawn from human nature. Some of the objective laws that govern human nature are the spirit of survival, fair play, inclusivity, cognitive ability for future orientation and curiosity for problem-solving.
One can only wish that India's politics against Pakistan is also governed under these objective laws that govern the nature of human beings. The Indian public judges their PM's motives through the lens of his ideological preferences and thus considers the resulting anti-Pakistan policies as morally right. What the Indian public needs to do is to judge these policies from the point of view of the probability of their success.
The best metric to do that is to see if, following these policies, the lives of the people living in India or even the entire region will become better or worse? Even if PM Modi has convinced the Indian electorate that fighting a war with Pakistan is morally justified, rationality demands that India must weigh the benefits of alternate political action, which is indulging in a dialogue — a pure act of prudence.
It is not the question of who dominates — hawks or doves — in the Indian policymaking circle, but the real question is the rationality of Indian policymaking. Rational minds will have to come to the forefront and comprehend the Indian foreign policy towards Pakistan, minus the policy being overshadowed by the Indian PM's personal motives, ideological preferences and anti-Pakistan biases.
Sane minds in India must distinguish between the Indian PM's official duty and his wish in analysing what is desirable and what is truly possible under the concrete circumstances of availability of tremendous military capability being showcased by both sides, including military platforms that demonstrate destructive powers with nuclear armed warheads.

High dollar value fueling inflation,"US
Rupee devaluation increases cost of imports, resulting in higher fuel and food prices
The persistent high value of the US dollar against the Pakistani rupee continues to exert significant pressure on inflation within the country. Economists widely identify the exchange rate as a primary factor driving price increases.
Due to this critical factor, the continuous drop in inflation, ie, 0.3% in April 2025 against 0.7% in March 2025, is not helping the federal as well as provincial governments to bring down prices of essential commodities, even the local produce did not match the price tag as it was a couple of years ago.
""A weaker rupee directly increases the cost of all imports priced in dollars,"" said economist Osama Siddiqui. This includes essential items like medicines, industrial inputs and food Pakistan does not produce sufficiently. When the rupee falls from, say, 230 to over 280 per dollar, the landed cost in rupees for these goods rises substantially.
""This cost-push effect is a major contributor to inflation, easily accounting for a significant portion of the price surge in imported goods. Recent data shows the rupee is trading consistently above 280 per dollar, compared to approximately 175 two years ago,"" he added.
This dollar strength critically impacts petroleum prices, as Pakistan imports roughly 80% of its oil needs. ""The kerb rate and official exchange rate directly influence the rupee cost of importing oil,"" said Muhammad Fareed, a money exchanger.
A rise in the dollar rate translates very quickly into higher fuel prices at the pump. Higher petroleum costs then cascade through the economy via increased transportation expenses. Diesel and petrol are fundamental to logistics, said transport operator Riaz Hussain. ""A 20% increase in diesel significantly raises the per-kilometre operating cost for transporting goods. This surcharge is inevitably passed on, inflating the prices of everything moved, from food staples to manufactured goods,"" he added.
Economists estimate that fuel and transportation costs constitute about 35% of Pakistan's Consumer Price Index (CPI), directly linking fuel hikes to overall inflation, which peaked at over 38% last year. Global trade dynamics further complicate the situation. Disruptions in international supply chains directly increase the cost of Pakistan's essential imports like wheat, pulses and edible oil.
""Events like the Red Sea tensions force longer shipping routes, doubling or tripling freight charges in some instances,"" Siddiqui added. ""These are dollar-denominated costs. Any global supply chain issue or increased shipping risk translates into higher import bills for Pakistan, requiring more dollars and further pressuring the exchange rate and domestic prices."" Geopolitical uncertainty, particularly surrounding major economies, adds another layer of pressure. Financial analyst Saad Mahmood pointed to concerns about potential policy shifts.
""Global markets react to uncertainty and right now uncertainty is at its peak. The ongoing conflicts between, Russia, Ukraine, Israel and Hammas, with another threat of Iran being attacked in case they failed to reach any nuclear deal; and the Trump's trade war with China, European Union, etc, all are adding to the uncertainty. Capital often flows out of emerging markets like Pakistan towards perceived safer assets like the US dollar during such times.""
This reduced dollar supply within Pakistan makes the currency scarcer and more expensive. ""When major international news breaks, especially involving the US or conflicts, demand for dollars often surges locally as people seek security, pushing the exchange rate up further,"" Mahmood said.
The combined effect of the high dollar exchange rate, its impact on fuel and transportation, global trade disruptions and geopolitical uncertainty creates a challenging environment for price stability in Pakistan. The rising cost of essential imports, amplified by expensive transportation, continues to translate into higher prices for consumers across the board.
To reverse the dollar's inflationary impact, Pakistan must boost exports and reduce import dependency, economists advise. ""Increasing exports like textiles, IT services and agricultural goods is crucial to earn more foreign exchange,"" Siddiqui said.
Simultaneously, promoting local manufacturing of essentials such as edible oils, pulses and industrial inputs would lessen the need for dollar-funded imports. Attracting foreign investment and securing stable financing to build reserves are vital to stabilise the rupee.
Adequate reserves instill market confidence and reduce speculative pressure on the dollar while long-term fiscal discipline and policy consistency are essential to break the cycle of currency-driven inflation. ""Right now remittances are the only window which is increasing decently, however, countries cannot only survive on this source of income, the world has entered into an era of artificial intelligence, we as a country must focus on this crucial aspect and catch the prosperity trains, which we have missed previously,"" he added.

Latin America: Beijing's narrative is dominating Washington's,"US
One recent example of the China-LAC cooperation is development of Chancay Port in Peru.
China's engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has been seen as a threat to the US strategic position globally with recommendations of employing military, technological and economic might to force its neighbours into severing ties with Beijing. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio himself recently travelled to several regional states to counter China's influence and prevent them from building critical infrastructure in cohorts with Beijing.
But with China and LAC leaders at a forum in Beijing agreeing to bolster ties and support a ""fair, transparent and rules-based multilateral trade system"", in a densely veiled swipe at America, the gathering sent a strong message about its reluctance to rupture relations with China.
In defiance of US President Donald Trump's trade war and crackdown on migration, the bloc has been promoting reconciliation to deliver a collective response. In last month's CELAC summit, regional leaders sought alliance to ""reinvent itself"" to face up to Washington's renewed ""imperialist domination"" efforts, protect against unilateral actions and develop initiatives in trade, science and technology.
For a region that has been immersed in a low growth trap and where connectivity is crucial for a resilient economic future, the forum provided an opportunity to LAC to showcase its concerns on America's protectionist policies and pursue its ambition of projecting itself a dynamic geopolitical and economic player.
In recent years, the China-Latin America relationship has strengthened, as two-thirds of regional countries have joined BRI and Beijing has emerged as biggest trading partners of Brazil, Chile and Peru. Trump's threats of taking over Panama Canal by force delivered him an ephemeral success once Panama withdrew from China's foreign policy drive. And Colombia's joining of blueprint tainted the US president's neo-Monroe Doctrine of considering the Western Hemisphere as America's exclusive sphere of influence.
Testifying before Senate Armed Services Committee, Commander US Southern Command Admiral Alvin Holsey said China was ""using the BRI to set the theater and expand its access to rare earth metals and control of ports for a potential dual civilian-military purpose"".
While much of interpretation is overblown with US coercive policies such as tariffs and aid cuts facilitating Beijing to outmaneuver Washington in a strategic competition, America's own approach is driven by a craving to seize Latin America's rare earth metals and for US national defense and commercial applications. The strategic chicanery surrounding the US practice approach is pushing regional countries toward China.
As Trump's stopgap policy challenges America's geopolitical and economic dominance, the forum is turning into a launchpad for introducing initiatives and formulating action plans to build a ""community with a shared future"" as highlighted by Chinese President Xi Jinping's commitment to provide a 66 billion yuan credit line to support the region's development, extend visa-free arrangement to five countries, import more products and channel further investments.
Since the turn of the century, China-LAC relationship has grown at a fast clip, bringing promising economic opportunities to the region. Nearly 200 BRI megaprojects worth $100 billion were implemented over the last decade; bilateral trade in 2024 leapt 6% to $518 billion. By 2023, China's investments had also exceeded $600 billion.
One recent example of the China-LAC cooperation is development of Chancay Port in Peru. The project - set to become a new logistical order and strategic transshipment hub and accelerate trade across the Pacific for Peruvian Blueberries, Brazilian soy and Chilean copper — would rewire hemispherical trade, intensifying the China-US rivalry. Yet the Peruvian government is seemingly willing to take risk even though it antagonises Washington. If there were any, Trump's tariffs and punitive measures have encouraged Lima and others into connecting with China-built port.
Chinese projects including upgradation of the Dominican Republic's electric grid, deep-water port on Grand Bahama and ""new infrastructure"" such as artificial intelligence, renewable energy, smart cities and 5G technology have rattled the US about growing China's penetration and alleged cyber threats from Beijing. These fears aren't holding regional leaders back from pursuing their economic and social development in partnership with China.
Studies show LAC's embracement of China as a partner has benefited it with advances in infrastructure development and trade and investment. Acknowledging BRI has played an important role in Latin America, ass the studies predict that Beijing has signed almost 1,000 bilateral agreements with LAC countries to facilitate and promote trade, investment and cooperation across a wide array of sectors.
China's expanding influence is sounding alarm in the US yet it cannot just shift the blame on Beijing, given the fact that Washington has for decades put the region in a pigeonhole and forgotten it.
Trump's depreciatory comments, expansionist agenda and renaming of Gulf of Mexico as Gulf of America would further complicate America's ties with the region and hasten its drive of seeking more autonomy in foreign policy.
While Trump's belittling, threatening and domineering posture has gained some achievement, not all LAC countries will toe America's line with most of them alongside China advocating for an inclusive economic globalisation, multilateralism and multilateral trading system. In this battle of narratives between China and the US, the latter's narrative seems to have dominated the former's.

Sinner obliterates Lehecka at French Open,"US
The Italian progressed into the fourth round in little more than 90 minutes
World number one Jannik Sinner delivered a flawless performance to pulverise Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-0 6-1 6-2 in little more than 90 minutes on Saturday, to burst into the French Open fourth round and issue a ominous warning to other title contenders.
The 23-year-old Italian, who returned to tennis in May after a three-month-doping ban, won the first 11 games in a row, and has so far found no resistance en route to the last 16.
He has yet to drop a set in his second tournament back, after reaching the final in Rome earlier in the month.
""Today I was playing really, really well,"" Sinner said. ""He was serving very well and brave. But I am very happy.
""My coach had (his) birthday yesterday and usually when he has birthday I don't play good. Luckily I was not playing yesterday.""
""This morning I said to my team I feel well,"" he added. ""I warmed up feeling really well, trying to go on court with a good focus. My team gave me the right tactics. It is a combination also being happy on court.""
Sinner exploded into action, racing through the first set with a bagel in 25 minutes.
The Czech was left stunned, wondering how to counter such power and precision, but before he came up with any answer he was already trailing 3-0 in the second set.
Pinned to the back, Lehecka could only watch how Sinner's shots flew past him, including a sensational baseline forehand winner that earned the Italian a 4-0 advantage.
The 23-year-old world number 34 earned a big cheer when he finally got onto the scoreboard at 5-1 but his ordeal was far from over.
Sinner served out the second set before proceeding to break shell-shocked Lehecka at the very start of the third.
Running his panting opponent ragged, Sinner earned another break and put him out of his misery with his first match point.
The top seed has now stretched his winning streak at Grand Slam events to 17 matches, after winning the titles at the 2024 U.S. Open and the Australian Open in January prior to his doping ban.
He will next face 17th-seed Andrey Rublev, who advanced after his opponent Arthur Fils of France withdrew with a back injury.
Andreeva's lucky charm helps her into French Open last 16
Mirra Andreeva had her lucky charm on her bench for her third-round clash against Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva, but left her opponent no chance in a 6-3 6-1 victory on Saturday.
The sixth seed, who won the Indian Wells and Dubai top-tier tournaments this year, set up a meeting with Australia's Daria Kasatkina.
""I knew Yulia is a very tricky player, she has an interesting game and it's uncomfortable for me. She likes to cut the rhythm a lot, I knew it would be tough,"" the 18-year-old said on Court Suzanne Lenglen as umbrellas popped open in the stands on a grey Parisian morning.
""I kind of knew what to expect I knew I had to play at 100% and fight for every ball and get those drop shots. I'm happy with the way I play today.""
Andreeva, who reached the semi-finals here last year, also attributed her win to a present she received.
""When I was walking on court a little girl put a drawing on my bench, I kept it. It's my lucky charm,"" she said.
""Wherever that little girl is, I want to thank her because it is my lucky charm.""
Despite an inconsistent serve with four double faults, Andreeva bagged the opening set with a blistering forehand winner for her third break of serve. REUTERS

PBF calls for more support for handicrafts sector,"US
Advocates for enhanced promotion, skill development in South Punjab, Balochistan
Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) Chairperson (Women Wing) Ayesha Farooqui said on Saturday highlighted the significant potential of handicrafts from South Punjab and Balochistan in creating employment opportunities, particularly for rural women. She urged the government to bolster support for the handicraft sector, facilitating artisans' access to both local and international markets.
Speaking to the media, Farooqui mentioned that traditional crafts are widely produced across these provinces and enjoy nationwide popularity. With increased governmental backing, these crafts could become substantial income sources for local women.
She called on the government to actively promote handicrafts from underserved rural and semi-urban areas by organising exhibitions, trade fairs, and craft bazaars domestically and internationally. Such initiatives would help open new markets and showcase Pakistan's cultural diversity.
Farooqui also stressed the importance of skill development and capacity building for artisans, alongside implementing value addition strategies to enhance the quality of handicrafts.
She proposed that provincial governments establish permanent handicraft stalls to boost revenue and generate employment, thereby connecting people from various regions with Pakistan's rich cultural heritage.
""The government should provide domestic skills assessment opportunities and support local communities involved in the handicraft and trade sectors,"" she added.
Farooqui noted that while Pakistan boasts a rich history, culture, and exceptional craftsmanship, it faces challenges in accessing international markets. ""We need to reassess our approach to global promotion by increasing awareness through exhibitions and leveraging digital platforms like e-marketing,"" she said.
She concluded by stating that promoting the handicrafts sector is not only vital for women's economic empowerment but also plays a key role in preserving and innovating Pakistan's traditions and culture.

"Petrol price up by Re1, LPG down by Rs4.62/kg","PK
The finance ministry said that the prices were based on recommendations from OGRA and other relevant ministries.
The federal government has raised the petrol price by Re1 for the next fortnight, while keeping the high-speed diesel rate unchanged. The new prices will be applicable from June 1.
According to a notification issued by the Finance Department, petrol will now be sold at Rs253.63 per litre while high speed diesel (HSD) will continue to be sold at Rs254.64 per litre.
The finance ministry said that the prices were based on recommendations from OGRA and other relevant ministries.
The government is focusing more on collecting petroleum levy on petroleum products to redirect to subsidize electricity prices.
It had earlier decided to fund Rs1.70 per unit subsidy for the consumers of electricity by redirecting PL collection. It also later decided to redirect PL collection to fund canal and road projects in Balochistan province.
The government has already decided to increase the petroleum levy rate up to Rs90 per litre on the sale of oil products. At present, the consumers are paying Rs78 per litre in petroleum levy on petrol and Rs77 per litre on diesel.
LPG
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) has reduced the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for June 2025 in response to fluctuations in the global market.
According to an Ogra notification, the new consumer price of LPG has been set at Rs2,838.31 per 11.8 kg cylinder, down from Rs2,892.91 in May. This reflects a decrease of Rs54.60 per cylinder, or Rs4.62 per kilogram.
The regulator attributed the price reduction to a 2.67% drop in the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP), which directly impacts local LPG producer rates. Additionally, a slight 0.35% increase in the average dollar exchange rate was recorded.
For June, Ogra has set the revised producer price at Rs199,234.49 per ton, which stood at Rs203,861.82 in May - causing a decline of Rs4,627.33 per ton.
Irfan Khokhar, Chairman of the All Pakistan LPG Distributors Association, welcomed the reduction in LPG prices and urged the government to ensure that the official price set by Ogra is strictly enforced.

Imran to lead movement from behind bars
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former premier Imran Khan announced on Saturday the launch of a nationwide protest movement against the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led ruling coalition, declaring that he will lead the campaign from behind bars.
The announcement was conveyed by PTI Senator Ali Zafar following his meeting with the incarcerated party's supremo at Adiala Jail.
Addressing the media outside the prison, the senator said the former PM had decided that the waiting game was over and the party would now take to the streets in a well-organised countrywide campaign.
""The protest will not be limited to Islamabad,"" Zafar said. ""It will be held across the country. The chairman [Khan] said we have been pushed to the wall. We are left with no choice but to go to the people.""
Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 on a raft of charges including corruption and incitement to violenceallegations he deniestold Zafar he would oversee the movement from jail and directly issue instructions to party leaders.
According to Zafar, Khan has tasked him with preparing a comprehensive plan for the protest campaign, which will be finalised after further consultations with the party's legal team and senior leadership.
""The chairman has full faith in the leadership, but he insists on leading the movement himself,"" Zafar said, ""he [Khan] has asked me to draft the initial protest strategy, which will be presented in the next meeting.""
The announcement comes against the backdrop of months of political gridlock and PTI's persistent claims of being denied a fair shake. Khan and his party have maintained that the legal actions against him were politically engineered and aimed at erasing him from the political playing field.
Khan's statement followed closely on the heels of his recent overtures to the country's powerful stakeholders, during which he expressed a willingness to engage in dialogue for national unity. He had reiterated openness to a ""give and take"" with the establishment, but ""only for Pakistan's interest,"" not for personal relief.
However, Saturday's message marked a shift in gears. ""We are not getting any relief from the judiciary or the executive,"" Khan was quoted as saying. ""No option has been left for us. We must now go to the streets.""
According to Zafar, Khan was adamant that this round of agitation would not be like previous attempts that fizzled out due to internal rifts and external pressures.
""He wants the campaign to be fully planned and effective,"" Zafar said. ""He knows there will be obstacles, but he believes we also have ways to overcome them.""
This is not the first time PTI has threatened to launch a street movement. The party had announced a protest after Eid earlier this year, but the plan never got off the ground, fuelling scepticism even among some supporters.
However, Khan's renewed resolve suggests a return to a more confrontational path ahead.
Moreover, the development is likely to dial up tensions between PTI and the military establishment. Despite Khan's earlier calls for reconciliation, relations remain fraught. Notably, PTI leaders were absent from a recent military-hosted dinner celebrating the success of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos, Pakistan's retaliatory operation following Indian aggression in May.
The conspicuous absence of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur from the event further underscored the lingering chill. Despite moments of cooperation during the Pakistan-India standoff, the mutual distrust between PTI and the establishment appears to have deepened.
Meanwhile, ministers from the ruling PML-N coalition have continued to scoff at PTI's protest plans, pointing to the party's failure to mobilise mass support since Khan's arrest.
However, Khan's call to action from a prison cell may still energise PTI's base, which has remained active online and during sporadic public gatherings. Party leaders have been hinting for weeks that a decisive moment was in the offing.
""This time, the movement will not be symbolic,"" Zafar said. ""It will be decisive. And the chairman will lead it from his prison cell.""
PTI insiders say the final contours of the protest strategy will be shaped in the coming days.
Observers note that whether Khan's call translates into sustained public mobilisation remains to be seen, especially in a political climate where opposition space has been sharply curtailed.

'India intensifying proxy terrorism',"US
Premier Shehbaz visits Command and Staff College in Quetta
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday accused India of stepping up a proxy terrorism campaign inside Pakistan following its defeat in Marka-e-Haq, vowing that what he called Fitna al Hindustan would be defeated by the Pakistani nation.
During his address to the faculty and graduating officers at the Command and Staff College Quetta, the prime minister accused India of resorting to indirect aggression after suffering setbacks in recent engagements.
He was referring to India's use of force, which was met with a precise military response under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, targeting Indian air assets, ammunition depots, and missile bases along and beyond the Line of Control. This operation was part of the broader Marka-e-Haq campaign, conducted from May 7 to May 10.
He reaffirmed that Pakistan's armed forces, backed by the full support of the nation, are prepared to meet every challenge to the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
""The Pakistani nation is united. With our faith, determination, and strength, we will defeat every conspiracy hatched by India and its proxies,"" the Prime Minister said.
PM Shehbaz lauded the performance of the armed forces during Bunyanum Marsoos, calling their conduct exemplary and a source of national pride. He praised the military's professionalism, bravery, and sacrifices, stating that their dedication had earned the highest respect of the nation.
The prime minister reiterated the government's full support to the armed forces in fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities and defending Pakistan against all threats.

PM amenable to talks with 'misled people' in Balochistan,"US
Vows to address grievances 'in spirit of brotherhood'; Says we all must defeat designs of bloodthirsty terrorists
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said he is willing to sit across the table with ""those who have been misled ... who have been led astray"" in Balochistan, as he pledged to deliver ""social and economic justice"" to the people of the province, which has been trapped in a spiral of deadly violence since 2006.
""We must strive to win back the people who were misled [by terrorists] onto the wrong track. If there are any grievances, they should be resolved through dialogue in the spirit of brotherhood,"" he said, referring to chronic concerns in the dirt-poor province that have been exploited by Baloch terrorist groups to promote their violent narrative.
The prime minister was addressing a grand jirga in Quetta on Saturday, which brought together tribal elders, lawmakers and key stakeholders for consultations focused on security and development.
Field Marshal Chief of Army Staff Syed Asim Munir, Balochistan's Acting Governor Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti and high-ranking military and civil officials were also present.
Expressing gratitude for the warm welcome he received, the prime minister described Balochistan as ""a beautiful province of brave people and the heart of Pakistan"".
Terrorist violence has surged in recent months, which civil and military officials have attributed to Indian interference. ""The bloodthirsty terrorists, who are against the progress and prosperity of Pakistan, are carrying out heinous acts of terrorism at the behest of foreign elements,"" the premier said, alluding to India.
""They must be stopped. We all must defeat their nefarious designs. If there are shortcomings in our response, these could be addressed with your guidance,"" he told the jirga participants.
He reiterated that ""all provinces are like brothers and will equally share the resources of the country,"" adding that the federal government was allocating Rs70 billion for a solarisation project in Balochistan.
Similarly, Rs150 billion will be directed towards the construction of the N-25 highway, commonly referred to as the ""bloody highway"" due to its perilous condition. The funds will be drawn from the amount being saved after the drop in international petroleum prices.
The prime minister further announced that Rs1,000 billion will be allocated to the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) this year, with 25 per cent — or Rs250 billion — earmarked for Balochistan.
He assured that every penny of the share, which he termed the ""right of the people of Balochistan,"" would be spent transparently for the province's progress and prosperity.
The prime minister also recalled that Punjab had agreed to give part of its share from the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award to Balochistan in view of its development needs, as the province is the largest in terms of area.
""In today's value, the funds diverted to Balochistan amount to Rs160 billion,"" he explained.
The NFC award was signed in Lahore in 2010 after three days of discussions among the national leadership, including President Asif Ali Zardari, then prime minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and Nawaz Sharif, he added.
He said that during Nawaz Sharif's tenure as prime minister, many development projects were undertaken in Balochistan and President Zardari had initiated the Aghaz-e-Haqooq-e-Balochistan package.
Talking about the recent conflict with India, Premier Shehbaz said that on the nights between May 6 and 7 and May 10, India attacked Pakistan, but with the grace of Allah, the armed forces bravely defeated the enemy, who will remember its defeat forever. He thanked the people of Pakistan for showing unity and standing shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan Army during the conflict.
""As the prime minister, I was witness to all the events of the short-duration war,"" he said, adding that ""as a brave and sagacious leader, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir led Pakistan armed forces to a victory against India and made the nation proud.""
He said that the triumph over India was akin to avenging the events of 1971. ""Now the enemy is scared and Pakistan's friendly countries are more confident after Pakistan's military victory over India,"" he claimed.

Yates snatches pink jersey from Del Toro,"US
He pulled off the overall lead in penultimate Giro stage
Simon Yates rode a stage for the ages when he stormed into the overall lead of the Giro d'Italia on Saturday as the Visma-Lease a Bike rider erased overall leader Isaac Del Toro's lead to take the pink jersey on the penultimate stage of the race.
The stage was won by Australian Chris Harper of Jayco-AlUla, who was part of a 31-rider breakaway before he rode solo to the finish to claim a first Grand Tour stage win, while Alessandro Verre was second, nearly two minutes behind.
But all eyes were on Yates as he finished third to flip the general classification battle and take the overall lead in a stage that will go down in cycling history as one of the greatest ever witnessed on the Grand Tour.
Having started the day more than a minute behind Del Toro, Yates now holds a commanding lead of three minutes and 56 seconds while Richard Carapaz is a further 47 seconds behind.
Yates will now wear the pink jersey at what is expected to be his coronation in Rome in Sunday's final flat stage.
On the 205 km ride from Verres to Sestriere where riders gained 4,500 metres in altitude in total, it was Carapaz or Yates who had to make a move if they were to take the pink jersey from Del Toro.
The stage is famous for its Colle delle Finestre climb, one of the hardest climbs on the continent which is 18 km long, of which the final eight kilometres are in the gravel before they approach the ski resort of Sestriere.
Redemption for Yates
In 2018, Yates saw his dreams of winning the Giro crumble on the Colle delle Finestre when Chris Froome's attack left him far behind, but this time he may well have won it by redeeming himself on the iconic climb.
Carapaz first attacked on the lower slopes, but Del Toro followed suit as Yates was left behind. But the Briton chased them down and then attacked himself, with the other two doggedly holding on as they swapped positions.
However, a fourth attack from Yates saw him commit to it as he put some distance between himself and the GC contenders as he approached the gravel section.
Del Toro initially played it cool having started the day 81 seconds ahead of Yates, but as the Briton went across the summit, he had built a lead of a minute and 40 seconds.
Del Toro did not respond even as the cavalry arrived in the form of Wout van Aert, who joined his teammate Yates on the descent to lend his support to the Briton's quest for the pink jersey.
With five kilometres left, Van Aert slowed down but that was all the help Yates needed as he powered to the finish while Del Toro seemed to have given up on chasing him down.
Earlier, Nicolas Prodhomme claimed the first Grand Tour stage win of his career when he rode solo to victory on stage 19 of the Giro d'Italia on Friday, while Mexico's pink jersey holder Isaac Del Toro came second to extend his overall lead.
On their penultimate day in the mountains, the riders faced a brutal 166 km ride from Biella to Champoluc with five classified climbs and a total elevation gain of nearly 5,000 metres.
Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale's Prodhomme broke free on the fourth climb to take the lead and eventually the victory to become the first Frenchman to win a Giro stage this year.
""I've worked a lot for this Giro d'Italia. I didn't want to compete for the GC (general classification), I wanted to try and win a stage. I've waited for long for this win to come,"" Prodhomme said.
""I won my first race three weeks ago (on the Tour of the Alps) but to win at the Giro d'Italia makes me very happy. It's a beautiful day."" REUETRS

Reset with Kabul,"US
The biggest beneficiaries of improved ties with Pakistan and other countries are the long-suffering Afghan people.
Pakistan's relationship with the Taliban government in Afghanistan appears to be on the mend after hitting its lowest point a few months ago. While several points of contention remain between the two countries, Afghanistan appears to have put sincere efforts into ensuring that its soil was not used against Pakistan during the recent tensions with India.
To supplant India, China also appeared in the picture with offers of trade and infrastructure development to the Taliban. In return, Beijing's main demand has been for the Taliban government to make peace, or at least play friendly, with Islamabad.
Since the recent trilateral forum in Kabul, Pakistan and Afghanistan have made significant efforts to publically downplay their differences and make statements to express interest in improving relations.
Most notably, after years of refusing to take stern action against the TTP, citing their many ideological similarities, the Afghan Taliban have effectively told their 'guests' that their self-proclaimed jihad against Pakistan is illegitimate because only the emir can issue a call for jihad, and in Afghanistan, the emir is the Taliban's supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.
The Taliban government is also learnt to have made sincere efforts - perhaps for the first time since retaking power - to capture and detain anti-Pakistan terrorists, including Afghan nationals.
All of these moves are not occurring in a vacuum. After years of official isolation, several countries have been moving towards reopening diplomatic ties with the Afghan government, including through the appointment of ambassadors and the reopening of embassies.
While many are still dragging their feet or formally recognising the Taliban government, the appointment of an ambassador is de facto recognition, as the envoy must present their credentials to the host nation's head of state.
But official or not, the biggest beneficiaries of improved ties with Pakistan and other countries are the long-suffering Afghan people.

Rising Islamophobia in India alarming: FO,"US
Islamabad urges Delhi to ensure rights of all citizens
Pakistan on Saturday expressed deep concern over the growing number of Islamophobic incidents across India and warned that the deliberate incitement of religious hatred for political or ideological purposes violates India's international human rights obligations.
Responding to media queries, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan, in a statement, said Pakistan strongly condemned the targeting of Muslims through hate speech, discriminatory policies, and acts of violence, reportedly carried out with the complicity or silence of Indian authorities.
""Pakistan calls upon the Indian government to uphold the rights and safety of all its citizens, regardless of faith,"" the spokesperson said, warning that the deliberate incitement of religious hatred for political or ideological purposes was in violation of India's international human rights obligations.
Khan added that such actions, at a time when restraint and reconciliation are most needed, further undermine prospects for communal harmony and regional stability.
The statement comes amid heightened tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours following New Delhi's accusations — leveled without evidence — linking Islamabad to the Pahalgam attack in IIOJK. The Pakistani government has strongly rejected the allegations.
Human rights organisations, including the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), have recorded at least 21 incidents of anti-Muslim violence across India in the days following the attack. These include physical assaults on Kashmiri Muslims, hate speeches at public rallies, and reported calls for the expulsion of Muslim students from hostels.
The situation has been further inflamed by the rise of incendiary music aligned with Hindutva ideology. Songs disseminated widely through platforms like YouTube and WhatsApp have been accused of inciting hatred against Muslims. One such song, Pehle Dharam Pocha (""They Asked About Religion First""), surfaced shortly after the Pahalgam incident, accusing Indian Muslims of conspiring against Hindus. It has garnered over 140,000 views in less than a week.
Other tracks such as Ab Ek Nahi Huye Toh Kat Jaaoge (""If You Don't Unite Now You Will Be Slaughtered"") and Jaago Hindu Jaago (""Wake Up, Hindus"") have called on Hindus to identify ""traitors within the country""a phrase widely seen as a veiled reference to Muslims.
In parallel with the online hate campaign, authorities in Gujarat reportedly demolished around 2,000 huts, which officials claimed were illegally occupied by undocumented migrants from Bangladesh. Activists, however, argue that the demolitions are part of a broader pattern of systemic discrimination aimed at portraying Indian Muslims as ""outsiders"".

Two men were shot dead by opponents in a revenge attack on Khumra Road. The police initiated an investigation after taking possession of the bodies and transferring them to a hospital.
Shabbir and Imran alias Arshad were riding a motorcycle to a village near Chak No. 37/GB on Jhumra Road when four armed men on two motorbikes approached them and opened fire from behind. Both victims succumbed to bullet injuries at the spot.
Jaranwala police officials reached the site after the incident and collected evidence along with a forensics team.
The police said they had initiated a search for the attackers. CPO Sahibzada Bilal Umar sought a detailed report on the incident from the Jaranwala SP. He ordered the formation of teams to immediately arrest the suspected murderers.
Meanwhile, the police arrested a man on the suspicion of murdering a citizen last week.
The suspect turned out to be the victim's stepfather who had allegedly committed the crime due to a domestic dispute.
According Madina Town SSP Saad Arshad, an investigation team led by Peoples Colony SHO Rana Maghfoor Ahmad Khan tracked down the suspect, Amanullah, with the help of technical resources.
During interrogation, Amanullah confessed to the crime, stating that he had killed his stepson, Abdullah, due to domestic issues.

'Special relief in power tariff still in place',"US
Energy Ministry says cost of power generation increasing
A special relief involving a Rs7.41 per unit reduction in electricity price, as announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, is still in effect despite a rising cost of electricity.
According to a statement issued on Saturday by the Ministry of Energy, the cost of electricity generation is increasing due to the lowest hydropower generation in the country's history in recent months and the reliance on expensive power plants running on alternative fuels.
""In view of this decline in hydropower production, the Ministry of Energy has issued directives to all provincial governments and relevant federal ministries to enforce Energy Efficient Building Codes, so that electricity bills can be reduced during periods of extreme heat and cold.""
In addition, it said, the government is preparing to offer energy-efficient fans — which consume up to 70% less electricity — on easy interest-free installments, which will help in replacing old fans and significantly lowering electricity bills.
Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik on Friday stated that power-generating companies are not utilizing imported gas as per agreements and resultantly expensive gas is being sold to domestic consumers at subsidized rates, leading to a rise in circular debt.
""The power companies are violating their agreements, which is increasing the liabilities of the national gas importing companies,"" said Malik, while speaking to the media at the head office of the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC).
Malik highlighted that the government's success in reducing electricity prices and maintaining current petrol and diesel prices is a significant achievement. However, relief in the electricity sector has become a burden on the petroleum sector.

The initiative comes at a time when Pakistan's energy sector faces high costs, volatility and an overreliance on imported fossil fuels, which account for nearly 60 per cent of the country's energy supply. Outdated infrastructure, inefficient management and transmission bottlenecks have contributed to persistent power shortages and a growing circular debt crisis, issues that the roadmap aims to address while planning for future growth, sustainability and climate resilience.

PSX rises modestly amid delay in budget,"GB
KSE-100 rebounds 0.49% WoW as local buyers absorb foreign selling
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a volatile trading week as investors remained cautious ahead of the FY26 budget announcement, now rescheduled for June 10, 2025, amid ongoing IMF negotiations.
Despite initial uncertainty, the KSE-100 index managed to post a modest weekly gain of 0.49%, closing at 119,691 points, supported by positive developments on the economic front including China's pledge to refinance $3.7 billion in commercial loans and a successful T-bill auction that raised Rs772 billion. However, foreign investors continued to offload their positions, with net outflows of $5.65 million, while local participants stepped in to absorb the selling pressure.
On a day-on-day basis, the PSX started the week on a bearish note on Monday as the KSE-100 index fell 882 points, or 0.74%, settling at 118,221 over investor caution ahead of the federal budget and the delay in IMF's approval of circular debt settlement plan.
On Tuesday, the market closed modestly higher with a gain of 112 points as the index oscillated in a narrow band throughout the day. Investors were wary ahead of the budget presentation, although cement stocks rose, driven by hopes for announcement of a real estate package. The bourse opened with renewed vigour on Thursday following a day's closure to mark Youm-e-Takbeer, which reflected the nation's nuclear achievements. The KSE-100 posted a notable rise of 638 points.
Finally, the PSX closed the week on a bullish note on Friday, lifted by strong gains in blue-chip oil, banking and fertiliser stocks amid growing optimism about the upcoming budget measures. The index surged 720 points and settled at 119,691.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote that the KSE-100 index displayed mixed trends throughout the week, beginning on a negative note due to uncertainties surrounding the budget rollout. On the economic front, China committed to refinancing $3.7 billion of commercial loans for Pakistan.
Moreover, Nepra approved K-Electric's multi-year tariff at Rs39.9/unit and a 14% USD-based return on equity. The government successfully raised Rs772 billion through a T-bill auction, exceeding its target of Rs650 billion. Cut-off yields declined across all tenors, falling by 9 to 15 basis points (bps). The State Bank's reserves climbed up by $70 million to $11.5 billion. The market closed at 119,691, depicting a rise of 588 points, or 0.49% week-on-week (WoW), AHL said.
Sector-wise, the positive contribution came from cement (317 points), fertiliser (249 points), power generation and distribution (148 points), commercial banks (84 points) and refinery (80 points).

The week commenced with the IMF concluding its visit to Pakistan without reaching an agreement on certain budget items, leading the government to reschedule the budget presentation to June 10, 2025, he said. Virtual negotiations were continuing, with both sides focusing on measures to enhance tax revenues and curtail expenditures. Meanwhile, Hussain added, China reaffirmed its commitment to refinancing $3.7 billion in commercial loans denominated in renminbi before the end of June. In other news, the State Bank's net buying from currency markets reached $223 million in February 2025 to further strengthen foreign exchange reserves, bringing the cumulative purchases to $5.9 billion during 8MFY25.

Gary Marcus proposes an alternative to AI models,"US
Scientist suggests approach based on logic
Two and a half years since ChatGPT rocked the world, scientist and writer Gary Marcus still remains generative artificial intelligence's great skeptic, playing a counter-narrative to Silicon Valley's AI true believers.
Marcus became a prominent figure of the AI revolution in 2023, when he sat beside OpenAI chief Sam Altman at a Senate hearing in Washington as both men urged politicians to take the technology seriously and consider regulation.
Much has changed since then. Altman has abandoned his calls for caution, instead teaming up with Japan's SoftBank and funds in the Middle East to propel his company to sky-high valuations as he tries to make ChatGPT the next era-defining tech behemoth.
""Sam's not getting money anymore from the Silicon Valley establishment,"" and his seeking funding from abroad is a sign of ""desperation,"" Marcus told AFP on the sidelines of the Web Summit in Vancouver, Canada.
Marcus's criticism centers on a fundamental belief: generative AI, the predictive technology that churns out seemingly human-level content, is simply too flawed to be transformative.
The large language models (LLMs) that power these capabilities are inherently broken, he argues, and will never deliver on Silicon Valley's grand promises.
""I'm skeptical of AI as it is currently practiced,"" he said. ""I think AI could have tremendous value, but LLMs are not the way there. And I think the companies running it are not mostly the best people in the world.""
The optimism that humanity stands on the cusp of achieving super intelligence or artificial general intelligence (AGI) technology that could match and even surpass human capability, has driven OpenAI's valuation to $300 billion, unprecedented levels for a startup, with Elon Musk's xAI racing to keep pace.
Yet for all the hype, the practical gains remain limited.
The technology excels mainly at coding assistance and text generation. AI-created images, while often entertaining, serve primarily as memes or deepfakes, offering little obvious benefit to society or business.
Marcus, a longtime New York University professor, champions a fundamentally different approach to building AI - one he believes might actually achieve human-level intelligence in ways that current generative AI never will.
""One consequence of going all-in on LLMs is that any alternative approach that might be better gets starved out,"" he explained, pointing out the tunnel vision of the LLMs.
'Right answers matter'
Instead, Marcus advocates for neurosymbolic AI, an approach that attempts to rebuild human logic artificially rather than simply training computer models on vast datasets, as is done with ChatGPT and similar products like Google's Gemini or Anthropic's Claude.
He dismisses fears that generative AI will eliminate white-collar jobs, citing a simple reality: ""There are too many white-collar jobs where getting the right answer actually matters.""
This points to AI's most persistent problem: hallucinations, the technology's well-documented tendency to produce confident-sounding mistakes.
Even AI's strongest advocates acknowledge this flaw may be impossible to eliminate.
Marcus recalls a telling exchange from 2023 with LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman, a Silicon Valley heavyweight: ""He bet me any amount of money that hallucinations would go away in three months. I offered him $100,000 and he wouldn't take the bet.""
Looking ahead, Marcus warns of a darker consequence once investors realize generative AI's limitations. Companies like OpenAI will inevitably monetize their most valuable asset: user data.
""The people who put in all this money will want their returns, and I think that's leading them toward surveillance,"" he said, pointing to Orwellian risks for society. ""They have all this private data, so they can sell that as a consolation prize.""
Marcus acknowledges that generative AI will find useful applications in areas where occasional errors don't matter much.
""They're very useful for auto-complete on steroids: coding, brainstorming, and stuff like that,"" he said. ""But nobody's going to make much money off it because they're expensive to run, and everybody has the same product.""

US envoy says Hamas response to ceasefire proposal 'unacceptable',"JP
.
Hamas announced on Saturday that it had submitted its reply to a US-backed Gaza ceasefire proposal, but Washington's main negotiator almost immediately criticised the response as ""totally unacceptable"".
Hamas did not say it had accepted the proposal from US envoy Steve Witkoff, but a Hamas source told AFP the group's response was positive, while emphasising the need for a permanent ceasefire — long a sticking point for Israel.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed Witkoff's assessment that the response was ""unacceptable"", accusing Hamas of clinging ""to its rejectionism"".
Israel on Friday warned Hamas to either accept the deal and free the hostages held in Gaza ""or be annihilated"".
In a statement on Saturday, Hamas said it had ""submitted its response... to the mediating parties"".
""As part of this agreement, 10 living prisoners of the occupation held by the resistance will be released, in addition to the return of 18 bodies, in exchange for an agreed-upon number of Palestinian prisoners,"" it added.
A source within the group's political bureau said it had offered ""a positive response to Witkoff, but with emphasis on guaranteeing a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal"" from the Gaza Strip.
Witkoff later said the response was ""totally unacceptable and only takes us backward"", urging the group to ""accept the framework proposal we put forward"".
""That is the only way we can close a 60-day ceasefire deal in the coming days in which half of the living hostages and half of those who are deceased will come home to their families and in which we can have... substantive negotiations in good-faith to try to reach a permanent ceasefire,"" he added in a post on X.
Hamas has long maintained that any deal should lay out a pathway to a permanent end to the war.
But Israel has balked at that prospect, insisting on the need to destroy the group to prevent a repeat of the October 2023 attack that sparked the war.
It recently stepped up its campaign in Gaza in a bid to defeat Hamas.
""While Israel has agreed to the updated Witkoff framework for the release of our hostages, Hamas continues to cling to its rejectionism,"" Netanyahu's office said in a statement, adding the group's reply was ""unacceptable and sets the process back"".
""Israel will continue its efforts to bring our hostages home and to defeat Hamas.""
A breakthrough in negotiations has been elusive ever since a previous ceasefire fell apart on March 18 with the resumption of Israeli operations.
US President Donald Trump had said on Friday that the parties were ""very close to an agreement"".
Two sources close to the negotiations said Witkoff's proposal involved a 60-day truce, potentially extendable to 70 days.
It would include the release of five living hostages and nine bodies in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners during the first week, followed by a second exchange the following week, the sources said.
Of the 251 hostages taken during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack, 57 remain in Gaza, including 34 the Israeli military says are dead.

Banks delay import payments,"US
Rising debt repayments, IMF targets pressure foreign exchange markets
Commercial banks have once again started delaying import-related payments due to the limited availability of foreign currency, caused by major foreign debt repayments due before the end of June and the need to meet the reserves-related condition set by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The situation warrants that the central bank either completely stop purchasing foreign currency from the markets or drastically reduce it to improve the supply of dollars, according to background discussions with multiple bankers. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday did not provide an official version on the matter.
Banking and market sources told The Express Tribune that some major and small banks were delaying import-related payments by two to three weeks, particularly in cases of open-account and contractual imports. The banks were also providing dollars for the clearance of letters of credit (LCs) to some major importers at rates higher than the interbank rate, they added.
Because of the situation, the spread between the interbank and open market has started widening, and a few banks have again been compelled to ration the provisioning of dollars. The interbank rate was over Rs282 to a dollar, while in the open market the dollar was available close to Rs285, said banking and currency market sources.
The situation is not as bad as the 2022 crisis, and it is high time that the central bank took notice to avoid any speculation in the market, said a senior executive of a private bank whose institution was also facing the challenge of ensuring sufficient dollar provision for import payments.
Concerned authorities said on condition of anonymity that the local currency did come under pressure in both open and interbank markets. However, they said that it was a temporary phenomenon and would end soon.
Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Pak Arab Refinery Limited (PARCO) were also facing issues in getting the right price of the dollar for making payments against their imports. The sources said that PSO paid about Rs3 higher for its latest import payment compared to the previous contract. This would translate into a higher petrol price for consumers.
Pakistan is scheduled to make $2.4 billion in foreign commercial debt repayments to China next month, in addition to payments to some other multilateral lenders. The foreign exchange reserves stand at $11.5 billion, which is not enough to make these payments and at the same time retain reserves in double digits.
The IMF has also further tightened the end-June Net International Reserves (NIR) target to negative $7.5 billiona further tightening of $1.1 billion compared to the target agreed upon in September last year.
To meet these targets and foreign debt repayments, the central bank is still purchasing dollars from the market.
The end-March negative NIR target was $10.2 billion, which means the central bank needs an additional $2.7 billion cushion just to meet the end-June target, according to the IMF report.
Another senior executive at a bank said that export and remittance proceeds were sufficient to cover imports, but the challenge lay with the financial account, which was putting pressure on the exchange rate. He said the central bank should refrain from buying dollars for a few weeks to ease market conditions.
Representatives of the banking industry have already brought the issue of the emerging shortage of foreign currency to the attention of the central bank, according to those privy to the discussions.
Despite the IMF programme, Pakistan has not received enough foreign loans this time. Central Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad said a few months ago that the SBP had bought over $9 billion from the local market in 2024 to build reserves.
The SBP spokesperson did not respond to questions about the reasons behind the recent pressure on the rupee-dollar parity, or whether there was a backlog of about $1 billion in deferred import-related payments due to the dollar shortage.
He also did not respond to questions regarding the increasing spread between the interbank and open market rates or the strategy the central bank is adopting to address the situation.
The buying of dollars from the market has helped reduce foreign debt by $800 million during the first nine months of this fiscal year. A stable rupee has also played a major role in bringing down the inflation rate to low single digits. However, exporters complain that tight control over the dollar price is eroding their competitive edge, and they argue that market forces should be allowed to play their role.
There is also a seasonal increase in demand for foreign currency due to Hajj, which central bank authorities expect will now subside.

Govt unveils maritime chamber,"PL
Chaudhry says MCCI to unify maritime sectors, push sustainable growth as climate threats rise in Global South
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, has announced the establishment of the Maritime Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) to promote the blue economy and enhance environmental sustainability across Pakistan's maritime sector.
Speaking at the Pakistan Business Council Forum on Saturday, according to an official statement, the minister stressed the urgent need to align maritime development with sustainability goals, particularly in the context of increasing climate-related challenges in the Global South.
He pointed out that Pakistan's coastal regions are particularly vulnerable to rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and environmental degradation, underscoring the necessity of a dedicated platform to drive eco-conscious policymaking.
The minister stated that the MCCI will offer a specialised institutional framework to unify stakeholders from across the maritime spectrum, including ports, shipping, logistics, fisheries, and marine services.
""This chamber will not only support investment and innovation in the maritime sector but also prioritise sustainability at ports, promote green technologies, and foster carbon reduction strategies,"" said Chaudhry, as per the statement. He reiterated the government's commitment to public-private partnerships and invited collaboration with environmental experts, industry leaders, and civil society to ensure that maritime growth supports both national and international climate objectives.
Chaudhry also reassured the business community that their concerns are being acknowledged and addressed, citing active coordination with the chief minister of Sindh to ensure cohesive and integrated action across all levels of governance.
Additionally, the maritime minister outlined the ministry's strategic roadmap for modernising Pakistan's port infrastructure. The focus areas include digitalisation, efficient cargo handling, and embedding environmental sustainability in port operations. The Pakistan Business Council expressed strong support for the initiative, recognising the establishment of the MCCI as a significant step toward building a climate-resilient and economically dynamic maritime economy, the statement added.

Govt considers levy on gasoline-powered cars to promote EVs,"PK
Decides to establish 'EV Fund' to support growth of electric transportation
The federal government is likely to impose a five-year levy on vehicles powered by petrol and diesel in the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26 budget to promote electric vehicles (EVs) and has decided to establish an EV Fund to support the transition toward electric mobility.
Sources said that if approved and implemented, this levy could generate annual revenue of Rs25-30 billion, amounting to Rs125-150 billion over the next five years. The collected revenue would be used to finance the new five-year Electric Vehicle Policy for 2026-30 and would be imposed on both imported and locally manufactured petrol and diesel driven vehicles.
Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has raised concerns about the government's proposal to provide idle electricity for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence operations, according to sources in the Finance Ministry.
The IMF has sought an explanation for not being consulted on the use of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI, as well as on electricity tariffs. A virtual discussion is scheduled with the IMF delegation specifically regarding electricity supply for Bitcoin mining.
The IMF has also asked for clarification on the allocation of electricity for cryptocurrency operations, particularly since crypto remains unregulated in Pakistan.
The IMF has insisted that all decisions under the loan programme be made with prior consultation. Sources confirm that Pakistan's economic team is facing tough questions during budget negotiations, and further hard discussions with the IMF regarding electricity supply initiatives are anticipated.
According to sources, many key economic targets in the budget proposals have already been finalised in consultation with the IMF, while discussions on other areas are ongoing and expected to conclude in the coming days. It has also been proposed to offer incentives for the local manufacturing of laptop and smartphone batteries and chargers.
Sources added that virtual consultations with the global lender are ongoing regarding budget proposals for the upcoming fiscal year, with an outcome expected soon. The draft budget will likely be finalised next week.
Both Pakistan and the IMF have agreed to continue virtual talks on all outstanding matters.
In the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26, the government is likely to set a GDP target of 4.2%, an inflation target of 7.5%, an agricultural growth target of 4.5%, an industrial growth target of 4.4%, and a services sector growth target of 4%.
The Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) will convene on June 2 to finalise the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) and the annual development plans. Later that same week, a key meeting of the National Economic Council (NEC), chaired by the prime minister, will be held where approval will be sought for the PSDP, annual development plans, and the Medium-Term Budgetary Framework proposed by the APCC. If adjustments or increases in funding for development projects are required, the NEC will approve them.
The Economic Survey, detailing the performance of the current fiscal year, will be released on June 9. The federal budget will be presented in parliament the following day, June 10, after its approval by the federal cabinet in a special session.

Judge Amjad Ali Shah of the Anti-Terrorism Court has taken serious notice of the alleged fake police encounter in the Rawat area, where a young man, Waheed alias Waheedi, was allegedly killed two days ago.
The judge issued show-cause notices for contempt of court to two police inspectors, questioning why the judiciary was used to provide cover for what appears to be an extrajudicial killing.
The court also questioned why the two officers, reportedly backed by the city police officer (CPO) and SP Operations, should not face criminal proceedings for their involvement.
The judge asked why legal warrants were obtained if the actual intent was to kill the suspect in a staged encounter. He warned that the use of court authority to legitimise such killings would not be tolerated.

Sybil creates history for Pakistan,"US
She wins gold medal at Asian Weightlifting Masters Championship on her debut
Powerlifter-turned-weightlifter Sybil Sohail became the first Pakistani woman to win the gold medal at the Asian Weightlifting Masters Championship in Doha, Qatar.
This was also the Commonwealth Powerlifting Champion Sybil's international debut at a weightlifting event.
The 31-year-old athlete has always dreamed of raising the Pakistani flag at the Asian championship and it was an aim she had set for herself after she became the Asian Commonwealth Powerlifting and Commonwealth Powerlifting champion last year.
""I aim to make my country proud, make my family proud, we have sacrificed a lot for the sport, but I need to make sure that all of that effort and dedication pays off,"" Sybil told this correspondent from Doha.
She was competing in the 59kg category and she lifted a total of 95kg to get her gold. She lifted 40kg in snatch while she had a more solid performance in clean and jerk with a 55kg finish.
Sybil is the eldest of the powerlifting and weightlifting sisters, Twinkle Sohail, Veronika Sohail, and Mariam Sohail.
She and her sisters created a unique record at the Commonwealth Powerlifting Championships last year when they collectively grabbed 15 gold medals.
She alone won six out of those 15.
The sisters belong to the Christian community in Lahore and they have been a shining example for the nation that rarely sees any athletes coming forward from minority groups.
However, Sybil credits Twinkle for introducing her to the sport and thanks her coach Rashed Malik for guiding all four of them and training them in Lahore at their club which is at the Punjab University grounds.
""Sybil has won so many accolades for Pakistan in powerlifting, but she had never competed in weightlifting, and for her personally it was her debut at an international weightlifting event as well, it was a dream for her because she was always charmed with weightlifting,"" said Twinkle who also coached Sybil often while training together told this correspondent.
""This is huge, she has won her gold medal on her debut.""
'Bitter experiences fuel our ambition to win medals'
Twinkle shared a bitter experience of Sybil's from 2016, which resulted in her missing out on the trials for the national weightlifting squad.
""She had a rough experience in 2016, there were trials for the team that was meant to compete in the South Asian Games weightlifting. But Sybil couldn't go to compete in them because she had an exam that same day. She knew if she competed in them she would have secured a spot.
""So since 2016, this has been a wish of hers that she finally fulfilled now. It took her nine years to achieve what she really wanted.""
Twinkle added that Sybil's feat brings an immense sense of pride to her and her family. Twinkle says that she understands Sybil's emotions completely.
""I started sports in my family, if I reflect on my own experience, there was a time when I was selected to go to Nepal for a competition in 2019. Unfortunately, at the time when Imran Khan's government was at the helm of affairs, I found out that the government only had the funds for only five players, my name was in sixth place on that list, and I had a silver medal to my name, but I couldn't compete in that event.
""So we fuel our ambition with these disappointments. These feelings are really beyond explanation but they are strong and we use them to drive us to achieve bigger goals and more medals.
""Hopefully I would make my name in weightlifting too,"" concluded Twinkle.
Lifting weights is good for women
Sybil's achievements and her dedication to powerlifting and weightlifting shows that she is changing the perception of society -- one day and one medal at a time.
""It is actually a misconception that weightlifting is bad for women, and it disrupts the hormones and creates complications for us when it comes to having children and starting families,"" Sybil explained. ""It is actually healthy to build the muscles and we need these exercises and weight training to stay strong.
""There are so many Pakistani powerlifters and weightlifters I know who were very active in the sport and then went on to have children.""

'Marry your best friend',"QA
Nadia Jamil waited 15 years for her soulmate
In a world of swipe-right love and viral divorces, leave it to the ever-wise and ever-real Nadia Jamil to remind us what enduring romance actually looks like. On Friday, the actor, activist, and all-around icon dropped a heartfelt post on X (formerly Twitter) that read like a Bollywood screenplay, but with more soul, fewer dance numbers, and a whole lot of wisdom.
""We were 14 and 15,"" she began, immediately pulling readers into a teenage love story that almost didn't survive family disapproval, long-distance years, and even a global pandemic. She paints the early contrast: she, an ""emotional romantic artist"" from a liberal home; he, a ""stoic finance whizz kid"" from a conservative background. All parents were against it. But love had other plans.
Nadia waited to marry her husband for fifteen years, longer than most celebrity marriages. When the two finally tied the knot, their wedding marked the start of a relationship built on resilience, shared experiences, and gradual growth.
""The marriage in itself is such a story,"" she wrote. ""It's had its ups and its downs. We are both very strong personalities, but we both held on.""
Nadia, in her trademark mix of honesty and grace, doesn't shy away from the hard bits. She talks about the distance that crept in when she moved to Cambridge with the kids and he stayed in Lahore to care for family. She shares how their bond was tested by cancer, grief, financial loss, and parenting across continents. But also how those very battles made them grow together.
According to Nadia, the secret is not just love but respect; it's knowing when to hold space for each other. It's flexibility, emotional growth, and the quiet power of honouring your partner's evolution.
And yes, there's a happy ending (and a new beginning): their eldest son is now all set to get married, and Nadia is officially a mother-in-law now, to a ""fantastic young woman,"" she beamed.
As she coaches other couples now, Nadia sees echoes of her own story in theirs. And her biggest piece of advice is to marry your best friend, the one who grows with you, the one who learns with you, the one who stays, especially when things get hard.

Mentors refuse to quit after tourney scrapped,"DE
Four mentors refuse to quit, want PCB to pay Rs 20m in compensation
Mentors appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for last year's Champions Cup are refusing to step down despite their roles being declared redundant. While Shoaib Malik has resigned voluntarily, the remaining four — Misbah-ul-Haq, Saqlain Mushtaq, Sarfaraz Ahmed, and Waqar Younis — are holding out, potentially forcing the PCB to pay Rs 20 million in compensation.
Details have emerged that the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) had appointed five mentors for the Champions Cup in August last year. These included Misbah-ul-Haq, Saqlain Mushtaq, Sarfaraz Ahmed, Shoaib Malik, and Waqar Younis. From the beginning, their hefty monthly salary of Rs 5 million each had been a topic of debate.
Recently, the PCB decided to scrap the Champions Cup due to unsatisfactory results and replace it with the Pentangular Cup. Logically, this also meant the mentors were no longer needed. Sensing the inevitable, Shoaib Malik resigned voluntarily, but the remaining four have maintained silence.
Sources say some of them are deliberately waiting to be officially dismissed so they can claim compensationfour months' salary amounting to Rs 20 million as per their contracts. A few days ago, the PCB unofficially conveyed through informal channels that their services were no longer required, expecting they might resign on their own. However, since that hasn't happened, the board may be forced to explore other options.
Sources further revealed that during their job interviews, these mentors had claimed they were forgoing lucrative opportunities — coaching gigs, TV shows, commentary, and league contracts — to serve the nation. That emotional pitch helped them secure record-breaking salaries. Ironically, many of them continued with their other engagements despite being appointed by the board.
After only a few months of paying hefty salaries, the authorities realized the initiative wasn't yielding the expected benefits. Reportedly, some mentors have even warned the PCB that if removed, they would launch criticism campaigns on media.

Authorities freeze uplift funds for Pindi,"US
Projects under 80 per cent completion have also been halted.
With the federal budget for 2025-26 approaching, development funds for all six districts of Rawalpindi Division have been frozen.
The Local Government Department, including Rawalpindi District Council, has been directed to immediately return unutilised development funds to the Ministry of Finance.
All development schemes that have not yet commenced have been categorised as ""lapsed funds,"" with an immediate ban placed on any expenditures. Only schemes that are over 80 per cent complete are allowed to use their allocated funds.
Projects under 80 per cent completion have also been halted.
As a result of the freeze and anticipated tax hikes in the upcoming budget, the estimated cost of nearly 350 halted small and large development schemes is expected to increase by 20-25 per cent. Throughout the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25, Rawalpindi District Council failed to initiate any major development project due to severe financial constraints.
With the suspension of funds, development work in all six districts — Rawalpindi, Attock, Jhelum, Chakwal, Talagang, and Murree — has come to a standstill for 90 days.
Resumption of work is expected by late August or early September, once new funds are released.

Unprecedented attack raises alarm over law and order in Sindh
In a first, an incumbent district and sessions judge has come under an armed assault as Larkana and Sukkur divisions witness aggravation in the already poor law and order situation. The squad of Larkana district court's top judge Simkan Hussain Mughal was attacked by unknown armed men as it passed through Tando Masti area of Khairpur district in the wee hours of Saturday.
Although the judge survived unscathed, a policeman was martyred and two cops were injured in the attack. The police, as far as their public statements are concerned, are still in the dark about the assailants and their motive. The incident has drawn widespread condemnation from across the country.
The injured Head Constable Iqbal Ahmed Malano narrated the incident to the media telling that they had crossed Tando Masti toll plaza by five to seven kilometres when they became fenced in by sudden indiscriminate firing. ""It felt as if the bullets were being fired from both sides of the road,"" he recalled.
The martyred policeman, Maqbool Ahmed Shaikh, died in front of him as both of them were sitting in the same police mobile van.
The judge was returning to Larkana from Sukkur where he attended a reception hosted by SHCBA in honour of the acting Chief Justice.
Malano said,""The firing was so intense that we could barely load chambers of our guns. We could not even count the attackers if they were five or eight or 10."" The martyred cop Shaikh, 48, was laid to rest in Larkana after his funeral which was offered in the police headquarters.
Talking to the media DIG Sukkur Faisal Abdullah Chachar disclosed that the police neither knew the assailants nor the motive. However, he said that raids have been carried out in the villages near the place of the attack and many suspects have been detained for interrogation. Some police sources claim that between 15 to 25 suspects have been picked up.
""It is not only an assault on an individual but also an attack on the justice system and the rule of law,"" said general secretary SHCBA.

Chairing a meeting to discuss proposals on regularising the illegal housing societies in the province, she said government departments were equally responsible for the establishment of such schemes but the citizens who bought the property got punished. She added, ""Why did the relevant institutions turn a blind eye when the illegal housing societies were being built. Money is taken from the poor people but plots are not given.""
The chief minister directed the authorities concerned to abolish the requirement of unnecessary no-objection certificates (NOCs) for the registration of housing societies.
She agreed to form a high-level committee for the regularisation of illegal housing schemes.
She also directed the authorities to take measures to digitise the housing sector for in the province for the first time. ""A housing society management system should be introduced. Housing society approval, management and transfer will be made possible online. NOC fees will also be paid online after uploading the required documents,"" she added.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said the development and management of the schemes would also be ensured through the management system.
She considered various options to devise foolproof methods for the development and management of housing societies. She noted, ""According to the rules and regulations, housing schemes should be considered for amnesty once.""

Drop in Chenab inflows as India weaponises water,"US
It is pertinent to note that this is not the first disruption this month.
A sharp reduction of 91,000 cusecs in water flows from India into the Chenab River has been observed over the past two days, the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) said on Saturday.
According to the data, the water inflow at the Chenab River's Marala Headworks stood at 98,200 cusecs on May 29. However, it fell drastically to 44,800 cusecs a day later.
By Saturday, the inflow further plunged to just 7,200 cusecs, with no water being discharged downstream. The low levels marked an overall reduction of 91,000 cusecs at Marala Headworks in a matter of two days.
However, the Pakistan Meteorological Department's Flood Forecasting Division categorised the water flow at Marala Barrage as ""normal"", noting a continuing downward trend.
It is pertinent to note that this is not the first disruption this month. On May 5, just before a spike in military tensions between the two neighbours, India had virtually halted water releases into Pakistan from the Chenab without issuing any prior notice.
Earlier on Friday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif issued a strong statement, denouncing India's attempts to weaponise water.
He warned that Pakistan would not tolerate any breach of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) or any actions endangering millions for the sake of narrow political agendas.
""Pakistan would not allow Delhi to cross the red line by holding the IWT in abeyance and endangering millions of lives for narrow political gains,"" the prime minister said.

"Woman, daughter killed in family-related incidents","US
Personal enmity, honour-related motives suspected behind the murders
A woman and her daughter were shot dead while their husbands were injured in an armed attack on the family in a village in Veeran Forest in Jhirk, Thatta district, on Saturday. Razia Khoso, 40, Azizan Khoso, 22, were gunned down and their husbands were injured.
The police said they have started an investigation, though, the incident's FIR could not be registered by the evening.

Meanwhile, in Kotri town of Jamshoro district a married woman was strangled to death allegedly by her own brothers and uncle. DSP Shahnawaz Jokhio and SHO Khair Muhammad Mallah told a press conference that 20-year-old Zulekhan, wife of Nadeem Burdi, was killed and later buried in Jeay Shah graveyard near Syedabad area.
The DSP informed that an FIR has been lodged on the state's complaint nominating her two brothers, an uncle, a cousin and seven other persons. The official also apprised that the police have filed an application before the court to exhume her body.

Tax shortfall,"DE
This shortfall has come at a heavy cost to the public.
The government's tax collection strategy has hit a shortfall — again. Despite imposing record taxes, withdrawing advances, freezing accounts and squeezing the salaried class beyond reason, the FBR missed its target by a staggering Rs1.03 trillion with just a month left in the fiscal year. To be clear: the target of Rs12.334 trillion was overly ambitious from the outset. It assumed compliance without reform, growth without relief, and revenue without restructuring.
This shortfall has come at a heavy cost to the public. The salaried class alone paid Rs437 billion in income taxes till April — a 52% increase over last year — while electricity bills and essential goods were taxed like luxuries. Meanwhile, the FBR aggressively pursued stopgap measures: illegally withdrawing funds from bank accounts, holding back refunds, and relying on tax advances to meet monthly targets.
All this, and still a miss. More alarming is the absence of structural effort. The promised recovery of arrears in litigation cases — a key part of the government's pitch — never materialised and refunds remained delayed. The FBR's reliance on punitive tactics instead of expanding the tax net is as evident as it is unsustainable. Compounding the problem is the IMF programme that guides Pakistan's fiscal policies.
By definition, the programme emphasises austerity and revenue generation over growth and investment, an approach that stifles economic activity and discourages business expansion. While the IMF's role in dictating revenue measures is undeniable, the government's own choices reflect poor prioritisation. Pakistan's tax regime continues to lean on the compliant and ignore the evaders. The FBR, ironically, continues to enjoy performance-based incentives while its core failure goes unaddressed.
The new Rs14.3 trillion target for FY26 risks becoming a recipe for disaster if fiscal prudence and a balanced approach between revenue collection and protecting the common man are not prioritised. The policymakers must rethink their approach to taxation as the economy cannot survive on extraction alone.

Digital border and human security,"US
A human-centric approach to national security requires safeguarding citizens' rights and freedoms.
For millennia, fluid physical frontiers and traditional concepts of territorial security defined the nature and scope of sociopolitical settings. However, as societies evolved and became increasingly interdependent and integrated, the relevance of physical boundaries came under increasing scrutiny, particularly after the formalisation of the nation-state system and sovereignty in the Westphalian Treaty in the mid-17th century.
The ensuing events laid the groundwork for global integration, interconnectedness and interdependence, or globalisation. Lately, digitalisation has sparked a debate about balancing digital rights with digital borders or national security.
A digital border is a system of virtual boundaries, cybersecurity measures and data privacy frameworks that regulate information flow across networks. It safeguards sensitive data, prevents unauthorised access and protects intellectual property, ensuring robust cybersecurity from the cyber domains of strategic threats. This way, it plays a key role in national security by protecting against cyber threats such as espionage, sabotage and disruption of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, digital borders help address propaganda and disinformation; defend economic interests; shield against cyberattacks, data breaches and cybercrimes; and check terrorist activities in digital space.
The nature of digital rights and digital borders may vary in each country with different socio-political cultures, citizens in democratic settings are essentially qualified for the greater rights: access to information, freedom of expression and civilised dissent, privacy, online security, digital literacy, online participation and net neutrality.
A human-centric approach to national security requires safeguarding citizens' rights and freedoms. For the provision of fundamental rights not only helps build public trust in the integration of the state but also makes every citizen a keyboard warrior against threats. In other words, societies that emphasise human security and fundamental rights effectively cultivate national and cybersecurity. Therefore, societies with human-centric strategic cultures are relatively immune from traditional and non-traditional threats and often enjoy prosperity and the accompanying digital rights.
However, the security states or societies facing traditional and non-traditional threats experience greater tension between national security interests and digital rights. This imbalance often stems from real or exaggerated security threats and resultant securitisation of a society and a lack of human security. Instead of pursuing pragmatic security policies aimed at directly addressing threats, most such states undermine citizens' rights, including the right to freedom of expression, in the name of national security. Digital censorship, surveillance, internet slowdowns and firewalls continue to erode digital rights with little, if any, impact on improving national security.
Owing to disregard for human security, they remain vulnerable to traditional and non-traditional threats. These threats exacerbate citizens' grievances; lead to increased securitisation and socio-economic and political instability; and intensify both conventional and non-traditional security challenges.
Digital borders, therefore, cut both ways: they deter national security threats while also potentially infringing on rights, particularly digital ones. On the one hand, they help safeguard national security and prevent cybercrime; on the other, they lead to censorship of information, surveillance of individuals and restrictions on access to online services and qualified digital rights.
For sustainable and holistic national security, digital surveillance should not override citizens' digital rights and human security. Instead, a balance should be struck between national security and digital rights. To this end, human security and people's welfare offer the best approach to balancing these competing interests, thus contributing to national security by preventing the emergence of new threats and aiding the state in battling existing ones.
Therefore, human security lies at the heart of national security and prosperity - something yet to be appreciated by key stakeholders in our society.

Report spells out past secret nuclear activities in Iran,"US
.
Iran has further stepped up its production of highly enriched uranium, according to a confidential UN nuclear watchdog report, as Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Saturday that Tehran deems nuclear weapons ""unacceptable"".
According to the latest report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) seen by AFP, Iran has sharply increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent, close to the roughly 90 percent level needed for atomic weapons.
It said in its quarterly report that Iran has an estimated amount of 408.6 kilogrammes enriched to up to 60 percent as of May 17, up by 133.8 kilogrammes since the last report in February.
Iran's total amount of enriched uranium now exceeds 45 times the limit authorised by the 2015 agreement with world powers, and is estimated at 9,247.6 kilogrammes.
""The significantly increased production and accumulation of highly enriched uranium by Iran, the only non-nuclear weapon State to produce such nuclear material, is of serious concern,"" the IAEA said.
In a separate in-depth report, the IAEA criticised ""less than satisfactory"" cooperation from Tehran over its scrutiny of its nuclear programme, specifically noting Iran's lack of progress in explaining nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
The report comes as Tehran pursues delicate negotiations with the United States on its nuclear programme.

Tarar for avoiding conflict of interests,"US
Says new tribunal members should not hear tax cases due to past affiliations
Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar has advised the newly appointed members of appellate tribunals dealing with billions of rupees worth of tax matters to recuse themselves from hearing cases where the conflict of interests arises because of their past professional affiliations.
The minister spoke to The Express Tribune after questions were posed about the conflict of interests in the case of some of the appellate tribunal members. ""When the question of conflict of interests arises, the newly appointed members will choose the option of 'not before me',"" Tarar said.
Instead of appointing new members of the Inland Revenue appellate tribunal through the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC), the government in January this year constituted a three-member selection committee.
Among the committee members were Justice (Retired) Mushir Alam, Major General (Retired) Naveed Ahmad, who is a member of the FPSC, and Asim Zulfiqar, a senior partner of AF Ferguson chartered accountancy firm.
On the recommendation of the committee, the federal cabinet has so far appointed 15 members from March to May this year.
The newly appointed members have been given salaries equal to judges but they are not independent like the judges, said Dr Ikramul Haq, a senior lawyer at the Supreme Court of Pakistan. He also questioned the selection process, saying there were questions about some of the members' competency and conflict of interests.
The members should either work under high courts or the Supreme Court instead of working under the executive branch, he suggested.
To a question about bypassing the FPSC, the law minister said the selection process had been outsourced to management consulting firm AT Kearney ""for ensuring independence"" in the process.
To another question how to ensure transparency and objectivity in deciding the cases if some of the tribunal members have worked with tax advisory firms, Tarar replied ""we believe that these are mature people and will take care of the conflict of interests"".
The minister said that whenever such a situation arises, the members should exercise the ""not before me"" right to avoid hearing cases being pleaded by tax firms where they have worked in the past. The Ministry of Law has made these appointments under Section 130 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
The law states that a person shall be eligible to be appointed as a member of the Appellate Tribunal, if he is an advocate of a High Court for not less than 15 years and possesses such other qualifications as may be prescribed by rules under this section; has for a period not less than 10 years practiced professionally as a chartered accountant and has for a period not less than 10 years practiced professionally as a cost and management accountant.
An officer of the Inland Revenue in BS-21 or above; or an officer of the Inland Revenue in BS-20, having served in such a grade for three years or more, is also eligible for these appointments.
The prime minister decided to appoint all these members from the private sector to address the issue of conflict of interests. There had also been incidents in the past where the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) used to influence the outcome of cases, although the members were working under the administrative control of the law ministry.
About Rs4 trillion in revenues are stuck at various levels – most of which before the commissioners appeal of the FBR and the appellate tribunals. The FBR and the office of the Attorney General of Pakistan had assured the PM to at least recover about Rs400 billion before June. Similar assurances had also been given to the IMF.
However, so far no major breakthrough has been achieved, except in the case of windfall tax.
A recent IMF report stated that the Pakistani authorities were actively pursuing the resolution of outstanding cases. It said efforts were being made to recover Rs367 billion out of a total of Rs770 billion under dispute. These included cases pending before the Supreme Court involving Rs43 billion, high courts in Islamabad, Sindh and Lahore involving Rs217 billion and the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue Rs104 billion.
The report disclosed that the IMF had been assured that the Supreme Court had completed its initial hearing, with a final decision expected by mid-April. A favourable ruling could effectively resolve related cases worth an estimated Rs120 billion, according to the report.
The IMF's view was that resolving the cases would help clarify the legality of the disputed claims, thereby supporting future revenue by reducing uncertainty and discouraging future litigation.
The appointments of the new members have already been challenged in courts for the lack of transparency.
According to media reports, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has issued an interim order on the appointment of members in the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, stating that all appointments would be subject to the final outcome of a writ petition.
Earlier, the IHC issued notices to the Ministry of Law secretary, FPSC chairman and Attorney General of Pakistan following a constitutional petition challenging the appointment process of tribunal members.
The petition challenges the unadvertised process of ""head hunting"" and the lack of transparency. It alleges that the appointment process did not follow the established rules and procedures.

Bumrah upbeat to exploit 'swinging conditions',"US
He believes England's approach would help Indian bowlers to take wickets
India's pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah expressed his eagerness to bowl in the bowling-friendly conditions in England as the two teams are set to lock horns in a five-match Test series, scheduled to commence on June 20.
Bumrah, who is one of the most experienced players in India's squad for the series, especially after the back-to-back retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, acknowledged playing in England as challenging before sharing his anticipation to bowl with the Dukes ball.
""Playing in England is always a different challenge, I always love bowling with the Dukes ball,"" Bumrah said in a conversation with former Australia captain Michael Clarke.
""The weather, the swinging conditions sometimes, and then when the ball becomes soft, there's always a challenge. So I always look forward to playing in England,"" he added.
Bumrah also commented on England's approach towards Test cricket, which he described as 'ultra-aggressive', will allow their bowling unit to take wickets.
""They're playing an interesting style of cricket which is interesting because I don't really understand it too much.
""But as a bowling unit, we always feel confident that when the batters are being ultra-aggressive, on a given day, anybody could run through and get wickets.""
Jasprit Bumrah then welcomed cricket's long-awaited comeback to the Olympics and shared that he is determined to make an appearance at Los Angeles 2028.
""Obviously, it is tough for any individual to keep playing everything for so long,"" he said. ""I've been doing it for a while, but eventually you have to understand where your body is going, what is the important tournament.
""You have to be a little selective and smart about how you use your body. As a cricketer, I would never want to leave anything and always keep on going. But I don't set goals or look at numbers. whenever I have [set goals], I've never been able to fulfil them.

He states Dr Khan deserves credit for his role as a scientist but ""he is not a leader""
Prime Minister's Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah has sparked a controversy by refusing to acknowledge Pakistan nuclear scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan as a ""hero"".
Speaking to a private news channel on Saturday, Sanaullah said Dr Khan cannot be called a hero.
""A hero is the one who carried out the nuclear tests [former prime minister Nawaz Sharif] and made Pakistan a nuclear power. Process was initiated by former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,"" he said.
He stated that Dr Khan deserves credit for his role as a scientist, and that credit is given to him, but ""he is not a leader.""
""Many countries have built nuclear bombs, but few have actually conducted nuclear tests. Here, people out of jealousy and malice claim that Nawaz Sharif did not want to carry out the tests.
""But let me remind you, Nawaz Sharif was the prime minister at the time, and he was the one who ordered the nuclear tests,"" he added.
The senior politician added that the establishment's position is clear and that Field Marshal Asim Munir has a clear and thoughtful stance that political negotiations should take place between political parties. ""He is not an obstacle to talks [with PTI founder Imran Khan]. In fact, he would welcome them,"" he said.
The advisor said instead of seeking dialogue with the establishment, Imran Khan should send a message for talks to PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif and PPP Co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari.
""Imran Khan blames us for everything, and at the same time claims we have no authority. The authority lies with the government, and the former prime minister will have to talk to the government,"" he said.
Sanaullah remarked that Imran Khan's political philosophy is to return to power with the establishment's support and then to start issuing threats to other politicians. ""Because of this political philosophy, Imran Khan has moved far away from success,"" he said.

Degree delay leaves Kohsar University students in limbo,"US
Students fear missing out on govt jobs, important opportunities
Hundreds of dejected students of Kohsar University Murree have been awaiting degrees for the last six months or so as the much inordinate delay in issuance of their degrees by the university has put their future at risk and in jeopardy.
The university's sluggishness has shattered the dreams of many students. Despite six months having passed, degrees have not been issued, causing students to miss out on government jobs and other important opportunities.
Students claim they have dedicated four years of hard work, time, and paid thousands of rupees in fees to the university, but without their degrees, they are unable to secure employment or pursue higher education.
Following Murree's elevation to district status, recruitment processes in various government departments are underway, but local youth are unable to apply due to the absence of their degrees.
Students have demanded that the university administration immediately issue the pending degrees and have appealed to higher authorities to take notice of this serious negligence to prevent further loss of time. If this situation persists, there is a real risk that students will lose valuable academic years, for which the entire responsibility will rest solely on Kohsar University Murree.
Private schools defy govt orders
Despite clear instructions from the Punjab government and guidelines issued by the Murree Education Department, private educational institutions have failed to bring their operations in line with official regulations.
The directives from the provincial government appear to have been blatantly ignored as no reductions in fees have been implemented, and the collection of exorbitant tuition fees continues unabated.
Parents say private schools have become a source of constant distress for both students and their families. Financially struggling parents are facing severe economic hardships due to high tuition fees and the mandatory purchase of school books at inflated and arbitrary prices set by the schools themselves.
The affected parents have urgently appealed to the Punjab Chief Minister, the provincial education minister, the Rawalpindi Commissioner, the Murree Deputy Commissioner, and senior officials of the Education Department.

Retailers push for tax reforms,"US
CAP calls for fixed GST on digital sales, revival of prize scheme
Pakistan's organised retail sector on Friday urged the government to overhaul the current retail taxation structure in the upcoming Finance Bill 2025-26, highlighting the need for fairer policies to support compliant businesses and expand the tax base.
In an appeal to Federal Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, the Chainstore Association of Pakistan (CAP) — representing over 150 Tier-1 retail chains — called for inclusive policymaking through structured consultation with the private sector. CAP said the budget presents a key opportunity to address long-standing disparities and bring undocumented retailers into the tax net without penalising formal players. The association expressed confidence in the government's commitment to economic revival. CAP underscored the contributions of integrated retailers to employment, commerce, tax revenue, and exports, despite their small share in the overall retail sector.
Currently, POS-integrated retailers contribute around 25-30% of turnover in taxes under various heads, while most of the sector remains either under-taxed or undocumented. CAP warned this imbalance has placed an unsustainable burden on documented businesses, forcing many to downsize or shut down. CAP Chairman Asfandyar Farrukh said strict enforcement actions and unresolved technical issues in the FBR-POS system have disrupted compliant retailers. The removal of GST concessions last year and the failure of the Tajir Dost Scheme due to poor planning worsened matters.

Says to elevate its envoy to ambassador
Afghanistan has welcomed Pakistan's decision to upgrade diplomatic engagement with Kabul, saying that the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (IEA) – the name the interim Taliban government uses for itself – will also reciprocate the move, according to the TOLOnews television.
The IEA's Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed Islamabad's recent decision to elevate its diplomatic relations in Kabul from chargé d'affaires to ambassador.

Banksy in Marseille,"US
New mural mesmerises and surprises locals
A new mural depicting a lighthouse by world-famous street artist Banksy has appeared on a wall in the southern French city of Marseille, with AFP confirming its location on Friday.
The anonymous artist known as Banksy revealed the new work on Instagram on Thursday but its location had not been disclosed.
The words ""I want to be what you saw in me"" are stencilled in English across the black lighthouse set against a beige stucco wall.
The mural is on a quiet street near the Catalans beach not far from the city centre, according to an AFP correspondent.
The lighthouse's painted shadow connects to one of the street bollards lining the sidewalk.
Banksy — whose identity has not been publicly revealed — has crossed the globe for decades painting clandestine murals in public spaces, including in the occupied West Bank, London and Los Angeles.
""It's fascinating that Banksy chose a city like Marseille, which has so much art, foreigners and life,"" said Esteban Roldan, a 42-year-old carpenter who came to see the artwork.
""This is huge, Banksy in Marseille,"" added another local, Virginie Foucault.
She said she was having lunch nearby. ""I thought to myself, 'I'm not going to find it in Les Catalans,' and then, by chance — I never go there — there it is. We love it, we love it!""
Banksy is best known for hard-hitting murals, often using a distinctive stencilling style, that frequently pop up on buildings and walls.
In recent years, he has kept the attention of the contemporary art world with his social commentaries and causes — migrants, opposition to Brexit, denunciation of Islamist radicals - while still stirring the excitement of the moneyed art markets.
The artist boasts an A-list client lineup and has sold his works for tens of millions of pounds at auction since the early 2000s. afp

'You belong with me',"PL
Taylor Swift purchases the rights to all her masters
Pop sensation Taylor Swift, who was locked in a feud with record executives since 2019 over ownership of her music, has bought back the rights to her entire back catalogue, she said Friday, as per AFP.
""All of the music I've ever made now belongs to me,"" she wrote on her website, after years of disputes over her first six albums, a number of which she rerecorded to create copies she owns herself.
""To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it,"" she wrote in the letter to her devoted followers.
""To my fans, you know how important this has been to me – so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them 'Taylor's Version'.""
Those records included the award-winning Reputation and Taylor Swift.
Swift bought back her masters from Shamrock Capital, an LA investment firm, for an undisclosed amount.
The re-recording power move came in the wake of public sparring with industry mogul Scooter Braun, her one-time manager whose company had purchased her previous label and gained a majority stake in her early work. He later sold Swift's master rights to the private equity company.
'This fight'
The situation left Swift publicly incensed: ""I just feel that artists should own their work,"" she said in 2019.
""She's a vocal advocate for artists' rights,"" Ralph Jaccodine, a professor at the Berklee College of Music, told AFP previously. ""She's built her own brand.""
Before her public efforts to regain control of her work, Prince, George Michael, Jay-Z and Kanye West all also fought for control of their masters – one-of-a-kind source material that dictate how songs are reproduced and sold – but none had gone so far as to re-record them completely.
The queen of pop, whose recent nearly two-year-long, $2 billion Eras tour shattered records, said that she was ""heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry.""
Swift's lucrative tour which wrapped last year was a showbusiness sensation, and will have helped offset the costs of buying back her catalog.
The 149 shows across the world typically clocked in at more than three hours long each.
Tour tickets sold for sometimes exorbitant prices and drew in millions of fans, along with many more who didn't get in and were willing to simply sing along from the parking lot.
""Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all this to happen,"" Swift said in her letter.
Swifties react
Fans across social media dubbed the end of the battle ""Swiftie Independence Day"", expressing pride and joy for their favourite artist to finally triumph in this long struggle. From quoting nostalgic lyrics to comparing Swift's new letter to the one she wrote in the beginning of the legal battle, fans on social media have been overjoyed at the news.
""As an artist, this must be the best feeling. Owning what you created and having control over it must be a great feeling. You go girl, this is marvelous,"" a user wrote on Instagram.
Some netizens, however, reflected on the bittersweet nature of Swift having to fight to earn what she had made. ""She deserves to own the rights to her own work. It's wild that she had to become a billionaire and have a record-breaking world tour of intense, hard work across multiple time zones for hours, night after night, just to be able to buy the rights to her own work. I hate it here,"" a user fumed.
A 2019 tweet from Kelly Clarkson also resurfaced on X. ""Just a thought, you should go in and re-record all the songs that you don't own,"" Clarkson wrote to Swift back then, now having the appreciation of Swifties for thinking ahead. ""I'd buy all the new versions just to prove a point.""
The news of Swift's purchase comes after Reputation's lead single Look What You Made Me Do featured in an episode of The Handmaid's Tale, adding fuel to Swifties' anticipation of Reputation (Taylor's Version).
Now, following this new development and reports that Reputation has returned to No 1 on US iTunes, fans feel that the moment couldn't be any more poetic. ""This is Reputation (Taylor's Version),"" an Instagram user emphasised. ""She literally worked hard to get it all back. I love this!""
The pop-star addressed the matter of Reputation (Taylor's Version) in her letter. ""Full transparency, I haven't even recorded a quarter of it,"" she admitted. ""To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in these first six that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it.""
Swift promised that she will eventually release the vault tracks for the album, adding that on the other hand, she has re-recorded her debut album. ""These two albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right,"" she said. ""But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.""

Rs223m sought for Raja Bazaar cabling project,"US
IESCO issues demand notice of Rs185m, SNGPL Rs30m, WASA Rs5m, and PTCL Rs3.3m
As part of the underground cabling and beautification project in Raja Bazaar, adjacent to the historic Fawara Chowk, utility agencies have issued demand notices totalling Rs 223.3 million to the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC).
The agencies include the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL), Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL).
Following the completion of a similar project in Saddar's commercial areas and the conversion of Bank Road into a pedestrian-only street, the RMC has approved similar plans for Raja Bazaar and Commercial Market.
In the first phase, IESCO issued a demand notice of Rs185 million, SNGPL Rs30 million, WASA Rs5 million, and PTCL Rs3.3 million.
Work on civil infrastructure and network shifting will commence once payments are made, after which beautification efforts will be undertaken by the municipal corporation itself.
Meanwhile, demand notices for the Commercial Market project are yet to be received.
Separately, the corporation has floated tenders worth Rs950 million for carpeting, expansion, and redesigning of 14 roads across the city, with work set to begin after Eidul Azha.
In another development, the old Rose Cinema building — constructed before the creation of Pakistan and located in front of Fawara Chowk — has been demolished after lease expiry and the lifting of a court stay.
The site, measuring one kanal and eight marlas, is now under the corporation's control and has been earmarked for a multi-storey parking plaza.
The proposal has been sent to the Punjab government for final approval. Additionally, another five-storey parking facility is planned on the site of the former municipal office near Fawara Chowk, where an incomplete three-storey RDA parking plaza already exists.
The structural design for the new facility has been prepared, and cost estimation is underway.
With three parking plazas in the Fawara Chowk vicinity, the corporation anticipates improved traffic flow and enhanced parking options for shoppers in the commercial district.
Chief officer Imran Ali stated that the corporation is focused on upgrading road infrastructure and completing the two ongoing underground cabling and beautification projects to provide citizens with improved facilities.

Hina Bayat thinks young actors vaping is unacceptable,"US
Veteran artist believes juniors are being offensive
In an interview with Hina Niazi, veteran actor Hina Bayat expressed sharp disapproval of those who smoke, having been in the vicinity of younger actors who think they are pardoned because they vape.
When asked what she would like to say to her peers who smoke, Hina said, ""All our young actors qualify for this since they believe that vaping isn't the same as smoking tobacco. They have no sense regarding this.""
She recalled an incident with an unnamed, disgruntled actor, who got upset at her preference. ""Once someone asked me for permission, saying, 'Would you mind if I smoke around you?' I said, 'I'm mildly asthmatic and allergic to smoke.' And that soured their mood,"" she said.
Hina added that the anonymous actor hit back at her, asking why people who don't smoke are ""so offensive"" to people who do. In response, she reminded her fellow actor that they were the one who sought her permission.
""And most importantly, why do people who smoke not realise that they are being offensive?"" the Farar actor posed.
Her views remained firm and uncompromising. ""You cannot smoke on the set, in the makeup room, and inside any other room,"" she stated.
But Hina does give credit where credit is due. When asked if she knows any celebrity who indulges in junk food, she said, ""All our artists are such fitness-conscious people that they won't do this."" Slipping in a joke, she added, ""Nobody eats junk food, and if anyone does, then they do it secretly.""
While her fellow actors are strict about keeping fit, Hina admitted that she herself doesn't do much in the way of self-care. ""I am extremely incompetent and lazy when it comes to this,"" she said. ""All I want is for my face to be clean. So the only thing that I am particular about is that I can't fall asleep with makeup on.""
She added that after returning from work, her top priority is to wash up. Aside from that, she admitted that she has never really focused on skincare or keeping her weight in check. But there is a catch: ""I do love walking, which I'm unable to do in Pakistan.""
Explaining why she doesn't keep her diet in check like celebrities generally prefer to, Hina simply said, ""I eat everything. Why shouldn't we benefit from the blessings that Allah has given us?""

"Local hero, Netflix star","SA
Humayun Saeed reflects on the pressures of working abroad
If there is any showbiz star who knows a thing or two about representing Pakistan internationally through his line of work, it is Humayun Saeed. Or, as viewers abroad may call him, Dr Hasnat in Season 5 of Netflix royal drama The Crown.
But although his reputation as an A-lister is cemented in his home country, Humayun stressed in an interview on YouTube channel Filme Shilmy that during his time on The Crown, he felt the weight of representing Pakistan before the eyes of the rest of the world.
""Representation is so important whenever we have to go outside our country,"" mused the star, who made his post-Crown comeback last year with a lead role in Gentleman after having been away from screens for nearly two years. ""Take The Crown. That character was an important one, and I gave it my all. I took a lot of time with it, and it was at the forefront of my mind that the whole world would be watching this.""
Despite the pressure of global expectations and the eyes of the world, however, the actor praised the work environment and the professionalism of his colleagues, whom he credited for going the extra mile to ensure his comfort.
""There was pressure, but I'm glad that the people who worked with me were very good,"" noted Humayun. They knew I had come from another country and was working in another language.""
Humayun went on to hint, however, that professionalism is a two-way street. ""I gave it my all, and this is where our respect comes from – the work ethic we have when we go elsewhere,"" he pointed out. Lauding, in turn, the work ethic of those on set, the actor continued, ""I saw that everything was happening on time, everyone was punctual and working quietly, and everyone's priority was to complete the work every day.""
Stopping just short of commenting on punctuality and efficiency on sets in Pakistan, Humayun went on to concede, ""Of course, we have that here as well, but maybe we make some mistakes. But the thing is, they do not make those mistakes.""
What's in a name?
Alongside his Bin Roye co-star, Mahira Khan, Humayun is currently in the throes of promoting his upcoming Eidul Azha romantic comedy Love Guru. In the same interview, Humayun recalled that he had been warned to refrain from being in any sort of offering going by that particular name, at the risk of being tainted by association after a previous film also called Love Guru had flopped.
""There used to be a film that wasn't very good called Love Guru, and someone told me I shouldn't take on this particular film – but our film is good!"" he insisted with conviction. Brushing aside the importance of the name of a production, Humayun maintained, ""People are interested in films. If you make a good movie, and if people like it, then they start to like the name as well!""
And of course, the star also has the evidence to back up his beliefs about films and their respective names. ""I made a movie called Punjab Nahi Jaungi, and everyone said, 'What kind of name is this? This is not a good name for a film!' But then when that film became a hit, everyone would say that it was because it had a catchy name!""
In other words: any title is only as good as the film itself. ""When a film is good, the name is also a hit,"" concluded Humayun firmly.
Delving deeper into the film itself and giving insight into his performance, the star discussed the art of delivering his lines when the viewers are in on a secret, but the characters are in the dark.
""The shades of this character – sometimes I don't always understand how to talk like him, because I myself don't talk like that,"" he admitted. ""But I would go to [director Nadeem Baig] and he would guide me and advise me about the timing. So I would copy Nadeem! The thing is, this film doesn't have that much comedy. I needed to add a few nuances so that the characters can't tell that he is lying, but the audience can.""
Mahira's personal touch
Sitting alongside Humayun, fellow A-lister and Love Guru leading lady Mahira, known for picking up non-conformist roles, had her own thoughts on what makes her character tick and how she brought shades of herself to the part.
""The first time you read a script, you read it as you,"" began Mahira. ""And then you pick on things in the script. And the director says, 'This is not you, this is a character!'""
Admitting that it isn't always practical to view a character through one's own lens, Mahira added ""Sometimes it's not needed, sometimes it's not the character, and you have to surrender to it.""
When it comes to Love Guru itself, however, Mahira is adamant that this her onscreen persona is one that audiences can get behind and fall in love with – and yes, this time, she was able to convince director Nadeem to view the role through her own lens to add richness and subtlety to her character.
""In this film, she is a girl of today,"" explained Mahira. ""She is a true blue feminist and someone who is always on the right side of the spectrum. I would go to Nadeem and say, 'She wouldn't say this about another girl!' And he would agree and say, 'You're right, let's change it.' So yes, I do bring this to the table.""
Looking back on her former roles, Mahira mused that she is now in a place where she does not feel she owes it to herself to take on characters carrying an important message, as opposed to the relatively ""easy-breezy"" lighter character she has taken on board in Love Guru.
""When I was younger, I was so hell bent on just doing that,"" she recalled. ""I remember I had a few choices and I went for Verna, because I felt the subject was so important and I needed to be a part of it. At that time, even though I was offered roles that were easy breezy, I thought, 'No, I have to do this first.'""
Now, however, Mahira feels unshackled from her own expectations. ""I've had a kind of switch,"" she affirmed. ""If I don't do it now, then when will I do it? But I don't look at it that way. if you know what I mean. I don't think, 'Oh this is easy breezy, and this is heavy'. Now it's just about what attracts me and what is offered to me.""
Will viewers find Mahira's easy-breezy character as palatable as the woman bringing her to life? There is not long to go before we find out.

Murree sets up cattle market for Eidul Azha,"US
RWMC has finalised cleaning arrangements, removal of offal ahead of Eid
The Murree district administration has set up a dedicated cattle market to facilitate citizens ahead of Eidul Azha.
The market was inaugurated recently at the ground located below Jheka Gali on Hill Dholu Road, one of the most picturesque spots in Murree city, where the Municipal Corporation has organised the facility.
The Municipal Corporation has urged livestock sellers and buyers from the local community to cooperate with the administration and bring their animals to the designated market.
Issuing official instructions, Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Abbas Shirazi emphasised that the cattle market has been established at a specific location to ensure cleanliness during the Eid festivities.
He further warned that no cattle markets would be allowed on other roads or areas, and that a strict action would be taken against anyone violating these regulations.
On the other hand, the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC) has finalised cleaning arrangements, including the removal of waste ahead of Eid under Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz's vision and ""Suthra Punjab Programme"".
Following the directives of RWMC CEO Rana Sajid Safdar, a grand cleaning operation is underway across all tehsils of the Rawalpindi Division. This operation includes specialised waste clearance and sanitation efforts in city streets, highways, markets, residential areas, and cattle markets, running round the clock.
With Eidul Azha approaching, waste lifting, manual sweeping, lime sprinkling, and immediate cleaning are being conducted daily in all cattle markets of Rawalpindi, including Murree, under a coordinated strategy.
The operation manager in Murree, Talha Mir, is supervising the sanitary workers actively deployed in the field. RWMC CEO Safdar is closely monitoring the ""Clean Punjab Programme"" in the division and reviewing daily field reports.

Drought threatens valley's natural allure,"US
Khabeki Lake dries up, Kanhatti Bagh at risk
The picturesque Soon Valley, home to historic and ecologically significant sites like Khabeki Lake and Kanhatti Bagh, is facing an environmental crisis due to prolonged drought, rampant deforestation, and repeated forest fires.
Khabeki Lake — an internationally recognised Ramsar site and vital habitat for migratory water birds — has completely dried up.
Once a thriving tourist attraction offering boating and wildlife viewing, the lake now stands barren. With water levels plummeting, fish populations are vanishing and tourism is rapidly declining.
The situation is equally alarming at Kanhatti Bagh, a British-era botanical garden and a major draw for tourists during holidays such as Eid.
The spring that feeds the garden has dwindled to a trickle, endangering more than 25 species of fruit-bearing trees, including loquat and Late Valencia. The garden, which boasts over 100 species of trees, is at serious risk of ecological collapse.
Despite the escalating crisis, the District Council Khushab has yet to take substantive steps to preserve these vital sites.
Experts suggest the construction of a mini-dam on Nala Souk near Kanhatti Bagh to create a sustainable water reservoir.
Meanwhile, locals are calling for immediate reforestation efforts and stricter enforcement against vehicle washing, plastic pollution, and illegal woodcutting near the lake.
Forest fires have ravaged more than 1,500 acres in Rakh Khabeki over the past two years, severely disrupting the habitat of Punjab Urial, partridges, and other wildlife. The cause of these fires remains untraced, but their environmental impact is undeniable.
Public and environmental advocates have appealed to the Sargodha commissioner of and Khushab deputy commissioner to take urgent action. Without immediate intervention, they warn that Soan Valley may lose not only its ecological balance but also its national and international standing as a hub of natural beauty and tourism.

KE presents formula for loadshedding-free city,"US
Asks govt to take over 300 loss-making feeders in problematic area, recover bills
The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of K-Electric, Moonis Ali has presented a practical formula to eliminate load shedding in Karachi.
Speaking at a session with the Council of Economic and Energy Journalists (CEEJ) on Saturday, Ali revealed that 300 of the 2,129 electricity feeders in Karachi are responsible for 87% of total power losses, making them the primary cause of persistent load shedding in the city.
To address this issue, the CEO offered a proposal to the government, suggesting, if it takes over these 300 feeders and manage the internal power supply in these areas, KE would provide load shedding-free supply to Karachi. He added that KE would supply power to these feeders, and the government would be responsible for recovering the bills.
According to Ali, 70% of Karachi is already exempted from load shedding. KE is also working on deploying advanced technology to curb electricity theft. For instance, if the PMT (Pole Mounted Transformer or Photomultiplier Tube) is tampered with, it would trigger a technical fault that would take up to three days to repair, discouraging illegal interference.
Ali urged the government to support KE in managing internal systems in the problematic areas.
Discussing future plans, Ali clarified that the multi-year tariff would not put extra burden on regular consumers. Instead, the tariff framework is designed to attract foreign investment into Karachi's power infrastructure. He noted that National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) would review the investment yearly; in the future, electricity could become cheaper for Karachi consumers.
He added that with the implementation of the multi-year tariff, Karachi would be 90% load-shedding-free by 2030. By then, the number of consumers in the city would reach five million, and power transmission would reach 5,000 megawatts.
In response to a question, Ali stated, KE is fully prepared to supply power to captive power industries by integrating them into the national grid and is willing to work with the government and stakeholders on a set timeline for grid transmission.
He concluded by noting a significant rise in electricity demand in recent months due to increased industrial activity in Karachi. Currently, KE has the capacity to supply 4,500 megawatts of electricity to the city.
Protest
Citizens in Quaidabad area protested against extended power outages on National Highway. The protest, which began at around 8pm on Friday, until Saturday evening causing worst traffic jams.
Taking advantage of the situation, fearless armed men also did their job of robbing people. In one incident, armed men snatched a motorcycle from a young biker and fled the scene.
MQM-P
The members of the Sindh Assembly belonging to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) have expressed deep concern and outrage over prolonged load shedding during the extreme heat.
They said, instead of improving service, the K-Electric, as usual, has increased the duration of load shedding. Korangi, Landhi, Malir, Shah Faisal Colony, Mehmoodabad, Burns Road, Garden, Nazimabad, Orangi Town, Baldia Town, North Karachi, New Karachi, Surjani, and Old City Area are the most affected. In Shah Faisal Colony, consumers connected to Abbas Bawazir PMT are the worst hit as the last load shedding of the day begins at 12 midnight and ends at 2.30am. Sometimes it is beyond 2.30am.
The MQM-P MPAs stated that the city that feeds the entire country is deprived of its basic rights.

Mushahid hails Russia's 'positive neutrality' during recent India clash
Pakistani Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed met Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Saturday, expressing gratitude for Russia's ""positive neutrality"" during the recent escalation between India and Pakistan.
The 40-minute bilateral meeting took place ahead of a broader gathering at the Eurasian Forum, where leaders from China, Turkiye, South Korea, and Cambodia were also in attendance.
Senator Mushahid, who was invited as the only Pakistani representative, delivered a keynote address at the forum, where he highlighted Pakistan's desire for regional peace and greater Eurasian cooperation.
During the meeting, Senator Mushahid expressed appreciation for Russia's stance of ""positive neutrality"" during the rising tensions between India and Pakistan. This neutrality stood in stark contrast to the escalating military operations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Russian FM
The discussion at the Eurasian Forum took a sharp turn when Lavrov condemned Western military alliances in Asia.
He specifically targeted India's growing involvement in the US-led Quad, which includes Australia, Japan, and the United States. Lavrov's criticism of the Indo-Pacific Strategy, which India is increasingly part of, was pointed: ""This Indo-Pacific had never existed — NATO made up this term to drag India into their anti-China schemes,"" he said.
Lavrov's words struck a nerve with the 12-member Indian delegation, which was present at the forum. The Indian representatives, including members of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), were notably silent as Lavrov criticised joint military exercises within the Quad.

Babusar Top turns white in May,"PK
The valley now resembles January more than June.
Intermittent snowfall has been continuing at Babusar Top, a popular tourist destination in the Kaghan Valley, as crowds of tourists are flocking to experience winter-like situation in May.
Tourists escaping the heat in other regions are delighting in the cold weather and celebrating in the snow. So far, over five inches of snow has been recorded at Babusar Top.
Due to the snowfall, authorities temporarily suspended traffic on the Babusar Top highway for safety reasons. However, the road has since been reopened after weather conditions improved.
Other upper areas of the Kaghan Valley — such as Jalkhad, Besal, and the mountains of Lulusar — also received snowfall, bringing back winter-like cold to the region.
The valley now resembles January more than June, and tourists are thoroughly enjoying the chilly, refreshing weather.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the current spell of rain and snow may continue for the next 12 hours, potentially causing further temperature drops.
In Balakot, Saturday saw a mix of clouds and sunshine, while rainfall and snowfall in the surrounding highlands added to the town's beauty and charm.
With ongoing climate change, the traditional sequence of four distinct seasons in the Kaghan Valley is gradually fading.

Championship leader Oscar Piastri topped the times again ahead of title rival and McLaren team-mate Lando Norris in Saturday's third and final free practice ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix.
The 24-year-old Australian clocked a best lap in one minute and 12.387 seconds to outpace Norris, who is three points behind him in the drivers' championship, by 0.526 seconds.
Charles Leclerc was third for Ferrari, seven-tenths off the pace, ahead of Mercedes' George Russell, four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull and Racing Bulls' impressive rookie Isack Hadjar.
Kimi Antonelli was seventh in the second Mercedes ahead of two-time champion and local hero Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin, seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Ferrari and Liam Lawson in the second Racing Bull.
Piastri will on Sunday seek not only to increase his lead in the title race, but also claim an eighth consecutive podium for McLaren, a feat achieved previously by only two drivers – Hamilton and three-time champion Ayrton Senna.
The session began in hot and dry conditions with Alpine new boy Franco Colapinto leading the way soon followed by home favourite Alonso, greeted by a loud cheer from a big Saturday crowd basking in the sunshine.
In a slow start, Lance Stroll and Gabriel Bortoleto joined in, but after 12 minutes only Bortoleto and Colapinto had set times.
The true action did not begin until the half-hour mark with Sainz clocking 1:14.124 followed by Leclerc and Hamilton taking over before Norris and Russell trimmed the top spot lap to 1:13.396.
Emerging last, Antonelli promptly endorsed the impression that Mercedes, like Ferrari, had found time overnight by going second on his first timed lap. Russell was four-tenths clear.
With only 17 minutes remaining, only six cars were on track as teams conserved tyres at a high-degradation circuit. It offered little entertainment for the fans before Verstappen, after set-up changes, went top in 1:13.375.
On their second runs, McLaren lifted the bar with Piastri clocking 1:12.387, a second faster than McLaren. Norris went second, 0.526 adrift and Leclerc third. Unexpectedly, the range of times from first to 10th was 1.4 seconds.

Javelin star outshines all,"DE
Arshad Nadeem wins gold at Asian Championship
Arshad Nadeem may have created the Olympic record and claimed gold, but it was the Asian Athletics Championship title that had eluded him — until Saturday afternoon.
The Mian Channu-based superstar continued his impressive run as one of the biggest names in the world of athletics when he took the javelin gold medal at the Asian Championship with a throw of 86.40 metre in Gumi, South Korea on Saturday.
""Another gold for Pakistan! Alhamdulillah!"" Arshad posted his comments on his social media pages after the win. ""This victory belongs to the Almighty first ...His blessings, His will. Without His grace, none of this would be possible.
""To my coaches, my team, my family, and every Pakistani who prayed for me — this medal is yours. Your support fuels my journey.
""Let's keep rising for our beloved nation! Insha'Allah, more to come.""
This was Arshad's third appearance at the Asian Athletics Championship, and this has been his third Asian title - the last two included bronze medals in the Asian Junior Athletics Championships in 2016 and the Asian Games in 2018.
The last time Arshad competed at the Asian Championships, he had finished sixth with a throw of 78.55 m in 2019.
But today he is a different man.
The 2025 Asian Championship was Arshad's comeback to international competition after his historic feat at the Paris Olympics in August when he created the Olympic record with a throw of 92.97 meters and grabbed the gold medal too. This made him the first individual athlete from Pakistan to win a gold at the Olympics and the first gold medal to come to Pakistan after 40 years.
In Gumi, amid the cheers from Pakistani fans and 'Dil Dil Pakistan' blasting at the stadium, Arshad was prepared to consolidate his gold medal, being the only thrower who had crossed the 90m mark.
Besides Arshad, Muhammad Yasir Sultan was also looking to defend his bronze medal out of the 12 finalists.
The possibility of Pakistan finishing with two podium places was enticing.
Arshad was a clear favourite to win, and by his expressions, he was looking to touch the 90m mark again, while Yasir was aiming at hitting the 80m target.
However, that was not meant to be for either of them.
Arshad looked a little nervous as his javelin only reached the 75.64m mark. Arshad was leading the pack from the get-go, even finishing the qualifying round at the top with a throw of 86.34m on Friday.
His second, third, fourth, and then fifth attempts were all unsatisfactory by his standard, 76.80m, 85.57m, 83.99m, and 83.44m despite leading the competition most of the afternoon except for facing threat from India's Sachin Yadav.
Arshad's best throw was his sixth and last attempt.
Meanwhile, Yadav took the silver for India, in the absence of the Paris Olympics silver medallist Neeraj Chopra.
His best was 85.16m, Japan's Yuta Sakiyama finished through with 83.75m after a close competition with Sri Lanka's Rumesh Tharanga Pathirage.
Meanwhile, it was a heartbreak for Yasir as he settled on eighth place with 75.39m far from his personal best of 79.93m, which he had achieved at the 2023 Asian Athletics Championship, which secured him a bronze.
Arshad was also congratulated by the President of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The Radio Pakistan reported: In his message, the President said the entire nation is proud of Arshad Nadeem's outstanding performance. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a statement, said Arshad Nadeem continues to make the nation proud. He said Arshad Nadeem's hard work, dedication, and remarkable success serve as an inspiring example for young athletes.
Medal to be dedicated to Pak Army: Arshad's mother
While Arshad got the job done in Gumi, his parents back home are proud of his performance.
""My son will continue to make Pakistan proud. I am grateful to everyone who prayed for my son's success. My son won this medal, and this medal is dedicated to Pakistan Army. It is a tribute to all the army men who sacrificed their lives for this country,"" she told a local news television channel.
She added that his entire family will celebrate his return home, ""I'll cook whatever he wants to eat. He loves to eat kheer.""
She continued to congratulate the nation for its success at the Asian Championship.

"IMF seeks explanation on Bitcoin, AI initiatives","US
Urges govt to launch programmes after mutual consultation
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has sought an explanation from the government for not taking it into confidence while setting aside 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centres.
Sources told Express News that IMF officials will take up the issue with the government during a virtual interaction.
They stated that the IMF has asked as to how such allocation could be made without deciding the legal status of cryptocurrency.
The Fund has said that all decisions should be taken within the framework of the IMF programme after mutual consultation.
Sources said the government team is going to face tough questions during its talks on the new fiscal budget. They said both sides have agreed to hold virtual consultation on all matters.
A report citing the Ministry of Finance said last week that Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bitcoin mining and AI data centers as part of the first phase of a national initiative that seeks to transform Pakistan into a global leader in digital innovation.
This initiative is led by the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), a government-supported organization, as part of a wider plan to utilize excess electricity, generate high-tech employment, and attract foreign investment, according to the ministry.
The allocation is the first stage of a larger, multi-phase rollout of digital infrastructure, marking a significant milestone in Pakistan's digital transformation, it added.
The Finance Ministry noted that upcoming developments are likely to feature facilities powered by renewable energy, strategic global partnerships with top blockchain and AI firms, and the creation of fintech and innovation hubs.

PSG's Marquinhos wants a fight against Inter,"RU
The captain is not going to let a second chance slip to win UCL final
Paris St Germain captain Marquinhos knows what it is like to lose a Champions League final and is not going to let a second chance slip without a fight when they face Inter Milan in Munich, the Brazilian defender said on Friday.
Marquinhos was a member of the PSG side which lost the 2020 final to Bayern Munich, but has the opportunity for redemption as the club look to secure their first Champions League trophy on Saturday.
""We've been through highs, we've been through lows,"" Marquinhos told reporters.
""Tomorrow we've got a beautiful opportunity. We could go down in history. This would be great for the club, for the players.
""This is my second chance to win a Champions League final and I'm not going to go down without a fight.""
Earlier this season, PSG were in danger of not even making the knockout stages, losing three and drawing one of their opening five games, before squeaking through on the final day of the league phase.
Since then they have gone from strength to strength, wrapping up the Ligue 1 title with six games to spare and winning the French Cup, and the PSG players are now ready to cap their season with the ultimate prize.
""We're going to pull out the performance of a lifetime tomorrow on the pitch because it will be very difficult and actually we've had to fight all season now to get to the final,"" Marquinhos said.
""We've done everything we can to get to the final of the Champions League. This is the best moment of our season. It's that cherry on the top and it's up to us now.
""We need to take the silverware back to Paris so that we can share this with our fans who have supported us over the season. Time is of the essence now, we're going for the silverware tomorrow and we're going to take it home."" REUTERS

Bureaucratic maze traps harassment victims,"US
Three different institutions addressing cases of harassment, women seeking justice are often denied timely redress
In Punjab, the Provincial Ombudsperson, the Women Protection Authority, and the Department of Women Development are tasked with handling cases of harassment. While all three departments claim to protect the rights of women in the province, the resultant bureaucratic maze enervates victims seeking justice.
Asiya Ashraf, a victim of workplace harassment, revealed that as a government employee, she initially contacted the Women Development Department's helpline. After filing a complaint, she was directed to the Punjab Women Protection Authority, which promised her justice.
However, she was later told to approach the office of the Provincial Ombudsperson for Women. ""My case is still pending while no hearing could be scheduled. I seek justice irrespective of which institution delivers it. Women should not be caught in the crossfire of inter-institutional conflicts and jurisdictional disputes,"" opined Asiya.
According to Advocate Amna Malik, a women's rights activist, there is a lack of coordination between the Women Protection Authority, Provincial Ombudsperson for Women, and the Department of Women Development, all of which are currently working to address harassment against women.
""As a result, victims are often caught in the middle, shuttling between these institutions. Each institution has its own set of boundaries and limitations while their jurisdictions are not clearly defined. Due to a lack of effective legislation, women remain uncertain about where to report harassment incidents. Ideally, all harassment cases should be handled under one umbrella, with all institutions linked together to avoid troubling women.
Although their goals are the same, they operate without harmony. Furthermore, the physical distance between these institutions, which are 15 to 20 kilometres apart, forces affected women to undertake lengthy journeys.
This, combined with the institutions' bureaucratic and administrative struggles, leads to women facing significant challenges and exploitation while seeking justice,"" highlighted Malik.
According to documents obtained by Express Tribune, the departments of education, health, police, population welfare, information, minorities, transport, and social welfare have the highest number of working women in Punjab.
Up to 6,654 harassment cases were reported over the past four years, with 1,358 cases received in 2021 and 1,950 cases registered in the first five months of 2025, reflecting a 245 per cent rise in incidence of the crime.
Chairperson of the Women Protection Authority, Hina Pervaiz Butt, revealed that the Punjab Ombudsperson office only dealt with workplace harassment cases. ""On the other hand, the Women Protection Authority specifically focuses on domestic violence, rape, and honor killings and provides immediate help, legal guidance, shelter homes, and other facilities to the affected women. Both institutions are playing an active and effective role in their respective jurisdictions for ensuring justice and protecting the rights of women,"" informed Butt.
""More complaints have been received due to public awareness over the past five years, and the case pendency is zero. Both parties make a compromise in many harassment cases and complaints are resolved in a short time,"" claimed Punjab Ombudsperson Nabila Hakim Ali Khan.
On the other hand, the spokesperson for the Secretary of Women Development, Kiran Fazal Butt, claimed that the department had established a helpline,1043 for reporting harassment incidents, which works under the Punjab Commission on the Status of Women.
Provincial Minister of Information Uzma Bukhari said that on the special directive of Chief Minister Punjab, a strict stance has been taken against harassers. ""All three institutions are working within their own boundaries and the government is creating a conducive environment for women in every department,"" said Bukhari.

Israel blocks Arab FMs Ramallah meeting,"US
Visit postponed after 'Israel's obstruction of it'
Israel will not allow a planned meeting in the Palestinian administrative capital of Ramallah, in the occupied West Bank, to go ahead, an Israeli official said on Saturday, after Arab ministers planning to attend were stopped from coming.
The move, days after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government announced one of the largest expansions of settlements in the West Bank in years, underlined escalating tensions over the issue of international recognition of a future Palestinian state.
Saturday's meeting comes ahead of an international conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, that is due to be held in New York on June 17-20 to discuss the issue of Palestinian statehood, which Israel fiercely opposes.
The delegation of senior Arab officials due to visit Ramallah — including the Jordanian, Egyptian, Saudi Arabian and Bahraini foreign ministers — postponed the visit after ""Israel's obstruction of it"", Jordan's foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that the block was ""a clear breach of Israel's obligations as an occupying force"".
The ministers required Israeli consent to travel to the West Bank from Jordan. An Israeli official said the ministers intended to take part in ""a provocative meeting"" to discuss promoting the establishment of a Palestinian state.
""Such a state would undoubtedly become a terrorist state in the heart of the land of Israel,"" the official said. ""Israel will not cooperate with such moves aimed at harming it and its security.""
A Saudi source told Reuters that Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud had delayed a planned trip to the West Bank. Israel has come under increasing pressure from the United Nations and European countries which favour a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, under which an independent Palestinian state would exist alongside Israel.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that recognising a Palestinian state was not only a ""moral duty but a political necessity"". Palestinians want the West Bank territory, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as the core of a future state along with Gaza and East Jerusalem. But the area is now criss-crossed with settlements that have squeezed some 3 million Palestinians into pockets increasingly cut off from each other though a network of military checkpoints.
The settlements are considered illegal by most countries, as the area is formally under military occupation but Israeli ministers talk openly of full annexation. Defence Minister Israel Katz said the announcement this week of 22 new settlements in the West Bank was an ""historic moment"" for settlements and ""a clear message to Macron"".
He said recognition of a Palestinian state would be ""thrown into the dustbin of history.""

Indian general admits Pakistan downed jets,"SG
CDS lays emphasis on rectifying tactical errors
India's defence chief on Saturday appeared to confirm his country had lost at least one aircraft during the brief conflict with Pakistan earlier this month, he told Bloomberg in an interview.
India and Pakistan were engaged in a four-day conflict this month, their worst standoff since 1999, before a ceasefire was agreed on May 10.
More than 70 people were killed in missile, drone and artillery fire on both sides.
Pakistan claimed its Chinese-supplied jets had shot down six Indian aircraft.
India's chief of defence staff, General Anil Chauhan, called Pakistan's claims that it shot down six Indian warplanes ""absolutely incorrect"".
But Chauhan, when pressed as to whether India had lost any jets, appeared to confirm New Delhi had lost an unspecified number of aircraft — without giving details.
""I think, what is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down,"" he told Bloomberg TV, speaking on the sidelines of Shangri-La Dialogue defence meeting in Singapore.
There was no immediate response from New Delhi.
On May 11, a day after the ceasefire, India's Air Marshal AK Bharti, speaking to reporters, had said that ""all our pilots are back home"", adding that ""we are in a combat scenario, and that losses are a part of combat"".
A senior security source told AFP three Indian jets had crashed on home soil without giving the make or cause.
But until the comments on Saturday, India had not officially confirmed any of its aircraft were lost.
""The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets, again targeting at long range,"" Chauhan added, speaking to Bloomberg.
""Why they were downthat is more important for us, and what did we do after that"", he added.
The recent conflict between the nuclear-armed rivals was triggered by an attack on tourists in IIOJK on April 22.
New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing the Islamist militants it said carried out the attack, charges that Pakistan denied.

Another gold for Nadeem,"US
His journey into javelin throwing started off with humble beginnings and makeshift equipment.
While Pakistan's cricket scene struggles on the international stage, Olympic champion Arshad Nadeem — hailing from the small village of Mian Channu in Punjab — continues to offer victorious morsels of hope for the nation's sporting future. Nadeem has just won gold in the men's javelin final at the 2025 Asian Athletics Championship, with a mighty 86.4 metre throw.
This historic win marks only the third time Pakistan has claimed gold at the championship, ending a 55-year drought since Muhammad Younis' victory in the 800-metre race in 1973.
Nadeem's triumphs not only cement his place as a national hero but also continually highlight much-needed dialogue about the potential of Pakistani athletes that has long been neglected. Nadeem's Olympic win itself was nothing short of a miraculous testament to the power of community support.
His journey into javelin throwing started off with humble beginnings and makeshift equipment. Weight-training equipment was improvised and crowdfunded, with the help of a journalist who initiated the campaign.
While these stories make for an inspiring and heartwarming tale of an underdog rising to international stadiums, there are thousands of children across the country dreaming to be athletes who are instead forced to give up.
Pakistan not only lacks professional training centres for athletes but also falls significantly short in supporting its national talent through adequate sponsorships and funding. This systemic neglect has left many promising athletes to rely on personal grit, or often sheer luck.
Yet, Arshad Nadeem's recurrent success proves that Pakistan possesses the sporting talent needed to excel on international stages. He stands as a testament to the power of hard work, discipline, and passion for a dream. The recent win is, again, a landmark achievement that inspires a new generation to believe in greatness despite all odds.

Blocking of passports: officials pass buck to interior ministry,"US
Thousands across Punjab blocked for last 2 years due to suspected participation in May 9, 2023 rioting incidents
Passports of thousands of people across Punjab have been blocked for the last 2 years due to their suspected participation in May 9, 2023 rioting incidents — leading to cancellation of their international trips including pilgrimage to Makkah.
Interestingly, geo fencing was used to identify the alleged rioters active in a particular area on May 9 and May 10 of 2023.
As a result, dozens of people — including employees of government and private organizations, whose workplaces were located in those localities and who used phones during rioting — faced blacklisting of passports.
A number of these people came to know that their passports have been blocked only when they arrived at the airport to fly to foreign destinations or went to the passport office for renewal of their documents. Dozens of such people have now approached the Lahore High Court (LHC).
While hearing these petitions, the LHC has summoned passport officials along with records.
In many of these cases, passport authorities have already submitted records to the court showing that the passports have been blacklisted.
The Passport and Immigration Department told the LHC that the task of blacklisting passports does not fall under their jurisdiction and that the Ministry of Interior includes and removes names from the blacklist and the Exit Control List (ECL).
They claimed that the names of the petitioners were added to the blacklist due to their alleged involvement in May 9 incidents.
Those individuals whose names are on the blacklist or whose passports have expired cannot renew their document until their names are removed from the blacklist.
Violent protests broke out across the country after the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan on May 9, 2023.
During the turmoil, attacks were carried out on 39 military installations across the country between 3pm and 7pm of May 9. Most of these attacks — 23 — occurred in Punjab, followed by 8 in K-P, 7 in Sindh and one in Balochistan.
Major military facilities attacked included the GHQ in Rawalpindi, the Corps Commander's House in Lahore, the Mianwali Air Force Base, and ISI offices in Faisalabad, Sargodha, and Rawalpindi.

Zardari's Jati Umrah visit fuels speculation,"US
.
As whispers of a behind-closed-doors meeting, President Asif Ali Zardari's visit to Jati Umrah — where he was hosted by the Sharif family — has sparked quiet speculation within the PPP ranks about whether their leaders will continue criticising Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz with the same candour as before.
A well-placed PPP leader, speaking to The Express Tribune, expressed uncertainty over whether the party's tone towards the chief minister would now be reined in following the high-profile but discreet political huddle.
Repeated attempts to get clarity from senior figures in both PPP and PML-N went unanswered, particularly on this point.
Two PPP leaders, requesting anonymity, confirmed that Zardari and Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider were hosted by Maryam Nawaz Sharif over the weekend.
However, they could not ascertain who else from the Sharif family was present. One believed Shehbaz Sharif may have attended the meeting, while the other suspected Nawaz Sharif himself was among the hosts.
Given the hush-hush nature of the gathering, neither leader was aware of the content of the discussions.
However, they speculated that the meeting might help defuse tensions and smooth over working relations between the chief minister and the governor, a partnership that has not been without its share of friction.
One of the leaders pointed out that with the PTI effectively out of the formal political arena, the political contest in Punjab had boiled down to a ""duel"" between the PPP and PML-N. He said that under such circumstances, the PPP could not afford to be seen maintaining overtly cordial ties with the PML-N, at least not in public.
""Punjab is of utmost importance if the PPP is to form the central government. We may not realistically aim to form the provincial government in Punjab, but unless the PML-N feels genuinely threatened on its home turf, it will never concede space to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in the next term for the prime ministership,"" he argued.
The same leader claimed that, according to information received through party lines, some members had been ""communicated to take it easy"" on their criticism of the Sharifs.
However, he added, it remained unclear whether this advice was rooted in formal instructions or simply a cautious reading of the political temperature.
The other PPP leader, however, vehemently denied receiving any such communication from the party leadership. ""We will continue our constructive criticism of this government,"" he maintained.
He further said that his own biggest question was why Zardari had remained in Lahore for the past seven days. ""Something feels out of place about this trip."" He noted that all arrangements at the Governor House had been made at the eleventh hour and in great haste.
According to him, one explanation might be that the governor himself is not particularly invested in the upkeep of his official residence.
However, he added a more speculative observation: ""It seems no one knew exactly about the duration or purpose of Zardari's stay, especially at the Governor House.""
