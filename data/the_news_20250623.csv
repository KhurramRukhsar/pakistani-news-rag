News Analysis: Pakistan’s wobbly tightrope between DC and Tehran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323979-pakistan-s-wobbly-tightrope-between-dc-and-tehran,"KARACHI: The US’s airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites late Saturday night have rattled the region, stirred domestic criticism and revived concerns about Islamabad’s long-standing tightrope walk between rival powers. Beyond official statements, reactions from the country’s top diplomats, academics and political analysts reflect the complicated implications for Pakistan’s foreign policy, security posture and strategic alliances.
Asif Durrani, Pakistan’s former ambassador to Iran and the UAE, and a former special representative for Afghanistan, gives an overall view on the situation. Speaking to The News, he says that the attacks by the US “may further destabilise the situation in the region, and have also dented US President Trump’s claim to be a ‘man of peace’”.
For Masood Khalid, former ambassador to Beijing and Seoul, Pakistan’s diplomatic principles are being tested: “We have lately seen increased positive engagement between Pakistan and the US, and the Americans played a constructive role in arranging the Pakistan-India ceasefire. Our position on Iran is a principled one, supporting the sovereignty of Iran, and in line with the general stance of the OIC. Iran is our neighbour and any conflict there is a threat to global and regional security with serious implications for Pakistan. We have, therefore, called for de-escalation, dialogue and diplomacy. This is a balanced position”.
But the attack has arguably pushed Pakistan off the fence. “At a time when Pakistan is working to improve its relations with the US, to move beyond the transactional and work towards a substantive relationship, it has been forced to take a clear-cut position against the US’s illegal and aggressive attack on Iran’s nuclear sites”, explains journalist and political commentator Nasim Zehra. “As long as the US was a mere, even though clear, backer of Israel, Pakistan was not forced to condemn it publicly. Now, the situation is very different”.
Zehra adds: “On the geostrategic and security front, there is consternation within Pakistan’s security practitioners and security experts as to the possible implications for Pakistan’s security and especially its nuclear programme after the US attack, especially given recent statements by former Israeli parliamentarians singling out Pakistan’s nuclear programme”.
Veteran diplomat Javid Husain, Pakistan’s ambassador to Iran from 1997 to 2003, echoes the urgency of standing with Tehran, telling The News that “if the American attack is not properly censured, the danger is that it would set a dangerous precedent for other powerful countries to follow by riding roughshod over weaker countries in their neighbourhood or elsewhere”, which is why “Pakistan’s security interests demand that we stand resolutely on the side of Iran on this issue”.
This is an emerging strategic dilemma for Pakistan, feels historian and Haqooq Khalq Party member Dr Ammar Ali Jan. According to Dr Jan, “On a macro level, this forces a choice on us. At some point, Pakistan will have to choose whether it remains on friendly terms with extremely belligerent imperialism and keeps a distance from the axis of resistance in the region. Or does it start gravitating towards the Axis of Resistance and regional powers such as Iran, China, Russia, thereby antagonising the US? So this balancing act will become very difficult as American belligerence increases in the region.”
For former human rights minister Shireen Mazari, the moment calls not for balance but for clarity. “It’s not about balancing a relationship because you can’t balance between an aggressor and a state that has been aggressed against. Here, the US is a clear aggressor. For Pakistan, this is a no-brainer. There is no way the public won’t be outraged even if there’s a hint that Pakistan would in any way support the US in this”, she says.
“The condemnations from Ishaq Dar and the FO have been very clear that we stand with Iran. We also really don’t want an Israeli-backed regime in Iran; we would become even more vulnerable”.
Mazari also highlights the long-standing fears of foreign redrawing of borders: “Also, remember the map issued some while back in the US Armed Forces Journal on ‘blood borders’ reshaping the Middle East. That map pretty much explains the whole plan of the US and rogue entity Israel. So Pakistan has to be wary of that. My hunch is they [US] will get stuck in this quagmire and it won’t be this easy to deal with Iran, something Israel is already finding out. So there are troubling times ahead and we can’t afford to ‘balance’. We have to take a very clear-cut position in support of Iran for our own security and safety”.
Any leverage Pakistan may have regarding mediation may be further strained if Iran retaliates by closing the Strait of Hormuz, a scenario that Dr Rabia Akhtar, dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Lahore, believes could have dramatic consequences. The “ripple effects” of that on countries like Pakistan, she says, “are profound”.
She also asks: “But what are Islamabad’s real options in a moment like this? And how much space does it truly have to manoeuvre? As we know, Pakistan has long walked a delicate tightrope between Iran and the Gulf/Arab states, balancing strategic ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE on one side, and a complicated neighbourly relationship with Tehran on the other. But if the Strait of Hormuz is genuinely threatened, that balance may become untenable”.
“So does Islamabad speak up, and risk alienating Iran? Or stay quiet, and appear indifferent to the security concerns of its Gulf patrons?” she queries.
“There is also the China variable....Would China expect Pakistan to quietly urge restraint in Tehran? And can Pakistan afford to play that role without becoming part of the fallout?”And yet, she notes, “could this moment paradoxically expand Pakistan’s diplomatic profile?”
Essentially, Dr Akhtar says, the fact is that “Pakistan’s choices in the coming days may reveal not just its strategic preferences but the structural limits within which those preferences are formed. And that will be an important lesson.”

Origins and future prospects of Iran’s nuclear programme,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323980-origins-and-future-prospects-of-iran-s-nuclear-programme,"US strikes could have halted Iran’s ability to enrich the uranium needed to make a viable nuclear weapon. But that’s not the same as preventing its ability to make a nuclear bomb.
It would be sensible to wait until the dust has settled before judging whether the US strikes on Iran were, in Donald Trump’s, words, “a spectacular military success”. And when dropping bombs that weigh more than 13 tonnes each, there’s going to be a lot of dust, states a Sky News analysis.
If nuclear facilities at Isfahan, Natanz and Fordow were destroyed—as the US claims—or even crippled, it would certainly halt Iran’s ability to enrich the Uranium needed to make a viable nuclear weapon.
But that’s not the same as preventing Iran’s ability to make a nuclear bomb. To do that, they need “weapons-grade” uranium; the necessary metal-shaping, explosives and timing technology needed to trigger nuclear fission in the bomb; and a mechanism for delivering it.
The facilities targeted in the US raid are dedicated to achieving the first objective. Taking naturally occurring uranium ore, which contains around 0.7 per cent uranium 235 -- the isotope needed for nuclear fission—and concentrating it. The centrifuges you hear about are the tools needed to enrich U-235 to the 90 per cent purity needed for a compact “implosion”-type warhead that can be delivered by a missile.
And the reality is Iran’s centrifuges have been spinning for a long time.United Nations nuclear inspectors warned in May that Iran had at least 408kg of uranium “enriched” to 60 per cent. Getting to that level represents 90 per cent of the time and effort to get to 90 per cent U-235. And those 400kg would yield enough of that weapons-grade uranium to make nine nuclear weapons, the inspectors concluded.
The second element is something Iran has also been working on for two decades. Precisely shaping uranium metal and making shaped explosive charges to crush it in the right way to achieve “criticality”, the spark for the sub-atomic chain reaction that releases the terrifying energy in a nuclear explosion.
In its recent bombing campaign, Israel is thought to have targeted facilities where Iranian nuclear scientists were doing some of that work.But unlike the industrial processes needed to enrich uranium, these later steps can be carried out in laboratory-sized facilities. Easier to pack up and move, and easier to hide from prying eyes.
Given that it’s understood Iran already moved enriched uranium out of Fordow ahead of the US strike, it’s far from certain that Iran has, in fact, lost its ability to make a bomb.And while the strikes may have delayed the logistics, it’s possible they’ve emboldened a threatened Iran to intensify its warhead-making capability if it does still have one.
Making a more compact implosion-based warhead is not easy. There is debate among experts about how advanced Iran is along that road. But if it felt sufficiently motivated, it does have other, less sophisticated nuclear options.
Even 60 per cent enriched uranium, of which - remember - it has a lot, can be coaxed to criticality in a much larger, cruder nuclear device.This wouldn’t pose as much threat to its enemies, as it would be too heavy to fit on even the best of Iran’s long-range missiles. But it would, nonetheless, elevate Iran to the status of a nuclear power.
The US launched a nuclear program with Iran in 1957. Back then, the Western-friendly monarch—the Shah—ruled Iran and the two countries were still friends. With backing from the US, Iran started developing its nuclear power program in the 1970s. But the US pulled its support when the Shah was overthrown during the Islamic Revolution in 1979, CNN reports in a write-up on the origins of Iran’s nuclear programme.
Since the revolution, which transformed Iran into an Islamic Republic, Western nations have worried the country could use its nuclear program to produce atomic weapons using highly enriched uranium. Iran has maintained that it does not seek to build nuclear weapons. It is a party to the UN’s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), under which it has pledged not to develop a bomb.
At the heart of the controversy over Iran’s nuclear program is its enrichment of uranium – a process used to produce fuel for power plants that, at higher levels, can also be used to make a nuclear bomb.
In the early 2000s, international inspectors announced that they had found traces of highly enriched uranium at an Iranian plant in Natanz. Iran temporarily halted enrichment, but resumed it in 2006, insisting it was allowed under its agreement with the UN’s nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
It prompted years of international sanctions against Iran. After years of negotiations, Iran and six world powers in 2015 agreed to a nuclear deal that limited Iran’s nuclear threat in return for lighter sanctions.
The deal required Iran to keep its uranium enrichment levels at no more than 3.67 per cent, down from near 20 per cent, dramatically reduce its uranium stockpile, and phase out its centrifuges, among other measures. Uranium isn’t bomb-grade until it’s enriched to 90 per cent purity. And nuclear power plants that generate electricity use uranium that is enriched to between 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent.
It’s unclear how close Iran might be to actually building a nuclear bomb, if at all, but it has made significant progress in producing its key ingredient: highly enriched uranium. In recent years, it has sharply reduced the time needed to reach weapons-grade levels – now requiring just about a week to produce enough for one bomb.
In 2018, Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal and initiated new sanctions on the regime to cripple its economy. Tehran in turn said it would stop complying with parts of the agreement, and started increasing uranium enrichment and uranium stockpiles, and using advanced centrifuges. It removed all of the IAEA equipment previously installed for surveillance and monitoring activities.
The Biden administration then kicked off more than a year of indirect negotiations with Iran aimed at reviving the deal, but those broke down in 2022. In 2023, the IAEA said uranium particles enriched to 83.7 per cent purity—close to bomb-grade levels—were found at an Iranian nuclear facility. Its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60 per cent had also grown to 128.3 kilograms, the highest level then documented.
And last year, the US shortened Iran’s so-called “breakout time” – the amount of time needed to produce enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon – “to one or two weeks.”
An IAEA report sent to member states late last month said Iran’s stock of 60 per cent purity enriched uranium had now grown to 408 kilograms. That is enough, if enriched further, for nine nuclear weapons, according to an IAEA yardstick.
The IAEA has long accused Iran of violating its non-proliferation obligations, but on Thursday – for the first time in almost 20 years – its board passed a resolution officially declaring Iran in breach of those obligations. Iran promised to respond by escalating its nuclear activities.
Enrichment is a process that increases the amount of uranium-235, a special type of uranium used to power nuclear reactors or, in much higher amounts, to make nuclear weapons.Natural uranium is mostly uranium 238 – about 99.3 per cent, which isn’t good for power or bombs. Only about 0.7 per cent is uranium 235, the part needed to release energy.
For nuclear energy use, that tiny amount of useful uranium-235 needs to be concentrated. To do this, uranium is first turned into a gas, then spun at high speeds in machines called centrifuges. These machines help separate uranium-235 from the more common uranium-238. That is what enrichment is.
Uranium used in nuclear power plants is typically enriched to about 3.67 per cent. To make a nuclear bomb, it needs to be enriched to around 90 per cent. Iran has enriched uranium to 60 per cent – not enough for a bomb, but a major step closer to weapons-grade material.
Centrifuges are essential for enriching uranium. The more advanced the centrifuge, the faster and more efficiently it can separate uranium-235 from uranium-238 – shortening the time needed to produce nuclear fuel or, potentially, weapons-grade material. Iran has spent decades improving its centrifuge technology, starting with its first-generation IR-1 model in the late 1980s. Today, it operates thousands of machines, including advanced models like the IR-6 and IR-9.According to the Arms Control Association, Iran’s current centrifuge capacity could allow it to produce enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb in less than two weeks.

"Countries call for restraint, return to talks",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323981-countries-call-for-restraint-return-to-talks,"ISLAMABAD: The United Nations and the international community Sunday largely responded with alarm and calls for restraint following the US attacks on three nuclear sites in Iran.
In the Arab countries, the reaction to the US strikes on the Iranian nuclear sites ranged from ‘concern’ to ‘condemnation’. Saudi Arabia, which resumed ties with Tehran in a Chinese-brokered detente in 2023, expressed “great concern” over the attacks.
Qatar, which hosts the biggest US military base in the Middle East, said it feared “catastrophic consequences” for the region and the entire world. The United Arab Emirates also expressed concern, calling for “an immediate end to the escalation”.
Iraq, another country that hosts US bases, expressed “deep concern and strong condemnation”, government spokesperson Basim Alawadi said, calling the attacks “a grave threat to peace and security in the Middle East”. Fears are growing in Iraq over a possible intervention by the armed factions, who have threatened Washington’s interests in the region if it joins Israel in attacking Iran.
Lebanon: Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, largely seen as close to the United States, urged both sides to resume talks to restore stability. Egypt also condemned the escalation, warning of “dangerous repercussions”, while Jordan’s foreign ministry voiced “deep concern”.
Foreign ministers from the OIC countries Sunday urged Israel to end its aggression towards Iran, without mentioning the US strikes on the Islamic republic’s nuclear sites. Yemen’s Huthis repeated threats to target US vessels and warships in the Red Sea after the overnight strikes, which they described as a “war declaration” on the Iranian people. On Saturday, the group threatened to resume attacks on US vessels and warships in the Red Sea, despite a recent truce, should Washington strike Iran.
Hamas also condemned what it called “blatant US aggression” against Iran. Lebanese armed group Hezbollah condemned in the “strongest terms, the barbaric [and] treacherous” US attack on Iran. “It constitutes a reckless, dangerous, and uncalculated escalation that threatens to expand the circle of war and push the region and the world toward the unknown if it is not stopped and deterrent measures are not taken,” Hezbollah said in a statement in Arabic. “This aggression confirms the full and direct partnership between America and Israel in planning and execution, not only in the war against the Islamic Republic, but also in all the wars and crimes the region is facing, in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen.”
“We believe that these attacks will not deter Iran from continuing its progress and development,” it added.  Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, “I am gravely alarmed by the use of force by the United States against Iran today.”
“This is a dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge – and a direct threat to international peace and security”, he said, adding that there is a “growing risk” that this conflict could “rapidly get out of control – with catastrophic consequences for civilians, the region, and the world”.
Guterres called on member states to “de-escalate” and “uphold their obligations under the UN Charter and other rules of international law”. “At this perilous hour, it is critical to avoid a spiral of chaos. There is no military solution. The only path forward is diplomacy. The only hope is peace.”
Deputy Head of President Vladimir Putin’s Security Council Dmitry Medvedev said several nations would be ready to provide Iran with nuclear weapons. He did not say which countries, but added the US attack caused minimal damage and would not stop Tehran from pursuing nuclear weapons. Russia’s foreign ministry said it strongly condemned the US attacks. “The irresponsible decision to subject the territory of a sovereign state to missile and bomb attacks, whatever the arguments it may be presented with, flagrantly violates international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council,” the ministry said in its statement.
The Chinese foreign ministry Sunday said it “strongly condemns” US strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites, that “seriously violate the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and international law, and have exacerbated tensions in the Middle East”. “China calls on the parties to the conflict, Israel in particular, to reach a ceasefire as soon as possible, ensure the safety of civilians, and start dialogue and negotiation,” the ministry said on X. “China stands ready to work with the international community to pool efforts together and uphold justice, and work for restoring peace and stability in the Middle East,” it added.
The EU’s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called for de-escalation and return to negotiations. “I urge all sides to step back, return to the negotiating table and prevent further escalation,” Kallas wrote on X, adding Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and that EU foreign ministers will discuss the situation on Monday.
French President Emmanuel Macron Sunday warned against an “uncontrolled escalation” in the Middle East after the United States joined Israel’s campaign against Tehran’s atomic programme by bombing Iranian nuclear sites. “No strictly military response can produce the desired effects,” Macron told a defence council meeting in Paris. “Resumption of diplomatic and technical discussions is the only way to achieve the goal we all seek, which is to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons,” he added.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer Sunday urged Iran to return to the negotiating table and said stability in the region remained a priority, according to a statement from Downing Street. “Iran’s nuclear programme is a grave threat to international security. Iran can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and the US has taken action to alleviate that threat,” Starmer said in a statement. Chancellor Frederick Merz called on Iran to immediately re-enter nuclear talks with the US so there can be a diplomatic solution, according to government spokesperson. “The Chancellor and security cabinet ministers will coordinate closely with their European Union and US partners throughout the day,” spokesman Stefan Kornelius said in a statement.
“Now we hope that, after this attack, which caused massive damage to nuclear weapons production and posed a threat to the entire region, a de-escalation can begin and Iran can sit down at the negotiating table,” Italy’s Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told state broadcaster RAI.
Switzerland urged all parties to exercise maximum restraint and immediately return to diplomacy. “Switzerland emphasises the importance of full respect for international law, including the UN Charter and international humanitarian law,” the foreign ministry said on its website.

US bombing of Iran started with a fake-out,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323982-us-bombing-of-iran-started-with-a-fake-out,"WASHINGTON: As Operation “Midnight Hammer” got underway on Saturday, a group of B-2 bombers took off from their base in Missouri and were noticed heading out toward the Pacific island of Guam, in what experts saw as possible pre-positioning for any US decision to strike Iran. But they were a decoy.
The real group of seven bat-winged, B-2 stealth bombers flew east undetected for 18 hours, keeping communications to a minimum, refuelling in mid-air, the US military revealed on Sunday.
As the bombers neared Iranian airspace, a US submarine launched more than two dozen Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles. US fighter jets flew as decoys in front of the bombers to sweep for any Iranian fighter jets and missiles.
The attack on Iran’s three main nuclear sites was the largest operational strike ever by B-2 stealth bombers, and the second-longest B-2 operation ever flown, surpassed only by those following the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States by al Qaeda.
The B-2 bombers dropped 14 bunker-busting GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrators, each weighing 30,000 pounds. The operation involved over 125 U.S. military aircraft, according to the Pentagon.
From the US military’s perspective, the operation was a resounding tactical success. The Iranians were unable to get off a single round at the American aircraft and were caught completely flat-footed, General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon on Sunday.
“Iran’s fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran’s surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission,” Caine said. “We retained the element of surprise.”Caine said initial battle damage assessments indicated that all three sites targeted sustained extremely severe damage and destruction, but he declined to speculate whether any Iranian nuclear capabilities might still be intact.
US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was more confident. “It was clear we devastated the Iranian nuclear program,” he said, standing alongside Caine in the Pentagon briefing room.Midnight Hammer was highly classified, Caine said, “with very few people in Washington knowing the timing or nature of the plan.” Many senior officials in the United States only learned of it on Saturday night from President Donald Trump’s first post on social media.
Hegseth said it took months of preparations to ensure the US military would be ready if Trump ordered the strikes. Caine said the mission itself, however, came together in just a matter of weeks.
What happens next is unclear. Gulf states, home to multiple US military bases, were on high alert on Sunday as they weighed the risks of a widening conflict in the region. Guarding against blowback, the US military also dispersed US military assets in the Middle East and heightened force protection for US troops.
Hegseth said the US military was positioned to defend itself in the Middle East, but also to respond against Iran if it goes through with longstanding threats to retaliate.
The Trump administration said it is not looking for a wider war with Iran, with Hegseth saying private messages had been sent to Tehran encouraging them to negotiate. But Trump has also warned Iran that the US is prepared to hit additional targets if needed, using far greater force. “Iran would be smart to heed those words. He said it before, and he means it,” Hegseth said.

B-2 stealth bomber priciest warplane on earth used in Iran strikes,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323983-b-2-stealth-bomber-priciest-warplane-on-earth-used-in-iran-strikes,"WASHINGTON: The US Air Force’s B-2 Spirit stealth bombers were involved in strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites on Saturday. The B-2 is one of America’s most advanced strategic weapons platforms, capable of entering sophisticated air defences and delivering precision strikes against hardened targets such as Iran’s buried network of nuclear research facilities.
The US B-2 costs about $2.1 billion each, making it the most expensive military aircraft ever built. Made by Northrop Grumman NOC.N, the bomber, with its cutting-edge stealth technology, began its production run in the late 1980s but was curbed by the fall of the Soviet Union. Only 21 were made after the Pentagon’s planned acquisition program was truncated.
The bomber’s range of over 6,000 nautical miles (11,112 km) without refueling enables global strike capabilities from continental US bases. With aerial refueling, the B-2 can reach virtually any target worldwide, as demonstrated in missions from Missouri to Afghanistan and Libya and now Iran.
Its payload capacity of more than 40,000 pounds (18,144 kg) allows the aircraft to carry a diverse array of conventional and nuclear weapons. The bomber’s internal weapons bays are specifically designed to maintain stealth characteristics while accommodating large ordnance loads which could include two GBU-57A/B MOP (Massive Ordnance Penetrator), a 30,000-pound precision-guided “bunker buster” bomb.
Reports said six bunker buster bombs were used on Iran’s Fordow research site.The B-2’s two-pilot crew configuration reduces personnel requirements while maintaining operational effectiveness through advanced automation systems.
The B-2’s stealth technology incorporates radar-absorbing materials and angular design features that minimize detection by enemy air defense systems. Its radar cross-section is reportedly comparable to that of a small bird, making it nearly invisible to conventional radar.
The 30,000-pound MOP represents the largest conventional bomb in the US arsenal, specifically engineered to defeat hardened underground bunkers. Its massive size requires the B-2 to carry only one or two MOPs per mission, but provides unmatched bunker-penetration capability.
The weapon’s 20.5-foot (6.25-m) length and GPS-guided precision targeting system enable accurate strikes against specific underground facilities. Its penetration capability of over 200 feet through hardened concrete makes it effective against the world’s most protected underground installations.
Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) provide the B-2 with precision conventional strike capability against fixed targets. These GPS-guided weapons can be deployed in large numbers, with the bomber capable of simultaneously engaging multiple targets with high accuracy.
Joint Standoff Weapons (JSOW) extend the aircraft’s engagement range while maintaining stealth characteristics during approach. These glide bombs allow the B-2 to strike targets from outside heavily defended airspace perimeters.
Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missiles (JASSM) offer long-range precision strike capability with their own stealth features. The extended-range JASSM-ER variant provides strike options against targets over 500 miles (805 km) away.
The B-2 Spirit serves as a key component of America’s nuclear triad, capable of delivering strategic nuclear weapons with stealth and precision. The aircraft can carry up to 16 B83 nuclear bombs.

"Trump betrayed not only Iran, but his own voters as well: Araghchi",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323984-trump-betrayed-not-only-iran-but-his-own-voters-as-well-araghchi,"ISTANBUL: The United States and Israel crossed a major red line in attacking Iran’s nuclear facilities, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi warned on Sunday, saying he was heading to Russia for talks with President Vladimir Putin.
Araghchi arrived in Moscow later on Sunday for talks after the US attack on key nuclear facilities, Iran’s state media reported.“They crossed a very big red line by attacking (Iran’s) nuclear facilities,” Araghchi said on the sidelines of a meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in Istanbul.
He was speaking just hours after President Donald Trump said US warplanes struck three Iranian nuclear sites, nine days into an Israeli bombing campaign targeting its nuclear facilities.
“The most dangerous one happened only last night,” Araghchi said, while acknowledging he did not know the full extent of the damage done in the strikes, including one at the underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo.
“I still do not have exact information about the level of damages, but I don’t think it matters... Last night’s attack was a grave crime,” he said.“Through this action, the United States has dealt a serious blow to international peace and security,” he said, vowing that Iran would defend itself “by all means necessary against... US military aggression”.
Araghchi said he would head to Moscow on Sunday and hold talks with Putin on Monday morning. “I’m going to Moscow this afternoon” to hold “serious consultations with the Russian president tomorrow”, he said.
After the strikes, Trump said Iran “must now agree to end this war”. But Araghchi said any demand to return to negotiations was “irrelevant”. “The world must not forget that it was the United States which—in the midst of a process to forge a diplomatic outcome—betrayed diplomacy by supporting the genocidal Israeli regime’s launch of an illegal war of aggression on the Iranian nation,” he said.
“So we were in diplomacy, but we were attacked... They have proved that they are not men of diplomacy, and they only understand the language of threat and force.”—AFP
News Desk adds: Araghchi also accused Trump of betraying not only Iran, but his own supporters as well. He said Trump was elected on a platform of putting an end to “America’s costly involvement in ‘forever wars’”.
“He has betrayed not only Iran by abusing our commitment to diplomacy, but also deceived his own voters by submitting to the wishes of a wanted war criminal who has grown accustomed to exploiting the lives and wealth of American citizens to further the Israeli regime’s objectives,” said Araghchi, referring to Netanyahu.

Govt mulls three taxation measures to raise Rs36bn,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323985-govt-mulls-three-taxation-measures-to-raise-rs36bn,"ISLAMABAD: The government has proposed three additional taxation measures to raise Rs36 billion and to bridge the gap created by a 10 percent salary hike and a reduction in GST on solar panels. These measures have been taken in response to IMF’s demand to avoid breaching on agreed fiscal framework for the budget 2025-26 in line with the IMF agreement.
Three new taxation measures would be incorporated into the revised Finance Bill for 2025-26 at the time of getting parliament approval. These revenue measures include Federal Excise Duty of 10pc on Day Old Chicks (DOC) of poultry sector, rate of tax increased from 25pc to 29pc on dividend received by a company from mutual fund deriving income from profit on debt, Withholding Tax to be increased from 15 to 20pc on profit on government securities paid to any person (institutional investors) other than an individual.
Although, the IMF is still not fully satisfied on the number crunching undertaken by the Finance Ministry and FBR and pressing upon tax authorities to calculate revenue impact rightly. Otherwise, the revenue gap would leave the Pak authorities with no other option but to unveil mini-budget to fill the gap.
The IMF has estimated the hike in salaries of public sector employees from 6 to 10pc would have an estimated cost of Rs29-30 billion. The import of solar panels with GST rate of 18pc envisaged to fetch revenues of Rs20 billion, but with reduction in tax rate to 10pc would have an effect of Rs6 to 8 billion.
In totality, the IMF asked the government to take additional measures of Rs36 to 38 billion to bridge the gap created through announcement of government after presenting the budget.
Details of additional revenue measures were shared by Chairman FBR Rashid Mahmood Langrial with National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance here on Sunday. He said new taxation measures of Rs36 billion would be taken to overcome financial gap on account of reduction in Sales Tax from 18pc to 10pc on solar panels and proposed increase in salary for government employees from 6 to 10pc.
New taxation measures would be made part of amendments to the Finance Bill. In budget (2025-26), the FBR has taken new taxation measures of Rs312 billion and enforcement measures of Rs389 billion for 2025-26.
Excluding Rs8.5 billion due to decrease in Sales Tax on solar panels, the net revenue impact of taxation measures now stood at Rs339.5 billion for the next fiscal year. The NA panel approved Finance Bill (2025-26) with the approval of certain recommendations of the Senate Committee as well as recommendations of NA Finance Committee.
The FBR chairman informed the committee there was a financial gap of around Rs35-36 billion including Rs12 billion due to increase in salary and Rs8.5 billion on account of reduction in Sales Tax on solar panels. The federal government also added some amount for distribution of revenue to the provinces under the NFC Award.
The FBR chairman said the government had shared six new taxation measures with the IMF. Out of these six measures, three have been approved by the IMF. The Finance Committee was informed a uniform tax rate of 10pc would be applicable on imported raw cotton and local cotton. Both types of cotton would now be treated at par.

What if Iran blocks Strait of Hormuz?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323987-what-if-iran-blocks-strait-of-hormuz,"ISLAMABAD: The world is on the brink of a global economic crisis as Iran threatens to block the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow 33-kilometer-wide stretch of water carrying a fifth of the world’s daily oil supply.
While this strategic waterway remains open for now, analysts fear escalation by the US-backed Israel could put the vital shipping route at risk if Iran chooses to impose a blockade or attack the vessels.  In view of experts, any disruption could send prices skyrocketing, destabilize economies and trigger a new energy crisis.
The oil lane is so vital because no real alternatives exist. Most Gulf oil cannot be rerouted without massive delays. It is the only deep-water route capable of handling the world’s largest crude tankers.
According to the US Energy Information Administration, 20 million barrels of oil — 20 percent of global consumption — pass through the Strait of Hormuz every day, along with one-fifth of world’s liquefied natural gas trade, primarily from Qatar.
Pundits of economy fear closure of the route could cause sudden oil price surge that would increase inflation, energy costs and disrupt industries across Europe. Manufacturing, transport and agriculture sectors would be especially vulnerable. Market reactions and volatility in European stock exchanges could be a knock-on effect.
Further, a blockade could further trigger military confrontations involving the US, EU navies and Gulf states, risking a broader regional war. Europe might be drawn into the conflict through NATO obligations or alliances, especially with countries like France or the UK maintaining naval presence in the region.
Beyond oil, the Strait is a key route for global shipping. Disruption could delay European imports of raw materials, electronics and consumer goods, affecting supply chains. Insurance premiums for shipping could spike, raising costs for European businesses and consumers.
According to Independent Commodity Intelligence Services, the end-result would be a loss of 312,000 tonnes of total Middle East HDPE exports, 240,000 tonnes of LDPE and 370,000 tonnes of LLDPE, assuming the waterway is completely shut for a month. This would account for between 8-14pc of our assessments of global monthly production of HDPE, LDPE and LLDPE.
The damage wouldn’t end with the loss of Middle East petrochemicals exports. The loss of exports would be just the tip of the iceberg. “The Strait of Hormuz is the world’s most important oil chokepoint because of large volumes of oil that flow through the Strait. In 2018, its daily oil flow averaged 21 million barrels per day, or the equivalent of about 21pc of global petroleum liquids consumption,” writes the US Energy Information Administration in its latest review of the energy corridor’s importance.
An escalation in the Middle East conflict could have a “huge impact on global trade”, the boss of the oil company Shell has warned, as Donald Trump suggested US could enter the air war between Israel and Iran.
Shell, one of the biggest traders of oil and natural gas in the world, said it had contingency plans in case the conflict disrupted flows from the region. There is a risk a blockage in the Strait of Hormuz could shock the energy market.
Reports suggest with the fall in oil, naphtha and natural gas-liquids exports would come a fall in petrochemicals production outside the Middle East. Many refinery-petrochemicals complexes and standalone steam crackers, based on imported Middle East oil and naphtha, would have to cut production.
Similarly, affected would be propane dehydrogenation plants dependent on Middle East propane. Condensate splitters, which convert Middle East condensates into light and heavy naphtha for petrochemicals production, would also struggle to operate.

Israel-Iran conflict: Dozens of passenger aircraft stranded,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323988-israel-iran-conflict-dozens-of-passenger-aircraft-stranded,"KARACHI: Thirty-three passenger planes from various countries including Air India, Turkey, Qatar, Germany, Emirates, and the US have been stranded due to the closure of airspace during the Israel-Iran war.
Several hundred crew members of these planes are also stuck in these countries. Emirates Airline’s Boeing 777, flight EK977, landed at Tehran’s Imam Khomeini Airport from Dubai on June 13, but the return flight was canceled due to the Israeli attack on Iran. Three Turkish low-cost Pegasus Air flights, PC 6624, 1637 and 512, landed at Imam Khomeini Airport from Mersin, Ankara and Istanbul on the same night. Among them, one A321 and two A320 aircraft were unable to return. Turkey’s private Airtel Wing’s Boeing 737 flight T1971 also landed in Tehran from Mersin that night. The MD97 plane of the African country Comoros, flight D1, had arrived in Tehran from Istanbul at Mehrabad Airport but could not return.
Pegasus Air flight PC 6646 also arrived at Tabriz Airport that night. On June 13, Pegasus Air flight PC 524 from Istanbul landed in Shiraz. It could not return. A private plane with American registration is still at Iran’s Sari Airport. Flight QR 436 from Doha arrived at Salmaniya Airport in Iraq on June 13. The Airbus A320 and 321 aircraft were unable to go back. Pegasus Air’s brand new Airbus A321 aircraft, flight PC656, and Turkish Air flight TK802, arrived in Baghdad on June 13 but were unable to return when the war broke out. Five more US-registered planes and helicopters were also unable to depart for their destinations at Baghdad Airport. South African Flight 19 is also stuck in Baghdad. A Boeing 737 aircraft of Iran’s Soufran Air landed at Najaf Airport from Mashhad on June 12, but was unable to return due to the outbreak of war. A brand new A321 aircraft of Turkey’s Pegasus Air, flight PC 820, and a Qatar Air A320 aircraft, flight QR 454, arrived at Erbil Airport in Iraq and were unable to return. A Qatari Leonardo helicopter and a US Army Boeing plane are also stranded at Erbil Airport.
A Gulfstream, EgyptAir Boeing 737 aircraft from the Cayman Islands are also stranded at Jordan’s Aman Sol Airport. A private Iraqi Hawker plane arrived in Amman from Erbil but was unable to return. A small private American plane and a Serbian Piper plane are also at Amman Civil Airport. An Airbus A330 aircraft of Turkish MNG Airlines arrived at Jordan’s Aman Queen Alia Airport as flight MB 197 from Istanbul but was unable to go back. Air India’s Boeing 787 aircraft, which arrived from Delhi on May 31 as a flight to Amman Queen Alia Airport in Jordan, suffered a technical fault and is still at the airport. An A320 aircraft of Germany’s Lufthansa Air, an A320 aircraft of Bahrain’s Gulf Air, and an A330 aircraft of Germany’s Discover Air are also present at Aman Queen Alia Airport.
Several major international airlines, including Delta, Air Canada, Emirates, Lufthansa, Qatar, KLM, and Swiss, have been forced to suspend or adjust flights due to the ongoing geopolitical unrest. With airspace closures, security concerns, and the safety of passengers and crew as top priorities, these airlines have made bold decisions to cancel or reroute services. This has caused widespread disruptions in global travel, impacting routes across the Middle East and beyond, as airlines respond to the ever-evolving crisis.
The escalating tensions between the United States, Israel, and Iran have significantly disrupted global aviation, with a growing number of airlines suspending, canceling, or rerouting flights in response to the volatile situation. As airspace closures and safety concerns intensify, travelers are faced with substantial changes in flight schedules. Key international airlines, including Delta, Air Canada, Emirates, Lufthansa, Qatar Airways, KLM, and Swiss, have made sweeping decisions to ensure the safety of their passengers.
Airlines from the US, UK, Canada, France and other countries have cancelled 52 Emirates flights due to serious security concerns. Of the cancelled flights, 32 are from Dubai and 20 are from Abu Dhabi Airport.

Strikes on Iran mark Trump’s biggest and riskiest foreign policy gamble,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323989-strikes-on-iran-mark-trump-s-biggest-and-riskiest-foreign-policy-gamble,"WASHINGTON: With his unprecedented decision to bomb Iran’s nuclear sites, directly joining Israel’s air attack on its regional arch foe, US President Donald Trump has done something he had long vowed to avoid - intervene militarily in a major foreign war.
The dramatic US strike, including the targeting of Iran’s most heavily fortified nuclear installation deep underground, marks the biggest foreign policy gamble of Trump’s two presidencies and one fraught with risks and unknowns.
Trump, who insisted on Saturday that Iran must now make peace or face further attacks, could provoke Tehran into retaliating by closing the Strait of Hormuz, the world’s most important oil artery, attacking US military bases and allies in the Middle East, stepping up its missile barrage on Israel and activating proxy groups against American and Israeli interests worldwide, analysts said.
Such moves could escalate into a broader, more protracted conflict than Trump had envisioned, evoking echoes of the “forever wars” that America fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, which he had derided as “stupid” and promised never to be dragged into.
“The Iranians are seriously weakened and degraded in their military capabilities,” said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations. “But they have all sorts of asymmetric ways that they can respond... This is not going to end quick.”
In the lead-up to the bombing that he announced late on Saturday, Trump had vacillated between threats of military action and appeals for renewed negotiation topersuade Iran to reach a deal to dismantle its nuclear programme.
A senior White House official said that once Trump was convinced that Tehran had no interest in reaching a nuclear agreement, he decided the strikes were “the right thing to do”.
Trump gave the go-ahead once he was assured of a “high probability of success,” the official said – a determination reached after more than a week of Israeli air attacks on Iran’s nuclear and military facilities paved the way for the US to deliver the potentially crowning blow.Trump touted the “great success” of the strikes, which he said included the use of massive “bunker-buster bombs” on the main site at Fordow. But some experts suggested that while Iran’s nuclear programme may have been set back for many years, the threat may be far from over.
Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon, saying its programme is for purely peaceful purposes.“In the long term, military action is likely to push Iran to determine nuclear weapons are necessary for deterrence and that Washington is not interested in diplomacy,” the Arms Control Association, a non-partisan US-based organisation that advocates for arms control legislation, said in a statement.
“Military strikes alone cannot destroy Iran’s extensive nuclear knowledge. The strikes will set Iran’s programme back, but at the cost of strengthening Tehran’s resolve to reconstitute its sensitive nuclear activities,” the group said.
Eric Lob, assistant professor in the Department of Politics and International Relations at Florida International University, said Iran’s next move remains an open question and suggested that among its forms of retaliation could be to hit “soft targets” of the US and Israel inside and outside the region.
But he also said there was a possibility that Iran could return to the negotiating table – “though they would be doing so in an even weaker position” – or seek a diplomatic off-ramp.In the immediate aftermath of the US strikes, however, Iran showed little appetite for concessions.
Iran’s Atomic Energy Organisation said it would not allow development of its “national industry” to be stopped, and an Iranian state television commentator said every US citizen or military member in the region would now be legitimate targets.
Early on Sunday, Iran’s foreign ministry issued a statement warning that Tehran “considers it its right to resist with all its might against US military aggression”.
Karim Sadjadpour, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, posted on X: “Trump indicated this is now the time for peace. It’s unclear and unlikely the Iranians will see it the same way. This is more likely to open a new chapter of the 46-year-old US-Iran war than conclude it.”
Some analysts suggested that Trump, whose administration has previously disavowed any aim of dislodging the Iranian leadership, could be drawn into seeking “regime change” if Tehran carries out major reprisals or moves to build a nuclear weapon. That, in turn, would bring additional risks.
“Beware mission creep, aiming for regime change and democratisation campaigns,” said Laura Blumenfeld, a Middle East analyst at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington. “You’ll find the bones of many failed US moral missions buried in Middle East sands.”
Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy intelligence officer for the Middle East, said Iran’s leadership would quickly engage in “disproportionate attacks” if it felt its survival was imperiled.
But Tehran will also have to be mindful of the consequences, he said. While actions such as closing the Strait of Hormuz would pose problems for Trump with the resulting higher oil prices and potential US inflationary impact, it would also hurt China, one of Iran’s few powerful allies.
At the same time, Trump is already facing strong push-back from congressional Democrats against the Iran attack and will also have to contend with opposition from the anti-interventionist wing of his Republican MAGA base.
Trump, who faced no major international crisis in his first term, is now embroiled in one just six months into his second.Even if he hopes US military involvement can be limited in time and scope, the history of such conflicts often carries unintended consequences for American presidents.
Trump’s slogan of “peace through strength” will certainly be tested as never before, especially with his opening of a new military front after failing to meet his campaign promises to quickly end wars in Ukraine and Gaza.
“Trump is back in the war business,” said Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group. “I am not sure anyone in Moscow, Tehran or Beijing ever believed his spiel that he is a peacemaker. It always looked more like a campaign phrase than a strategy.”

"Pakistan-India ceasefire hinged on dialogue, but ‘that is not happening’: Bilawal",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323990-pakistan-india-ceasefire-hinged-on-dialogue-but-that-is-not-happening-bilawal,"ISLAMABAD: Former foreign minister and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has said that Islamabad agreed to a ceasefire with New Delhi last month on the understanding that the US will support a broader diplomatic process to address long-standing issues.
“At a time when the Pakistani Army believed that we had a military upper hand in the conflict, we agreed to a ceasefire because we believed there was a commitment from the United States that we’d go on to have a dialogue in a neutral location on all friction points,” he said.
“Now that isn’t happening. We don’t want the international community to get a false sense of ease as a result of the ceasefire. There’s still a very real threat,” said Bilawal in an interview with UK newspaper The Sunday Times, which he gave while leading a diplomatic mission paying visits to important world capitals to expose Indian aggression against Pakistan.
The nuclear-armed neighbouring arch-rivals had engaged in a serious military confrontation following India’s unprovoked missile attacks on targets within Pakistani territory last month.
The Pakistan Army launched a retaliatory operation named Bunyan-um-Marsoos (Iron Wall) to counter the Indian aggression, which New Delhi branded as a response to the alleged Pakistani involvement in the attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and  Kashmir’s (IIOJK) Pahalgam in April.
Both countries suffered losses of life and property while the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) downed at least six Indian fighter jets, including the expensive French aircraft, Rafale, while successfully defending the country’s territorial integrity. The 87-hour conflict, which raised fears of a nuclear war between the two countries, finally ended in a ceasefire brokered by the United States.The PPP chairman further warned that South Asia remains dangerously close to full-scale conflict, saying that during the recent escalation Islamabad had only “seconds” to determine whether a missile launched by New Delhi was nuclear-armed.
“On the final day of clashes, India deployed a dual-use cruise missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead,” he said. “In that atmosphere, you’ve got only a few seconds to decide looking at an image: is this missile going to be used within the nuclear connotation or not? And in those split seconds, decisions are made.”
He reiterated that Islamabad had nothing to do with the April attack in Pahalgam. “To this day, they [India] haven’t provided names, identities, or proof of cross-border infiltration,” he said.
Despite the ceasefire, Bilawal warned that conditions for conflict remain dangerously fragile. “We’ve achieved a ceasefire but we haven’t achieved peace. That’s problematic because we have lowered the threshold for full-blown military conflict to dangerously low levels.” The former foreign minister, who had served in the coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also accused the West of abandoning regional responsibilities, particularly in Afghanistan. “The rest of the world may have moved on from Afghanistan and exited Kabul, but we’re fighting terrorism from there,” he added.

1124 helpline set up to redress public complaints,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323991-1124-helpline-set-up-to-redress-public-complaints,"LAHORE: As directed by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the Directorate of Monitoring Cell has been established in the Home Department.
Special helpline 1124 has been set up for redressal of public complaints. Public can call for guidance or complaint related to jail department, civil defence, highway patrol and security companies. This facility can also be availed for reporting bombs or suspicious objects at any place.
The Punjab Highway Patrol contact system has been established for assistance or guidance during travel on major highways. Passengers can call 1124 for help in case of vehicle breakdown, robbery or any emergency.
Immediate action will be taken regarding overloading and careless driving on public transport. The CM highlighted, “People can call the helpline for medical assistance while traveling on any highway of Punjab.” Inappropriate behaviour of highway patrolling staff would be taken into account, she said.
The chief minister said a complaint could also be filed on 1124 regarding inappropriate behaviour of prison staff, like demanding bribes. Protection of legal rights of prisoners would be ensured, she vowed. Complaints related to security guards or security companies would be resolved immediately, she remarked. Action would be taken against the security company on complaint of a guard receiving less than prescribed wages.
She said complaints would be resolved regarding illegal sale or transfer of LPG gas. Even if there is no emergency exit system in a multi-storey building, or there is a lack of fire extinguishing arrangements at a petrol pump or gas station, information can be reported on the helpline.
The chief minister said the government was committed to protecting lives and property of the people. She warned neglect in redressal of public grievances would not be tolerated. The CM pointed out highway patrol was being reactivated to ensure safe travel on the highways.

Key Bangladesh party files case on alleged election rigging,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323992-key-bangladesh-party-files-case-on-alleged-election-rigging,"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s leading political party filed a case Sunday against former election commissioners it accuses of rigging past polls to keep now-ousted autocrat Sheikh Hasina in power.
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said it had lodged a complaint against 19 people including Hasina, who fled in August following weeks of protest against her rule.
“We have brought allegations of violating the constitution, breaching the electoral code of conduct, assisting a political party to win despite holding government positions, unleashing a reign of terror, and falsely declaring candidates as winners despite their failure to secure enough votes,” Salauddin Khan, a senior BNP leader, told reporters.
The BNP claimed Hasina’s election wins in 2014, 2018 and 2024 were achieved through repressive actions against opposition parties.Among those named in its case lodged at a Dhaka police station are three former top election commissioners -- Kazi Rakibuddin Ahmad, KM Nurul Huda, and Kazi Habibul Awal.
Other officials accused by the BNP include more election commissioners, commission secretaries, senior police and intelligence officials, and Hasina’s interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. All are no longer in office.
The party alleged that despite repeated requests to the election commission, no steps were taken over the years to ensure a level playing field.Instead, some opposition candidates were killed, subjected to enforced disappearances, or faced various forms of persecution.
According to the BNP, Hasina maintained her grip on power through her interior minister and senior police and intelligence officers, while the election commission turned a blind eye and declared her party’s candidates the winners.
Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus this month ordered the relevant government bodies to bring those allegedly responsible for irregularities at the election commission to justice.

Twenty killed in suicide bombing at Damascus church,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323993-twenty-killed-in-suicide-bombing-at-damascus-church,"DAMASCUS: At least 20 people were killed and dozens injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Mar Elias Church in the Dweila neighborhood of Syria’s capital Damascus on Sunday, health authorities and security sources said.
It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was toppled by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December.Syria’s interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State. He entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest, a ministry statement added.
A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two men were involved in the attack, including the one who blew himself up.Islamic State has been behind several attempted attacks on churches in Syria since Assad’s fall, but this was the first to succeed, another security source said.
Syria’s state news agency cited the health ministry as saying that 52 people were also injured in the blast.A livestream from the site by Syria’s civil defence, the White Helmets, showed scenes of destruction from inside the church, including a bloodied floor and shattered pews and masonry.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the offensive against Assad before taking over in January for a transitional phase, has repeatedly said he will protect minorities.
“We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,” the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.
“We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.”
Islamic State had previously targeted religious minorities, including a major attack on Shiite pilgrims in Sayeda Zainab in 2016 — one of the most notorious bombings during Assad’s rule. The latest assault underscores the group’s continued ability to exploit security gaps despite the collapse of its territorial control and years of counterterrorism efforts.

JI chief says US destroyed global peace by attacking Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323955-ji-chief-says-us-destroyed-global-peace-by-attacking-iran,"ISLAMABAD: Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Ameer Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has strongly condemned US attack on Iran, stating America has destroyed global peace through its aggression.
Speaking at Youth Digital Summit organised by JI Media Cell here Hafiz Naeem criticised Pakistan government for portraying Donald Trump as a “messenger of peace,” only for him to rain bombs on Iran.
He expressed outrage over massacre of innocent Palestinians in Gaza despite presence of 8.8 million troops in Muslim countries, calling America and Israel enemies of humanity.
Saying Pakistan was not Pakistan’s friend, Naeemur Rehman stressed, “We must free ourselves from both America and its puppets”.
He asked the youth to support global movements for truth and justice through digital platforms. Young people must become digital ambassadors and take to the streets to demand their rights. “Be vigilant so that we are not sold out again”, he warned.
Hafiz Naeemur Rehman inaugurated Read Maududi App, which will provide access to writings and materials related to Syed Abul A’la Maududi.
Naeemur Rehman condemned US attack on Iran, stating, “America has destroyed global peace by attacking Iran. Just yesterday, Trump claimed they would wait two weeks before taking action. At this point, US is ignoring all human and moral values. Its decline has begun, and unity is essential to counter it”.
JI leader highlighted ongoing atrocities by Israel, saying Israel has been committing genocide in Palestine for the past two years.
“Even though International Court of Justice has declared Israel guilty, no one is stopping it. Iran did not attack Israel, so why did Israel attack Iran”, he questioned.
He pointed out the grave humanitarian situation, noting, “Generations of Palestinians have been born in refugee camps, and hundreds remain imprisoned in Israeli jails”. He said Hamas’ struggle is in accordance with international law, but because of its resistance, US labels it as terrorism.
Trump, who was once called a “messenger of peace”, has dropped bombs weighing over 2000 kilograms on Iran, he said.
Hafiz Naeem said, “People of Gaza have shown the world its reflection. Despite Muslim countries having an army of 8.8 million, children in Gaza are being martyred daily”, he noted.
Head of JI Media Cell Salman Sheikh said Jamaat-e-Islami has the most organised youth, saying they want to make the youth voice of Pakistan and Islam.
Secretary General Women Wing Jamaat-e-Islami, Humaira Tariq, said youth are future of the country. They want to do a lot for Pakistan. She was addressing Youth Digital Summit at the Convention Centre. Humaira Tariq said the oppressed people of Gaza have written a new chapter in history with their sacrifices.

Leghari orders no power cuts during Muharram,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323956-leghari-orders-no-power-cuts-during-muharram,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Power Awais Leghari Sunday directed all the distribution companies (DISCOs) across the country to ensure uninterrupted power supply during Muharram ul Haram.
In a letter addressed to the chairmen and chief executive officers of all power distribution companies, the minister emphasized the critical importance of seamless power supply during the month particularly, as millions of citizens are expected to participate in the nationwide congregations and processions.
Highlighting the extreme weather conditions, including heatwaves, Leghari stressed that the citizens must be protected from any form of discomfort or disruption during the observance of religious ceremonies.
He ordered immediate repair and replacement of all damaged or malfunctioning electrical equipment in areas of DISCOs.
Formation of emergency response teams in each distribution company will be on high alert on Youm-e-Ashur. He emphasized regular coordination with the district administrations, law-enforcement agencies, and religious organizations to ensure smooth operations.
The minister directed advance intimation to the Imambargahs, mosques, and key users about any scheduled maintenance or potential load management plans.

"PTI seeks immediate release of Imran, inclusion in strategic decision-making",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323957-pti-seeks-immediate-release-of-imran-inclusion-in-strategic-decision-making,"ISLAMABAD: Slamming the US strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) urged the government on Sunday to immediately convene an All Parties Conference (APC) on the rapidly deteriorating regional situation and formulate a consensus-based policy on the belligerent Israel.
In the light of escalating crisis, PTI Information Secretary Waqas Akram called for immediate release of PTI founder Imran Khan and his inclusion in strategic decision-making regarding the situation arising out of Israel’s unprovoked attack on Iran and the subsequent US strikes on the country.
He contended that Tel Aviv was pushing the entire region to the brink of a devastating war. He also expressed alarm that the regional situation was fast changing and the government’s “ostrich-like” approach could prove disastrous.
In a statement, he said the flames of the war had already reached Pakistan’s doorstep and underlined that Pakistan can undoubtedly weather the storm, just as it did against India, “but the power elite must take the nation into confidence and forge a consensus-driven approach because Pakistan is currently caught between a rock and a hard place”.
Akram praised Imran Khan’s foresight, noting that a week earlier he had sent a message through his sisters to postpone the protest for two weeks due to the Iran-Israel conflict.
“(US President) Donald Trump issued a deceptive signal, claiming he would not engage in the Israel war for the next two weeks,” he said, claiming: “Khan’s famous quote—‘No one understands the West better than me’—proved to be true.”
He recalled that the PTI founder had stated on the floor of the House that Pakistan could partner with the US in peace, but not in war, as the country had already paid an immeasurable cost in terms of both lives and resources for siding with the US in its meaningless and unnecessary wars.
Waqas said Israel could not have invaded Iran without the strong backing and support of the US, which was evident from the airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities even after Tehran was given a two-week ultimatum, simply at the behest of Israeli prime minister.
“The US not only violated Iran’s sovereignty but also breached the UN Charter and resorted to an act that could have far-reaching and catastrophic consequences at both regional and international levels,” he added.

Kashmir settlement imperative for lasting peace: Dar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323958-kashmir-settlement-imperative-for-lasting-peace-dar,"ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister (DPM/FM) Muhammad Ishaq Dar said a peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was imperative for a lasting peace in South Asia.
In a statement made at the meeting of OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir in Istanbul, he said, “South Asian region is home to over one-fifth of the world population and it could ill-afford the consequences of irresponsible Indian actions. “Today’s meeting is taking place at an important juncture as our brothers and sisters in Palestine and Iran are facing Israel’s relentless onslaught. Only last month, Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir were also attacked by India. The attacks by Israel and India set a dangerous precedent for unilateral aggression,” he added.
“In future, the arguments being extended by these aggressors could be exploited to launch attacks on other countries as well. In these challenging times, the Islamic unity and joint Islamic action are required more than ever. The current Indian designs in Jammu and Kashmir are, in fact, a replication of the Israeli designs in Palestine. The script being enacted by Israel and India - in Palestine and Kashmir respectively - is essentially the same with particular reference to egregious human rights violations and blatantly illegal attempts to changing the demographics,” he explained.
He was of the view that the situations were worsening and called for the urgent attention of the international community for a peaceful resolution, in accordance with the relevant UN Resolutions and aspirations of the local people. “This attention, however, must not be aimed at legitimizing the status quo. Illegal and lopsided solutions cannot be unilaterally imposed. Only those solutions could bring the lasting peace, which are in conformity with the international law. The true peace is characterized by prevalence of justice, not absence of violence,” he remarked.
He recalled that India attacked Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, without any verifiable evidence or a credible investigation into the Pahalgam attack of 22 April 2025. “It chose the path of belligerence and aggression despite an offer by the Prime Minister of Pakistan for a transparent and independent probe into this tragic incident. Most deplorably, India did not pay heed to the calls for restraint, made by the international community, including the United Nations and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation,” he added.
“During the intervening night of 6 and 7 May 2025, India deliberately targeted the civilian areas on the false pretext of presence of terrorist infrastructure, resulting in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children. India’s unprovoked firing and shelling at the Line of Control also resulted in the loss of precious lives, houses and other assets. In view of India’s unabated aggression, Pakistan was constrained to respond in line with Article 51 of the UN Charter to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Our response, in the early hours of 10 May 2025, was mature, calibrated, restrained, and targeted only against military installations. The purpose of our action was to demonstrate our right, will and capability to defend our territory and people.”
“The Deputy Prime Minister said, “Today, Pakistan remains firmly committed to upholding the ceasefire and promoting an environment of regional stability. However, at a time when international efforts are being made for regional peace and stability, the statements emerging from India reflect an aggressive and belligerent approach. India is fabricating misleading narratives to justify aggression. These rhetorical statements must stop.” He said that the Indian authorities exploited the Pahalgam attack to launch a massive crackdown in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. “There are reports that over 2800 Kashmiris were arrested or questioned in the immediate aftermath of the attack.
The draconian Public Safety Act was slapped on at least 75 of them. Police carried out extensive searches at multiple residences of the locals. Around three dozen houses were razed to ground through the use of explosives. “Ishaq Dar said, “In the last 78 years, India has tried different methods to consolidate its occupation of the large parts of Jammu and Kashmir.”

Iran to continue its nuclear programme: ambassador,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323959-iran-to-continue-its-nuclear-programme-ambassador,"ISLAMABAD: Iran’s Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam on Sunday asserted that Iran would continue its nuclear program despite US attacks on its nuclear sites.
Speaking at a press conference here at the National Press Club, Islamabad, he said the Iranian nuclear program was for peaceful purposes, including generating electricity and others, emphasizing that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) had declared the nuclear program peaceful fifteen times, said a press release.
He said that negotiations on Iran’s nuclear program were ongoing when Israel attacked and martyred its prominent nuclear scientists, military commanders, to which Iran responded with missiles it had developed. He also declared Israeli and American attacks on Iran a clear violation of international law, calling that Israel could not face Iranian missiles for ten days. “Iran will respond to the US in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Iran will target Americans around the world,” he added.
He thanked the Pakistani government for condemning the attacks on Iranian soil. The Iranian nuclear commission was investigating the situation after the US attacks so that the Iranian people can be protected from any emergency situation, he noted. “We are ready to fight this war for a long time with the guidance of our leadership and the help of our forces,” he said.
“We have not yet requested the supply of weapons from any country,” he added. In response to a question, the Iranian ambassador said that drones and other weapons had been recovered from people spying in Iran, adding that some Iranian people were also among those arrested.

Without ‘buyback guarantee’ pharma firms won’t invest in vaccine production: officials,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323970-without-buyback-guarantee-pharma-firms-won-t-invest-in-vaccine-production-officials,"ISLAMABAD: Without “buyback guarantees” from government of Pakistan, local pharmaceutical industry is unwilling to invest in indigenous vaccine production, as the process requires multimillion-dollar investments, officials and industry sources told The News.
Despite an annual expenditure of around Rs67 billion on vaccine procurement — currently co-financed by domestic budgets and Gavi, Vaccine Alliance — Pakistan remains heavily dependent on foreign vaccine manufacturers.
With Gavi’s support set to end by 2029, the entire financial burden of immunisation will shift to Pakistan’s federal and provincial governments, raising serious questions about sustainability and self-reliance. Yet, not a single local pharmaceutical company has stepped forward to invest in full-scale vaccine development.
Officials in Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (NHS,R&C) and Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) said vaccine production is a high-risk venture that demands substantial capital, cutting-edge technology transfers from abroad, trained human resources, cold-chain infrastructure, clinical trials and global quality certifications.
“No Pakistani pharmaceutical firm is willing to commit to large-scale vaccine production unless the government guarantees to buy their product”, a senior Health Ministry official said. Unfortunately, he said, for the last 10 years, successive governments have refused to provide such sovereign guarantees.
These guarantees, officials argue, are essential because the cost of domestically produced vaccines will be higher in the initial years. However, Pakistan’s current procurement rules only allow purchase of lowest-cost bids — usually offered by established multinational vaccine producers. This creates a structural disincentive for local manufacturers, who fear being priced out despite their investments.
“There is also an ever-present fear of accountability organizations”, official said. If a government official signs a procurement deal at a higher price to support local production, they fear being dragged into inquiries or anti-corruption proceedings, he added.
DRAP officials clarified while their role is regulatory facilitation, responsibility for vaccine development lies with National Institute of Health (NIH) and the private sector. “We are in talks with several international organisations to help build Pakistan’s vaccine production capacity. But ultimately, private sector must lead with government incentives”, a senior DRAP official said.
The absence of a comprehensive national strategy, funding commitments, or enabling regulatory policies has left Pakistan vulnerable. No locally produced therapeutic product except four medicines have received WHO prequalification, making them ineligible for international tenders floated by global procurement agencies such as Unicef or the Global Fund.
The urgency is mounting. Pakistan’s Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) currently provides vaccines for over 10 diseases, including polio, measles, tuberculosis and hepatitis B. High-value vaccines like pneumococcal conjugate (PCV) and pentavalent vaccines are largely subsidised by Gavi. But, with Gavi’s exit nearing, Pakistan must prepare to shoulder the full cost or risk major setbacks in its immunisation efforts.
To mitigate the looming crisis, Pakistani health authorities have begun exploring international partnerships. During a recent visit to Bali for 9th Asia Pacific Leaders’ Summit on Malaria Elimination, Federal State Minister for Health Dr Mukhtar Ahmed Bharath held discussions with his Indonesian counterpart Budi Gunadi Sadikin on joint vaccine production.
“Indonesia is performing impressively in vaccine manufacturing, and we are exploring ways to partner with them to establish a vaccine production facility in Pakistan”, Dr Bharath said.
Health experts warn unless Pakistan seizes this opportunity to build local capacity, it may find itself unable to afford critical vaccines after Gavi exits, leading to disease outbreaks, wastage of vaccine stocks, and further pressure on already fragile health system.
“Vaccine development isn’t just a scientific endeavour — it’s a political, economic and governance challenge”, a senior DRAP official emphasised. He said it requires a top-level, multi-stakeholder commitment, involving policy reforms, ease of doing business, international cooperation, and most critically, government-backed assurances to local industry. Until that happens, Pakistan’s dream of vaccine self-sufficiency will remain just a dream, he observed.
Chairman of Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA), Tauqeer-ul-Haq, echoed the concerns of industry leaders, saying no private firm would risk investing millions of dollars in vaccine production without a firm buyback guarantee from government.
“Vaccines are not over-the-counter products that can be sold in pharmacies or medical stores. They are procured almost exclusively by the governments. Without assurance of purchase, private sector simply won’t take the plunge”, he said.
Tauqeer-ul-Haq said a well-structured Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model is the most viable way forward, where the government provides an enabling environment, fiscal incentives and regulatory support to kickstart domestic vaccine development and ensure its sustainability.

11 FIA officials suspended over Lesco corruption charges,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323971-11-fia-officials-suspended-over-lesco-corruption-charges,"LAHORE: In a major crackdown on corruption, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has suspended 11 officials, including inspectors and sub-inspectors, from its Lahore Zone.
The suspensions came after findings from two inquiry reports highlighting collusion between FIA personnel and the officials of Lahore Electric Supply Company (LESCO).
The suspensions were recommended in the reports titled “Inquiry Report on Issues Related to LESCO” under Shahid Khan, former Federal Secretary, and “Inquiry Report: Corrupt Practices – Connivance of LESCO & FIA Officials” chaired by Sohail Habib Tajik, Additional Secretary (Admin), Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control.
Acting on the directives received from the Ministry on April 21 and April 29, FIA issued orders for immediate suspension and transfer of said officers from ACC FIA Lahore to FIA Headquarters Islamabad until further notice.
The order, signed by Additional Director HRM Syed Ali Akbar Shah, was issued with approval of Director General FIA. It reflects the agency’s commitment to internal accountability and zero-tolerance for misconduct and corruption.
The development follows mounting pressure for transparency and institutional reforms in energy and enforcement sectors amid public outcry over corruption.

Baloch leader killed in Khuzdar attack,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323973-baloch-leader-killed-in-khuzdar-attack,"QUETTA: Mir Atta Rehman Mengal, the son of former Balochistan Chief Minister and ex-Ambassador to Qatar Mir Naseer Mengal, was killed along with his five security guards in an armed attack in Khuzdar’s Aranji area late Saturday night.
His son, Mati-ur-Rehman Mengal, sustained serious injuries in the assault. According to security sources, unidentified armed men attacked the guesthouse of Mir Atta Rehman Mengal in the Wadh tehsil of Khuzdar district during the night between Saturday and Sunday. A heavy exchange of fire ensued, resulting in the deaths of Mir Atta Rehman Mengal and his five guards.
Security forces swiftly reached the scene and shifted the bodies to a nearby hospital. Mir Atta Rehman Mengal’s funeral prayers were offered in Badri, Wadh, on Saturday, and he was later laid to rest in his ancestral graveyard. Mir Atta Rehman Mengal was the brother of Mir Shafiq-ur-Rehman Mengal, head of the Jhalawan Awami Panel, and belonged to a well-known political family in Balochistan.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed deep sorrow and grief over the assassination of Mir Atta Rehman Mengal. He prayed for the elevation of the martyr’s ranks and extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved family, assuring them of the provincial government’s full support during this difficult time.
The Chief Minister also wished a swift recovery for Mir Mati-ur-Rehman Mengal, who was injured in the attack. Condemning the incident, CM Bugti called the assault a cowardly and reprehensible act of terrorism. He affirmed that the Balochistan government will conduct a thorough and transparent investigation to bring those responsible to justice. “The people and government of Balochistan stand united against terrorism, and such cowardly attacks cannot weaken our resolve,” he added.

From the opposing group, two brothers — Noor Shah Alam and Shah Buraaz (sons of Nooradeen) — lost their lives, and one woman was reported injured.A case was  registered on the complaint of Zahidullah (son of Sher Wali Khan), a resident of Khadri Mamandkhel.
He told police that they were digging soil for a water irrigation channel when Shah Buraaz and Shah Alam (sons of Hataylay) arrived unarmed and tried to stop them, leading to a scuffle.Soon after, Atlas Khan, Habibur Rehman alias Bateeri (sons of Hataylay), Zubair, and Mamoor Khan — all residents of Khadri Mamandkhel — arrived armed and opened fire on them.
Zahidullah stated that an ongoing land dispute was the root cause of the conflict.On the other hand, the wife of Faraz (from the second group) told police that they were harvesting okra on their land when the suspects — Sher Wali and Najeebullah (sons of Mah Buraaz), Bakhtullah, Sabghatullah (sons of Muhammad Daraz), Syed Alam (son of Saifullah), and five unidentified assailants — arrived and, following an altercation with her uncles, opened indiscriminate fire. She also cited a property dispute as the motive behind the attack.Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the scene and shifted the deceased and injured to the hospital.

Governor concerned over governance in KP,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323976-governor-concerned-over-governance-in-kp,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Sunday accused the provincial government of being unwilling to give up power at any cost, claiming that the current dispensation was merely bluffing about dissolving the provincial assembly.
Speaking to a delegation of journalists from Dera Ismail Khan, led by Muhammad Irfan Mughal and Saeedullah Marwat, he said that the KP government was desperate to pass the budget, even if it means using indirect means.
He added that despite the chief minister’s threats, meeting Imran Khan is not an option for the government, and it would find excuses to ensure the budget gets approved.The governor warned that the possibility of an emergency in the province could not be ruled out, and predicted that Gandapur would resort to any tactic necessary to remain in power.
During the meeting, which included journalists Muhammad Rehan, Naveed Sultan, M. Salahuddin, Ahmad Mughal, Abdullah Jan, Hammad, Nusrat, Adil Waqar and others, issues and public grievances were discussed.The governor expressed concern over the deteriorating security situation in the province and criticized the provincial government’s lack of interest.
He said that the survey for the Dera Ismail Khan International Airport was in progress, and the Lift Canal Project had entered the re-tendering phase under Wapda, with phased planning underway.On the issue of load-shedding, the governor said the power outages in Dera Ismail Khan were unbearable.
He rejected Wapda’s justification for low recoveries and pressure from Islamabad, saying that the public should be given control over feeders and that loadshedding should be proportional to recovery rates.
Highlighting the injustice stemming from the 1991 water agreement, he said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had not received its due water share and urged the federal government to grant the province its rightful share. He demanded that the provincial government should take control of local electricity distribution companies.
The governor revealed that 14,000 out of 24,000 Wapda posts in the province remained vacant, exacerbating the electricity crisis.He criticized the excessive loadshedding and low voltage, calling it a form of cruelty, especially amid the ongoing heatwave in the region.
The governor announced plans to hold another meeting with Wapda officials in the coming days to resolve the crisis and suggested that power management would improve significantly if the province were given control over electricity.Kundi also alleged that Wapda staff were complicit in electricity theft.

Federal budget — from blueprint to action,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323978-federal-budget-from-blueprint-to-action,"The federal budget for FY 2025–26 was anticipated to serve as a roadmap for revitalizing Pakistan’s manufacturing, trade, and export sectors. Instead, it has drawn sharp criticism from industry stakeholders for its lack of strategic direction, absence of structural reforms, and measures that threaten the viability of key economic sectors, particularly textile exports. While expectations were set for a budget that would rein in inflation, stimulate investment, and bridge the formal-informal sector divide to enhance tax revenue, the proposals unveiled have failed to meet these goals. The budget neither offers a coherent economic vision nor demonstrates the capacity to address Pakistan’s structural challenges.
Pakistan’s textile export industry—constituting the backbone of the country’s exports—has been dealt a severe blow through the imposition of 18% sales tax on imported yarn under the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS). This move, at a time when the sector is already grappling with liquidity shortages and delayed sales tax refunds, threatens to cripple exporters by disrupting cash flows and undermining their global competitiveness. The EFS was designed in 2021 to simplify and streamline export operations by consolidating earlier schemes such as SRO 450, 492, 327, and DTRE. Through integration with WeBOC and Pakistan Single Window (PSW), the scheme allowed duty and tax-free import of inputs for re-export—critical for sustaining the value-added textile chain. The newly proposed taxation dismantles this progress, contradicting the very spirit of EFS. Despite being refundable, sales tax operates as a consumption tax and exporters often face refund delays of up to 180-200 days. This delay imposes severe stress on working capital, especially for SMEs. Introducing a new tax burden at the import stage essentially punishes exporters for participating in the formal economy.
Imposing taxes on imported yarn contradicts the global trend of facilitating raw material access for re-export. Regional competitors like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia operate under duty and tax-free regimes for such imports, giving them a distinct competitive edge. Pakistan’s cotton quality issues, including declining staple length and contamination, necessitate import of better-quality yarn, especially as global demand shifts towards synthetic fibers—now 79% of the global textile market.
Statistics reveal the impact of cost dynamics. While yarn imports from China on a tax-paid basis have surged 300%, imports under EFS have increased only 85%, indicating that buyers are motivated by quality and price, not by tax arbitrage. The new tax regime would limit Pakistan’s exporters to low-value products, derailing aspirations for moving up the value chain. A parallel concern is the prevalence of undocumented, cash-based yarn transactions—commonly referred to as “GOL trade”—which undermines fair market practices and formal export channels. Each year, approximately 2.5 to 3 million bales of cotton are traded through these undocumented mechanisms, weakening compliance and diminishing the effectiveness of facilitation schemes like EFS. Urgent policy intervention is needed to curb this practice, enforce proper invoicing, and ensure transparency in domestic trade.
A particularly controversial provision in the Finance Bill is the insertion of Section 37AA in the Sales Tax Act, empowering Inland Revenue Officers to arrest individuals on mere suspicion of tax fraud without a warrant. This violates Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees due process and a fair trial. By granting unchecked powers to tax officials, the measure risks misuse, deterring legitimate business activity and damaging investor confidence. Tax enforcement should remain within the bounds of civil law, with any allegations of fraud subjected to judicial scrutiny. Criminal liability must not be arbitrarily assigned by administrative authorities.
Exporters have also been unfairly targeted under the income tax regime. The simultaneous application of Section 154 and the newly inserted Subsection (6C) in Section 147 imposes double taxation on export proceeds. While banks now collect 1% advance tax under Section 154 (declared as minimum tax), an additional 1% advance tax is imposed under Section 147—together pushing the effective rate to an unjust 2%. For context, local suppliers pay 1%, and yarn traders only 0.5%.
This discriminatory treatment not only violates the principle of tax equity but also increases the cost of doing business for exporters. Coupled with an additional Super Tax of up to 10%, the current framework is unsustainable. There is a dire need to restore the Final Tax Regime (FTR), abolish Super Tax for exporters, and rationalize advance tax to support export competitiveness.
Achieving the projected 18.5% increase in tax revenues for FY 2025–26 is unrealistic without expanding the tax base. With GDP growth stagnant and inflation easing, relying on existing taxpayers alone will not yield desired results. Instead of squeezing compliant sectors, the government must broaden the tax net, improve public expenditure efficiency, and phase out distortive subsidies.
Key areas for reform include: 1) Tax base expansion: Incentivize formalization and penalize undocumented trade, 2) energy sector viability: Rationalize tariffs and reduce circular debt, 3) privatization, governance and revitalizing state-owned enterprises through private sector participation, and 4) public debt management — build institutional capacity for debt sustainability and develop a domestic debt market.
Even in low-tax countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan, tax gaps are considerable when measured as a share of existing revenues. Therefore, fiscal reforms must be part of a broader development strategy, not a standalone effort.
The 2025–26 budget presents a troubling narrative - instead of facilitating economic recovery, it imposes regressive measures that stifle investment and threaten exports. It risks derailing Pakistan’s most vital industrial sector, textiles, and undermines business confidence through arbitrary enforcement powers and a burdensome tax regime. The time for comprehensive, transparent, and equitable reform is now. Without it, Pakistan’s aspirations for sustainable economic growth and global competitiveness will remain unfulfilled.

Zinda Hai Bhutto Zinda Hai!,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323886-zinda-hai-bhutto-zinda-hai,"When we say “Zinda Hai Bhutto Zinda Hai,” some people mock this slogan due to their biased and narrow-minded thinking, without reflecting on their own conduct. These individuals are unaware of history. They do not realize that throughout political history, many great leaders have risen to the height of popularity and sparked revolutions that changed the course of events , yet, over time, history has proven their political philosophies to be flawed, rendering them politically irrelevant.
These leaders, despite their mass appeal, often gained public support by promoting extremism and provocation. The change or upheaval they brought about, though initially popular, ultimately proved disastrous , both for themselves, their political parties, and the people they claimed to represent. Such figures have included politicians from both the right and left, nationalists, religious ideologues, and military opportunists alike.
There are a few political leaders in history whose philosophies remain alive and relevant even today. It can truly be said that such leaders are still alive, both spatially and temporally , because of the enduring relevance of their political thinking and approach. One such leader is Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
Shaheed Bhutto was a visionary statesman with a deep understanding of history. He crafted his political vision with careful consideration of historical experiences. His political philosophy rests on three fundamental principles:
First, that the interests of one’s country and nation must always take precedence in foreign policy. National dignity and sovereignty should not be compromised under any circumstance.
Second, that a nation’s internal problems must be addressed from within, by empowering the oppressed and marginalized classes, nationalities, and social groups. Their right to resources must be recognized, they must be economically uplifted, and guaranteed fundamental human rights, including civil liberties.
Third, that in order to realize the above two principles, one must follow the path of a long, patient, and democratic struggle , a struggle that is peaceful, sustainable, and capable of delivering gradual progress and lasting victories. This democratic path is far superior to any destructive adventure or chaos. History shows that chaos only serves the interests of imperialist and anti-people forces, as it undermines the gains achieved through peaceful democratic movements. That is why these forces fear and target those who champion peaceful democratic struggle.
The unmatched sacrifices of the Bhutto family, and of the leaders and workers of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), stand as proof of this unwavering commitment. The PPP’s journey of peaceful struggle and sacrifice continues to this day.
If today Pakistan has a federal, parliamentary, democratic constitution… if democracy exists… if the federating units and the people have achieved anything , it is because of Shaheed Bhutto and the Pakistan Peoples Party that carried forward his vision.
Grounded in Bhutto’s political philosophy, the PPP continues its journey as the true representative party of the people. And that is why Bhutto is still alive today.
To understand Shaheed Bhutto’s political vision and philosophy, it is essential to study his writings, interviews, and speeches in depth. On November 30, 1967, during the founding session of the Pakistan People’s Party, Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto presented the “Basic Documents” he had authored, which were formally adopted by the party. These documents declared: “Islam is our religion, democracy is our politics, socialism is our economy, and the people are the source of power.”
To elaborate on these foundational principles, Shaheed Bhutto wrote a detailed program for the Pakistan Peoples Party in April 1968, in which he stated: “Pakistan is caught in a whirlpool. When we look back on the last 20 years of our national life, we see a dangerous trend that has emerged alongside both international and subcontinental challenges. It would be unreasonable to regard this crisis as a routine occurrence of the times or as the result of a natural process. This dominant negative trend must be reversed.”
A scholar and political leader like Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto is born once in centuries. He viewed situations through a broad international and historical lens. His thinking was never superficial; it was deep, thoughtful, and visionary. At the time he founded the Pakistan Peoples Party, the global communist movement was at its peak, and socialist revolutions were sweeping across various regions. Yet, Shaheed Bhutto had his eyes set on the future. He foresaw the eventual outcomes of the communist movement.
Rather than raising slogans in favor of communist dictatorship, he declared democracy as his political path, something that even socialist states were eventually compelled to adopt, though only after enduring immense turmoil. Shaheed Bhutto declared socialism not as politics, but as an economic system, a distinction he clearly articulated in the Party’s Basic Documents and its detailed program.
He argued that capitalism in Pakistan was fundamentally different from that in Europe or other developed capitalist nations. In those countries, capitalism functioned alongside democracy and civil liberties. In Pakistan, however, it had become a tool of exploitation, concentrated in the hands of just 22 families. These families plundered wealth in the name of capitalism, opposed democratic rights, and were aligned with dictatorial regimes. They neither ran their factories at full capacity nor allowed broader industrialization. Under the guise of industries and loans, they misappropriated state capital.
As a result, new job opportunities were not being created, and the rural majority continued to suffer from extreme poverty. Importantly, the Basic Documents did not reject private investment outright. Instead, they clearly stated:
“Private investment will be allowed only on the basis of merit, efficiency, and legitimate profit-making , not on the basis of patronage of influential families or corrupt elements within the bureaucracy. Private investment can be beneficial, but only when the working class is treated as an equal partner in profit-making.”
Shaheed Bhutto believed in socialism, but he emphasized that socialism cannot be imposed through decrees or dictatorship. The establishment of a classless and socialist society , and the elimination of capitalist exploitation , must occur through a historical process. This journey, he stressed, could only be completed through democracy, under a people, centric political program.
Another remarkable achievement of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was that he not only gave Pakistan a federal, parliamentary, democratic system of government through the 1973 Constitution, but also addressed long-standing grievances by granting maximum autonomy to the federating units, thus reducing the sense of deprivation among them.
Shaheed Bhutto also provided Pakistan with a neutral and independent foreign policy, which he elaborated in his book “The Myth of Independence.” He opposed turning Pakistan into a pawn of American interests and consistently advocated for strengthening ties with China. However, he was equally clear that Pakistan’s national interests must remain paramount, even in its relationship with China.
Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto offered a historically proven solution to every national crisis with his unwavering belief that the people are the true source of power. In times of crisis, he asserted, the only viable path is to return to the people. This is the essence of Bhuttoism, an ideology rooted in popular will and democratic engagement. No other ideology has proven to be as effective or enduring.
Unfortunately, Pakistan was repeatedly led in directions contrary to Shaheed Bhutto’s vision and philosophy. The country was drawn into the strategic games of global powers, military regimes were imposed, and at various times, ethnic, linguistic, regional, religious, and so-called political extremism was deliberately cultivated to counter the influence of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).
Today, Pakistan once again finds itself trapped in the very whirlpool Shaheed Bhutto warned about in his prophetic book, “If I Am Assassinated.” Following his judicial execution, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto upheld his political philosophy and gave her life in the struggle to rescue the nation from crisis.
Now, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari continues this journey. In the spirit of Shaheed Bhutto’s words, Bilawal is forging a connection with the people, aligning himself with their hopes, needs, and aspirations. Shaheed Bhutto remains alive, not just in memory, but in leadership, because he chose to embrace martyrdom at the hands of a dictator rather than be condemned by history.
Today, history stands as a witness to the validity of Bhutto’s political philosophy. In the current national context, there is an urgent need to revisit and realign with the vision of Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

‘Women suffering in silence due to shortage of female gastroenterologists in Pakistan’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323887-women-suffering-in-silence-due-to-shortage-of-female-gastroenterologists-in-pakistan,"A severe shortage of trained and qualified female gastroenterologists in Pakistan is contributing to delayed diagnoses and poor health outcomes for women suffering from gastrointestinal and liver diseases, as many are reluctant to consult male doctors due to cultural and social barriers.
This concern was raised on the second day of the 7th Annual Conference of the Pakistan GI and Liver Disease Society (PGLDS) where experts lamented that women across rural and urban areas were silently enduring serious health issues that were often diagnosed too late for effective treatment.
They called for a national colorectal cancer screening program, especially for women, who due to the sensitivities involved and lack of female doctors, frequently presented in advanced stages when treatment became more difficult.
Speaking at the conference, which was held at the Liaquat National Hospital’s convention center in Karachi, local and international specialists called for urgent public health reforms, including screening programmes, dietary awareness and structural changes in homes and schools to prevent a looming health crisis.
Dr Lubna Kamani, president of the PGLDS, reiterated the call for early detection and lifestyle change. “We are facing a tsunami of fatty liver, hepatitis C and colorectal cancer. It’s time people took screening seriously. Medicines for Hepatitis B and C are available in Pakistan, but most people do not know they are infected. We urge everyone to get tested and follow medical advice,” she said.
Without national programmes for screening and chronic illness prevention, she warned, the health system will collapse under the weight of non-communicable diseases. Dr Nazish Butt, senior member of the PGLDS, emphasised the rising burden of obesity and gut health issues in women. She noted that poor diets, sedentary routines and hormonal factors were making women more vulnerable to gastrointestinal and liver disorders.
“We are seeing more young women with advanced liver disease and GI cancers because they delay seeking help,” she said, stressing the need for gender-sensitive health care and targeted awareness.
Dr Sajjad Jamil, secretary general of the PGLDS, blamed obesity as the ‘mother of all illnesses’ and criticised the country's deteriorating dietary culture. “Children start consuming sugary drinks, processed meat and junk food from an early age. There’s no physical activity in schools, no playgrounds, and too much screen time. We are nurturing disease,” he warned, adding that Pakistan could not afford to treat millions of people when mostly earned less than 500 to 600 rupees a day.
He demanded immediate implementation of a national colorectal cancer screening programme and school-based awareness campaigns promoting healthy eating and exercise.
International experts highlighted the importance of preventive approaches. South Korean expert Prof Eun Young Kim shared how her country controlled liver and GI diseases through regular screenings, national health insurance, and diet and activity awareness.
“What we see here is preventable. Governments must invest in health promotion, not just treatment,” she remarked. Dr Shahid Ahmed, patron of the PGLDS, said the conference aimed to equip local healthcare professionals with updated knowledge and treatment options. “We’ve invited experts from South Korea, Turkey, South Africa and beyond to present and train our young doctors on how the world is addressing these diseases,” he said.
Dr Wajiha Rizwan, president of the Medical Women Association of Pakistan, raised a key concern about the lack of female gastroenterologists, which is delaying diagnoses in women, especially in conservative communities.
“Many women are uncomfortable being examined by male doctors and suffer in silence. This leads to late-stage diagnosis of GI diseases,” she said. She also noted that over half of newly graduated female doctors did not enter the profession, and those who did, faced unsafe environments and discrimination.
The second day of the PGLDS conference continued with sessions on colorectal screening, therapies for fatty liver, endoscopic innovations and gut microbiome research.

Faisal Edhi praises Benazir for her humanitarian services,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323888-faisal-edhi-praises-benazir-for-her-humanitarian-services,"Edhi Foundation Chairman Faisal Edhi has praised the extraordinary humanitarian services rendered by the late prime minister and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Benazir Bhutto during her life.
Speaking at a ceremony held by the PPP’s District South chapter to mark Benazir’s birthday, Edhi said her life and struggle served as a role model not just for Pakistanis but also for the entire world. He recalled that she had rendered untiring humanitarian services until her last breath.
He also recalled that during his life, the late Abdul Sattar Edhi had organised birthday celebrations for Benazir at the Edhi Home in Kharadar every year, featuring ceremonial cake cutting by the late founder of the Edhi Foundation. He greeted all the PPP’s workers and supporters on the birthday of their leader.
PPP District South President Jawed Nagori said on the occasion that no other Pakistani politician can match Benazir’s exemplary show of patriotism and humanitarian service. Nagori also praised Pakistan’s armed forces for defending the geographical frontiers of the country against the recent brazen military aggression of India. He said that following in the footsteps of his mother Benazir, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari emphatically pleaded Pakistan’s case before the world while heading a diplomatic mission sent to different countries.
He said the PPP chief successfully conveyed Pakistan’s message of peace, stability, reconciliation and non-aggression on the diplomatic front. The international community fully recognised and acknowledged Pakistan’s viewpoint on the Kashmir issue, and regional peace and stability, he added.

SHC dismisses appeal of convict in drug smuggling case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323889-shc-dismisses-appeal-of-convict-in-drug-smuggling-case,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has dismissed the appeal of a convict in a drug smuggling case, observing that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt.
Appellant Syed Ameenullah had been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Malir additional district & sessions court for possessing 57kg of charas. According to the prosecution, police had arrested the appellant on March 15, 2021, from the Gadap area and recovered 57kg of charas from his vehicle.
His counsel said the prosecution had failed to prove the recovery of the alleged narcotic drug, yet the trial court recorded the conviction assigning the reasons that were contrary to the evidence available on record.
He said that there were material contradictions in the statement of the witnesses, which have made the recovery of the alleged narcotic drug highly doubtful, but the trial court failed to appreciate that aspect of the case.
He also said that the alleged recovery of charas from the possession of the appellant was doubtful, and that despite prior information, the complainant failed to associate any private person to witness search and recovery, so benefit should be extended to the appellant.
The deputy prosecutor general supported the trial court’s order, saying that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond any doubt. The prosecutor said the prosecution had produced evidence to establish safe custody and safe transmission of the case property.
After hearing the arguments, an SHC division bench comprising Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput and Justice Tasneem Sultana observed that it appeared that the prosecution had taken all the necessary steps to ensure safe custody of the recovered material, which was ultimately confirmed as charas through the report of the chemical examiner.
The bench said that as regards the contention of the appellant’s counsel that there are contradictions and discrepancies in the evidence of prosecution witnesses, it may be observed that minor discrepancies do not cast doubt on the guilt of the appellant in the judicial mind of the court.
The SHC observed that the prosecution had proved its case against the appellant beyond any reasonable doubt.The SHC dismissed the appeal by maintaining the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant.

Experts highlight misconceptions about vitiligo at awareness seminar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323890-experts-highlight-misconceptions-about-vitiligo-at-awareness-seminar,"Vitiligo is a long-term skin disease characterized by milky-white patches of skin losing their pigment. These patches, which can appear anywhere on the body, result from the destruction of melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing melanin, the pigment that gives skin its colour. While the exact cause of vitiligo is still unknown, scientists believe it to be an autoimmune disorder, where the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks the melanocytes.
These views were shared by lead speaker and renowned dermatologist Prof Dr Azim Jahangir Khan, board certified by the American Board of Dermatology, at a public health awareness seminar titled ‘Recent Advances in the Management of Vitiligo’, held at the prestigious Postgraduate Institute Cosmetique, DHA, Lahore.
He said vitiligo can affect people of all skin types but is more noticeable in individuals with darker skin, it can develop at any age. However, for many people with it, the white patches begin to appear before age 20, and can start in early childhood. In addition, researchers continue to study how family history and genes may play a role in causing vitiligo.
“Sometimes an event – such as a sunburn, emotional distress, or exposure to a chemical – can trigger vitiligo or make it worse. Vitiligo seems to be more common in people who have a family history of the disorder or who have certain autoimmune diseases, including: Addison’s disease, Pernicious anemia, Psoriasis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, SLE, Thyroid disease or Type 1 diabetes.”
The seminar’s aim is to educate the medical community and the public, challenge misconceptions and support individuals living with the condition and to remove the stigma and negative perception surrounding vitiligo.
“Vitiligo is not contagious or life-threatening, but it can have significant psychological and emotional effects on those who have it. It has an estimated prevalence of 0.5–2% of the population in South Asia,” added Prof Azim.
“Generalized vitiligo is the most common type of vitiligo. Approximately 98 percent of people have this type of vitiligo. Segmental vitiligo usually onsets at an early age. About 2 percent of people have this type of vitiligo. It appears on one side of the body without crossing the midline, and it presents in an isolated segment such as the leg, arm, or face.
“Segmental vitiligo usually progresses rapidly for about 6 months to 24 months, and then stops. After this period, segmental vitiligo does not spread any further. Trichome vitiligo is often known as a clinical variant of vitiligo with three different sections characterizing its appearance. This type of vitiligo heralds active, progressive vitiligo and should be treated as soon as possible,” said UK-certified Dr Amnah Raj, consultant dermatologist and hair transplant expert and fellow of the American Society of Dermatologic Surgery.
“Depending on the type of vitiligo diagnosed, a doctor may order blood tests or evaluations for other conditions related to vitiligo. Many people with vitiligo are otherwise healthy, but some types of vitiligo can be associated with a higher risk for thyroid problems and various autoimmune conditions,” said Dr Asma Sana, consultant dermatologist, melanocyte transplant surgery expert and a diplomate of the American Board of Internal Medicine.
She said that if you are diagnosed with generalized vitiligo, the doctor may also recommend visits to an ophthalmologist (eye specialist) or audiologist (hearing specialist). Melanocytes are found in the eyes and inner ears as well as the skin, and cells in these areas can be impacted by vitiligo too.
Vitiligo isn’t the only possible cause of skin depigmentation. The process of ruling out similar conditions is referred to as differential diagnosis, infections such as tinea versicolor, a common fungal infection, Skin exposure to certain chemicals, Scarring, Eczema, Albinism.
“Your doctor may be able to rule many of these conditions quickly based on a visual exam, your medical and family history, or simple blood tests,” further explained by Dr Asma Sana.
Although it cannot be cured, there are several promising new treatments for vitiligo are currently available, including JAK (Janus Kinases) inhibitors like Upadacitinib and povorcitinib, as well as melanocyte-stimulating agents like afamelanotide. These therapies, along with others are offering hope for more effective and targeted treatments beyond traditional options like corticosteroids and phototherapy.
Melanocyte-keratinocyte transplant procedures and other surgical therapies may help repigment segmental vitiligo. VYN201 is a novel BET proteins inhibitor, showing potential superiority over JAK inhibitors in reducing inflammation and promoting melanocyte recovery.
Some clinicians are exploring the use of combination therapies, such as combining melanocyte transplantation with JAK inhibitors or tacrolimus, to improve outcomes, explained by Dr Asma.
Vitiligo can have a profound impact on an individual’s life. The visible nature of the condition often leads to self-consciousness and anxiety. People with vitiligo may face social stigma, discrimination, and bullying, which can further affect their mental health and self-esteem. The psychological toll of feeling different or being treated unfairly can be immense, often leading to withdrawal from social interactions and a decline in overall quality of life, said Dr Saima Malik, Cardiff University, Wales Qualified Dermatologist & Fellow American Society of Dermatologic Surgery.
Organizations such as Postgraduate Institute Cosmetique work tirelessly to provide resources, support, and advocacy for those affected by vitiligo, host events, and create educational materials to further the understanding of vitiligo and combat the associated stigma. By amplifying the voices of those with vitiligo and promoting positive representation, they help to foster a more inclusive and compassionate society, elaborated Dr Saima Malik.
Embracing vitiligo is not just about individual acceptance; it’s also about fostering a broader cultural shift towards inclusivity and diversity. Schools, workplaces, and media outlets play crucial roles in shaping societal attitudes. Implementing educational programmes that teach about vitiligo and other visible differences can help to cultivate empathy and acceptance from a young age.
Employers can create inclusive environments by adopting policies that protect against discrimination and by celebrating diversity in all forms, educate your friends and family about the condition to dispel myths and misconceptions, added Dr Saima Malik.

Convention stresses joint efforts for inclusive development,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323871-convention-stresses-joint-efforts-for-inclusive-development,"LAHORE:The Civil Society Organisations (CSO) Convention 2025 started with a panel discussion titled ‘Collective efforts in shaping development agendas,’ setting the tone for a gathering that brought together prominent voices from Pakistan’s civil society, academia, and development sectors. The session explored the themes of localisation, youth engagement, climate action, and food security.
Salman Abid opened the panel discussion with a reflection on alarming data from the recent economic survey, spotlighting the pressing threats posed by climate change and food insecurity. He emphasised the critical need for community-driven responses to development challenges.
Aisha Jamshaid, Country Director of Welthungerhilfe (WHH), advocated for greater youth participation through local government elections, noting that 60% of Pakistan’s population comprises young people whose innovative ideas remain largely untapped. She called for attention to the decline in civic activism, particularly among young women, and urged for renewed investment in volunteerism.
Siraj ul Haq reflected on the 25-year journey of the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF), highlighting its grassroots partnerships and disaster recovery initiatives, including collaborative governance models developed after recent floods. He praised LPP’s model of community-centered development, rooted in the legacy of Orangi Pilot Project founder Akhtar Hameed Khan.
Chairman FAFEN, Mukhtar Javaid, addressed the widening disconnect between state institutions and civil society. Citing Pakistan’s donor-reliant network history as unsustainable, he urged for homegrown solutions and a recommitment to volunteerism. He proposed forming a Northern Development Consortium inspired by the Southern model.
Dr Abdul Saboor offered a stark assessment of poverty and fiscal misalignment in Pakistan. He noted the contradiction between massive budget allocations for elite schools and the meager funding for the science and IT sector. He urged civil society organisations to step in where elected representatives fall short, and to realign development agendas with local needs and realities.
Speaking on food security, Ghulam Mustafa highlighted the paradox of Pakistan being a top producer of staple crops while nearly half its population lives in poverty. He called for a people-centered approach to development, prioritising access to clean water and essential services.
A video message from Mubarak Sarwar, CEO of AGAHE, underscored the value of indigenous knowledge and grassroots wisdom. Representing AGAHE on-site, Abdullah reinforced this view, stressing the importance of learning from past mistakes rather than repeating them.
The second panel discussion, ‘Advancing the Safeguarding and Social Cohesion Agenda,’ was led by Aalia Sundas. It examined the collaborative roles of district forums, CSOs, and statutory bodies like the Ombudsperson’s office.
Aftab Akhund from RDF shared experiences from post-conflict regions on community-led safeguarding. Ubaid Chaudhary discussed integrating formal justice mechanisms with grassroots engagement. Saima Faiz from SPO emphasised the need for inclusive local structures and institutionalised protection norms, especially for women.
Sajid Bhatia highlighted the significance of interfaith harmony in strengthening national unity. Dr Benjamin from REEDS Pakistan connected climate vulnerability with safeguarding mechanisms, advocating for integrated, responsive governance.
Later in the day, several prominent voices offered keynote addresses. Jamshaid Fareed, Chairperson of the National Humanitarian Network (NHN), commended the Southern Development Consortium (SDC) for convening the event at a critical time. With donor funding shrinking, he stressed that civil society get united to defend civic space and protect the integrity of grassroots development.
Prof Dr Muqarrab Akbar drew attention towards the role of educational institutions in fostering peace and resilience.  In a video address, Shahnawaz Khan, CEO of SPO, called for civil society to stand united against rising threats to civic freedoms.
Zahida Qureshi, CEO of SFSP, concluded the session with a heartfelt speech, applauding the collective spirit of the Convention. She emphasised the inclusion of marginalised groups, highlighting the recent passage of the Disability Act and urging society to own and support the most vulnerable.
The convention served as a significant milestone in collective efforts towards inclusive development. It provided a platform for diverse stakeholders, including development practitioners, government representatives, civil society actors, academia, media, and community leaders, to engage in a dialogue aimed at amplifying the voices of marginalised groups—particularly women, persons with disabilities (PWDs), and transgender communities. It also offered an opportunity for networking and institutional reflection, with the goal of creating systemic structures that ensure equitable participation and representation for all.

Multiple entry visa policy for Afghan drivers supported,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323936-multiple-entry-visa-policy-for-afghan-drivers-supported,"PESHAWAR: Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry has welcomed the decision taken by the Pakistan government of introducing a one year multiple entry visa for Afghan drivers to boost cross border trade.
In a bid to enhance bilateral trade and streamline border management, Pakistan recently announced a new policy of granting Afghan drivers and transporters a one-year multiple entry visa.
“The step taken by the government will help in reducing the hurdles to Pak-Afghan trade and transit trade by facilitating passage of good laden trucks between the two countries,” said Senior Vice President of the chamber, Zia-ul-Haq Sarhadi, in a statement.
Zia Sarhadi, who is also executive member Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI),  made some suggestions for making the new policy more practical and long lasting. He said before this policy, the government had decided to issue TAD-1 documents for Afghan drivers, with a one year validity.
Initially, he pointed out, the visa fee for TAD was set at $100, but then during processing, the fee increased to $500 and $1,000, creating problems for drivers and traders.Zia Sarhadi said measures should be taken to ensure implementation of fixed fee for the new visa issuance policy and drivers should not be compelled to pay additional amount.
He suggested setting up a desk at Torkham border point for visa issuance and renewal for drivers and cleaners. Zia Sarhadi recalled that the “Red Pass” was issued by the Pakistan government in the late 80s to people associated with Pak-Afghan trade who keep on traveling across the border for business purposes.
He believed that the revival of Red Pass policy would also help in expediting cargo traveling procedure and timing in Pak-Afghan trade.Zia Sarhadi said visits by drivers to embassies for application submission and other formalities would be time consuming and may cause delay in transportation of import-export bound goods between the two countries.

Dealers want tea reclassified as essential commodity,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323938-dealers-want-tea-reclassified-as-essential-commodity,"PESHAWAR:  Pakistan Tea Association has urged the government to exclude tea from the “luxury items” tax category, arguing that the current classification makes it unaffordable for lower-income households.
The demand was made by the association’s  members during its meeting held under the chairmanship of Ashfaq Ahmad, a former chairman KP chapter of Pakistan Tea Association and Member Executive Committee Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The meeting was attended by tea dealers including Mubashir Paracha, Athar Paracha, Uzar Paracha, Shahid Aslam, Khawaja Saeed, Ibrahim, Shabir Ahmad, Haroon Khawaja, Saad Parach, Tariq Abdul Basit, Asif Paracha, Sadiq Maqbool Paracha, Zubair Paracha and others.
The meeting participants demanded termination of Minimum Retail Price (MRP) of Rs 1200 on imported tea which resulted in increase in price of the commodity from Rs 250 to Rs 300.Addressing the participants, Ashfaq Ahmad said that tea had become an essential commodity, consumed by people across all socioeconomic classes from the most affluent to the poorest.
“A majority of people living below the poverty line are using tea as a broth to consume it with bread”, he added.He said if tea was excluded from the list of “luxury items” and exempted from different levies, including sales tax and Customs duty, its price would decrease and become affordable for the poor.
Ashfaq suggested inking free trade agreements with countries from where tea was imported including Kenya and Vietnam to ensure availability of tea at affordable price in the country. The KP Tea Association office-bearers believed that the government could ease financial burdens on vulnerable populations by reclassifying tea as an essential commodity and supporting local tea vendors and businesses.

KP needs anti-drone system after attack on police station,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323939-kp-needs-anti-drone-system-after-attack-on-police-station,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa needs an anti-drone system after a number of terror incidents in which quadcopters were used.The latest incident happened in Bannu where Miryan Police Station was attacked with a drone. There was no casualty in the incident.
According to senior officials it was a small drone and it was first incident if its kind. However, the trend is alarming as there were already reports that terrorist groups used these unmanned aerial vehicles in few incidents recently.
Presently, the KP government and police do not have any anti-drone system to detect and hit these unmanned aerial vehicles. An official said the KP Police had suggested purchasing anti-drone system as well as guns to counter any misuse of unmanned aerial vehicles by the terrorists.
The government was informed that Punjab had already purchased the system that was provided to the regions despite the threat level these is not as high as that in KP.
Recently, there were reports that terrorists used drones to carry out attacks on public places in southern districts, including North Waziristan.
Also, a number of drones were shot down in the country after being launched by India last month.Drones can also be used for various other functions by terrorists and criminals.Apart from the anti-drone system, the police in KP, particularly in southern districts, need a more sophisticated system to counter attacks by the terrorists and go after their network.
Recently, special sniper commandos were trained that will make teams for every district to shoot their targets.Besides, more bullet-proof vehicles, thermal imaging guns and scopes have been provided to the force in troubled districts.

Swat’s plum orchards facing climate threats,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323942-swat-s-plum-orchards-facing-climate-threats,"MINGORA: The picturesque valley of Swat, known as the “land of fruits”, continues to charm not only with its natural beauty but also with its rich agricultural produce.Among its prized fruits is the plum, locally known as “aloo bukhara”, which holds significant nutritional, economic and cultural value.
Spread over more than 2,000 acres, Swat’s plum orchards yield hundreds of thousands of mounds annually, generating over Rs 500 million in revenue for local farmers. The region grows several plum varieties, including the popular “seewa”, “shahi” and “kala aloo bukhara.” The harvest season spans from June to August, with the fruit transported to markets across Pakistan.
However, this sweet success story is facing bitter challenges. Farmers report a gradual decline in production, primarily due to shifting weather patterns linked to climate change. Unseasonal rainfall, pest attacks, low-quality pesticides, and the lack of cold storage facilities have compounded the problems.
“The rainfall patterns have changed and sometimes the fruit doesn’t ripen properly,” said a local farmer. “Without timely government support and guidance, it’s getting harder each year,” he went on to add.
Despite these setbacks, the plum remains a vital source of livelihood for thousands of families and represents a deep-rooted part of Swat’s cultural identity. Farmers believed that with the right agricultural training, pest control solutions, and storage infrastructure, Swat’s plums could earn recognition in international markets.
“Aloo Bukhara is not just a fruit - it’s our pride,” said another farmer. “If the government invests in this sector, it can become a symbol of Pakistan’s agricultural strength globally,” he added.With timely intervention, Swat’s plum industry could blossom into an international success, benefiting both the economy and the farming community.

Faisalabad lacks system to use rainwater,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323944-faisalabad-lacks-system-to-use-rainwater,"FAISALABAD: With an average annual rainfall of 346mm, Faisalabad receives a generous amount of natural, clean and free water. However, due to the city’s poor drainage infrastructure, this valuable resource is routinely lost and converted into black water as it mixes with sewage and flows into the sewer system.
As a result, not only this freshwater is wasted, but the crisis of groundwater contamination and depletion becomes more severe. Most residents of Faisalabad rely on underground water, which is increasingly being polluted by industrial waste and untreated sewage. This growing contamination poses serious health risks and adds to long-term environmental concerns.
Although Faisalabad has an existing storm water drainage system, its design flaws have led to major inefficiencies. Back in 1994, storm water drains were included in urban planning along major roads. Later, institutions such as NESPAK and NLC spent billions of rupees building deeper channels to safely carry rainwater out of the city. However, a critical error occurred when these storm drains were connected to the city’s sewage lines. As a result, during rainfall, storm water mixes with sewage, causing manholes to overflow and roads to flood.
According to Wasa, Faisalabad’s sewer system was never designed to handle rainwater drainage. Still, the utility is burdened with managing this extra load. Despite the recurring nature of this crisis, it has not been addressed with the seriousness it deserves. Encouragingly, experts point to a simple, low-cost, and effective solution: groundwater recharge wells. Faisalabad has around 350 potential sites where such wells could be constructed to channel rainwater directly into the ground. This would not only help replenish underground water tables but also reduce urban flooding and drainage issues.
This idea is not entirely new. A few years ago, the then Wasa managing director Zahid Aziz and DCO Noorul Amin Mengal launched a pilot project in D-Ground featuring ten recharge wells. Unfortunately, the initiative was abandoned after administrative transfers. However, the complete design remains available in Wasa’s records and can be updated and implemented today. Rather than investing billions in expanding the sewerage system alone, incorporating rainwater harvesting and recharge systems into city planning would be a smarter, more sustainable policy choice. Faisalabad now stands at a critical crossroads. The question is not whether to spend more or less, but whether to ignore this growing crisis or take timely action to safeguard the future.
Rainwater conservation is no longer just an environmental concern, it’s a necessity for Faisalabad’s public health, economy and sustainable development.A key member of the Shah gang was killed in an encounter near Chak 237/RB in the jurisdiction of Sadr police station.
The shootout occurred when the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Iqbal Division was en route to arrest a suspect, and four armed men opened fire on the police vehicle.According to the police, during the exchange of fire, Atif alias Aati was killed while his three accomplices managed to escape. Atif was a wanted criminal, allegedly involved in numerous cases including the murder of a Dolphin Force constable, Asif, during an earlier encounter and the killing of two women in Jaranwala.
BS CRIMINOLOGY PROGRAMME: The Department of Rural Sociology at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) is set to launch a new BS Criminology programme. The decision was formally approved during a meeting of the university’s Academic Council, chaired by Vice Chancellor Dr Zulfiqar Ali.
The agenda was presented by Registrar Umar Saeed Qadri. The introduction of this new degree programme aims to provide students with expanded educational opportunities within the social sciences. The BS in Criminology will equip students for promising careers not only in the public sector, but also in the private sector, research institutions, and various professional organisations where criminology expertise is in demand. The university officials stated that the programme was designed to meet the growing need for criminology professionals in multiple sectors across Pakistan.
WOMAN KILLS HUSBAND: A woman allegedly murdered her husband with the help of her alleged lover at Madina Town.Police reported that Nawaz had warned his wife’s alleged lover Shoaib to stay away from their home. Nawaz returned home late at night and caught Shoaib and his wife Humaira in the same room. In the ensuing confrontation, Humaira and Shoaib allegedly strangled Nawaz to death. Both have been arrested and a case has been registered against them.

Vondrousova warms up for Wimbledon with Berlin title,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323848-vondrousova-warms-up-for-wimbledon-with-berlin-title,"BERLIN: Marketa Vondrousova ended the run of Chinese qualifier Wang Xinyu to land the Berlin WTA title on Sunday and ignite dreams of a second Wimbledon victory.
The Czech, who won Wimbledon in 2023, was pushed hard by Wang, appearing in her first final, but eventually emerged the 7-6 (12/10), 4-6, 6-2 winner. This was Vondrousova’s third success on the WTA tour and it proved she is hitting form at the right moment after a torrid time with injury with Wimbledon starting on Monday week.
The 25-year-old, finalist at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, has tumbled down the world rankings to 164 from sixth after months away from the court with a left shoulder injury for which she underwent surgery last year.
“We’ve all worked hard for me to come back,” said Vondrousova, acknowledging the hard work she and her team have put in to get her back firing on all cylinders. Wang broke Vondrousova twice to lead 6-5 in the first set only for the Czech to level at 6-6, taking the tie break 12/10 after saving six set points.
With her serve under pressure she lost the second set before running away with the third as Wang appeared to run out of steam at the end of a loaded week coming through the qualifiers. “We came here hoping to win the first match and here I am. I’m so grateful,” smiled Vondrousova.
This was her first title match since she defeated Ons Jabeur in straight sets at Wimbledon two years ago. Immediate reward for the win will come on Monday when she shoots up inside the top 100 to 73 in the latest WTA world order.
Sunday’s success was the icing on the cake for Vondrousova who stunned world number one and three-time Grand slam winner Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-final. For Wang it was just a step too far after what she had described as a “dream” week on the grass of the German capital including defeats of 2021 Berlin champion Liudmila Samsonova and French Open champion Coco Gauff.

Kessler beats Yastremska to win Nottingham Open,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323851-kessler-beats-yastremska-to-win-nottingham-open,"LONDON: McCartney Kessler clinched the first grass-court title of her career as the American beat Ukraine’s Dayana Yastremska in the Nottingham Open final on Sunday.
Kessler ignored a 90-minute rain delay to earn a 6-4, 7-5 victory that secured her fourth WTA title. The world number 42 had ended Katie Boulter’s 13-match winning run in the Nottingham Open by knocking out the Briton in the quarter-finals.
The 25-year-old also ousted top seed Beatriz Haddad Maia in the first round and wasted little time setting the tone against Yastremska. Kessler broke the world number 46 in the opening game and a second break put her in complete control.
She was leading 5-4 when the showers forced the players back to the locker room, but the American returned to finish off the first set quickly. Kessler was within touching distance of the title after a break at 3-3 in the second set and then had five match points on Yastremska’s serve.
The Ukranian staved off defeat and broke when Kessler served for the title for the first time. But Kessler showed her mental fortitude, breaking straight back and then serving out the victory at the second attempt.
“I am super excited to have another title, another great week of tennis for me,” she said. “It was a tighter second set than I wanted at 5-3, but it made it more exciting.” Yastremska lost her second final of the year but admitted the ongoing conflict with Russia in her home country made tennis of secondary importance. “It’s been also been a tough week with what was going on in Ukraine so I have had to deal with a lot of things this week,” she said.

"Pakistan’s Awais, Asif, Sajjad excel in Asian Snooker",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323852-pakistan-s-awais-asif-sajjad-excel-in-asian-snooker,"KARACHI: Pakistan players excelled on the opening day of the Asian 6-Red Snooker Championship 2025, with defending champion Awais Ullah Munir, seasoned cueists Muhammad Asif and Muhammad Sajjad delivering emphatic victories in Colombo.

Bumrah shines but Brook brings England almost level with India,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323853-bumrah-shines-but-brook-brings-england-almost-level-with-india,"LEEDS: Harry Brook fell for 99 on his home ground and the brilliant Jasprit Bumrah took five wickets on Sunday to leave the first Test between England and India at Headingley finely poised.
England were bowled out for 465 on the third day, in reply to India’s first-innings 471; a deficit of just six runs. When Brook was dismissed just one run shy of three figures, England were still 73 behind at 398-7.
But Chris Woakes, selected to lead the bowling attack in place of the injured Gus Atkinson, got England almost on level terms with a handy 38. The 36-year old all-rounder, who has a Test century to his credit, struck consecutive sixes off paceman Prasidh Krishna before he was bowled by Bumrah.
Bumrah then wrapped up the innings by bowling Josh Tongue to finish with excellent figures of 5-83 in 24.4 overs. The 31-year-old has now taken 14 five-wicket hauls in just 46 Tests. Brook’s aggression, in an innings in which he had three reprieves, eventually proved his downfall.
One run shy of what would have been a first Test century at Headingley -- and ninth in 26 matches -- he mishooked a Krishna bouncer to Shardul Thakur at fine leg. Brook threw his head back in agony following the end of a typically dashing 112-ball innings featuring 11 fours and two sixes.
He had been caught off a Bumrah no-ball while still on nought in Saturday’s last over and on Sunday he was dropped on 46 and 82 -- with both those chances ones India should have taken. England resumed on 209-3, 262 runs behind, with Ollie Pope exactly 100 not out after coming in with the hosts in trouble at 4-1.
Pope, having added just six more runs off as many balls, made a careless exit when, trying to cut a wide ball from Krishna, he edged to wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant. Brook treated Bumrah, widely regarded as the world’s leading bowler, with disdain when he advanced down the pitch and drove the paceman through the covers for four.
He then dished out similar treatment to Mohammed Siraj. But from around the wicket, fast bowler Siraj had England captain Ben Stokes caught behind for 20 with a fine delivery that cut away from the left-hander as he pushed outside off stump.
Stokes, without a Test century for two years, threw his bat in the air in frustration before he walked off. Brook should have been out on 46 when he pushed forward to left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja only for Pant to drop the thin nick.

"Inter Milan, Dortmund claim first wins at Club World Cup",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323854-inter-milan-dortmund-claim-first-wins-at-club-world-cup,"Philadelphia: Inter Milan came from behind to beat Urawa Red Diamonds and knock the Japanese side out of the Club World Cup on Saturday, while Borussia Dortmund held off Mamelodi Sundowns to win a seven-goal thriller.
Fluminense rallied in the second half to beat Ulsan 4-2 and knock out the South Korean side while Monterrey and River Plate ended goalless. At Lumen Field in Seattle, Ryoma Watanabe got an early opening goal for Urawa Reds, who were backed by a noisy contingent of their supporters.
But captain Lautaro Martinez -- who got Inter’s equaliser in their 1-1 draw with Monterrey of Mexico in their opening game -- repeated the trick to level matters with a clever overhead kick 12 minutes from time.
Valentin Carboni was then the unlikely hero as he grabbed the winner two minutes into injury time. The 20-year-old Argentine had not played a competitive game since early October after suffering a serious knee injury while on loan at Marseille.
Carboni had not made an appearance for Inter in over two years, but he was on to hand to sidefoot home when the ball fell to him in the area. “Our opponents play with their hearts and to counter that as a team we need to play with more pride, be humble and know how to suffer,” Martinez told broadcaster DAZN.
The result left some Urawa fans in tears and Inter level on four points with River Plate with the two teams meeting next. River Plate were let down by their finishing in a scrappy, foul-ridden encounter with Mexico’s Monterrey, who sit on two points.
Esteban Andrada, Monterrey’s Argentine keeper, made a series of saves while River’s forwards were unable to put away the few chances that came their way. Monterrey could still make it into the last 16 if they beat Urawa and River or Inter win their game.
Earlier Jobe Bellingham got his first goal for Dortmund as his new club overcame stifling heat in Cincinnati to beat Sundowns 4-3 and move to four points from two matches in Group F. The South African champions had taken a surprise early lead through a fine solo goal from Lucas Ribeiro.
However, Sundowns goalkeeper Ronwen Williams handed Dortmund their equaliser on a plate, passing the ball straight to Felix Nmecha, who stroked home. Serhou Guirassy gave Dortmund the lead with his 35th goal since the beginning of the season.
English midfielder Bellingham, who this month followed older brother Jude’s footsteps in joining the German side from Sunderland, started for the first time for Dortmund and made it 3-1 just before the break.
Khuliso Mudau’s own goal made it 4-1 before the hour mark, but Sundowns salvaged some pride by reducing the deficit through Iqraam Rayners and Lebo Mothiba. “I’m sweating like I’ve just come out of a sauna,” said Dortmund coach Niko Kovac when asked about the conditions in a game which started at midday local time.
“It was tough going for both teams, but the opposition are used to it. We certainly didn’t give our best performance, but that wasn’t possible today.” Sundowns will still go into their final game in Group F with a chance of qualifying for the last 16.
“The boys made a wonderful performance... it was a hell of a match. I’m not happy but very proud,” said their Portuguese coach, Miguel Cardoso. South Korea’s Ulsan gave Fluminense a real scare in their Group F clash at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, leading 2-1 until the 66th minute before the Brazilians ran out 4-2 winners, eliminating the K-League champions in the process.
Colombian striker Jhon Arias put Fluminense ahead with a 27th minute free-kick but goals from Lee Jin-hyun and Um Won-sang gave Ulsan the advantage at the break. Nonata levelled for the Brazilians in the 66th minute before Juan Freytes put Fluminense ahead in the 83rd minute, slotting home after a scramble in the box.

South American teams lay down the gauntlet to Europe at Club World Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323855-south-american-teams-lay-down-the-gauntlet-to-europe-at-club-world-cup,"PHILADELPHIA: It took until Friday night for South America’s unbeaten run at the Club World Cup to come to an end as Boca Juniors succumbed to a late defeat against Bayern Munich in Miami.
The Argentine giants’ phenomenal support at the Hard Rock Stadium could not quite get them over the line, as Michael Olise’s late goal inflicted a first loss in 10 games on a side from CONMEBOL.
But the evidence so far in the United States suggests that if anyone is going to stop a European side winning FIFA’s new 32-team competition, it will be a club from South America. Copa Libertadores winners Botafogo edged out European champions Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in Pasadena while Flamengo, Brazil’s biggest club, came from behind to stun Chelsea.
Palmeiras, Boca and Fluminense have all held European opposition too, and South American clubs are set to feature heavily in the knockout stages. One factor helping teams from Brazil and Argentina make such an impact is the remarkable backing from their supporters, who have turned out in impressive numbers across the United States.
“Amazing, amazing,” said Bayern coach Vincent Kompany when asked about the atmosphere for his team’s game against Boca, as it seemed that La Bombonera had been transported to Miami.
“Anyone here who has knowledge of this game knows how tough it is to play against these teams and nearly every game for a European team is like an away game.” The support for Flamengo against Chelsea in Philadelphia was impressive too, with a large percentage of the crowd of over 54,000 clad in the black and red of the Rio de Janeiro side.
In comparison, few supporters have travelled from Europe, even if large numbers of American soccer fans have turned out wearing the colours of the likes of Chelsea and Manchester City. The last 11 editions of the old, seven-team Club World Cup were won by European sides. CONMEBOL last produced a winner in 2012, when Corinthians of Sao Paulo defeated Chelsea.
There is a huge financial gulf -- the top 29 teams in analysts Deloitte’s Football Money League for 2025 come from Europe. Real Madrid topped the list with revenues last year exceeding one billion euros ($1.15 billion), while Flamengo sneaked in at 30th with 198 million euros.

Man City squad must be trimmed: Guardiola,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323856-man-city-squad-must-be-trimmed-guardiola,"ATLANTA: Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola said Saturday his club will have to sell players this summer for the stars’ own good. The Premier League side brought in several players ahead of the Club World Cup, leaving Guardiola with a large squad.
Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been linked with a move to Turkish side Galatasaray in recent days. Guardiola said he did not know anything about it, but said several players would have to be sold following the purchases of Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and Rayan Ait-Nouri.
“I will love to have the players we have right now all season,” Guardiola told reporters in Atlanta. “The problem is they will be unhappy during the season, they will be sad, they will be disappointed.
“I don’t want that. I do it for them, not for me. For them. We have to see what happens, it’s a long time until the transfer window will be closed, we have to see step by step.” Guardiola has said in the past he prefers a squad size of around 20 senior players, whereas City have more than 30 at present.
Before trimming the squad City are hoping to win the Club World Cup in the United States with their new arrivals providing fresh energy. They beat Wydad AC in their first match and face Al Ain on Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium where they can seal qualification to the last 16.
Guardiola said Spanish defensive midfielder Rodri was not able to start the game as he continues his comeback from injury. “He’s getting better. He can play 20 minutes, 30 minutes at a time. He wants to play to help but we want to protect his knee,” said the coach.
Guardiola said he was keen to take City far in the Club World Cup and it was a “privilege to be here”. The coach dismissed some of the complaints about the competition and pointed towards the attitude of the South American clubs as an example of follow. “I love when I see Botafogo, all the Brazilian teams, Argentinian teams, how they celebrate, how they are together, I love them,” said Guardiola.

Minjee Lee grabs four-shot lead at Women’s PGA Championship,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323857-minjee-lee-grabs-four-shot-lead-at-women-s-pga-championship,"LOS ANGELES: Australia’s Minjee Lee defied difficult, windy conditions with a remarkable bogey-free three-under par 69 on Saturday to seize a four-stroke lead over Jeeno Thitikul at the Women’s PGA Championship in Texas.
Lee, chasing her third major title, fired three birdies in one of just three sub-par rounds at Fields Ranch East in Frisco, north of Dallas, where soaring temperatures and wind tested golfers for a third straight day.
“I just try to stay patient out there,” the 29-year-old said after building a six-under total of 210. “You can’t get ahead of yourself, especially in these conditions.” Trailing Jeeno by three to start the day, Lee grabbed her first birdie at the ninth, where she blasted out of a greenside bunker to four feet and made the putt.
She finally took control at the par-five 14th, drilling a 19-foot birdie putt as Jeeno three-putted for a bogey that dropped her three strokes back. Lee added a birdie at the 15th, and remained bogey free with a par save at 18 -- where her second shot raced through the green but she chipped to three feet.
“I try to stay within myself and play the shot as best as I could,” she said. “Just stayed patient, just take it as it comes.” Lee, whose 10 LPGA victories include major titles at the 2021 Evian Championship and 2022 US Women’s Open, said there would be plenty of work to do on Sunday despite her four-shot cushion.
“It’s just only getting harder and harder just with I think pressure of a major championship, and also just the course just demands so much from you,” she said. World number two Jeeno’s hopes of a first major title took an early hit with bogeys at the third and sixth.
She rolled in a 12-foot birdie at the eighth, but dropped into a tie for the lead after back-to-back bogeys at 11 and 12. She bounced back from her bogey at 14 with a birdie at 15, but gave back a shot at the 16th, finishing with a four-over 76 for 214.
Lee and Jeeno, both based in the Dallas area, were the only players under par heading into the final round. US veteran Lexi Thompson, playing a limited schedule this season, shook off a horrendous start to post a three-over par 75 to headline a trio sharing third place on one-over 217.
Thompson opened with a triple-bogey and a bogey and added another bogey at the eighth before she made two birdies coming in. She was joined on one-over by South Korean Choi Hye-jin, who carded a 72, and Japan’s Miyu Yamashita, who shot 73.

Former England fast bowler David Lawrence dead at 61,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323858-former-england-fast-bowler-david-lawrence-dead-at-61,"LEEDS: David ‘Syd’ Lawrence, the first British-born black cricketer to play for England, has died at the age of 61, it was announced Sunday.
Nearly a year ago it was revealed that Gloucestershire fast bowler Lawrence, who took 18 wickets in five Tests between 1988 and 1992, had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease, an incurable illness, which progressively damages parts of the nervous system.
A statement from Lawrence’s family given to Britain’s PA news agency said: “It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Dave Lawrence MBE following his brave battle with motor neurone disease.”
Lawrence bagged a five-wicket haul against the West Indies in 1991 to help England seal a series-levelling win at the Oval, with Desmond Haynes and Vivian Richards among the batsmen he dismissed. But his career all but ended the following year with a sickening injury when he shattered his kneecap running into bowl during a Test against New Zealand in Wellington.
That was the end of his time with England, although he made a brief comeback for Bristol-based Gloucestershire, playing four four-first class games in 1997 before retiring for good after taking 625 wickets for the county.

"Syria announces 200 per cent public sector wage, pension increase",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323908-syria-announces-200-percent-public-sector-wage-pension-increase,"DAMASCUS: Syria announced on Sunday a 200 percent hike in public sector wages and pensions, as it seeks to address a grinding economic crisis after the recent easing of international sanctions.
Over a decade of civil war has taken a heavy toll on Syria´s economy, with the United Nations reporting more than 90 percent of its people live in poverty.
In a decree published by state media, interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a “200 percent increase to salaries and wages... for all civilian and military workers in public ministries, departments and institutions”.
Under the decree, the minimum wage for government employees was raised to 750,000 Syrian pounds per month, or around $75, up from around $25. A separate decree granted the same 200 percent increase to retirement pensions included under current social insurance legislation.
Since war broke out in 2011 with former ruler Bashar al-Assad´s brutal repression of anti-government protests, Syria has faced a painful economic crisis that has persisted even after his December ouster by Islamist-led forces.
The war ravaged the country´s infrastructure and industry, while sanctions compounded Syria´s economic woes. Last month, the United States and European Union announced they would lift economic sanctions in a bid to help the country´s recovery.

Spain claims exemption after Nato agrees 5% spending deal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323909-spain-claims-exemption-after-nato-agrees-5pc-spending-deal,"BRUSSELS, Belgium: Nato on Sunday signed off on a pledge to ramp up defence spending for its summit next week, but Spanish premier Pedro Sanchez insisted Madrid would not need to hit the headline figure of five percent of GDP.
US President Donald Trump has been pressuring allies to commit to that target when they meet for the two-day starting on Tuesday in The Hague. Spain had been the last holdout on a compromise deal that sees allies promise to reach 3.5 percent on core military needs over the next decade, and spend 1.5 percent on a looser category of “defence-related” expenditures such as infrastructure and cybersecurity.
Multiple diplomats at Nato said the agreement had gone through with the approval of all 32 nations and that there was no exemption for Madrid. But within minutes Sanchez came out saying he had struck an accord with Nato that would see his country keep respecting its commitments “without having to raise our defence spending to five percent of gross domestic product”. The claim from Madrid came after Sanchez on Thursday threw a last-minute grenade into preparations for the gathering in the Netherlands by taking a strong stand against the agreement.
In a blistering letter to Nato chief Mark Rutte, Sanchez said that committing to a headline figure of five percent of GDP “would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive”. The outburst from Madrid´s centre-left leader sparked fury from other Nato members who feared it could derail the carefully crafted compromise.

Freed Belarus opposition leader urges Trump to help release all prisoners,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323910-freed-belarus-opposition-leader-urges-trump-to-help-release-all-prisoners,"VILNIUS: Belarus opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky, who was released following an appeal from the White House, said on Sunday that US President Donald Trump could secure the freedom of all Belarusian political prisoners.
A tearful and emaciated Tikhanovsky spoke to reporters in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius a day after he was released from several years of prison with more than a dozen others. “President Trump now has the power and opportunity to free all political prisoners in Belarus with a single word, and I ask him to do so, to say that word,” Tikhanovsky said.
The eastern European country still holds more than 1,000 political prisoners in its jails, according to Belarusian human rights group Viasna. Tikhanovsky said he hoped to return to Belarus “but when, I don´t know yet”.
“You have to understand, I spent more than five years alone in a solitary cell,” he said. “I was completely isolated. I have very little information and now I need to find out a lot of things.” Tikhanovsky was joined at the news conference by his wife Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who took the mantle of the opposition movement after he was jailed.

Wildfire forces asylum seekers from Greece camp,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323911-wildfire-forces-asylum-seekers-from-greece-camp,"ATHENS: A forest blaze forced officials to clear hundreds of asylum seekers from a reception camp on the Greek island of Chios on Sunday, the migration ministry said.
Chios, off Turkiye´s west coast, is a frequent landing point for migrants trying to reach Europe. Civil Protection said more than a dozen nearby villages were also emptied as a precaution after the fire flared on Sunday morning.
About 100 firefighters, 30 fire engines, two water-bombers and 10 helicopters battled the flames, the fire service said. Teams from Athens arrived by the afternoon to back local crews as strong winds fanned the blaze.

India arrests two for harbouring held Kashmir attackers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323912-india-arrests-two-for-harbouring-held-kashmir-attackers,"HELD SRINAGAR: New Delhi´s counter-terrorism agency said on Sunday it has arrested two men in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK)  for allegedly harbouring gunmen behind a deadly attack on civilians that sparked a days-long conflict between the two countries.
India´s National Investigation Agency (NIA) said the two suspects were from the Pahalgam area, where gunmen killed 26 people two months ago.“The two men had provided food, shelter and logistical support to the terrorists, who had... selectively killed the tourists on the basis of their religious identity,” a statement by NIA said. The majority of those killed were Hindu men.
The agency identified the two men as Parvaiz Ahmad Jothar and Bashir Ahmad Jothar, claiming the duo “have disclosed the identities of the three armed terrorists involved in the attack”.

Israeli army says bodies of three hostages recovered in Gaza,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323913-israeli-army-says-bodies-of-three-hostages-recovered-in-gaza,"OCCUPIED AL-QUDS: The Israeli military said on Sunday that it had recovered the bodies of three hostages in Gaza more than 20 months after they were abducted by Hamas fighters.
“In a special operation... the bodies of the hostages Ofra Keidar, Yonatan Samerano and Staff Sergeant Shay Levinson were recovered from the Gaza Strip yesterday,” the military said in a statement.
Samerano´s father had announced earlier on Sunday that his son´s body, which was taken into Gaza after he was killed in a kibbutz by the territory on October 7, 2023 had been recovered by the Israeli army.
He paid tribute to “the brave soldiers of the IDF (Israeli military) and the Shin Bet” security service in a message posted on Instagram. The Israeli campaign group the Hostages and Missing Families Forum described Samerano as “a talented DJ who just wanted to make music, have fun, and travel”.
Keidar, a 71-year-old mother of three, was a resident of a resident of Kibbutz Beeri -- where over a 100 people were killed. Levinson, a 19-year-old tank commander, “engaged and fought terrorists on the morning of October 7 and fell in combat,” a statement from the military said.
Following the news, the forum repeated their frequent calls for the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, writing on social media: “The hostages have no time. We must bring them ALL home, Now!”.
The attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on Israel in October 2023 resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures. Of the 251 hostages seized during the assault, 49 are still held in Gaza, including 27 the Israeli military says are dead. Released hostages have reported that they were beaten and tortured by Hamas militants, while held in isolation in tunnels snaking underneath Gaza.

Turkiye detains prominent journalist for allegedly threatening Erdogan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323914-turkiye-detains-prominent-journalist-for-allegedly-threatening-erdogan,"ANKARA: Turkish authorities detained prominent independent journalist Fatih Altayli on Saturday over social media comments allegedly threatening President Tayyip Erdogan, the Istanbul prosecutor’s office said.
Altayli, who has more than 1.51 million subscribers on his YouTube channel, posted a video on Friday referencing an unnamed poll showing 70 per cent of Turks opposed Erdogan ruling for life, saying this would “never be allowed” by the Turkish people.
Altayli also referenced past Ottoman rulers in his comments, saying people had “drowned”, “killed”, or “assassinated them in the past.” His comments drew backlash from an Erdogan aide, Oktay Saral, who said on X that Altayli’s “water was boiling”.
In a statement, the Istanbul prosecutor’s office said the comments from Altayli “contained threats” against Erdogan, and said an investigation has been launched against him. Legal representation for Altayli could not immediately be reached for comment.
Altayli’s detention comes amid a series of detentions of opposition figures in recent months, including the arrest in March of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu who is Erdogan’s main political rival.
The main opposition CHP says the detentions and arrests of its members, along with other opposition members and journalists or media personalities, is a politicised move by the government to muzzle dissent and eliminate electoral challenges to Erdogan.

Thai PM claims she has coalition support after resignation calls,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323915-thai-pm-claims-she-has-coalition-support-after-resignation-calls,"BANGKOK: Thailand’s prime minister, seeking to fend off calls for her resignation, said on Sunday all coalition partners have pledged support for her government, which she said would seek to maintain political stability to address threats to national security.
Paetongtarn Shinawatra has faced criticism for her perceived mishandling of a border row with Cambodia, including over a phone call with the country’s former leader, Hun Sen, the audio of which was leaked on Wednesday.
After the initial leak, Hun Sen released the full audio, in which Paetongtarn appeared to kowtow before the veteran Cambodian politician and to denigrate a senior Thai military commander - crossing red lines for her critics and some former allies.
A major coalition partner, the Bhumjaithai Party, quit the ruling alliance soon after the leak, overshadowing Paetongtarn’s premiership and a parliamentary majority cobbled together by her Pheu Thai party.
“The country must move forward. Thailand must unite and push policies to solve problems for the people,” Paetongtarn, the daughter of influential former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, posted on X after a meeting with coalition partners, including the United Thai Nation party.
Prior to the post, the UTN had looked set to demand her resignation in return for backing the ruling coalition. The government and the country’s influential military share a common position, to back democratic principles and follow the provisions of the constitution, said the 38-year-old leader, a political neophyte who was appointed prime minister last year.
Activists, among them groups with a history of influential rallies against the Shinawatra administration, have scheduled a protest in Bangkok starting on June 28 to demand Paetongtarn’s resignation.
Cambodia´s prime minister said on Sunday the country would halt all fuel imports from neighbour Thailand, as tensions escalate over an ongoing border dispute. The nations have been at loggerheads since a Cambodian soldier was killed last month as troops exchanged fire in a disputed area known as the Emerald Triangle, where the borders of both countries and Laos meet.
“Starting from midnight tonight, all fuel and gas imports from Thailand will be halted,” Cambodian leader Hun Manet wrote on social media. He said energy companies would be able to “import sufficiently from other sources to meet domestic fuel and gas demands” in the country.
Thailand has placed restrictions on several border checkpoints citing “national security”, and on Sunday Cambodia closed two crossings in retaliation. In statements issued on Sunday, Cambodia´s foreign ministry urged citizens not to travel to Thailand unnecessarily, while Thailand´s consular affairs department warned Thais in Cambodia to avoid “protest areas”.
The border spat has triggered political turmoil in Thailand after a phone call between leaders was leaked, prompting domestic criticism of Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra´s conduct.
The ruling Thai party´s biggest coalition partner withdrew earlier this week as calls grew louder for her to step down and she was forced to apologise over her phone conversation with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.

Democrats assail ‘erratic’ Trump over Iran strikes,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323917-democrats-assail-erratic-trump-over-iran-strikes,"WASHINGTON: Democrats bristled on Sunday over US President Donald Trump´s decision to launch air strikes on Iran without seeking authorization from Congress, accusing the Republican of violating the constitution and demanding a vote to rein in his war powers.
Members of the Senate and House of Representatives argued that US intelligence had not shown an imminent threat from the Middle Eastern country that justified Trump´s unilateral action.
“President Trump´s actions in bombing Iran puts the US on the brink of a wider war in the Middle East, all without constitutionally required Congressional approval,” Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said in a statement.
Democrats were divided between those demanding a vote on a war powers resolution to constrain Trump´s authority to launch further action and a smaller group, who maintained that the strikes were grounds for the Republican leader´s impeachment.
They included Illinois moderate Sean Casten and New York leftist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who accused the president of having “impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations.” Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leaders in the Senate and House respectively, said Trump had “dramatically increased” America´s risk of becoming embroiled in a new Middle Eastern conflagration.
“No president should be allowed to unilaterally march this nation into something as consequential as war with erratic threats and no strategy,” Schumer said. The Democrats have foreign policy hawks in their ranks and many were quick to point to the threat that a nuclear-armed Iran would pose --- while still upbraiding Trump for acting without consulting lawmakers.
“The Constitution makes clear that the power to authorize war lies with Congress... The American people deserve more than vague rhetoric and unilateral decisions that could set off a wider war,” said Mark Warner, vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee.
The loudest Democratic voice in support of the strikes was staunchly pro-Israel Senator John Fetterman, who singled out Trump for praise -- something even party colleagues who support the strikes have avoided.

Tokyo votes in local election seen as key test for ruling party,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323918-tokyo-votes-in-local-election-seen-as-key-test-for-ruling-party,"TOKYO: Voting kicked off on Sunday for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly, a poll seen as a key barometer of public sentiment towards the central government, which has been struggling with low approval ratings.
Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba´s Liberal Democratic Party -- its popularity battered by surging inflation and high rice prices -- hopes to retain its position as the largest party in the mega-city´s legislature.
“We will do everything... to get everyone elected,” Ishiba told reporters earlier this month when campaigning kicked off, claiming his party was best positioned to resolve local issues affecting Tokyo´s some 14 million residents.
The Tokyo assembly election are being watched closely as they come just weeks before elections -- which local media has reported could be July 20 -- for the country´s upper house. Ishiba is seeking to maintain his coalition´s majority, having already lost a majority in lower house elections last October.
Local media have speculated that further poll blows could lead to a change of party leadership. For months, public support for Ishiba, who took office in October, has been at rock bottom, thanks in part to rising inflation and soaring rice costs on his watch.
Polls this month showed a slight uptick in support, thanks in part to new policies to tackle the rice price issue. Polling stations will close at 8:00 pm (1100 GMT).
A record 295 candidates were running in Sunday´s election -- the highest since 1997, including 99 women candidates, the highest ever, which officials have hailed as a “delightful trend”. Japan remained at 118th place out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum´s Global Gender Gap Index ranking this year, as women´s participation in politics was particularly low.

More than 250 Air India crash victims identified,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323920-more-than-250-air-india-crash-victims-identified,"NEW DELHI: More than 250 people killed in an India plane crash have been identified through DNA testing, a hospital official said on Sunday as specialists near a final toll for one of the worst air disasters in decades.
All but one of the 242 people on board the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were killed when the Air India plane smashed into a residential area of Ahmedabad, where at least 38 more died. Such was the level of destruction that more than two dozen believed killed remain unidentified 10 days after the jet came down. “The results of the DNA sample matches for 251 have arrived,” said Rakesh Joshi, medical superintendent at Ahmedabad´s civil hospital.

Somalia Al-Shabaab clash kills seven Uganda soldiers: army,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323921-somalia-al-shabaab-clash-kills-seven-uganda-soldiers-army,"KAMPALA: At least seven Ugandan soldiers have been killed in Somalia, an army spokesperson said on Sunday, part of the ongoing fight against the Al-Shabaab militant group. The soldiers were part of the African Union Support and Stabilisation Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) tasked with combating Al-Shabaab.
Recent attacks have stoked fears of a jihadist resurgence in the Horn of Africa nation, especially coming as AUSSOM struggles with insufficient troops and funding shortfalls. The losses came during a three-day siege over a town in the Lower Shabelle region, a Ugandan defence ministry statement said, adding the town was recaptured from Al-Shabaab.

"French teen charged over plot to attack synagogues, public gatherings",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323923-french-teen-charged-over-plot-to-attack-synagogues-public-gatherings,"PARIS: French prosecutors have charged and jailed a 17-year-old Islamic State group sympathiser suspected of planning attacks on synagogues, sex shops and public gatherings, the national anti-terror office said on Sunday.
“He was not yet at the stage of carrying out an attack, but he was getting ready,” Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said earlier on the LCI news channel. The suspect was arrested on Tuesday, prosecutors told AFP. Defence lawyer Florian Godest Le Gall told AFP his client was a “troubled boy pushing who was testing the boundaries of what is forbidden”.
“There is no real targeting of specific sites or actual intent to act,” he said. “There is a lot to clarify, particularly around his mental state and vulnerability,” he added, ruling out any “true radicalisation”.

Hot-air balloon crash in Brazil kills eight people,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323924-hot-air-balloon-crash-in-brazil-kills-eight-people,"SAO PAULO: Eight people were killed after a hot-air balloon carrying 21 passengers, including the pilot, crashed on Saturday in Brazil’s southern state of Santa Catarina, state officials said.
The tourism balloon caught fire during the flight in early morning hours, crashing in a forest area in the city of Praia Grande, according to the state fire department. The city is a popular tourist spot for balloon trips in Brazil. The Santa Catarina government estimates that 25 to 30 hot-air balloons depart daily from Praia Grande in peak season, with most of them having capacity to transport as many as 25 people.
Thirteen survivors were transported to nearby hospitals, according to the fire department. A spokesperson of the department told local news outlet CNN Brasil that none of them were with their lives at risk.
