Blistering heat bears down on Pakistan,"PK
Citizens advised to stay indoors, avoid sun between 11am and 4pm
A persistent and severe heatwave continues to engulf large swathes of Pakistan, with temperatures soaring to alarming levels across the country.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the ongoing heatwave is expected to persist until Thursday, June 13, with temperatures in many regions remaining significantly above seasonal norms.
The PMD reports that temperatures in upper and central Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, Sindh, Balochistan, and southern Punjab are ranging between 4 to 7°C above average.
In response, citizens have been strongly advised to avoid exposure to direct sunlight, especially between 11:00 AM and 4:00 PM, and to stay well-hydrated to reduce the risk of heatstroke.
The situation is especially critical in plain areas, where temperatures are forecast to remain extremely high through Wednesday and Thursday, accompanied by dusty winds in the afternoons.
According to a spokesperson for the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Bhakkar recorded the country's highest temperature at 50°C.
Other cities such as Dera Ghazi Khan and Noorpur Thal registered 49°C, while Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Layyah, and Mandi Bahauddin saw highs of 48°C. Bahawalnagar, Chakwal, Jhelum, Khanewal, Kot Addu, Sargodha, Sheikhupura, and Sialkot all experienced scorching temperatures reaching up to 47°C.
Major urban centres including Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Attock, and Sahiwal are also facing extreme heat, with forecasts predicting temperatures between 45°C and 47°C.
In terms of humidity, Multan recorded 46°C with 56% relative humidity, Dera Ghazi Khan 46°C with 42%, Sargodha 47°C with 52%, and Lahore 46°C with 36%, indicating dangerous heat index levels.

Bosnia partners with EU to secure border,"US
Govt says country becomes a credible partner in securing external borders of the EU
Bosnia and Herzegovina on Wednesday signed an agreement with the European Union providing for technical assistance and deployment of EU guards on its borders to control and prevent illegal migration and cross-border crime.
The agreement was signed in Brussels by Borjana Kristo, the chairwoman of Bosnia's Council of Ministers, and Magnus Brunner, the EU Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration, a statement from Kristo's office said. ""The signing today ... is an important step forward on the European path of Bosnia-Herzegovina which has thus fulfilled an EU condition and become a credible partner in securing the external borders of the EU,"" the statement said.
An EU candidate country which has yet to start negotiations on the membership of the 27-member bloc, Bosnia was the only Western Balkan country besides Kosovo that had not signed an arrangement with the EU's border agency Frontex.
Thousands of people from the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and North Africa use the so-called Balkan route, which runs via Turkey, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Serbia, to reach wealthy Western countries.
Frontex can assist EU countries by exercising powers such as border checks and registrations. The EU has said its increased cooperation on border management with the Western Balkan countries has significantly decreased illegal border crossing, with a downward trend continuing in 2025.

US mediation offer,"PK
The stakes are too high to leave the longstanding Kashmir issue to empty slogans or rigid bilateralism.
The Kashmir dispute is not a regional fault line. It is a global flashpoint — one that demands more than sterile diplomatic statements and historical posturing. The recent military flare-up between Pakistan and India, the most serious between the two in decades, brought the subcontinent dangerously close to open conflict. A ceasefire was achieved, but not through bilateral diplomacy — it was the intervention from none other than the President of the United States of America that helped defuse the escalation that threatened what is called mutually agreed destruction. This begs the question: can the Kashmir dispute be resolved without the active involvement of a major world power?
For far too long, India has been averse to third-party mediation, insisting that Kashmir is a bilateral matter in line with the Shimla Agreement of 1972. This rigid stance has, in effect, blocked any meaningful dialogue while allowing the conflict to fester. But the latest developments suggest a subtle shift. New Delhi and Islamabad, while not openly inviting mediation, allowed space for President Donald Trump to intervene — a notable departure from past rejections of third-party involvement. Just yesterday, the US Department of State reiterated Trump's willingness to help resolve the Kashmir issue, stating that ""each step that he takes is made to solve generational differences between countries"".
This statement, while significant, should be viewed with cautious optimism considering the chequered US history. The stakes are too high to leave the longstanding Kashmir issue to empty slogans or rigid bilateralism. And as long as it remains unresolved, it will continue to poison relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours and destabilise an already fragile region.
Whether it is Trump or any other global leader, only a credible and powerful mediator can help break the deadlock. Currently, the US — which enjoys leverage over both Islamabad and New Delhi — remains best placed to lead that effort.

Migration crisis: what really matters?,"PK
The United States, long a symbol of refuge, has been retreating from its commitments.
When President Donald Trump signed an executive order back in January banning refugee resettlement, citing national security and the need to ""protect the homeland"", it wasn't just a policy shift but a declaration of how the modern world views displacement. Refugees are increasingly seen not as victims of circumstance, but as potential threats, burdens or political pawns. The tough reality that emerges with increasingly strong borders and inflammatory people-powered politics is: in the world at large, is it borders or bodies that weigh more?
The United States, long a symbol of refuge, has been retreating from its commitments. Under Trump's previous administration, the refugee cap reached historic lows, and entire populations were blocked entry on the basis of religion and nationality. Now, the familiar language of fear is back, cloaked in sovereignty, but rooted in exclusion.
And this is not a uniquely American phenomenon. Across Europe, the narrative echoes. The UK's attempts to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda, Italy's criminalisation of migrant rescue ships and Greece's illegal pushbacks in the Aegean all signal a global trend: the securitisation of human movement. Refugees are treated less like people in need and more like liabilities to be managed, repelled or offloaded.
But in today's world, the category of the ""refugee"" itself is expanding — or at least, should be. While the 1951 Geneva Convention defines a refugee as someone fleeing persecution due to race, religion, nationality or political opinion, this framework fails to accommodate the new and growing class of displaced persons: climate migrants.
Many people are made homeless each year by floods, droughts, fires and flooding waters. Entire nations on islands are in peril and at the same time, changing weather in South Asia and Africa leads to conflicts and destroys people's livelihoods. These people do not receive the same status as refugees, according to international rules. No one is protecting them and there is no form of recognition set aside for them.
This lack of rules further highlights a weakness in how the world is run. The rules in war do not update as the world shifts. Refugee institutions made after World War II do not keep up with the issues caused by today's displacement. Although the Geneva Convention is admired, it no longer works well. It cannot address the blurred lines between conflict and climate, between persecution and poverty, between war and weather. As a result, these grey zones are overlooked by the international community as rich nations stop accepting refugees but claim to follow humanitarian principles.
This raises a fundamental moral dilemma: What are borders actually protecting? If the answer is sovereignty, then sovereignty itself becomes a justification for indifference. Hannah Arendt once warned of the danger faced by those who lose the ""right to have rights"". Today, millions roam the world with no state to speak for them, no law to defend them and no border willing to welcome them. Their existence is a daily negotiation with rejection.
The debate is not just about who crosses borders; it's about how the global order prioritises state security over human security; it's about whether IR will keep being just about power or if it will become something fairer and more open. We can no longer afford to treat migration as a temporary crisis or a political inconvenience. Climate displacement, economic collapse and civil conflict are not going away; they are the future. And that future demands new definitions, new protections and, above all, new compassion.
If we continue to worship borders and ignore the bodies knocking on them, then we must also accept what that reveals about our values. If the world is set up to protect the few at the expense of the disadvantaged, it will not be a true just society. And in the end, the lines we draw on maps will mean little if they come at the cost of our shared humanity.

London Mayor knighted by King Charles,"US
The announcement of Khan's knighthood was made on December 30, 2024, in the New Year's Honours list.
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has been knighted by King Charles for his outstanding services that included Khan's efforts for improving London's air quality, provision of free school meals, and increase in council housing.
Despite the recognition, Khan faced fierce criticism from senior Conservative politicians, alongside a mammoth petition that amassed 220,000 signatures, aiming to prevent the knighthood.
The announcement of Khan's knighthood was made on December 30, 2024, in the New Year's Honours list.
Despite the backlash, which included nearly 30 petitions being submitted to revoke the honor, the Mayor's knighthood proceeded without change.
In defence of Khan, Foreign Secretary David Lammy expressed pride in the UK's ability to elevate individuals from humble beginnings, noting Khan's rise from being the son of a bus driver to a knight.
Lammy also acknowledged Khan's efforts to improve London's air quality, provide free school meals, and increase council housing.
Khan, reflecting on the honour, expressed his gratitude on social media, emphasising the journey from growing up on a council estate to becoming Mayor of London.
Taking his X handle, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan tweeted, ""The London promise: if you work hard, and get a helping hand, you can achieve anything.""
""Immensely proud to receive a knighthood from His Majesty The King. Growing up on a council estate in Tooting, I never imagined I'd one day receive this great honour while serving as Mayor,"" he added.

Escalator installed at Lahore railway station,"DE
Lahore Railways Station serves hundreds of thousands of passengers daily
Pakistan Railways has launched a phased project to install escalators at key stations including Lahore, Karachi, and Multan, at a total cost of Rs120 million. According to the Railways minister, escalators at Lahore Railways Station will be operational from June 25.
In the first phase, work is underway at Lahore Railways Station, where escalators are being installed on platforms 2 and 4 at a cost of Rs60 million. The installation is nearly complete.
Established in 1859 during the British era, Lahore Railways Station serves hundreds of thousands of passengers daily. In the absence of escalators, elderly passengers, women and children often struggled with stairs while carrying luggage. Given the hardship faced by the railway commuters, the administration decided to install escalators which will be operational soon.
As many as 50 million passengers travel in trains annually. The railways administration said after Lahore, the escalators will be installed phase-wise at Karachi, Multan, Rawalpindi, Peshawar and other stations.
It has estimated the total cost at Rs120 million. Work for installation of escalators at Karachi Railways Station will also be started this month. Besides, the administration is also constructing comfortable waiting areas for passengers.

15% hike in oil refining planned,"US
Capacity will be increased through executing plant upgrade projects
Pakistan is likely to increase its refining capacity by 15% by the year 2027 through plant upgrade projects, which are being executed under the Oil Refining Policy 2023, according to the Annual Plan for fiscal year 2025-26.
For FY26, the targets for crude oil and natural gas production have been fixed at 24.24 million barrels and 1.24 trillion cubic feet (tcf), respectively. The target for local liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) supply has been set at 0.75 million tonnes.
The shortfall in indigenous gas supplies will be bridged through liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, which are estimated at 7.5 million tonnes. Both gas transmission and distribution companies – Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) and Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) – have set goals of adding 116,270 new consumers and 2,770 km of transmission and distribution pipelines during FY26.
During the year, efforts will be made to explore 14.8 million tonnes of local coal to count on domestic production and slash the import bill.
To reduce reliance on imported fuels, which currently meet 30% of gas demand, and address infrastructure gaps, the Petroleum Division has prioritised three key initiatives for FY26, which is beginning in July. The scope of the Village Gasification project will be expanded to 81 villages near gas fields by laying 2,770 km of new pipelines.
Adaptation, resilience strategies
Under these programmes, energy efficiency projects will be kick-started during FY26. These projects include the Machike, Thalian and Taru Jabba White Oil Pipeline, which is termed environment-friendly.
Pakistan's energy sector requires a transformative approach to address the challenges of energy security, affordability and sustainability. The Integrated Energy Planning Initiative, led by the Ministry of Planning and Development, aims to reshape the energy landscape through data-driven and analysis-based decision-making and policy formulation.
During FY25, crude oil production stood at 23.55 million barrels against the target of 26.55 million barrels, while the production of natural gas was 1.08 tcf, lower than the target of 1.21 tcf.
Local LPG supply came in at 0.73 million tonnes compared to the target of 0.79 million tonnes. In the outgoing year, a total of 35 wells (14 exploratory and 21 developmental) were drilled, significantly lower than the target of 67 wells (27 exploratory and 40 developmental).
A target of 15.4 million tonnes had been set for coal exploration, of which 13.82 million tonnes were extracted, marking a 90% success rate.
To bridge the gas demand-supply gap, around 7 million tonnes of LNG is expected to be imported by June 2025 against targeted imports of 8.85 million tonnes. The goal could not be achieved due to the failure of international suppliers to deliver LNG as per contractual agreements.
Gas pipelines
During fiscal year 2024-25, SNGPL and SSGC collectively added 20,061 new consumers (including domestic, commercial and industrial) compared to the target of 68,990 consumers. The two Sui companies also added 2,254 km of transmission and distribution pipelines against the target of 3,274 km.
With the proposed allocation of Rs2,541 million for FY25, the Petroleum Division advanced activity on four ongoing projects. These included the expansion and upgrading of Pakistan Petroleum Corehouse to ensure sustainable operations and facilitate oil and gas exploration, the Strategic Underground Gas Storage project and the supply of gas to villages and localities falling within 5 km radius of gas-producing fields of SNGPL and SSGC.

Death penalty for child molestation upheld,"CN
CJ Aalia Neelum observed that any person involved in such a heinous crime doesn't deserve any relief.
A Lahore High Court (LHC) division bench headed by Chief Justice Aalia Neelum dismissed an appeal of a death row convict in a case of sexually assaulting a three-year-old child.
CJ Aalia Neelum observed that any person involved in such a heinous crime doesn't deserve any relief. Hanjarwal police had registered an FIR against Nadeem Aslam over committing sodomy with the child. The trial court had handed him a death sentence in 2022. The convict had filed an appeal in the LHC against the district court's order.
Meanwhile, a man approached the LHC with a request for urgent intervention to prevent police officials from killing in an encounter his brother who is accused of raping a woman.
Petitioner Muhammad Azam expressed fear in his petition that his brother Ikram might be killed in a staged encounter by police officials.
The petitioner stated co-accused Khawar Mansab, Fiaz and Layeq had been killed in an encounter. He requested the court that directions be passed to the police authorities to restrain the officials from staging an encounter against his brother. He prayed that directions be issued to the police to produce the accused before the relevant court.
Hafizabad police had arrested the accused in the rape case.

PSL11 likely to clash with IPL again,"US
A proposal was made to hold the tournament in December-January
Like the 10th edition, the HBL Pakistan Super League season 11 is also likely to take place alongside the Indian Premier League in April-May next year.
In that case, the home series against Zimbabwe will have to be rescheduled. Given the limited time, the proposal to hold the tournament this December seems highly difficult to implement.
According to details, the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is traditionally held in February-March, but this year, due to the ICC Champions Trophy being hosted in Pakistan, the event was pushed to April and May, overlapping with the IPL schedule. Next year, the ICC T20 World Cup is scheduled for February-March, forcing Pakistan to find new dates for its league.
A proposal was made to hold the PSL in December-January, but due to unresolved key issues, organizing it that early seems unlikely. During this window, the PCB may instead hold the domestic Pentangular Cup, involving top star cricketers.
Earlier this year, it was announced that PSL would be made into a separate company, and Salman Naseer has started working as its CEO. However, no major appointments have been made in other departments yet.
With 10 editions now completed, the valuation of the existing six franchise teams will be carried out, following which a 25% increase in franchise fees is expected. Last December, all teams had confirmed in writing their intent to retain ownership. However, Multan Sultans' owner, Ali Tareen, repeatedly voiced concerns about financial losses. He has been silent recently, so it remains unclear whether he will keep the team or go for rebidding. Notably, this team currently pays over one billion rupees annually in fees, making it the most expensive franchise.
Similarly, the board had announced the inclusion of two new teams starting from the 11th edition, but no progress has been made on that front either.
Sources revealed that the 10-year title sponsorship agreement also needs to be renewed. There will be separate contracts for ground sponsorship in 810 categories, and for both local and international broadcasting. A new deal for live streaming will also be required.
Currently, PCB earns about PKR 900 million annually from the title sponsorship. Last year, live streaming rights for Pakistan were sold for approximately PKR 1.8 billion. Local broadcast rights generated around PKR 6.3 billion, while international rights brought in $4.6 million. Ground rights were sold for around PKR 2 billion for two years. For TV production, PCB signed a two-year deal worth $2.25 million annually. Tenders will be issued for all these agreements, followed by lengthy processes.
If the current format continues With the inclusion of two new teams, the number of PSL matches will rise from 34 to 54. Consequently, the value of all associated deals is expected to increase by about 30%. However, it is yet to be decided whether the new teams will follow the current financial model or if a new approach will be adopted. Franchise sources confirmed that the board has not yet discussed new teams with them, let alone any financial models.
The final dates for PSL 11 have not yet been confirmed, though holding the tournament in April-May next year seems likely. A joint email was sent by franchises requesting a meeting of the PSL Governing Council to discuss key matters of the league. A response is expected in coming days.
It's worth noting that the Pakistan team has a home series against Sri Lanka in November, featuring three ODIs and three T20Is. December and January have been kept open for domestic events. In February, Australia is scheduled to visit for three T20Is, and the T20 World Cup will follow in February-March. In March, Australia will return for three ODIs, and at the end of March and in April, Pakistan is set to tour Bangladesh for two Tests, three ODIs, and three T20Is.
Zimbabwe's team is scheduled to tour Pakistan in April-May for three ODIs and three T20Is. To hold the PSL during this window, the PCB will have to reschedule the Zimbabwe series.
Sources added that franchises' concerns about scheduling clashes with the IPL have decreased after the 10th edition. However, broadcasters and rights holders still have differing views. Holding PSL alongside IPL in April-May next year is a possibility, but a final decision will be made later.

Professional panhandlers thrive in capital,"PK
Residents call for extensive approach to dismantle networks; support those in need
Amidst repeated action against beggars by Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, the city continues to witness a rise in the number of beggars at its streets, markets and traffic intersections.
In most of areas of main city and housing societies in the suburbs, they are seen in abundance with scores among them are permanent and professional seeming like to be part of a nexus operating in the city. Some residents have pointed out that many of these permanent beggars are travelled to designated places daily in the morning and picked up in the evening by their masters after day long begging in these areas.
Particularly busy areas like F-6, F-7, F-10 Markaz, capital's main traffic signals and housing societies along Islamabad Expressway including PWD, Police Foundation and Pakistan Town commercial areas have witnessed a surge in beggars including women and children, soliciting money from commuters and shoppers.
Expressing concerns on prevailing situation, the residents have demanded strict enforcement of anti-begging laws, arguing that unchecked beggary not only tarnishes Islamabad's reputation but also resulting in petty crimes. They are also perturbed on re-emergence of beggars groups after a couple of days of action by ICT administration who occasionally launch operation against these beggars, nab them and put behind the bars.
But, this practice could not prove to be a permanent solution to this menace as there are also reports that many rag pickers conduct recce in different areas during the day that leads to theft and robbery after sunset. Citizens in many localities have expressed frustration over frequent encounters with organized groups of beggars as well as the crimes like snatching or plundering valuables and breaking into houses, also threatening human lives.
""Once regarded as one of the most orderly and serene cities in South Asia, Islamabad is now grappling with a persistent and increasingly visible challenge of beggary,"" remarked a businessman, Saleem Khan. ""From traffic signals to bustling markets, the city's thoroughfares are teeming with individuals with many of them seeming like part of organized groups or an unseen nexus operating in the city,"" Saleem Khan said.
""Some of them aggressively seek alms and when refused either they abuse you or scratch your vehicles and run away. "" Since they are professional engaged in this notorious practice for years, they have numerous techniques to allure people. ""Their techniques range from sympathetic women holding infants, children selling flowers, some knocking windows of your car and some elderly begging for medical treatment or marriage of their daughters,"" said Aiman Baig, a working woman.
""Some among them are too sticky and arrogant and also pass derogatory remarks when refused alms. "" She said, whether it is intersection at Aabpara, traffic-laden Jinnah Avenue or other areas in the city, you can find them everywhere. Amina Rafeeq, a local resident describes it as very uncomfortable and says, ""even if you desire to help someone needy, you cannot ascertain who is genuinely deserving and who belongs to a nexus.""

Industry urges withdrawal of taxes on IT, digital services sectors warning that new taxes may derail growth
Tech experts have pleaded for the withdrawal of taxes on the IT sector, digital services, and e-commerce to maintain momentum in digital transformation and economic documentation.
They urged the government to support sectors that bring in foreign exchange and investment, generate employment, and contribute tax revenue, rather than restricting growth through discouraging tax measures. However, they praised the government for allocating funds for IT infrastructure development and human resource training.
Pakistan Freelancers Association (PAFLA) Chairman and Executive Member of Digital Nation Pakistan, Ibrahim Amin, highlighted the importance of policy continuity. He suggested that the government extend the 0.25% Final Tax Regime for freelancers and IT exporters until 2035 to boost confidence, encourage compliance, and enhance remittances.
He said the proposed 5% tax on social media advertising could indirectly affect the income of IT companies and freelancers, which may negatively impact IT foreign exchange inflows.
""As per estimates, IT exports will surge to over $3.5-$4 billion, and remittances from freelancers will increase to more than $500 million by the end of the current financial year. If we want to sustain this growth, the government, along with stakeholders, should support these sectors with tax exemptions and incentives,"" he said.
The services sector has shown steady growth in IT and e-commerce. In May 2025 alone, 718 new companies were registered in these sectors, according to data released by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).
Saad Shah, CEO of Ucaaza retail chain and e-commerce storesaid the introduction of new taxes on e-commerce customers and vendors could slow down the sector's growth and its contribution to the broader economy, including digitisation and documentation.
He noted that e-commerce still holds an insignificant share of the overall retail market, but its rapid expansion is attracting both local and foreign investment. However, the new taxes will shake the confidence of major stakeholders in Pakistan's e-commerce ecosystem.
He pointed out that a significant segment of e-commerce contributes tax revenues, unlike the wider retail sector comprising shopping centres and wholesale markets. He added that instead of broadening the tax base, the government is overburdening existing taxpayers.
The government has introduced the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025, in the finance bill. It targets entities with significant digital sales in Pakistan conducted through foreign-registered companies. Under this act, a 5% tax will be levied on the invoiced amount for goods and services.
Additionally, the withholding tax rate on online and e-commerce transactions has increased from 1% to 2%, while an 18% GST has been imposed on goods purchased via local e-commerce vendors.
Mehwish Salman Ali, a tech expert and member of the P@SHA committee, urged the government to strengthen the IT and digital business ecosystem through favourable policies, including tax exemptions and incentives.
She warned that if government policies discourage investors and business owners, job creation would be affected, and ultimately the fruits of training new talent would not be reaped at an optimal level.
She praised the allocation of Rs4.3 billion for the capacity building and skill development of 161,500 students, including 56,000 in IT-related fields. The IT industry is facing a serious shortage of human resources, and investing in youth to equip them with emerging skills is crucial, she added.

JCP to review tenure of CB,"PK
The meeting will discuss extending the tenure of constitutional benches.
A crucial meeting of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), chaired by Chief Justice Yahya Afridi, will be held on June 19 in the Supreme Court building.
The meeting will discuss extending the tenure of constitutional benches.
The matter was last addressed in the commission's session on December 21, 2024, where a majority approved a six-month extension for the nominated judges of the Supreme Court's constitutional benches.
At present, 15 judges have been working for the constitutional benches. Among them, a committee led by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Justice Ali Mazahar selects judges for the particular constitutional benches.
Performance of CB
The present CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan has been able to issue only three reported judgement since it's creation through 26th constitutional amendment.
The CB had issued first reported judgement in January. This two-page decision was related to the jurisdiction of CB itself. The order had held that regular benches could not hear matters related to the interpretation of law and constitution.
Secondly, reported short order has been passed in military courts case. Likewise, another reported judgement was authored by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail.
Lawyers are wondering as who will judge the performance of the constitutional bench. They are also raising question that why Justice Mandokhail is not being given independent CB.
A lawyer says that the CB started by spending two months studiously avoiding the 26th Amendment case in favour of hearing cases of no importance which had already become infructuous.
""It followed that by spending four months almost exclusively on the military courts case before passing a verdict which must surely have pleased the establishment. The only other order of note it passed in that period was to ensure that no regular bench of the Supreme Court could hear any case of importance.
""Next, it took up the reserved seats review case in which most of the original judges were excluded and the few who were included seemed to have suddenly, and inexplicably, become of the opposite view from day one"", says the lawyer.
He said that when the idea of a CB elected by politicians was first floated; many said such a bench was fundamentally against the idea of judicial independence and predicted it would reduce the credibility of the SC to nothing. Nonetheless, judges in Pakistan have sometimes defied predictions. ""Unfortunately, the CB's performance thus far has proved this is not one of those times.""
He also said that the stated rationale of the CB at the time of the 26th Amendment was to improve the constitutional jurisprudence of the SC. In its first six months, the number of detailed judgments it has issued can be counted on the fingers of one hand. And all of them have tended to take out jurisprudence backwards and closer to the desires of the establishment,"" he adds.

Pooran retires from internationals,"US
He also served as West Indies' limited overs skipper
Former West Indies white-ball captain Nicholas Pooran announced his retirement from international duty on Monday.
Pooran hit 13 half-centuries in 106 Twenty20 Internationals and amassed 2,275 runs to become West Indies' leading scorer in the shortest format.
One of the world's most explosive batters, the 29-year-old smashed 149 sixes in T20 Internationals to stand fifth overall.
He served as West Indies' limited overs skipper but gave up the captaincy after their first-round exit from the 2022 T20 World Cup.
""This game we love has given and will continue to give so much - joy, purpose, unforgettable memories, and a chance to represent the people of the West Indies,"" the Trinidadian said in a social media post on Monday.
""Wearing that maroon, standing for the anthem, and giving everything I had each time I stepped on the field... it's hard to put into words what that truly means to me.
""To have led the team as captain is a privilege I will always hold close to my heart.""
Pooran last played for West Indies in their 3-0 T20 series defeat by Bangladesh in December last year, while his most recent ODI appearance came in July 2023 against Sri Lanka.
""Nicholas officially informed the leadership of his decision to retire from international cricket, bringing to a close a significant chapter in his career,"" Cricket West Indies said in a statement.
""His performances on the field and influence within the team have made a lasting impact on West Indies cricket.""
Pooran opted to skip West Indies' ongoing T20 series against England, requesting to be rested after playing for the Lucknow Super Giants in the Indian Premier League.
He is likely to remain active on the lucrative global T20 league circuit.

The federal government is planning to impose additional surcharges on electricity consumers by amending the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) Act, a move that would allow it to unilaterally increase electricity bills, sources said on Wednesday.
According to official sources, the proposed amendment to the NEPRA Act will empower the government to exceed the current 10% cap on electricity surcharges, paving the way for higher charges on consumer bills.
Sources said the government was preparing to remove the existing 10% limit on surcharges levied through power bills, with the new legal framework granting it broader authority to determine tariff hikes on a case-by-case basis and for specified durations.
A proposal is also under consideration to charge consumers an additional Rs3.23 per unit as a surcharge. However, a final decision regarding the increase has not yet been made, sources clarified.
In the past, surcharges collected from electricity bills were primarily used to pay interest on the growing circular debt. The government is now aiming to eliminate the circular debt altogether by borrowing Rs1,275 billion from commercial banks.

Senegal stun England to put Tuchel under pressure,"US
Ismaila Sarr, Habib Diarra and Cheikh Sabaly scored for the African side
England slumped to a 3-1 home friendly defeat by Senegal on Tuesday to ramp up the scrutiny on boss Thomas Tuchel one year out from the World Cup.
Goals from Ismaila Sarr, Habib Diarra and Cheikh Sabaly inflicted England's first ever defeat against African opposition at Nottingham Forest's City Ground after Harry Kane had given the hosts an early lead.
Tuchel was scathing in his criticism of his side's dreary display in beating minnows Andorra just 1-0 in World Cup qualifying on Saturday.
The German, who was appointed with the task of ending England's wait since 1966 for a major tournament win, suffered his first defeat in four games in charge.
""We need to see the players under these kinds of conditions against one of the top 20 teams in the world to be smarter,"" said Tuchel.
""We don't go next week to the World Cup. We go in one year.""
Tuchel responded by making 10 changes, with Kane the only player to retain his place.
It took just seven minutes for the Bayern Munich striker to maintain his record of scoring in every game since Tuchel took charge.
Former Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy should have done better when he could only parry Anthony Gordon's shot into the path of Kane, who tapped in his 73rd international goal.
Dean Henderson was given a rare chance to impress in the England goal as Jordan Pickford was relegated to the bench.
The Crystal Palace stopper made impressive saves from his club team-mate Sarr and Idrissa Gana Gueye.
But he was helpless when Sarr made the most of a lack of concentration from Kyle Walker to meet Nicolas Jackson's cross and fire into the bottom corner.
England had never lost to African opposition in 21 previous matches but Senegal had been beaten just once from open play since losing to the Three Lions at the 2022 World Cup.
""Not good enough. We had moments, but with and without the ball things aren't clicking, we're not finding the right tempo,"" said Kane.
""We've lost that aggressive nature that we had.""
Diarra was afforded acres of room to run in behind the England defence and slot between the legs of Henderson to put the visitors in front just after the hour mark.
Mendy made amends for his role in the opening goal with fine saves to deny Bukayo Saka and Morgan Gibbs-White a swift equaliser.
England thought they had levelled late on when Jude Bellingham smashed home from a corner.
But the goal was ruled out for a handball by Levi Colwill before the ball broke to the Real Madrid midfielder.
Senegal made the most of that reprieve to seal a famous win in stoppage time when Sabaly rounded off a slick counter-attack.
Boos rained down from the disgruntled home support to leave Tuchel with plenty to ponder before England are next in action in September.

SC rejects plea against mobile towers around KHI airport,"US
.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected an appeal against the installation of mobile towers around the airport in Karachi, saying that aviation and other authorities concerned said that those towers were built in accordance with international aviation standards.
A three-member bench, comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Aqeel Abbasi heard the appeal. According to the observations of the responsible parties, the bench said that there was no danger to the planes taking off from the airport.
The petitioner Muhammad Aslam Khan Advocate had argued that some time ago, a Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane had crashed into a residential area, in which around 100 people died. The court said in remarks that the accident on the Flight PK-8303 was not due to the population.
During the hearing, Justice Mazhar remarked that the house which was hit by the plane was not so high. He said that planes fly daily and the aviation authorities had no problem, so why someone else had the problem with it.
Justice Abbasi remarked that entire population around the airport could not be evacuated. Justice Rizvi said in his remarks that if any accident happened in the future, the responsibility would lie with the authorities who were currently saying that the towers did not pose any problem for the planes.

Saba Qamar skipped Eid glamour for rest,"IE
Actor gets candid about burnout and healing
Actor Saba Qamar has opened up about her absence from social media during Eidul Azha, revealing that she chose rest over ritual dressing this year.
In a heartfelt Instagram story, the Kamli actor explained she spent the three days of Eid in quiet reflection, prioritising healing and self-care after a demanding year of non-stop work and travel.
""I know so many of you were waiting to see my Eid look this time, and I just want to say that there wasn't one,"" Qamar wrote. ""I didn't wear anything special, didn't dress up, and, for once, I didn't feel like I needed to.""
The actor added that she spent Eid taking it slow. ""This Eid, I chose rest - pure, simple, and soulful rest,"" she said. ""I spent these three days lying down, oil in my hair, good food in front of me, quiet prayers in my heart, and a whole lot of healing.""
""My heart was quietly asking for a break, and I listened,"" Qamar explained. ""Sometimes, we have to pause, breathe, and come home to ourselves. This Eid, I did just that. No glam, no noise - just me-time.""
This is not the first time the star has emphasised the importance of a break. While most celebrities welcomed 2025 with a more energised online presence, Qamar worried fans with a brief social media hiatus. Taking to Instagram Stories, she reassured fans that her absence on social media was not a cause for alarm.
""Sometimes in life, you just need to take a step back, be quiet for a bit, and give yourself some time to heal and recharge,"" she penned.
With more gentle words to dispense, Qamar continued, ""I promise this is just a little pause, not the end of anything. Even the brightest stars need to rest sometimes so they can shine even brighter.""

Pakistani who plotted US attack extradited from Canada,"IL
Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, also known as Shahzeb Jadoon
A Pakistani man was extradited from Canada to the United States on Tuesday to face charges of plotting to carry out an attack on Jews in New York City, the Justice Department said.
Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was arrested in Canada in September.
According to a criminal complaint, Khan planned to travel to New York and carry out a mass shooting in support of the Islamic State (IS) at a Jewish center in Brooklyn on the October 7 anniversary of the deadly 2023 Hamas attack on Israel. ""He planned to use automatic weapons to kill as many members of our Jewish community as possible, all in support of IS,"" US Attorney Jay Clayton said in a statement.
Khan allegedly revealed his plans in conversations with conspirators who were actually undercover law enforcement officers, the Justice Department said. He was taken into custody by Canadian authorities in the municipality of Ormstown some 12 miles (19 kilometers) from the US-Canada border.

Black Cloud' installation envelopes Ukraine streets,"US
Artwork evokes feelings of war in passersby
A massive black cloud has stood in Kyiv's historic Sophia Square this week, emitting flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder in evocation of war, before it travels to the Burning Man art festival in the United States later this year.
The Black Cloud installation, by Ukrainian artist Oleksiy Say, measures 30 metres (100 feet) long and 15 high, weighs nearly eight tonnes and is made from four kilometres of fabric.
The work also includes the sounds of artillery fire, explosions, drones and military vehicles in a chilling evocation of Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine since February 2022.
""Get ready. Evil is just around the corner. It makes sense to face it,"" Say told Reuters, standing beside his work, in a message to others beyond Ukraine.
The 50-year-old, who studied at the Kyiv Art and Industrial Technical School, lives and works in the capital of Ukraine where there has been a surge of ""war art"" during the conflict.
Say's installation will be a Ukrainian contribution to the annual, eight-day independent art festival in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada in August.
""Perhaps the next time someone watches news about Ukraine they will register not only the information but also experience an emotion that goes with it. That's how it (the Black Cloud) is intended to work,"" said Maria Moroz, executive producer of the project.
For Kyiv residents, the Black Cloud is a stark symbol.
On a recent day, some took photos while others stood quietly, one couple hugging in silence under its shadow.
""It evoked images of explosions and destruction in me,"" said Natalia, 58, from Kyiv.
""It made me think of something evil. It reminded me of the war,"" said Tetiana, 54. ""Constant air raid alerts, missiles, ... drones, this is what it makes me think of.""

PRAC criticises missed opportunities in budget,"US
Draws govt's attention to key sectors
The Policy Research and Advisory Council (PRAC) has acknowledged several positive measures in the federal budget for 2025-26, but has raised significant concerns about the budget's failure to address critical challenges, particularly in the industrial sector, which could increase unemployment and destabilise Pakistan's already fragile economic outlook.
In a statement, PRAC Chairman Mohammad Younus Dagha acknowledged the budget's forward-thinking initiatives, including the Green Sukuk, which signals a positive shift towards sustainability and reflects the government's commitment to addressing environmental concerns. He also welcomed the tax relief for salaried individuals, noting it would offer financial relief to the broader population.
However, he pointed out that the lack of an increase in the minimum tax threshold may not sufficiently ease the burden on the most vulnerable and heavily taxed segments. Additionally, the reduction in withholding taxes on property transactions by 1.5% across all tax brackets and the removal of 7% federal excise duty on property transfers are expected to stimulate the real estate and construction sectors.
PRAC expressed concerns about the budget's failure to address the pressing economic challenges. The most significant issue raised was the budget's reliance on unrealistic revenue targets and growth projections, which Dagha described as ""disconnected from economic realities.""

"Punjab, Sindh clash over local governance","US
PPP's Sharjeel criticises, PML-N's Azma defends record
Information ministers from Punjab and Sindh clashed on Wednesday, exchanging barbs over the state of local governments and governance styles in their respective provinces, both ruled by coalition partners — the PML-N in Punjab and the PPP in Sindh.
The war of words comes amid increasing pressure for local government (LG) elections in Punjab, which have been overdue for months. CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja last week warned that an impending order on the matter could embarrass the provincial government.
Sindh Senior Minister and Information Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon questioned the PML-N's reluctance to hold LG elections despite claiming to represent Punjab's mandate. ""If the Punjab government fails to recognise local institutions, it is undermining the Constitution,"" Memon said, adding that managing the province through the commissioner system was regrettable and undemocratic.
Memon accused Punjab's government of denying people grassroots representation and vowed that the PPP would continue to push for LG elections in Punjab. ""We will not abandon the people of Punjab,"" he said, denouncing the PML-N's ""arrogant attitude"" and ""politics of rights violations"".
He stated that the perception of Punjab as ""the fiefdom of a single party"" must be dispelled. He also lamented the Punjab government's ""politics of hatred and division.""
Memon's statement drew a sharp rebuke from his Punjab counterpart, Azma Bukhari. The Punjab information minister stated that the PML-N had previously established a strong LG system in the province and would do so again.
Bukhari mocked the PPP, saying the partywhich secures 400 votes in a provincial assembly constituency and 50 votes in a union council seat contest would soon be put to the test.
""The arrogant rulers in Sindh should have mercy on the province's suffering people. They have been in power for three consecutive terms, yet their performance remains zero,"" the information minister said.
Meanwhile, PPP Parliamentary Leader in the Punjab Assembly, Syed Ali Haider Gilani, entered the fray, reminding the PML-N-led provincial government that the PPP is a coalition partner and that without its support, the government could not pass the upcoming budget.
""The foundation of this [provincial] government rests on the PPP's support,"" Gilani said. He praised the PPP's ""unparalleled services"" in Sindh over the years in infrastructure, health, education, and social protection.

Reform bills tabled amid quorum clashes,"US
All relevant government departments and regulatory bodies will be mandated to integrate with the new portal
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government has introduced a series of new laws aimed at removing barriers to business and trade, streamlining charitable organization registration, providing housing for government employees' families in case of in-service death, offering free legal aid to underprivileged individuals, and tackling climate change challenges.
During a session of the provincial assembly held Wednesday, six bills were presented, and two were approved. Among the key legislative developments is the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Ease of Doing Business Bill 2025, which seeks to simplify business operations in the province through regulatory reforms and the establishment of a one-window digital portal.
All relevant government departments and regulatory bodies will be mandated to integrate with the new portal. An operational unit will also be created to manage the development, maintenance, and upgrading of the portal. The law will apply province-wide and will be implemented following an official government notification.
Additionally, the assembly introduced the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Government Employees Housing Foundation Bill 2025, which proposes the provision of residential plots to government employees or their families — on a no-profit, no-loss basis — in cases of retirement or in-service death.
To enhance the regulation of charitable organizations, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Charities (Amendment) Bill 2025 was also tabled.
This move is intended to ensure the Commission's financial self-sufficiency, improve transparency, filter out inactive organizations, and ensure more effective use of public donations.
Finally, the assembly introduced the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Legal Aid (Amendment) Bill, aimed at providing free legal assistance to the poor and needy. The amendments focus on cost efficiency by eliminating the previously proposed separate Legal Aid Agency and instead assigning the Director General of Prosecution as the head of legal aid efforts, establishing a special wing within the Directorate of Prosecution to handle legal aid services.
Earlier, despite repeated quorum objections from the opposition, legislative proceedings continued in the assembly.

Pakistanis topped asylum seekers' list  in UK in 2024,"DE
The number of UK asylum seekers has risen sharply in recent years
In 2024, the largest group of asylum seekers hailed from Pakistan, followed by Afghanistan. In previous years, they came mainly from Syria and Iran.
Britain's Labour government pledged to cut a backlog in asylum applications and end ""the costly use of hotels to house asylum seekers"", saving £1 billion annually, finance minister Rachel Reeves announced Wednesday.
""Funding that I have provided today... will cut the asylum backlog, hear more appeal cases and return people who have no rights to be here, saving the taxpayer a billion pounds a year,"" Reeves said in her Spending Review that sets out Treasury expenditure and savings over the next few years.
The number of UK asylum seekers has risen sharply in recent years, with tens of thousands of applications waiting to be decided, according to official figures.
Labour, which came to power last July, has set about tackling the situation.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer has started formal talks with unspecified countries to create ""return centres"" outside the UK for those who have exhausted all legal avenues to remain in the country.
The number of asylum seekers in the UK tripled to 84,200 in 2024 from an average of 27,500 between 2011 and 2020.
In 2022, there were approximately 13 asylum applications per 10,000 people in the UK, compared with 25 asylum applications per 10,000 people in the EU at the same time.
Some 11 percent of migrants in the UK were asylum seekers or refugees in 2023 — almost twice as high as the 2019 figure of six percent.
The number of people crossing the Channel in makeshift boats, a route that virtually did not exist before 2018, has meanwhile increased sharply in recent years.

FO rejects Jaishankar's 'irresponsible' remarks,"FR
Advises Indian minister to refrain from concocting, misleading narratives
Pakistan on Wednesday categorically rejected the irresponsible remarks of the Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made during different media engagements in Brussels, advising him to refrain from concocting misleading narratives to justify their recent aggressive actions.
""The discourse of top diplomats should aim to promote peace and harmony, rather than producing bellicose punchlines. The tone and tenor of a foreign minister should be commensurate with his dignified status,"" the Foreign Office spokesperson said in a press statement.
Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, Jaishankar said when India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that ""Operation Sindoor"" was not over, it was a clear message that ""we reserve the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us"".
The Foreign Office spokesperson said for the last several years, India had been engaged in a malicious campaign to mislead the international community through a fictitious narrative of victimhood.
""However, India's continued anti-Pakistan diatribe cannot hide its sponsorship of terrorism beyond its borders, nor can it cover up the state-sanctioned oppression in IIOJK. Instead of pointing fingers at others, India should introspect on its own involvement in terrorism, subversion and targeted assassinations,"" he added.
The spokesperson further stressed that India must also desist from concocting misleading narratives to justify its recent aggressive actions.
""The narrative emerging from India betrays sheer frustration, following an unsuccessful military adventure against Pakistan. The Indian leaders would be well-advised to improve the standard of their discourse and discard their obsession with Pakistan. The history will judge not by who shouted the loudest — but by who acted the wisest,"" the spokesperson further added.

Military notes of Indo-Pak conflict — the rundown,"PK
Escalation and military preparations took place during May 1–6.
During the last two weeks, in this series, we discussed the perceptual aspects of the recent Indo-Pak standoff, India’s doctrinal collapse, the redefined deterrence and the ‘Exterior’ and ‘Interior Maneuvers’ by both sides, before and during the hostilities. We continue the debate…
This was the first time that India under its supposed ‘new normal’ used ‘cruise’ missiles, both the BrahMos version (PJ-10 co-developed with Russia) as well as the European SCALP-EG targeting Pakistan proper. Pakistan also retaliated for the first time, employing its conventionally armed short-range Fatah-I and Fatah-II series of ‘ballistic’ missiles and other types. This was also the first time that RPVs (drones) were used with the intent of causing damage to the other side, in addition to reconnaissance and intelligence-collection roles. This was also the first time that strategic instability in South Asia was linked internationally to the unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute and not terrorism per se.
Let us quickly recapture the timelines from April 22 to May 22, 2025. In run up to the crisis, on April 22, five militants killed 26 civilian tourists in Pahalgam, Jammu & Kashmir, including one Nepali national, leading to Indian finger pointing towards Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) groups. On April 23, India suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, closed Attari–Wagah border crossing, expelled Pakistan’s military diplomats, reduced Pakistan’s diplomatic staff and cancelled SAARC visas for Pakistani nationals. From April 23–30 border skirmishes took place.
On April 24, Pakistan condemned the Pahalgam attack and termed India’s response as “unilateral”; and retaliated by cancelling Indian visas, evacuating Indian nationals, closing its airspace to Indian aircraft, halting all trade and warning India against diverting Indus water, calling it an act of war. On April 25, India initiated ceasefire violations across the LoC. National Security Committee (NSC) met in Pakistan on April 26. Iran stepped forward with an offer to mediate. And on April 30, India banned its airspace to Pakistan, and IAF intruded into Pakistani airspace.
Escalation and military preparations took place during May 1–6. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, after some initial ambivalence, ‘expected’ to speak with both foreign ministers on May 1. On May 3, Pakistan successfully test-fired its short-range Abdali ballistic missile. India escalated by cutting off all mail and trade links with Pakistan, banning Pakistani vessels from its ports and warned Pakistani ships against entering the Indian waters. On May 4, India stopped downflow from Baglihar dam on River Chenab. On May 6, Pakistan shot down 29 Indian drones near the LoC and in Punjab. And Iran’s FM visited Pakistan proposing mediation.
In the military operations (May 7–10), India launched “Operation Sindoor”, on May 7, conducting missile strikes on nine sites in Pakistan (Bahawalpur, Muridke, Gulpur, Bhimber, Chak Amru, Bagh, Kotli, Sialkot and Muzaffarabad). On May 10, IAF attacked eight major Pakistani air bases, including Nur Khan base in Rawalpindi. Pakistan, early on May 10, retaliated with Operation “Bunyan-un-Marsoos”, launching missile and drone combo on 26 military targets across India, and in the Indian-occupied Kashmir. It also launched another wave of swarm drones, loitering munitions and Fatah missiles targeting 26 locations along India’s western border.
On the same day (May 10), the Saudi FM called for de-escalation, Secretary of State Rubio spoke with both PMs and NSAs, urging restraint. Pakistan’s DGMO reached out to the Indian side for direct military-level communications. President Trump mediated the ceasefire and announced it on X. On May 11, Pakistan claimed victory against India. Both sides subsequently conducted propaganda offensive through aggressive diplomacy by sending delegations to global capitals.
In between the above compressed timeline, a lot went through. The Indian attacks, as per information available through open sources, were ‘supposedly calibrated’ during May 8 and early on May 9, whereas the wider attacks during May 9-10, still ‘presumably’ calibrated, were dangerously escalatory, as these were aimed at Pakistan’s SEAD (suppression of enemy air defences) systems, after IAF having lost aircraft on May 7.
It was sometimes on the morning of May 9 (the US time and evening in India/Pakistan), that the US received unspecified, new but ‘alarming intelligence’ about dangerous escalation between both sides, as reported by CNN and corroborated byThe New York Times. The US worries emerged before the dramatic escalation during the night of May 9-10, but no source has actually ‘identified’ those worries.
The ‘speculation’ is that Washington observing Pakistan’s launch of short-range Fatah-I and -II ballistic missiles and others for the first time during May 9-10 night got aggressively involved. Islamabad’s stockpile of tactical nuclear arsenal and Indian thinking of continuing a conventional war of punitive retribution provided a background to it. Some analysts also attribute it to Pakistan’s deft diplomacy, signalling to and drawing on the US interlocution, spurred by ‘readiness changes in Pakistan’s stockpiles’, besides the announced meeting of Pakistan’s National Command Authority, that oversees the non-conventional means of war i.e. the nuclear weapons.
The DG ISPR had, on May 9, declined calls for de-escalation due to the planned riposte under Pakistan’s ‘quid-pro-quo plus’ strategy, to equalise losses caused by the Indian attacks. India later struck Nur Khan airbase around 2:30 am on May 10. This attack was meant to “strike where it would hurt”, to quote the Indian Director-General Air Operations, Air Marshal Bharti. However, that was an escalatory message.
The Indian attacks also targeted Rafiqui, Rahim Yar Khan and Sukkur bases during the first wave of strikes, followed by the IAF strikes at Sargodha, Bholari and Jacobabad airbases and some military infrastructure at Murid, Chunian, Arifwala and Pasrur. This was India “knocking on the nuclear door”, and it presumably provided more muscle and lethality to Pakistan’s riposte, that was dubbed equally if alarmingly escalatory by Washington.
In de-escalation, the predominant view is that the Saudis, the Americans, the Turks and the Qataris rushed to quell India “not because Pakistan asked, but because Delhi could not stabilize the board…Pakistan had not flinched; it had not folded. It escalated, absorbed and redrew the board”.
More on ceasefire exclusively later. Continues…

Are copyright laws a threat to AI industry?,"PK
Amidst the lawsuit, Getty argues both can co-exist
Getty Images' landmark copyright lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Stability AI began at London's High Court on Monday, with Getty rejecting Stability AI's contention the case posed a threat to the generative AI industry.
Seattle-based Getty, which produces editorial content and creative stock images and video, accuses Stability AI of using its images to ""train"" its Stable Diffusion system, which can generate images from text inputs.
Getty, which is bringing a parallel lawsuit against Stability AI in the United States, says Stability AI unlawfully scraped millions of images from its websites and used them to train and develop Stable Diffusion.
Stability AI – which has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in funding and in March announced investment by the world's largest advertising company, WPP – is fighting the case and denies infringing any of Getty's rights.
Before the trial began on Monday, Stability AI's spokesperson said ""the wider dispute is about technological innovation and freedom of ideas"".
""Artists using our tools are producing works built upon collective human knowledge, which is at the core of fair use and freedom of expression,"" the spokesperson said.
In court filings, Stability AI lawyer Hugo Cuddigan said Getty's lawsuit posed ""an overt threat to Stability's whole business and the wider generative AI industry"".
Getty's lawyers said that argument was incorrect and their case was about upholding intellectual property rights.
""It is not a battle between creatives and technology, where a win for Getty Images means the end of AI,"" Getty's lawyer Lindsay Lane told the court. ""The two industries can exist in synergistic harmony because copyright works and database rights are critical to the advancement and success of AI ... the problem is when AI companies such as Stability want to use those works without payment.""
Getty's case is one of several lawsuits brought in Britain, the US and elsewhere over the use of copyright-protected material to train AI models, after ChatGPT and other AI tools became widely available more than two years ago.
Creative industries are grappling with the legal and ethical implications of AI models that can produce their own work after being trained on existing material. Prominent figures including Elton John have called for greater protections for artists.
Lawyers say Getty's case will have a major impact on the law, as well as potentially informing government policy on copyright protections relating to AI. Reuters

SESSI made 'doubtful' medicine purchases,"US
PAC orders audit into Rs9b annual drug procurements
The Sindh Assembly's Public Accounts Committee (PAC) has ordered a full audit into the procurement of medicines worth Rs9 billion annually by the Sindh Employees Social Security Institution (SESSI), amid complaints of large-scale irregularities, substandard supplies, and misappropriation of public funds.
The decision came during a PAC meeting held on Wednesday under the chairmanship of Nisar Khuhro. The committee reviewed SESSI's audit reports for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Senior officials, including Secretary Labour Rafiq Qureshi and SESSI Commissioner Miandad Rahujo, were in attendance.
During the session, Khuhro expressed concern over the massive annual expenditure on medicines despite persistent complaints from workers and health staff about the supply of low-quality drugs and outdated machinery at SESSI hospitals.
SESSI Commissioner Rahujo informed the committee that the institution operates seven major hospitals and 42 dispensaries across the province, including Walika Hospital, Landhi Hospital, and the Kidney Centre. These facilities serve industrial labourers and SESSI-registered employees.
He stated that out of SESSI's Rs13billion annual budget, 70% — around Rs9billion — is spent on medicine procurement and healthcare services. The remaining Rs4billion is allocated to field directors.
However, the PAC was told that only 70% of the medicine procurement follows formal tendering procedures, while the remaining 30% is purchased locally by directors, where most complaints and irregularities reportedly originate.
Khuhro directed that a comprehensive audit be conducted to examine the entire procurement process, particularly the Rs9billion spent annually on medicines. He stressed the need for transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.
The commissioner added that Hospital Management Committees had been formed to oversee hospital operations, and the SESSI Governing Body had recently approved a Rs1.4billion project to upgrade and reconstruct Walika Hospital. Construction is expected to commence within a year.
Separately, the PAC raised serious concerns about violations of minimum wage laws across the province. The PAC chairman cited disturbing figures that nearly 80% of private industrial units are not paying the government-mandated minimum monthly wage of Rs37,000 to workers.
When asked about compliance, Commissioner Rahujo revealed that out of 67,000 industrial units in Sindh, only 24,000 are registered with SESSI. Of these, 6,000 are non-operational and 18,000 are functional, collectively employing about 800,000 registered workers. He admitted that many units, including private security firms, fail to pay the full minimum wage.
Calling it a ""blatant violation of labour laws,"" Khuhro directed the Labour Department and SESSI to take immediate steps to ensure all workers receive the legal minimum wage, and to launch strict enforcement actions against defaulting units.
The committee also turned its attention to internal issues within SESSI, particularly staffing and fraudulent appointments. Khuhro questioned the number of employees, the legitimacy of their hiring, and the attendance system in place.
Commissioner Rahujo reported that SESSI currently employs 4,200 staff and has implemented a digital attendance system. He confirmed that several people hired on the basis of fake degrees had been dismissed after verification.
In another damning disclosure, it was revealed that Rs50million had been siphoned off through fraudulent billing under the guise of repair works at SESSI facilities. The PAC ordered the Labour Secretary to conduct a detailed inquiry into the matter and submit a comprehensive report on the financial irregularities.
Khuhro stressed that institutional reforms and strict oversight are essential to protect workers' rights and public resources. He reaffirmed that it is SESSI's core responsibility to serve the working class with transparency, efficiency, and integrity.

This increase is expected to significantly raise the official valuation
The district administration of Rawalpindi has decided to increase Deputy Commissioner (DC) property rates by 15% across all commercial and residential areas, including both upscale and older localities. The revised rates will come into effect from July 1.
This increase is expected to significantly raise the official valuation (registry price) of all types of properties. Notably, the DC rates for posh and commercial zones will see a steeper rise, while even underdeveloped and historic neighbourhoods will face revised, higher rates.
As a result of this decision, there has been a surge in property sale registrations ahead of the new fiscal year. Property dealers are rushing to complete transactions before the new rates are implemented.
According to the Property Registrar Office, only those transactions for which sale statements are completed by June 30 will be registered at the current DC rates. Any transactions incomplete by that date will be subject to the revised rates, and additional stamp papers must be submitted for registries already in process.
If the upcoming Punjab provincial budget, to be presented on Saturday, June 14, includes changes to stamp duty or other property-related taxes, those will also apply to pending property registries from July 1 onward.

Bilawal slams India for sabotaging Trump's peace efforts,"PL
Slams Delhi's use of terrorism as foreign policy tool
PPP Chairman and head of a high-level parliamentary delegation Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Wednesday said India's narrative was based on 'lies and propaganda', while Pakistan's stance was rooted in'truth and peace.'
He criticised India for using terrorism as a foreign policy tool and pointed out that Indian agencies had been targeting Sikh activists around the world.
Speaking at a news conference along with the delegation members, Bilawal said US President Donald Trump's multiple offers of mediation reflected his desire to establish peace between Pakistan and India. However, he regretted that Indian government seemed to be sabotaging such efforts.
He welcomed the US State Department's recent statement, highlighting former President Donald Trump's willingness to mediate Kashmir issue during his tenure.
""Pakistan has always sought peace through dialogue and diplomacy,"" Bilawal said, emphasising that resolving all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir dispute, must come through peaceful negotiations.
He stressed that lasting peace between Pakistan and India was in the interest of international community.
Bilawal asserted that India had repeatedly failed to produce credible evidence to support its terrorism allegations against Pakistan. ""Despite our continuous demands, India has not been able to prove any of its claims,"" he said.
He said : ""India knows well that Pakistan has no links with terrorism. Its efforts to malign us will fail, and we will continue to pursue peace in the region.""
He further said that Pakistan sought peaceful solutions to all disputes - Kashmir, and water issues - through dialogue.
Bilawal said: ""Even President Trump acknowledged that dialogue on Kashmir is essential. If the U.S. must push India to the negotiating table, it should, because peace is in the world's best interest.""
Bilawal also condemned India's reported campaign against Sikh communities abroad and its involvement in terrorism within Pakistan. ""We call on India to stop sponsoring terrorism beyond its borders,"" he added.
He warned that India's threats to cut off water supplies to Pakistan were a violation of UN Charter.
Commenting on Pakistan's recent security achievements, Bilawal said: ""The recent conflict has shown that even as a smaller nation, Pakistan has the strength to defend itself on all fronts.""

Charred body found on motorway,"US
Police say victim was murdered before being set on fire
The police have apprehended two suspects involved in the case of a charred body found on the motorway.
The body of an unidentified man was discovered near Sami Di Jhok. The victim had been murdered and then set on fire by unknown assailants before being discarded on the motorway.
Following this grim discovery, a case was registered at the Roadala Road police station. After the case was registered, the newly appointed Station House Officer (SHO) of Roadala, Ghazi Adil Gulfam, and his team employed technical resources to identify the heirs.
Investigations revealed that the victim, Farrukh Shakeel, had been abducted from the area of Kahania police station, Lahore, where a separate case had also been registered.
During the investigation of this case, the police arrested two culprits, Mubashir Hanif and Abdul Wahab, and sent them to jail, initiating the investigation process.
Meanwhile, two people, including a revenue department official, were shot dead in separate incidents.
The police took the bodies into custody and shifted them to the hospital and started searching for the attackers.
Police said 23-year-old Usman alias Don, a resident of Chak 47, JB Mansooran, Nishatabad police station, was seriously injured by accused Saifullah, Asmatullah, Sanaullah and Amanullah, armed with modern weapons, while the victim was sitting with others on chairs outside his house.
The injured Usman was shifted to Allied Hospital after medical assistance, where he died after struggling for life and death.
Police officers reached the spot. They took possession of the body of the deceased, handed it over to his relatives after postmortem, registered a case under the sections of murder against the named accused and started raids to arrest them.

Top US general praises 'phenomenal partner' Pakistan,"US
CENTCOM chief warns against pursuing ties with India at Pakistan's expense
In a stunning rebuke to the Indian attempts seeking Pakistan's international isolation, a top US general on Tuesday publicly praised Pakistan as a ""phenomenal partner"" in the global fight against terrorism and insisted Washington must not ignore Pakistan while pursuing strategic ties with India.
The testimony of General Michael Kurilla, Commander Central Command (CENTCOM), was seen as a major diplomatic win for Pakistan at a time when India was trying to build a narrative that Islamabad was sponsoring terrorism.
The testimony stands in sharp contrast to persistent efforts, particularly from Indian lobbying groups, to paint Pakistan as an unreliable partner in the fight against terrorism. Gen Kurilla's candid remarks not only validate Pakistan's ongoing sacrifices but may also recalibrate the tone of future US policy in South Asia.
Gen Kurilla's statement before the House Arms Services Committee led to a meltdown in India where the media and commentators questioned the US loyalty.
The CENTCOM chief terming ISIS-Khorasan the most active terrorist groups, said the Afghan Taliban went after them and pushed ""a lot of them into the trial areas on the Afghan-Pakistan border"".
""Through a phenomenal partnership with Pakistanthey (Pakistan) have gone after ISIS Khorasan, killing dozens of them,"" he told lawmakers.
""Through our relationship we have with them, and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals. They extradited back Jafar, who is one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing,"" he added.
""And the first person [] the [Pakistani] chief of the army staff Munir [called] me and said, ""I've caught him, ready to extradite him back to United States, please tell the Secretary of Defense and the President.""
""So, we are seeing Pakistan, with limited intelligence that we provide, and go after them using their means to do that, and we're seeing an effect on ISIS Khorasan,"" General Kurila said.
""And I would also tell you that since 2024the beginningPakistan has had over 1,000 terrorist attacks in the western area, killing about 700 security and [2,500] civilians. They have an active counterterrorism fight right now, and they have been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world.""
Gen Kurilla highlighted the staggering toll terrorism continues to take on Pakistan itself, citing over 1,000 terrorist attacks in 2024 alonekilling approximately 700 security personnel and 2,500 civilians.
""They have an active counterterrorism fight right now,"" he stated. ""And they've been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world.""
The CENTCOM chief emphasized that Pakistan's efforts over the last several months have severely degraded ISIS-K's capabilities. According to intelligence gained through interrogations and exploitation of captured militants, the terrorist group is currently at a ""low point"", though it still poses a transnational threat.
""These are the same individuals that carried out the Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow and the bombing in Kerman, Iran,"" Kurilla said. ""There are even ties to plots against the U.S. homeland, which I can discuss in a classified setting.""
In a significant diplomatic note, Gen Kurilla rejected the idea that US relations in South Asia must be zero-sum between India and Pakistan.
""It's not a binary switch,"" he asserted. ""We can't have one with Pakistan if we have a relationship with India. We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has.""
Paul Kapur
Paul Kapur, US President Donald Trump's nominee for Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that he would prioritise security cooperation with Pakistan where it aligns with US interests.
He also expressed intent to explore opportunities for enhancing bilateral collaboration in trade and investment,
He previously served on the State Department's Policy Planning Staff during Trump's first term, where he played a role in shaping US strategy in South Asia.
Kapur, an academic of Indian origin, acknowledged the region's volatility, referring to the recent escalation between India and Pakistan. He said the crisis was narrowly averted due to ""intense engagement"" by US Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
""If confirmed, I will pursue security cooperation with Pakistan where it is in America's interest,"" says Paul Kapur who is set to become Trump's top diplomat on South Asia.
On Pakistan, he said that if confirmed, he would ""pursue security cooperation where it is beneficial to US interests while seeking opportunities for bilateral collaboration in trade and investment.""
He noted that ""South Asia recently avoided a costly conflict with Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio intensely engaged on the issue.""
He added, ""If confirmed, I will continue to promote long-standing US security interests with India and Pakistan through the pursuit of peace and stability and the fight against terrorism.""

Friends going home from food street crushed by tanker,"US
The people held the driver responsible for the accident and tortured him
The number of deaths in traffic accidents involving water tankers in the city has not stopped. A water tanker ran over a motorcycle near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad, resulting in the death of two youths at in the early hour of Tuesday. The people present at the scene pelted stones and broke the windows and lights of the water tanker, while the Papushnagar police reached the scene and saved the water tanker from burning.
The people held the driver responsible for the accident and tortured him, who was later taken into custody by the police. The young man who died in the water tanker collision were identified as 20-year-old Muhammad Zubair and 18-year-old Ayan. The bodies of both the deceased were taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital in a hidden ambulance, while the Papushnagar police are investigating the incident further.
Mohammad Zubair's brother, Sarfaraz, speaking to media representatives outside the Chhipa cold storage, stated that Zubair and his friends were returning after eating at Hussainabad Food Street when they became victims of a traffic accident. He urged higher authorities to take concrete measures to control traffic accidents and prevent such incidents.
The brother of Ayaan, one of the young men who died in the accident, speaking to media representatives, said that he had visited the accident site and gathered information from people there. He was told that a car driver had given way to both young men, and then a water tanker crushed them.
After their funeral prayers, both young men who died were laid to rest in the local cemetery.
Meanwhile, a motorcyclist died in a traffic accident near Sharafi Goth. Rescue officials say that the deceased was identified as 27-year-old Sajjad. People at the scene told the ambulance driver that the accident occurred due to a collision with a water tanker. However, SHO Sharafi Goth Rao Khalid said that one person riding a motorcycle was killed and another was slightly injured when a bus hit him on Korangi Industrial Road.

"Fights, politics rock Rawalpindi Arts Council","US
Frequent brawls, artiste bans & administrative silence have driven families away
Once known for promoting family entertainment and cultural heritage, the Rawalpindi Arts Council has now become a battleground — both political and physical.
According to sources, frequent quarrels involving physical assaults have become a routine occurrence, while the administration often disappears during such incidents and no legal action is taken against those involved.
In just the past four days, two fights broke out involving foul language and physical violence. Despite the chaos, no complaints were filed with the police by the council's administration.
Established in 1975 during the tenure of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the council was meant to promote entertainment, highlight Punjabi culture, and support local artists through drama festivals.
Over the past 50 years, it staged historic plays and launched the careers of many artists.
However, in the past two years, the council has turned into a political arena. More than half of the artists, directors, and singers have been barred from entering the premises.
A female director's play was pulled from the drama festival schedule at the last minute. A former director was removed abruptly at midnight due to alleged political pressures, sources said. Protests and rallies have been held by artists against these restrictions.
The political entanglements are so intense that even a senator and two MNAs from the PML-N have failed to resolve the issues.
As a result, the number of family attendees has significantly declined. In some shows, only security personnel, administrative staff, and artists' families are present, the sources claimed.
Earlier this week, a serious altercation broke out before a play, with young men exchanging blows and hurling abuse.
Women and children fled the scene, some running upstairs to escape the chaos. The brawl lasted nearly 30 minutes despite efforts by others to intervene.
Families have appealed to Punjab's Information Minister Uzma Bukhari to visit the council, listen to all artist groups, and lift the bans to restore normalcy.
They warned that if immediate action is not taken, the Arts Council could cease to exist as a cultural hub and become a full-fledged battlefield.

"Pump petrol, earn raptures","IL
Should Imran Abbas really be impressed by a woman working at a gas station?
Quick, without Googling or consulting ChatGPT, riddle us this: what is the most ludicrous, outlandish, woman-in-men's-field thing a female person do to earn the respect of a man? Is it building a rocket? Sliding into a parallel parking spot in 0.5 seconds? Building a career as a petrol station attendant?
We need neither brains nor AI to assist with this answer, because we have Imran Abbas toiling away on Instagram Stories to tell us: it is number 3. Possibly because women have little time left for rocket-building over the course of a busy work day, and also because very few women in their right minds would attempt to parallel park when there is a perfectly good spot available half a mile away free of both other cars and braying bystanders. Which just leaves us with the petrol station thing.
Earlier this month, Imran was impressed enough to post (with consent) a video of the woman refuelling his car, not unlike a tourist on safari in Africa pulling over to quickly snap photos of a wandering leopard before it slinks away into the bush. Just before telling us all this her name, Imran urges us to check out this rare sighting of a 'working woman', saying, ""Look at this, women here are in every field of work."" The label splashed across his video read ""Respect!!!"". Yes, all three exclamation marks are his own.
What's the problem?
In an interview earlier this year, when touching upon society's favourite oxymoron (the ""working woman"") the ever dependable Sania Saeed, fierce defender of those of those she shares a gender with, pointed out that in rural areas, women had been working and farming alongside men for generations without anyone recognising their value.
Bearing Sania's observation in mind, the real question is this: why is it noteworthy for a woman to be working at a petrol station? Why can a woman not be out in the wild earning a living without people getting out of their cars to marvel at the spectacle? Is it because there are so many cultural barriers for women to break through that by the time they make it to the finish line at the petrol station, it is time to hand out medals and/or film it all for posterity? Is this awed state the equivalent of a woman overcome with raptures over a man who is both liberal and culinarily advanced enough to boil himself an egg for breakfast?
As a man as social media savvy as Imran must be aware, in the wake of any content posted online, it is the prerogative of followers to comb it for subtext with the diligence of a forensics expert searching a crime scene for clues. On social media, a spade is rarely ever a spade. You put up your post, and in return, we put on our Sherlock hats and ask the important questions: What can we glean from this five-second video about this person's innermost thoughts and society at large?
In Imran's defence
We have little interest in Imran's innermost thoughts – unless, of course, he is reckless enough to publicly compose a post titled ""My innermost private thoughts"", in which case it is open season on the poor man. In this spirit, it is necessary to back up Imran's one-word helpful caption and note that, as he so thoughtfully pointed out, it is of course entirely respectable to earn a living at a petrol station. He is not wrong on that score.
We must also absolve him of any nefarious intentions of patronising this woman in the same way as someone else would praise a four-year-old's drawing of a cat. This is not meant to be an attack on Imran, who, lest we forget, was amongst the first male celebrities to publicly condemn the murder of Sana Yousaf, a woman who fell afoul of a man spurned. In this petrol station situation, Imran's was an entirely innocuous post, put up to celebrate the power of women defying social norms to go out and earn a living that does not involve a more traditionally female career, such as teaching or making snide comments about blackheads whilst threading 50 eyebrows a day.
All of which is a very roundabout way of circling back to our original question: why are there so many social norms that necessitate defying in order for a woman to find work at a petrol station? Is such public appreciation yet another example of hidden patriarchy?
Of course, it is a bit pointless to go searching for hidden patriarchy in Pakistan when we have such a rich abundance of the in-your-face variety, displayed so gloriously on our dramas on our screens and there for your viewing pleasure on the off chance that you have not had your fill of patriarchy in your real non-drama life. To pick at random, Naqsh, starring Hina Altaf, shows us a father informing his daughter that she must marry the man of his choice on the grounds that he is her father, despite her protestations to the contrary. Meanwhile, Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum (in which a woman felt compelled to marry a stranger so as to spare her parents awkward questions about why there was a bride-shaped space on the wedding stage) shows Hania Aamir's Sharjeena sprinting to the kitchen after putting in a full day at work without anyone batting an eye (although her more sympathetic housemates do take care to compliment her cooking, a heartwarming moment for which we are urged to give them an undying round of applause.)
Down with patriarchy
Many educated women will be fortunate enough to no longer have to put up with a father stubbornly insisting they marry whatever specimen he parades before them, but unfortunately they will still find themselves occupying the Sharjeena end of the spectrum when it comes to striking that work-life balance. And naturally, if a real-life Sharjeena lands herself a man who will voluntarily boil that egg, she it to be congratulated for winning the lottery.
We should not belittle Imran for recognising the hard work put in by a woman. It is, after all, the very thing that Sania stressed people fail to do. But the very fact that a woman is celebrated for being able to work in what would otherwise have been a post taken up by a man points unwittingly to a society rooted in preferring that that woman stay home instead and trot out beautiful rotis as if drawn by the hand of God. Or a compass.
As Morgan Freeman succinctly remarked way back in a 2006 interview, the only way to get rid of racism is to stop talking about it. In the same vein, the only way to hack away at deep-rooted patriarchy is to not stop and take note every time a woman steps out of the house to earn a living just like a man. Hopefully, we can achieve this noble goal before Katy Perry builds a second home on the moon. Although perhaps if we insist on entertaining such notions, we are just the dreamers of dreams.

WI announce revamped Test squad for Aus series,"US
Several players who were part of the recent Test tour to Pakistan have missed out
The West Indies have unveiled a significantly revamped Test squad for their upcoming home series against Australia, marking the beginning of the 20252027 ICC World Test Championship cycle.
Roston Chase, recently appointed Test captain and returning to the format for the first time since March 2023, will lead a youthful and restructured lineup.
Notably, white-ball captain Shai Hope makes a comeback to the Test side, while his ODI deputy, Brandon King, has earned his maiden Test call-up.
Veteran pacer Kemar Roach has been omitted from the squad, signaling a move toward building a new core.
The top order has been strengthened with the return of opener John Campbell and the inclusion of 24-year-old Kevlon Anderson, who has been rewarded for his strong domestic form.
Anderson impressed in the 2024/25 West Indies Championship, amassing 573 runs in 11 innings with three centuries, finishing third among the tournament's leading run-scorers.
""I'm excited about the inclusion of young prospect Kevlon Anderson, who comes in after solid seasons in our domestic competitions to help provide stability in the top order, while the return of Shai Hope is welcomed given his consistency in white ball cricket,"" head coach Daren Sammy said.
""Brandon King's inclusion fits a role we have identified that needs special focus to take our team to those closer to the top of the rankings,"" he added.
The bowling attack also features new faces. Twenty-one-year-old Johann Layne joins the squad after claiming 63 wickets in 17 first-class matches.
Anderson Phillip, who was part of the squad during the Pakistan tour, has earned his place again following a five-wicket haul for West Indies A against South Africa A.
""The start of the Test Championship Cycle is critical to building positive momentum as we strive to work our way up the rankings. Beginning with a strong showing against a team like Australia would be ideal in our quest to bring West Indies back to the helm of Test Cricket,"" he said.
""It was imperative that we sought to put a squad together that was well equipped, in both the batting and bowling departments, to manage the ebbs and flows of this format of the game, while possessing the ability to apply pressure in key phases, through disciplined, purposeful play,"" he added.
Several players who were part of the recent Test tour to Pakistan have missed out, including Joshua Da Silva, Alick Athanaze, Kavem Hodge, Amir Jangoo, Gudakesh Motie, and Kevin Sinclair.
For the unversed, the three-match Test series will commence on June 25 in Barbados.
West Indies squad for Australia Tests: Roston Chase (Captain), Jomel Warrican (Vice Captain), Kevlon Anderson, Kraigg Brathwaite, John Campbell, Keacy Carty, Justin Greaves, Shai Hope, Tevin Imlach, Alzarri Joseph, Shamar Joseph, Brandon King, Johann Layne, Mikyle Louis, Anderson Phillip, Jayden Seales.

FinMin's presser marred by journalists boycott,"DE
The omission this year was seen as a serious breach of transparency.
Journalists briefly boycotted Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb's post-budget press conference on Wednesday after the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) broke
with a decades-old tradition by failing to provide a technical briefing on the Finance Bill.
The boycott forced a delay in the press conference as finance ministry officials attempted to convince reporters to return - without success. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar eventually intervened and managed to resolve the standoff, allowing the briefing to proceed.
Journalists protested the absence of the customary technical session, saying such briefings had been provided consistently for over 20 years.
The omission this year was seen as a serious breach of transparency.
Later, the finance minister sent the relevant officials to persuade the journalists, but to no avail. When the matter became serious, Tarar reached 'P' Block, where the press conference was being held, and resolved the matter.

Green economy: beneficiaries and losers,"PK
Women still make up only about 16% of the workforce worldwide in the energy sector.
Innovation and sustainable development now have more opportunities thanks to the transition to a green economy. New types of jobs are being created as nations take steps to lower carbon emissions, make investments in renewable energy and build infrastructure that is climate resilient. The future of work is thought to depend on these so-called green jobs. But a crucial question is brought up by this shift: who will benefit and who might be left behind? Especially, how does this change affect workforce gender equality?
Women still make up only about 16% of the workforce worldwide in the energy sector. The percentage is marginally higher in renewable energy, where women comprise roughly 32% of the workforce. However, most of these jobs are in lower-level or administrative roles. Since they are underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) education, women are rarely seen in technical or leadership positions. Women lose out on the high-paying, technical jobs that are expanding at the fastest rate in the green economy if they are unable to access these fields.
The situation is even more challenging in Pakistan. Women only make up 4% of technical positions in the energy industry, and many female engineering graduates are either unemployed or not actively employed. Even if women do work in the energy or environmental sectors, their opportunities for advancement into leadership positions are typically limited to non-technical roles like support or communication. Women's ability to fully benefit from the green economy is limited by their lack of representation and opportunity.
When it comes to launching or expanding green businesses, Pakistani women entrepreneurs also face significant obstacles. Despite introducing Green Banking Guidelines and providing some incentives for green finance, the SBP's policies do not always consider the particular difficulties faced by women. For instance, many women are excluded from business networks, do not have access to collateral or experience discrimination in financial institutions based on their gender. Women-owned green businesses will find it difficult to compete or expand without greater support.
The carbon credit market, where nations or businesses can purchase and sell credits based on how much carbon they emit or reduce, is a new area of economic activity. New regulations to permit trading in this market were recently announced by Pakistan. This presents a risk even though it might generate revenue and encourage low-carbon development. The advantages may once more go primarily to men and those in positions of power if women and other marginalised groups are not actively included in this market. Women must be represented in these markets at all levels, from project design and ownership to policymaking, in order for them to be equitable.
Gender equality must be taken into consideration when developing policies to ensure that the green economy benefits everyone. First and foremost, more needs to be done to inspire women and girls to pursue STEM fields. Green technology training, mentorship programmes and scholarships can all help women get ready for the workforce of the future. For women who wish to work in green industries but might not have received formal training in the field, governments and businesses must also create specialised training programmes.
Another crucial area is financial accessibility. Financial institutions must create products that are specifically designed to meet the needs of women, such as low-interest financing, collateral-free loans and money management education. In order to support the success of their businesses, women also require improved access to networks, markets and information.
Making sure women have a say in decision-making is another crucial step. Women have to be represented in government climate policy, neighborhood green initiatives and global sustainability debates.
Data is also crucial. Gender-disaggregated data should be gathered and used by organisations and governments to track progress and inform policy.
In summary, the shift to a green economy presents an opportunity to combat climate change while simultaneously fostering more equitable and inclusive communities.

Humayun doesn't care if you think he is too old to be a hero,"US
Star responds to people trolling him over his age
Men in their fifties need not worry that they are past their prime, because as A-lister Humayun Saeed has proved in his latest film, any older gentleman can play a love guru if he really puts his mind to it. Or at least, he can if he has occupied the shoes of a leading man as long as Humayun has, regardless whatever naysayers may have to say about his age.
""I've been a hero for a very long time, and I've been around for a long time,"" remarked Humayun during a recent appearance on Vasay Chaudhry's show as the pair discussed the former's new release Love Guru, with Chaudhry, incidentally, also serving as screenwriter for the Eidul Azha rom-com.
In his own defence about consistently nabbing the coveted 'hero' role despite the wealth of younger actors in the industry, Humayun also pointed out, ""My movies also have Fahad Mustafa and Hamza Ali Abbasi."" Radiating a relaxed confidence, the star mused that since he has been in showbiz for so long, any criticisms fans (or trolls) have about his age have little to no impact on him.
""Let them target me if they want to!"" declared Humayun with spirit. Keeping his ego in check, however, the star exuded an air of surprise when faced with a compliment on his dancing in the film. ""Did that look like dancing to you?"" he asked wryly.
Humayun may remain unbothered by those who feel he is too old to play a hero, but he did concede that he found it tiring when filming had wrapped up and the time had come to put in the hours to promote Love Guru before the world.
""Promotion is harder than filming. It looks as though I'm enjoying it, but it's a lot of hard work!"" admitted the actor. ""There was so much travelling involved, as well as changing outfits – sometimes two or three times in a day. It takes its toll. Before this film, when I would be promoting anything, I would spend the whole day in one outfit, but when the heroine [costar Mahira Khan] is changing outfits, I have to keep up and change as well!""
Despite the physical toll of dancing and promoting, however, there was a moment of lightness that Humayun said would remain with him: the sense of humour of Love Guru cast member Ahmad Ali Butt.
""Ahmad Butt kept the laughter rolling on set,"" noted Humayun. Lavishing praise on his fellow actor, hinting that this was the reason he continued to work with Ahmad in the first place, the star added, ""Not only does he have talent, he also keeps me entertained!""

"US, China agree on trade 'framework'","US
All eyes were on the outcomes of negotiations as both sides tried to overcome an impasse over export restrictions.
Top officials from the United States and China said Tuesday that they had agreed on a ""framework"" to move forward on trade, following two days of high-level talks in London to resolve tensions.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressed optimism after a full day of negotiations that concerns surrounding rare earth minerals and magnets ""will be resolved"" eventually, as the deal is implemented.
But this framework will first need to be approved by leaders in Washington and Beijing, officials said, at the end of meetings at the British capital's historic Lancaster House.
All eyes were on the outcomes of negotiations as both sides tried to overcome an impasse over export restrictions. US officials earlier accused Beijing of slow-walking approvals for shipments of rare earths.
The world's two biggest economies were also seeking a longer-lasting truce in their escalating tariffs war, with levies currently only temporarily on hold.
""We're moving as quickly as we can,"" US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told reporters.
""We would very much like to find an agreement that makes sense for both countries,"" he added, noting that the relationship was complex.
""We feel positive about engaging with the Chinese,"" he maintained.
Speaking separately to reporters, China International Trade Representative Li Chenggang said: ""Our communication has been very professional, rational, in-depth and candid.""
Li expressed hope that progress made in London would help to boost trust on both sides.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent earlier described the closely-watched trade talks as productive, although scheduling conflicts prompted his departure from London with negotiations still ongoing.
Bessent, who led the US delegation with Lutnick and Greer, left early to return to Washington for testimony before Congress, a US official told AFP.
Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng headed his country's team in London, which included Li and Commerce Minister Wang Wentao.
Both sides do not yet have another gathering scheduled.
But Lutnick said Tuesday that US measures imposed when rare earths ""were not coming"" would likely be relaxed once Beijing moved forward with more license approvals.
Global stock markets were on edge, but Wall Street's major indexes climbed on hopes for progress earlier Tuesday.
The London negotiations follow talks in Geneva last month, which saw a temporary agreement to lower tariffs.
This time, China's exports of rare earth minerals — used in a range of things including smartphones, electric vehicle batteries and green technology — were a key issue on the agenda.

PSX at new peak as budget sparks optimism,"US
Index surges 2,328 points on equity tax status quo, upbeat FY26 outlook
Bulls roared back to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday as investor appetite grew that propelled the KSE-100 index higher by 2,328 points to an all-time high above 124k.
The rally was fuelled by the announcement of federal budget, which maintained status quo on equity taxation and signalled economic recovery. Market players welcomed the avoidance of a major tax burden on capital markets and viewed the increase in withholding tax on bank deposits as a measure that would shift investment to stocks.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti observed that stocks reached a new all-time high, led by across-the-board activity, as investors cheered the status quo on equity taxes and higher withholding taxes on bank deposits in the FY26 budget.
IMF-driven projections of a 3.9% fiscal deficit, low current account deficit, 4.2% GDP growth, Rs86.5 billion in privatisation proceeds and Rs1 trillion federal PSDP drove the bullish momentum, he added.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index displayed a surge of 2,328.24 points, or 1.91%, and settled at 124,352.68.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the stock market welcomed the budget with strong optimism, breaking all resistance levels to cross the 124,000 mark. A new historic intra-day high of 124,588 was reached before the index settled at 124,353, up 2,328 points.
The rally was driven by broad-based participation, reflecting growing investor confidence. He recommended investors to accumulate stocks on dips in fertiliser, cement and banking sectors.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Deputy Head of Trading Ali Najib wrote that the bourse acknowledged the FY26 budget with optimism. Investors viewed the budget as ""neutral to positive"", particularly in light of its alignment with fiscal prudence and IMF reform commitments, he said.
Najib pointed out that investor sentiment turned decidedly bullish as the budget did not incorporate new taxes or levies. The continuation of subsidies for key sectors and enhanced clarity on the government's economic direction further boosted market confidence.
KTrade Securities, in its report, said that the stock exchange responded positively to the budget, which was seen as supportive for capital markets. Key contribution to the index came from cement, oil and gas, banking and fertiliser sectors, with notable gains in Lucky Cement, Fauji Fertiliser, Pakistan Petroleum, Engro Holdings, Mari Petroleum, Pakgen Power and OGDC.
It anticipated continued upward momentum in the current week, driven by investor optimism around the budget and positioning ahead of potential economic tailwinds.
Overall trading volumes increased to 1.04 billion shares compared with Tuesday's tally of 593 million. The value of shares traded was Rs46.7 billion. Shares of 478 companies were traded. Of these, 283 stocks closed higher, 157 fell and 38 remained unchanged.
Pervez Ahmed Consultancy was the volume leader with trading in 78.3 million shares, rising Rs0.49 to close at Rs2. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 55.1 million shares, gaining Rs0.03 to close at Rs1.45 and Sui Southern Gas Company with 45.1 million shares, rising Rs3.74 to close at Rs41.14. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs1.1 billion, the National Clearing Company reported.

Gillespie takes a dig at PCB Chief Naqvi,"DE
He was disappointed by lack of seriousness of the top PCB official
Former Pakistan red-ball head coach Jason Gillespie has once again taken a dig at Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi for absence from a crucial team-building session, known as the ""Connection Camp.""
Speaking on The Howie Games podcast, Gillespie recounted the efforts made by himself and white-ball head coach Gary Kirsten to attend the campinitiated by Kirstenonly to find a noticeable lack of engagement from the top PCB official.
""Gary came up with this great idea of a connection camp. Everyone in Pakistan cricket basically shared their experiences in that meeting. I flew in from Australia, Gary flew in from South Africa, the Chairman Mohsin Naqvi dialed in Zoom,"" said Gillespie.
""He is based in Lahore, but he did not come, while Gary came in from Africa. We both felt that the Chairman could not even drive 20 minutes to come here - that was a bit unusual."" he added.
The Pakistan Cricket Board held the camp on September 23, 2024, with the aim of improving communication, collaboration, and performance among the national team.
The session featured eight senior players, including Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Rizwan, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Saud Shakeel, Shadab Khan, and Shan Masood.
PCB Chief Operating Officer Salman Naseer had described the camp as a timely initiative ahead of a packed cricketing calendar, with its primary objective being the development of a unified vision and mission for the national team.
It is pertinent to mention that the former Australian pacer resigned as the national team's Test coach just days before the South Africa Test series last year.
Bowlers surge in rankings
Pakistan bowlers have made significant gains in the latest ICC T20I rankings, thanks to their impressive performances in recent international fixtures.
In the bowling rankings, Pakistan pacers Haris Rauf and Abbas Afridi have surged forward, both occupying the joint 18th position with 605 rating points.
Left-arm speedster Shaheen Afridi has also moved up, now holding the 35th spot with 552 points.
Pakistan's T20I vice-captain Shadab Khan climbed to 58th place in the rankings, alongside spinner Abrar Ahmed, both earning 476 points.
However, young bowlers Naseem Shah and Sufiyan Muqeem have slipped in the standings, now placed at 92nd and 95th positions with 407 and 406 points, respectively.
New Zealand's Jacob Duffy currently leads the T20I bowling charts, while England's Adil Rashid has claimed the second spot, pushing India's Varun Chakaravarthy down to third.
In the T20I batting rankings, Pakistan's star duo Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan have retained their 12th and 13th positions, respectively. Wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Haris also holds firm at the 30th spot.
However, emerging middle-order batter Hasan Nawaz has slipped to 46th place, while Saim Ayub has dropped to 62nd.
Pakistan T20I captain (name omitted in original text) has fallen two spots to 76th with 430 rating points, and Fakhar Zaman has slipped one place to 87th.
Australia's Travis Head continues to dominate the T20I batting rankings, followed by India's Abhishek Sharma in second. England's Phil Salt has dropped to fourth place, as young Indian batter Tilak Varma rises to third.

"Pak, Afg and UAE to play T20I tri-series","DE
Series is likely to be played in Dubai later this year
The T20I series between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which is scheduled to be played in the United Arab Emirates, is now set to be turned into a trilateral series with the hosts making the third team.
The Afghan side are scheduled to tour Pakistan in late summer for a bilateral T20I series in the current future tours programme cycle.
However, with the prospect of this year's T20 Asia Cup in the UAE, an arrangement is being worked to move the series there and include the hosts as the third team, sources close to the matter stated.
India are the hosts for this year's edition of the Asia Cup, but the tournament will be staged at a neutral venue after Pakistan and India agreed to host each other at neutral venues in multi-team tournaments because of geopolitical tensions. The month of September is locked as a tentative window for the tournament.
Both, Pakistan and Afghanistan, haven't played each other on Pakistani soil. Though, Afghanistan played in Pakistan for the ICC Champion Trophy
Pakistan and Afghanistan have never played each other on Pakistani soil. Ahead of the last iteration of the Asia Cup, which was played in the ODI format and was held across Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Afghanistan hosted Pakistan in Hambantota and Colombo for acclimatisation purposes ahead of the tournament in 2023.
The last bilateral T20I series between the two teams was also played in the UAE in March 2023 and saw Afghanistan beat Pakistan across formats for the first time and also record their first series win. In what remains their last meeting, Afghanistan secured their maiden ODI win over Pakistan during the 50-over World Cup in 2023.
Pakistan and UAE have never played each other outside a multi-team tournament. They first played each other in a six-team Austral-Asia Cup in 1994 and then came face to face in the 1996 and 2015 50-over World Cups. Their last meeting came in the 2016 Asia Cup in Bangladesh.

PM expresses satisfaction over surge in remittances during May
A delegation of Pakistan Muslim League-Q on Wednesday called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and expressed full support for all the initiatives taken by him for the country's economic development and public welfare.
The delegation comprising Members of the National Assembly Chaudhry Hussain Elahi, Muhammad Ilyas Chaudhry and Ms Farukh Khan and led by Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain called on the prime minister, PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The MNAs praised the prime minister and his team for presenting the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026 in the National Assembly.
The delegation said that both the military and political leadership were working tirelessly for the national development and the welfare of the people.
They also lauded the prime minister's exemplary leadership during the recent tensions with India and his efforts to elevate the country's prestige at the global stage. Matters related to the respective constituencies were also discussed during the meeting.
Remittances
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday expressed satisfaction over increase in remittances during May 2025 which was 13.7 per cent more than the previous fiscal year.
In a statement here, the prime minister said the country had received some US$ 34.9 billion in remittances during the current fiscal year, which was 28.8 per cent higher than the outgoing financial year.
""US$ 3.7 billion was received in remittances during May 2025, which is 13.7% more than May last year. The increase in remittances is evidence of the growing confidence of overseas Pakistanis in the economic policies of the government,"" PM Shehbaz said.
He added that the government's economic measures and people-friendly budget for the next fiscal year were a harbinger of a bright future for the country.
The prime minister paid tribute to the government's economic team.
PSX
The PM hailing the record surge in the stock market to 124,000 points, said that the bullish trend reflected the confidence of investors and businessmen in the pro-people budget presented by the government on Tuesday.
The prime minister, in a statement, said that in the federal budget 2025-26, the government put no additional tax burden on the common man, and that the pay raise and tax reductions would provide relief to the salaried class.
""The journey to national economic progress has begun. The people of Pakistan made immense sacrifices. Now, we all must work together to improve the common man's life,"" he remarked. He also appreciated the government's economic team whose efforts led to the reduction in inflation and increase in foreign exchange reserves.
""Pakistan's return from the brink of default, the beginning of economic stability, and the journey toward progress is a miracle. This historic economic turnaround, achieved through the hard work of the economic team and prioritizing Pakistan's interests, will be etched in history forever,"" he commented.

Remittances cross $34.9b for FY2025,"PK
Average monthly inflows rise by 10.7% from FY24 – easing deficit; South Africa, Ireland, Malaysia lead new growth
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reported a robust increase in workers' remittances for May 2025, providing crucial support to the external sector amid a widening trade imbalance caused by rising imports and declining exports.
According to the latest data, total remittance inflows reached $3.7 billion in May, up around 14% year-on-year. This upward trajectory has been a consistent feature throughout the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25, offering some relief to Pakistan's external account pressures.
""Workers' remittances reflect robust growth of 16% month-on-month and 13.7% year-on-year, signalling sustained confidence of overseas Pakistanis in formal banking channels,"" said Ali Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Limited (AHL).
Cumulative inflows from July to May FY2025 stood at $34.9 billion, marking a strong 28.8% increase from the same period last year, he said. This rise is likely due to improved documentation, regulatory support, and seasonal Eid-related transfers.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US) remained the top contributors, with the rising trend offering vital support to foreign exchange reserves.
Saudi Arabia led with $913.9 million, followed by the UAE at $754.2 million and the UK at $588.1 million. The UAE showed the strongest growth, with a 45.7% increase during July-May, and Dubai alone sending $567.2 million in May. European Union (EU) countries posted a 28.1% rise, with Italy contributing $118.2 million.
Significant year-on-year growth was seen from non-traditional markets such as South Africa (74%), Ireland (53.1%), and Malaysia (40.4%). This reflects the Pakistani population's struggle for gradual diversification as traditional markets become more saturated.
Monthly figures showed a peak in March 2025 at $4.05 billion, with steady inflows continuing through May. The fiscal year's average monthly remittance stood at $2.52 billion, up 10.7% from FY24.
Experts attribute the surge to favourable economic conditions in host countries, a stable exchange rate, and Pakistan's push to formalise channels through digital platforms like Roshan Digital Account and SBP EasyData. These reforms have improved transparency and accessibility, making formal remittance channels more attractive for overseas Pakistanis.
Despite gains, concerns remain about the sustainability and inclusivity of this growth. Heavy reliance on traditional markets - accounting for 61% of inflows — exposes Pakistan to risks from labour policy changes or economic slowdowns in those regions.
Remittances from the US declined 12.4% year-on-year in May 2025, possibly due to regulatory tightening or demographic shifts in the diaspora.
High transfer costs between 5% and 7% — continue to drive users toward informal channels like hawala. Persistent exchange rate gaps between official and parallel markets also reduce incentives to use formal systems.
Data issues complicate accurate analysis. There is limited reporting on remittance purposes, and foreign currency account flows are included in headline figures.
Structural challenges persist as well. Most Pakistani workers abroad are in low-skilled jobs, especially in Gulf countries, making inflows vulnerable to wage stagnation and automation in labour-importing countries such as Saudi Arabia under its Vision 2030 reforms. Moreover, Pakistan's policies have yet to fully engage the diaspora in high-value activities beyond basic remittances, such as investments in bonds or startups.
Seasonal fluctuations also affect stability. The 16% month-on-month jump in May 2025, partly due to Eid, highlights the volatility of these flows. This contrasts from April-May patterns in previous years, underlining their unpredictability.
To improve resilience, experts recommend diversifying labour destinations, cutting transfer costs through fintech collaboration, publishing detailed remittance data, and upskilling workers to meet demand in advanced economies.
Such measures are critical to ensuring that remittances continue to serve as a resilient and growth-supporting element of Pakistan's economy, which remains reliant on these inflows for covering 8-10% of its GDP.

KE consumers to get Rs4.69/unit relief in April,"NL
Nepra to decide on FCA petition on June 19 as KE seeks adjustment of Rs16b
K-Electric (KE) consumers are set to receive a relief of Rs4.69 per unit under the fuel cost adjustment (FCA) for April 2025.
This will translate into a total benefit of Rs7.13 billion for KE consumers, driven by a reduction in fuel prices used for power generation during the month. The relief will be granted as a provisional monthly FCA.
Initially, KE had requested a provisional FCA of negative Rs4.55/kWh for April 2025. Later, it revised the claim to negative Rs4.69/kWh, calculated based on the interim reference tariff of March 2023.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) will conduct a public hearing on June 19 to decide on KE's petition to reduce the power tariff.
According to Note-2 of Annex-A (calculation sheet), KE submitted that following the determination of generation tariffs for its power plants for the post-June 2023 period, it had provided the required data on partial load, open cycle, degradation curves, and startup costs for approval. An amount of Rs16 billion, covering the period from July 2023 to April 2025, is still pending adjustment. In addition, heat rate adjustments related to the previous Multi-Year Tariff (MYT) for BQPS-III and KCCP plants — amounting to Rs0.6 billion and Rs0.2 billion respectively — are also pending.
Of the total Rs16 billion, Rs15.2 billion has already been set aside by Nepra in KE's FCA decisions for November 2024 to March 2025.
KE has requested the Authority to also consider these pending adjustments of actual fuel costs, so recovery may be made from the negative fuel cost variations of March and April 2025. The aim is to ensure consumers are not burdened in future billing cycles.
During the hearing, Nepra will deliberate on whether the requested FCA is justified and whether KE has followed the merit order while dispatching power from its own plants and while purchasing from external sources.

Diddy defence questions ex,"US
Lawyers argue former partner had 'agency'
Sean Combs's defence lawyers on Tuesday began questioning a woman who dated the music mogul up until his arrest, and who has testified in agonising detail that he pressured her into drug-fuelled sex with escorts, as reported by AFP.
In the initial hours of questioning, defence attorney Teny Geragos sought to demonstrate that the woman speaking under the pseudonym Jane had agency throughout her relationship with Combs — an attempt to show that what prosecutors deem to be sex trafficking was in fact consensual.
The defence exhibited loving messages and voice notes the pair shared, and also asked Jane about her ""jealousy"" regarding Combs's ""polyamorous"" lifestyle that involved other girlfriends.
Geragos elicited testimony from Jane in which she said she gravitated to men who were ""successful.""
The witness, who told jurors she still loves Combs, also testified that at points she felt ""very loved"" by him, and that he was her ""baby.""
Attorney Geragos spent much of the afternoon prompting Jane to read lengthy, lewd texts aloud.
During the uncomfortable, painstaking process Jane repeatedly emphasised there was an ""undertone"" to the messages in which she felt compelled to write what Combs wanted to hear.
Jane was largely calm and confident throughout defence questioning, but one particularly tense exchange saw her patience wane.
Pressing her over jealousy related to the gifts Combs gave other women, Geragos asked her if he ever gave her a Chanel bag.
""No, I only got trauma,"" Jane responded.
""What is a Bottega bag?"" Geragos then asked, referring to another luxury accessory that Jane had previously said she received from Combs.
""I'm sure you have one,"" Jane quipped, before the lawyer asked her how much a Bottega bag costs.
Jane clapped back: ""How much does my body cost?""
Violent outburst
Jane previously told jurors how the final year of her relationship with the artist known as ""Diddy"" exploded into violence in June 2024.
At the time Combs was already under investigation by federal authorities, and the now-infamous security footage of him assaulting his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura in a hotel was public.
Jane, who began seeing Combs in early 2021, detailed how she had longed for a more traditional romantic relationship with him.
But she said 90 per cent of their time together resulted in sometimes days-long sex parties that saw Combs direct her to have sex with male escorts while he watched, even as she told him the encounters made her feel ""sleazy"" and ""disgusted.""
Jane told jurors Combs paid for her rent at the time and still does, and he covers her legal expenses.
She previously testified at length that she felt ""obligated"" to participate in the so-called ""hotel nights"" for ""fear of losing the roof over my head"" that Combs was bankrolling.
A June 2024 date-turned-argument escalated when Jane said she pushed Combs's head onto a marble countertop in her home and began hurling candles – acts of ""built-up"" anger, she testified.
Combs was livid: Jane said he kicked down doors and ultimately put her in a chokehold.
She ran out, but upon return Combs kicked and punched her until she had a black eye and ""golf ball"" sized welts, she said.
Combs instructed her to ice the injuries and prepare for a hotel night with an escort.
""You're not going to ruin my night,"" she said Combs told her. When she said she didn't want to participate, he stood close to her face as he asked in a ""forceful"" tone: ""Then is this coercion?""
Jane ultimately complied: ""I just felt like I wasn't even in my own body,"" she said.
'Sexual trauma'
When Ventura – who last month testified of physical and psychological abuse in similarly excruciating detail – filed her 2023 civil lawsuit that opened the door for a federal investigation, Jane said she ""almost fainted.""
""There was a whole other woman feeling the same thing,"" Jane said.
""I feel like I'm reading my own sexual trauma. It makes me sick how three solid pages, word for word, is exactly my experiences and my anguish,"" she messaged Combs, in text records read in court.
The 55-year-old faces life in prison if convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.
Jane's story was not in the original indictment against Combs, but she was added after receiving a subpoena requiring she testify in November 2024 before a grand jury.
Jane has not filed any civil suit against Combs, and testified she has no plans to do so. She is expected to stay on the stand through Thursday.
Now in its fifth week of testimony, the Manhattan federal trial is anticipated to continue at least through June.

US says Trump keen to resolve Kashmir issue,"PK
State Dept reaffirms US willingness to engage on dispute amid Islamabad's diplomatic outreach
Pakistan's recent diplomatic outreach in Washington appears to be making headway, as the US Department of State on Wednesday reaffirmed President Donald Trump's stated willingness to engage on the Kashmir dispute.
During a White House press briefing, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce responded to a query regarding Trump's potential course of action following his earlier offer to mediate on Kashmir.
""So, while I can't speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can't speak to any details of what he might have in that regard,"" she said, noting that further comment would come from the White House.
Bruce stressed the president's track record of initiating unexpected diplomatic dialogues, expressing optimism that progress on Kashmir was not beyond reach. ""[Trump] has been the only one to bring certain people to the table to have conversations that nobody thought was possible,"" she said.
""It shouldn't surprise anyone that he'd want to manage something like that,"" she added.
The remarks coincided with a recent high-level Pakistani delegation visit to Washington, led by Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Responding to a related question, Bruce confirmed that the delegation met with senior State Department officials, including Under Secretary for Political Affairs Allison Hooker.
According to Bruce, the discussions centred on bilateral ties, with emphasis on counterterrorism cooperation. ""We also know that Deputy Secretary Landau met with the Indian parliamentary delegation last week, and he also reaffirmed the United States strong support of India in the fight against terrorism,"" she noted.
Pakistan has launched a comprehensive diplomatic campaign in the United States to present its viewpoint on the recent escalation with India and to counter New Delhi's expanding lobbying footprint in Washington. The campaign includes outreach to US lawmakers, think tanks, and the media.
Foreign Minister Bilawal, who led a nine-member team, visited New York and Washington from May 31 to June 6 before heading to London and Brussels. During the US leg of the trip, he held meetings with over a dozen members of Congress, including both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
He also engaged with senior officials at the State Department, where he outlined Islamabad's concerns over India's aggressive posture, threats to the Indus Waters Treaty and incendiary rhetoric from the Modi-led government.
Meanwhile, President Trump, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office last week, doubled down on his claim of playing a key role in easing tensions between India and Pakistan during earlier flare-ups. ""They don't give me credit for anything, but nobody else could have stopped it,"" he said.

Eight killed in migrant boat attack off Djibouti,"PL
Last year, the IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the route, with 462 resulting from shipwrecks.
At least eight people died and 22 were missing after smugglers attacked a migrant boat and forced them to disembark, the UN's migration agency said on Wednesday.
The boat was carrying around 150 passengers when it was stopped by smugglers last Thursday, forcing them to disembark ""far from the coast"". ""The passengers were left to swim for their lives in open water,"" the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a statement.
It was not clear why the smugglers forced the group to disembark. Each year, thousands of African migrants brave the ""Eastern Route"" across the Red Sea from Djibouti to Yemen in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries.
Last year, the IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the route, with 462 resulting from shipwrecks.

Bench slams misuse of case property amid missing car claims
A three-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, comprising Justice Musarrat Hilali, Justice Shakeel Ahmed, and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, has directed the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Police to submit a complete record of all vehicles held in their warehouses as case property.
During the hearing, Justice Musarrat Hilali questioned how police officers were using these case vehicles, remarking, ""Why are only low-ranking officers held accountable? Why don't you take action against senior officials? Until high-ranking officers are held responsible, these issues will not be resolved.""
Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim added, ""This situation will not improve until at least one officer is removed from service.""
Justice Shakeel Ahmed also expressed dismay, saying, ""If not for yourselves, then have mercy on this country. How long will such illegal practices continue?""
The court instructed the K-P Advocate General to present the full list of vehicles currently stored by the police, including details on which vehicles are linked to which cases, and under what legal provision police officials are authorized to use them. The report is to be submitted by Thursday.
These observations were made during the hearing of a petition filed by a local Imran Khan, seeking the return of a vehiclea 2010 Toyota GLibelonging to him.
His counsel, Anjum Durrani, informed the court that the vehicle has been in the custody of Chamkani Police since 2020 and is now allegedly being used by a retired police officer.

Protesters carried banners and chanted slogans in support of the detained leaders, demanding immediate release of Imran Khan and other party leaders and workers.
PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh said that the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law have been dismantled. ""Form-47 governments, imposed through rigged elections, have pushed the country to the brink,"" he claimed. ""Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi have been jailed in false cases, and the doors of justice have been shut. Judges go on leave when it is time to deliver justice. Today again, the judge scheduled to hear the Al-Qadir Trust case went on leave,"" he said, alleging a conspiracy to deny Khan justice.

Govt hints at Rs500b mini-budget,"US
FinMin wants economic curbs on ineligible persons; Says ban on transactions a must to avoid more taxes
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday cautioned that the government may be compelled to impose up to Rs500 billion worth more new taxes if the National Assembly did not allow it to ban economic transactions by ineligible persons.
The minister also made a paradoxical comment where he defended the decision to keep the minimum monthly wage unchanged at Rs37,000 but advocated an annual increase in salaries of the parliamentarians to adjust for the impact of inflation.
The warning about a mini-budget before the approval of the new budget came just a day after the finance minister proposed roughly Rs432 billion worth of new taxes, which targeted the digital economy, solar panels, middlemen's cars and fuel, including that used in agriculture.
He made the remarks during a post-budget press conference where he expanded upon the federal budget proposed for the new fiscal year.
If the law to ban economic transactions is not passed and the enforcement measures are not implemented, we will have to impose Rs400 billion to Rs500 billion worth of new taxes, repeated by the finance minister twice to register his point.
""We have two ways — either we ensure enforcement or we introduce additional measures of up to Rs400 billion to Rs500 billion. This is why we will go to the parliament to help us out with the enabling amendments and legislation"", he added.
He said that the International Monetary Fund has accepted the government's point of view that it can get Rs389 billion additional in the next fiscal year through enforcement measures, which is not possible without new legislation.
Transactions to be banned
In the budget, the government has proposed restrictions on economic transactions by ineligible persons lacking sufficient financial resources. These restrictions include: a ban on booking, purchasing, or registering motor vehicles; a ban on registering, recording, or attesting the transfer of immovable property; a ban on selling securities — including debt securities or mutual fund units — to ineligible persons; and a ban on opening or maintaining current, savings, or investor portfolio securities accounts.
Only individuals holding 130% of the value in cash and equivalent assets — comprising local or foreign currency, fair market value of gold, net realisable value of stocks, bonds, receivables, or any other cash-equivalent asset — will be eligible to buy such assets.
Rs37,000 minimum wage appropriate
In a surprising statement, the finance minister defended the decision to freeze the minimum wage at Rs37,000 per month — or Rs1,423 per day, excluding holidays.
""Go to the industries and get their feedback on the minimum wage. I think we are in a good place,"" said Aurangzeb.
However, he also defended the substantial hike in salaries of the Senate chairman and deputy chairman, and the National Assembly speaker and deputy speaker, raised sixfold to Rs1.3 million per month.
He said their salaries were being adjusted after nine years. Like the annual increment in government employee salaries, parliamentarians' pay should also increase, he recommended.
Media protests for its rights
At the outset of the press conference, reporters voiced concerns over not receiving a technical briefing from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on the Finance Bill 2025 on Tuesday. They walked out in protest and returned only after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial acknowledged that such a briefing should have been given as per tradition.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb later acknowledged the ""worry"" caused to reporters and said he ""regretted if there was anything of the sort"".
Cash on delivery disparity
The government's move to charge 2% tax on online shopping up to Rs20,000 — while charging only 0.25% for purchases exceeding that amount — is likely to further encourage cash-on-delivery for high-value transactions.
Dr Najeeb, FBR Member Policy, explained that while the value of goods in such transactions is high, the profit margins are low, hence the proposed lower tax rate of 0.25%.
Under the proposed rates, tax on a Rs20,000 transaction will amount to Rs400, but for Rs21,000 it will drop to Rs52.
Dr Najeeb noted that grocery items have lower margins but are taxed at higher rates than electrical goods. ""We did not follow previous policies where everyone suffered under the same category,"" he added.
Pakistan's East Asia moment
Finance Minister Aurangzeb asserted that reducing import duties would move Pakistan toward an export-led economy. He emphasised the significance of tariff reforms under the National Tariff Policy.
""People ask us if revenue will decline. But if we are to take this country forward toward an export-led model, this is the discussion we must have,"" he said.
The minister noted that additional customs duties were eliminated from four tariff lines and reduced for 2,700 more, all linked to raw materials intended to benefit exporters.
""This is an East Asia moment for Pakistan. Whatever was available in the fiscal space reflects the direction of travel. We've tried to reduce tariffs. This is not the eventual end state,"" he remarked.
On the increased tax rate for the sale of plots, Aurangzeb said the selling side still receives capital gains, but the buying side should receive some relief.
Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal stated that there was no more fiscal space to reduce expenditure, and savings from downsizing the government were limited to the abolishment of vacant positions.
Responding to a question about delinking population statistics from the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Aurangzeb insisted, ""Everything will be done in consultation with provinces.""
Earlier this week, the finance minister had said that the population should be delinked from the NFC formula to address 2.6% annual population growth.
""Nothing will be done without the provinces, including the national fiscal pact,"" he added.
To a question about the impact of reducing the income tax surcharge by 1%, which still leaves it at 9%, on brain drain, Aurangzeb said the government had set a rare direction, one indicating that ""anything going up is, within a year, going down"".
""The things that had never been reversed before have now been put into reversal - but that's not the eventual end state,"" he said.
He clarified that the government is trying to send a message to sectors facing undue burden, particularly the formal sector, that it is ""serious"". ""This is just signalling, from my perspective, in the right direction,"" he said.
When asked about the rationale for imposing an 18% sales tax on imported solar panels, FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial explained that panels were being imported either fully or partially assembled.
Those adding value locally were already taxed at 18%, while fully assembled imports were not, putting local assemblers at a disadvantage.
""We also closed the door for future local assembly, so this was not an option. We have to create a level playing field,"" Langrial said, asserting that incentives were no longer needed, given the falling cost of technology.
He estimated that the 18% tax on solar panel imports would increase the payback period by only two months, from 18 to 20 months.
Eurobond repayments
On bond repayments, the finance minister said the first instalment of $500 million worth of Eurobonds is due in September, followed by the next in March. ""We are prepared and willing to pay,"" he said.
""With the international credit rating improving, we want to access the euro and US dollar markets, which is expected in 2026, but certainly not this calendar year,"" Aurangzeb added.

Man gets life in jail for murder,"US
Faizan fatally stabbed Raza Khan multiple times, resulting in his death
An Additional Sessions Judge in Abbottabad has sentenced the main accused in a high-profile murder case to life imprisonment, following the fatal stabbing of a local resident in the Jhangi area.
The verdict came after extensive legal arguments, with the prosecution led by prominent Supreme Court lawyer Advocate Atif Ali Jadoon.
According to case details, the incident occurred on September 13, 2022, when the accused, Faizan, along with his brothers Nauman and Arsalan, attacked Raza Khan as he was returning home. During the altercation, Faizan fatally stabbed Raza Khan multiple times, resulting in his death at the scene due to excessive bleeding.
In the same attack, Raza Khan's sister and his nephew, Abu Bakar, were also injured after being assaulted with a knife. Both victims were rushed to a hospital and survived after receiving timely medical treatment.
In a bid to mislead law enforcement, Faizan reportedly inflicted injuries upon himself and attempted to file a counter-FIR.

Impunity prevails,"US
The sheer scale of this failure is distressing.
A fundamental promise of any just society is the protection of its most vulnerable citizens. For women and children, who too often bear the brunt of violence, abuse and harassment, this promise is paramount. Yet, recent alarming figures from Punjab, the biggest province of the country, reveal that the rampant culture of impunity is undermining efforts to safeguard these precious lives.
Out of over 60,000 cases registered in the province in the current year concerning crimes against women and children, a mere 924 suspects have faced punishment, while a staggering 2,388 have walked free. This dramatic disparity, where the acquittals more than double the convictions, casts a long shadow over the efficacy of our justice system.
The sheer scale of this failure is distressing. To register tens of thousands of complaints, only to see a minuscule fraction result in accountability, reflects a systemic breakdown. The data starkly indicates that the primary culprit behind this crisis of impunity is often the very institution tasked with upholding the law — the police.
Official reports frequently attribute the pathetically low conviction rates to ""gross negligence"" on the part of law enforcement. This includes faulty investigations and a critical lack of evidence. The human cost of this negligence is immeasurable. For survivors of horrific crimes, particularly rape victims, the journey to justice is already fraught with immense emotional and psychological turmoil.
To then witness their alleged tormentors escape punishment due to procedural failings is nothing short of re-traumatisation. It shatters their faith in the legal system and forces them to relive their trauma without the closure or vindication that justice might offer.
Addressing this crisis demands an immediate and comprehensive overhaul of investigative and prosecutorial practices. A special committee should be set up to expedite and review cases, and mete out strict punishment as a necessary deterrent.

Court slams police over investigation in Malir jailbreak case,"US
Moreover, no jail record with verified signatures from jail authorities was brought forth
An anti-terrorism administrative court has issued a written order regarding the remand of 115 accused in the Malir jailbreak case, strongly criticizing the performance of jail authorities and the investigating officer.
In its detailed ruling, the court termed the escape of inmates a result of gross negligence and weakness on the part of the Malir Jail administration. It further declared the investigation conducted so far to be inadequate and unsatisfactory.
According to the written order, the investigating officer mentioned 118 accused in the case files, yet only 115 were produced in court, without providing any explanation for the discrepancy. The court noted that no legal basis or solid evidence was presented to justify the remand of the suspects.
The court also pointed out that no recoveries, evidence, witness statements, case diary, or medical reports of injured police personnel were submitted. Moreover, no jail record with verified signatures from jail authorities was brought forth regarding the custody of the accused. Interestingly, the investigating officer claimed that the inmates did not break out of jail, but rather escaped after a roof collapsed during an earthquake.

Auto sector divided on new budget,"SA
Some air concern over impact on local manufacturing; others dub new policies balanced
Auto sector experts and consultants expressed serious reservations about the finance minister's budget speech and called for reviewing the federal budget before seeking approval from the National Assembly (NA).
Talking to The Express Tribune, Auto Sector Expert Mashood Khan said the finance minister's budget speech closely mirrors the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) recommendations. The downward trend in additional customs duty, regulatory duty and customs duty will likely hit local manufacturing instead of exports in the future. Severe consequences for the local manufacturing industry may be predicted and witnessed. Without a thriving domestic industry, the import bill will surge, and foreign reserves will take a hit. The auto parts and other manufacturing sectors will face major challenges. It is unclear how exports will increase without a robust local industry.
""I urge the federal finance minister to revisit the budget before seeking approval from the National Assembly. Without a supportive industrialisation policy, local manufacturing will struggle, and exports will suffer,"" he said.
Moreover, Economic Strategist and Regional Expert Dr Mehmoodul Hassan Khan said the pledges for the creation of effective incentives and essential tax exemptions for the adoption and use of electric vehicles (EVs), contributing to the national goal of 30% penetration for new passenger EV sales and 50% for two- and three-wheelers by 2030, represent a paradigm shift towards a massive green transformation.
Additionally, reducing taxes on five-year-old vehicles is a step in the right direction, making imports more affordable, which would provide some much-needed financial relief to common consumers in the country.
The introduction of a holistic and comprehensive reform package, mainly gradually phasing out additional customs duty on vehicles and reducing regulatory duties, will also be beneficial for the local auto industry, creating a strategic balance between local and imported automobiles.
The government's recommendation that no new regulatory duties be imposed on the auto sector and its proposal for an annual 10% reduction in tariffs on used vehicles is a constructive step having multiplier effects.
The easy and smooth mechanism of issuance of licenses to 57 EV manufacturers for the production of two- and three-wheeler electric vehicles vividly reflects the strategic priority of the government in reducing carbon footprints and inching towards carbon neutrality.
Meanwhile, contrary to the above-cited views, another leading automobile consultant and expert, Shafiq Ahmed Shaikh, said: ""In my opinion, the federal budget is good and balanced. With reference to the auto sector, the recommended National Tariff Programme with the plan is good for Pakistan and a requirement of today. As I foresee, by gradually lowering import duties, in the future it will not only stabilise the local and international markets but also have to be competitive with the global industry.""
He said under the proposed tariff, the duties would come down to 15% from the current 20% over five years, whereas additional customs duty and regulatory duty will also be phased out. The government also plans to eliminate the Fifth Schedule and lower the maximum slab rate to 15%. This is a good overhauling of the trade regime and will definitely foster export-led growth. This was also the requirement of the IMF, which seeks to bring Pakistan's tariff structures in line with global norms. Now, through revolutionary changes, not only will policy stabilisation come, but easy access to international supply chains will also be opened.
""At present, this sector contributes around 4% of total tax revenue. I foresee that by taking the tariff rationalisation route, more revenue will be generated,"" he said.

Poverty spike,"US
The 44.7% figure relies on outdated survey data from 2018-19
The World Bank's recalibration of global poverty lines has cast a harsh spotlight on Pakistan, estimating that 44.7% of the population, or over 107 million people, live below the lower-middle-income threshold of $4.20/day. Extreme poverty has surged to 16.5% under the revised $3/day line. While blind nationalists may deflect by blaming the worsening statistic on updated benchmarks and revised global calculations, the truth is that the numbers are actually an understatement.
The 44.7% figure relies on outdated survey data from 2018-19, before the catastrophic impact of events such as the Covid-19 pandemic, record inflation and economic disarray for the past few years and the 2022 super-floods that submerged a third of the country and displaced millions.
You need not be an economist to recognise that, in light of these events, the actual current poverty rate based on the World Bank's metrics is much higher. And even this outdated data tells a story that is relevant today. The restive province of Balochistan, for example, had a poverty rate of almost 70%.
Pakistan has also been one of the world's worst performers in combating poverty. India managed to shrink its extreme poverty rate from over 16% in 2012-2013 to under 6% in 2022-2023, despite the increase in the nominal dollar value.
Pakistan, on the other hand, saw at least 27 million more people falling under the poverty line. The first step to addressing the problem is getting more reliable data, so that the picture, no matter how brutal, is more accurate. The next step is transformative action, rather than theatrics and name-calling to divert blame for a national failure onto any one party.
One of the best ways to address extreme poverty is by strengthening social services, including through cash transfers via BISP, and bolstering human capital via investment in health, nutrition and education. Tax policy reforms are also critical because a social safety net is pointless if it is financed through indirect taxes that squeeze the working poor, rather than the millionaires and billionaires who don't pay their fair share.

"60 Gazans dead in Israeli gunfire, airstrikes","GB
Many casualties reported near aid site, medics say
Israeli gunfire and airstrikes killed at least 60 Palestinians in Gaza on Wednesday, most of them near an aid site operated by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in the centre of the enclave, local health officials said.
Medical officials at Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals said at least 25 people were killed and dozens wounded as they approached a food distribution centre near the former Jewish settlement of Netzarim before dawn.
Israel's military, which has been at war with Hamas since October 2023, said its forces fired warning shots overnight towards a group of suspects as they posed a threat to troops in the area of the Netzarim Corridor.
""This is despite warnings that the area is an active combat zone. The IDF is aware of reports regarding individuals injured; the details are under review,"" it said.
Later on Wednesday, health officials at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip said at least 14 people had been killed by Israeli gunfire as they approached another GHF site in Rafah.
The foundation said it was unaware of Wednesday's incidents but added that it was working closely with Israeli authorities to ensure safe passage routes are maintained, and that it was essential for Palestinians to closely follow instructions.
""Ultimately, the solution is more aid, which will create more certainty and less urgency among the population,"" it said by email in response to Reuters questions. ""There is not yet enough food to feed everyone in need in Gaza. Our current focus is to feed as many people as is safely possible within the constraints of a highly volatile environment.""
In a statement, GHF said it distributed 2.5 million meals on Wednesday, the largest single-day delivery since it began operations, bringing to more than 16 million the number of meals provided since its operations started in late May.
Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says that since then, 163 Palestinians had been killed and over 1,000 wounded trying to obtain the food boxes.

Taliban hang up Kalashnikovs to pen memoirs of Afghan war,"DE
Little attention is paid in either book to the thousands of civilians killed in Taliban attacks
Since trading the battlefield for Afghanistan's halls of power, some Taliban members have also swapped their weapons for pens to tell their version of the 20-year conflict with Western forces, who they accuse of distorting ""reality"".
A flood of books has been written, mostly from a Western perspective, about the war between the US-led forces that invaded Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11 attacks until the Taliban's return to power in 2021.
But in the years since, a proliferation of writings by Taliban figures — praising their exploits and the achievements of the ""Islamic Emirate"" — is now the reigning narrative in Afghanistan.
""No matter what foreigners have written... they have largely ignored the reality of what happened to us and why we were forced to fight,"" author Khalid Zadran told AFP.
A member of the Haqqani network — long viewed as one of the most dangerous militant factions in Afghanistan — he now serves as the spokesman for the capital's police force.
In his 600-page tome in Pashto published in April, he recounts US incursions in his home province of Khost, his childhood steeped in stories of soldiers' ""atrocities"", and his desire to join the Taliban in the name of his country's ""freedom"".
""I witnessed horrific stories every day — mangled bodies on the roadside,"" he writes in ""15 Minutes"", a title inspired by a US drone strike he narrowly escaped.
Muhajer Farahi, now a deputy information and culture minister, penned his ""Memories of Jihad: 20 Years in Occupation"" to ""state the facts"", he said.
""America, contrary to its claims, has committed cruel and barbaric acts, destroyed our country with bombs, destroyed infrastructure, and has sown discord and cynicism between nations and tribes,"" he told AFP from his office in central Kabul.
Little attention is paid in either book to the thousands of civilians killed in Taliban attacks — many of them suicide bombings that entrenched fear across the country for nearly two decades. Farahi insists the Taliban ""were cautious in saving civilians and innocent"" lives, while criticising fellow Afghans who collaborated with the pro-Western police as a ""stain"" on the country.

K-P to unveil Rs2tr tax-free budget,"US
Surplus planned as spending to focus on development, education emergency
The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government is set to present a Rs2,000 billion budget tomorrow, with over Rs1,800 billion allocated for current expenditures. The budget will show a surplus of Rs180 billion and will not introduce any new taxes. However, the scope and rate of existing taxes will be expanded.
A total of Rs433 billion has been earmarked for development projects, including funds for the development of the newly merged tribal districts. The government will also announce the imposition of an ""education emergency"" in the new fiscal year. Under this initiative, furniture will be provided to 100 per cent of public schools.
To boost its own revenues, the province has set a 40 per cent higher target for provincial tax collection compared to the current fiscal year. The new budget includes the establishment of four additional cardiac centers in addition to the existing ones, as well as special funds for the merged districts.
Measures to support the province's vulnerable, marginalized, and low-income populations are also part of the budget. Funding has been allocated for key infrastructure and welfare projects including the Peshawar-DI Khan Motorway, a new electricity transmission line, the establishment of an insurance company, and the Chashma Right Bank Canal.
Safe City projects in Peshawar, Bannu, and DI Khan will receive financial support, and the education budget is being increased by 13 per cent. The monthly honorarium for artists will also be raised from Rs100,000 to Rs150,000.
A significant portion of the development budget will focus on completing ongoing projects. Priority will be given to projects that are 80 per cent or more complete, followed by those with 60 per cent completion. The number of new development projects has been capped at 500, with Rs195 billion to be immediately released, and up to Rs250 billion allocated as needed.
For the first time, a special committee will be formed to approve projects based on priority and necessity. The budget will continue to prioritize the education, health, and social welfare sectors. Additionally, the 13-year throw-forward period for the Annual Development Program (ADP) will be reduced to seven years. A safari park is also planned for Misri Banda in Nowshera as part of the new fiscal year's initiatives.
The federal government is set to allocate a total of Rs1,342.78 billion to K-P from the divisible pool for the upcoming fiscal year 2025-26, which will raise the province's overall budget to approximately Rs2,000 billion.
For the ongoing fiscal year 2024-25, the federal government was expected to provide Rs1,221.53 billion. However, according to revised estimates, the actual amount transferred to the province stood at Rs1,135.66 billion by the end of the fiscal year.
In the upcoming fiscal year, the merged tribal districts will receive a Rs40 billion subsidy in the energy sector. This is a reduction from Rs65 billion allocated during the current fiscal year. Additionally, the federal government will provide Rs80 billion in special grants to these merged districts — an increase from Rs66 billion allocated in the current year.
Under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), the merged tribal areas will be allocated Rs65.44 billion, compared to Rs70 billion in the current fiscal year.

BTS megastars to reunite after military service,"RO
Fans await K-pop band's anticipated return
Two members of K-pop supergroup BTS were released from South Korea's mandatory military service on Tuesday and announced they wanted to start performing again ""as soon as possible"", prompting a fan frenzy, as reported by AFP.
BTS, South Korea's most lucrative musical act, has been on a hiatus since 2022 while its seven members complete their military service.
Hundreds of fans gathered at a site near the two army bases where band leader RM – recently named ""Favorite K-pop Artist"" at the American Music Awards – and singer V were separately discharged.
Cheers broke out as they stepped out of different vehicles and hugged, with RM playing a quick song on the saxophone as V stood next to him smiling, holding bunches of flowers.
""What we want most right now is to perform again,"" RM, still wearing his army uniform, told reporters and fans after his discharge.
""We're working hard on the new album so we can return to the stage as soon as possible.""
RM said there had been ""many difficult and painful moments"" during his 18 months of military service.
""Since returning, I've grown closer with my father and old friends – many of whom had already completed their military service,"" he added.
V said military service was ""a time for me to reset and rebuild both my body and mind"".
""Now that I've done that, I truly want to run straight to ARMY as soon as possible,"" he said, referring to the band's official fandom name.
This week, four BTS members will complete their service. Two were discharged last year, and the final member, SUGA – who has been working as a social service agent for alternative non-active duty service – will be released later this month.
HYBE, the band's agency, had urged fans not to go to the discharge location, citing safety concerns. Flouting the warning, dozens gathered outside V's military base, eagerly awaiting the return of their star.
""Honestly, I came here with such high expectations,"" Yang Ho-hee, 28, told AFP outside the base.
Reunion tour?
On a football field where the newly released BTS members spoke, hundreds of fans from around the world gathered, hoping to catch a glimpse of their idols.
RM and V later held a live chat on their superfan platform, Weverse, where fellow member Jin joined.
""We have plans. Please wait just a little longer,"" said RM.
""I've had time to recharge, so I'll make something good and show it to you. We'll make sure everyone knows that we're back.""
All the band members signed new contracts with their agency HYBE in 2023, and once SUGA is released on June 21, analysts expect profit-driving reunion activities.
""In the case of HYBE share prices, the current market consensus is seen as not fully reflecting BTS's impact,"" Lim Soo-jin, an analyst at Daishin Securities, told AFP.
Despite an ongoing police investigation into the company chairman for suspected insider trading and a recent raid by authorities, analysts say HYBE's shares are up, rising by 10 per cent over the past week through June 9.
GDP impact
Prior to their mandatory military service, the boy band generated more than 5.5 trillion won ($4 billion) in yearly economic impact, according to the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute.
That accounts for roughly 0.2 per cent of South Korea's total GDP, according to official data.
HYBE has hinted at a BTS comeback this year, but has also said the members ""need time for reflection and preparation"".
""Normally, the process goes from song production to album release, then a tour,"" Lee Jae-sang, CEO of HYBE, told a shareholder meeting in March.
""But since BTS have already become global top-tier artists, we are continuing discussions about their vision and what's next,"" Lee added.
The HYBE headquarters building in Seoul was wrapped with the slogan ""WE ARE BACK"", the official logo for the upcoming BTS FESTA.
HYBE shares opened nearly three per cent higher Tuesday morning, reaching their highest level in two years.

Bread makers push for rate hike,"US
Sui gas and LNG supplies are completely shut off
The Pakistan Naanbai Association and the tandoor bodies of the twin cities Rawalpindi and Islamabad have issued a one-week notice to the government and Deputy Commissioners regarding the steep increase in prices of flour, fine flour, and commercial gas cylinders, demanding a rise in the prices of bread, naan, and paratha.
A joint convention of naanbai bodies from Islamabad and all districts of Punjab has been called in Rawalpindi after Eidul Azha. During this convention, a decision will be made either to officially announce the new prices of bread and naan or to launch a complete strike and protest.
Shafeeq Abbasi, the central president of the association, says a sack of red flour costs Rs6,000 from the mills to the tandoor, while fine flour is being sold at Rs7,200 per sack. Within a week, the price of regular flour has increased by Rs500 and fine flour by Rs600 - a trend that continues to rise, he adds.
""Despite the extreme heat, no tandoor has access to Sui gas. Every tandoor operator is forced to buy commercial gas cylinders for Rs14,000 each to operate.
Sui gas and LNG supplies are completely shut off. Electricity prices have also increased, while rental costs for tandoors and labour wages have gone up.""
Additionally, the prices of ghee, oil, and dry milk have surged, he says and adds under these conditions it is impossible for them to sell affordable bread.
Abbasi demanded the government fix new, increased prices for bread; otherwise, after Eid, the All Punjab Tandoor Owners Convention will decide on strict measures.

Murray leaves door open to coaching return,"US
His short stint with Djokovic ended with a trophy
Former world number one Andy Murray has left the door open to a coaching return after his short stint with Novak Djokovic ended without a trophy, but the Scot said he did not expect to be working with another player anytime soon.
Serb Djokovic appointed Murray ahead of this year's Australian Open and said at the Qatar Open in February they would continue working together for an indefinite period.
However, the 24-times Grand Slam champion then endured a woeful run of form and the pair parted ways last month ahead of the French Open.
""I would do it again at some stage. I don't think that will happen immediately,"" Murray told the BBC on Monday. ""I wasn't planning on going into coaching as soon as I finished playing but it was a pretty unique opportunity.
""It was a chance to learn from one of the best athletes of all time. You also learn a lot about how to work with a team.
""You're working with a physio, physical trainers, agents, and you need to know how to get your message across to the player and find out what makes them tick.
""That was the thing I learned and something I need to work on if I want to do it again in the future,"" added Murray.
Though they won no titles in their six-month partnership, Murray said he had good memories of his time working with former rival Djokovic.
""It was a brilliant opportunity for me. We got to spend some really nice moments away from the court,"" the three-times Grand Slam champion added.
""Results weren't as we wanted but we gave it a go. We'll see about coaching in the future but I don't think that will happen for a while.""

Rare dowry lawsuit filed decades after marriage,"US
The case was filed by Mashahid Hussain against his brother-in-law Manzoor Ahmed.
In a unique and unprecedented case in Pakistan's family courts history, a man has sued his brother-in-law 24 years after the marriage of his sister, demanding the return of 132 tolas of silver, 18 tolas of gold jewellery, and dowry items worth Rs861,000.
The rare case has been filed in the Rawalpindi's family court, raising several new constitutional and legal questions.
Family Judge Yasir Bilal of Rawalpindi accepted the case for hearing, issued notices to Manzoor Ahmed, and summoned him to appear in court with a reply on July 2. Along with the notices, advertisements calling for court attendance have also been issued.
The case was filed by Mashahid Hussain against his brother-in-law Manzoor Ahmed. The petition states that his sister, Rana Arifa Sabohi, was married to Manzoor on July 29, 2001. The couple has no children. Manzoor's lawyer says they will submit their legal response according to family law on July 2.

"Brazil, Ecuador book World Cup berths","DE
The five-time world champions booked their place with a 1-0 home victory over Paraguay
Brazil booked their place at the 2026 World Cup in North America on Tuesday with a lacklustre 1-0 home victory over Paraguay, the first win of Carlo Ancelotti's reign.
The five-time world champions — the only team to appear in every edition of the World Cup — punched their ticket to the finals in Canada, the United States and Mexico thanks to Vinicius Jr.
The Real Madrid star bundled home from close range in the 44th minute in Sao Paulo after a cross from new Manchester United signing Matheus Cunha.
Uruguay's 2-0 win over Venezuela in Montevideo had raised the prospect of qualification for both Brazil and Paraguay at Corinthians Arena.
Paraguay were left needing only a point to qualify while Brazil knew they could advance with a win in Ancelotti's second game in charge.
In the event it was Brazil who seized the opportunity presented by Venezuela's loss with Vinicius scoring the only goal just before half-time.
Brazil had struggled to create many chances up until that point, with Cunha squandering a golden chance in the 35th minute after heading wide from point-blank range.
Cunha made up for it with a key part in the goal, capitalising on good work from Raphinha to dart into the box and whip in a low cross for Vinicius, who stabbed home the finish.
The win lifted Brazil into third place in the South American standings with 25 points from 16 games, guaranteeing them a top-six finish and an automatic qualifying berth.
The defeat leaves Paraguay with 24 points, meaning they need one point to secure their first World Cup appearance since 2010.
Ecuador book place
Surprise package Ecuador joined Brazil by sealing qualification with a point following a 0-0 draw with Peru in Lima.
In other games, Uruguay edged closer to qualification with their win over Venezuela while Chile were eliminated with defeat to Bolivia. Goals from Rodrigo Aguirre and Giorgian de Arrascaeta secured all three points for Marcelo Bielsa's Uruguay to leave the two-time world champions firmly on course for a place in next year's finals.
Like Paraguay, Uruguay need only a point from their final two games to qualify.
Venezuela, who are bidding to reach the World Cup for the first time in the nation's history, are seventh with 18 points from 16 games.
Argentina, who have already qualified, meanwhile came from behind to frustrate Colombia with a 1-1 draw in Buenos Aires.
Liverpool star Luis Diaz fired Colombia into the lead with a superb 24th minute goal, and the Colombians were given a further boost midway through the second half when the world champions were reduced to 10 men after Enzo Fernandez's dismissal.But Colombia's hopes of a vital win were dashed nine minutes from time when Thiago Almada weaved into the box and found the target to level.
The top six finishers in South America qualify automatically for the World Cup, with the seventh-placed team advancing to an intercontinental playoff.
Bolivia defeated Chile 2-0 to end the former South American champions' hopes of qualification.
It is the third straight World Cup that Chile have missed out on.The loss continues a dramatic fall from grace for 'La Roja', who won back-to-back Copa Americas in 2015 and 2016.

Six drowned picnickers' corpses retrieved,"US
Two families lose members to waves of Indus, Jhelum rivers
The bodies of six members of two families who had drowned in in the Indus and Jhelum rivers have been found.
In Bhakkar, a family outing to the Indus river ended in tragedy when a 21-year-old woman drowned along with her two young cousins. According to local officials, a six-year-old girl slipped into the river, after which her 13-year-old sister jumped in to save her.
Seeing both girls drowning, their 21-year-old cousin also leapt into the river to rescue them. However, the strong current swept all three into deeper water.
Upon hearing the screams for help from Lal Shah, the husband of the woman, local residents began a search and retrieved the bodies from the river after about half an hour.
Bhakkar District Police Officer Shehzad Rafiq Awan told The Express Tribune that the deceased woman had been married 15 days earlier and was visiting a relative, Syed Taqqi Shah, in Jhok Jando, along with her husband, from the nearby town of Behal.
Due to the river's proximity, they had gone for sightseeing at the Basti Mian Khan dyke with the two young cousins.
The funeral of the woman was held in Kathanwalla and of Taqi Shah's daughters in Jhok Jando.
The DPO explained that the incident had occurred during daytime and the water was seven to eight feet deep at the spot where the six-year-old girl had drowned. Her 13-year-old sister and newlywed cousin jumped into the same dangerous area in an attempt to save her, resulting in all three losing their lives.
As the area descended into gloom over the tragedy, the official emphasised the importance of avoiding to take young children to the riversides.
He suggested that even adults should prefer alternative locations for recreation.
Meanwhile, the bodies of three members of a family from Kot Lashkari Khan in Sahiwal district were retrieved from River Jhelum.
The family had gone to the river for recreation on the third day of Eid. A woman was taking selfies near the river when she slipped into the water. Her sister attempted to rescue her.
Eventually, four family members were swept away while trying to save each other from drowning.
Local residents managed to save one young man, Zeeshan Anwar.
Sarfaraz Raja, his wife Nida and sister-in-law Nazia Sajjad drowned in the river. Their bodies were found seven kilometres downstream 20 hours later.
The bodies were retrieved by local divers and teams from Rescue 1122.

Oil industry slams govt for failing to fulfil promise,"PK
Says despite commitment, sales tax exemption on petroleum products not withdrawn
The oil industry has expressed concern over the government's failure to fulfil the promise of resolving the issue of sales tax exemption on petroleum products in the Finance Bill 2025, which jeopardises $6 billion worth of planned investment in upgrading refineries.
The industry has cautioned that the continuation of sales tax break in the budget for fiscal year 2025-26 threatens the viability of businesses, undermines investor confidence and is inconsistent with broader objectives of the Pakistan Brownfield Oil Refining Policy 2023.
Earlier, foreign investors also voiced concern due to the sales tax exemption and were hesitant to invest in Pakistan's refineries.
The government has allowed the oil industry to charge Rs1.87 per litre in order to recover the losses caused by the sales tax holiday. It also committed to resolving the issue by imposing up to 5% sales tax in the FY26 budget. However, it did not meet the commitment.
Chairman of the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC), in a letter sent to the Ministry of Energy – Petroleum Division on Wednesday, once again asked for the removal of sales tax exemption on petroleum products.
""On behalf of the Oil Companies Advisory Council and its member companies, we wish to convey our deep concern and strong protest over the continuation of general sales tax (GST) exemption on petroleum products in the recently announced Finance Bill 2025,"" the OCAC chairman said, adding that while they acknowledge the government's interim relief by allowing the recovery of GST impact through the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM), effective May 16, 2025, ""this remains a temporary measure with inherent implications"".
""We urge the immediate withdrawal of the GST exemption and request its replacement with a sales tax mechanism that allows for full input tax adjustment. This is the only durable solution that will restore financial stability, tax neutrality and regulatory clarity to the sector, failing which, the investment of $6 billion in Pakistan's refining sector under the Brownfield Refining Policy is at serious risk,"" said the OCAC chairman.
In view of the critical nature of the matter and its wide-ranging implications, he sought an urgent meeting with the petroleum minister to secure a path towards permanent resolution.

"India, ISKP and BLA: Pakistan's multi-front security challenge","PL
Pakistan's commitment to countering terrorism has been evident in recent counter-intelligence successes.
In recent years, Pakistan has grappled with an evolving security landscape marked by a resurgence of terrorism and foreign interference. From the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) to the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and with India's Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) allegedly backing these elements, the threats are no longer isolated. They form part of a broader, transnational effort to undermine Pakistan's internal cohesion, divert its strategic focus and erode its sovereignty.
At the heart of these challenges lies a sophisticated matrix of proxy warfare, disinformation campaigns and ideological subversion, designed to weaken Pakistan's state apparatus and inflame ethnic and sectarian divisions.
Pakistan's commitment to countering terrorism has been evident in recent counter-intelligence successes. The arrest of an ISKP recruiter in coordination with Turkey's National Intelligence Organization (MIT) signals a proactive approach to dismantling terror networks. However, gains like these are frequently offset by persistent external interference.
RAW's support to insurgent groups such as the BLA and Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) reportedly extends beyond financial and logistical assistance. It includes strategic disinformation campaigns aimed at fostering mistrust within Pakistani society and delegitimising state institutions. By exploiting regional grievances — particularly in Balochistan and former tribal areas — these actors seek to provoke unrest and delegitimise constitutional authority.
Such asymmetric tactics are not unique, but the scale and precision of their execution suggest a long-term strategy to destabilise Pakistan from within. The manipulation of nationalist sentiments and radical religious narratives is central to this objective, positioning Pakistan as a battleground for ideological and geopolitical contests.
While ideological differences exist between groups like ISKP and BLA, they converge on one objective: undermining the Pakistani state. Rivalries between such factions may occasionally result in infighting, but their collective impact remains deeply destabilising. These groups exploit porous borders, weak governance in remote regions and access to digital platforms to sustain their operations.
The fragmentation of these networks does not reduce the threat; instead, it signals a dangerous adaptability. Their volatility, combined with the external backing they receive, fuels a cycle of violence with repercussions far beyond Pakistan's borders.
The result is not only domestic insecurity but also a regional spillover — disrupted trade routes, refugee inflows and diminished prospects for regional cooperation. The persistence of such conditions limits Pakistan's ability to assert itself diplomatically and economically within South Asia.
Pakistan faces an existential threat, not merely through armed incursions or terrorist attacks but through strategic hybrid warfare. The tools of this conflict are disinformation, cyber subversion and proxy militancy — each aimed at fragmenting Pakistan's national identity and weakening its institutions.
This multi-pronged approach serves broader geopolitical aims: to contain Pakistan's strategic outreach, curtail its role in regional diplomacy and deter foreign investment. The cost is not only economic — it is societal, institutional and psychological. A state that must perpetually defend its legitimacy at home finds it difficult to project influence abroad.
Addressing these complex challenges requires more than tactical responses. While intelligence coordination and counter-terrorism operations remain crucial, the broader strategy must be structural, long-term and rooted in resilience.
First, Pakistan must continue to modernise its security and intelligence infrastructure. This includes enhanced cyber surveillance, predictive analytics and robust counter-disinformation architecture. Investment in these capabilities would strengthen the state's ability to detect, deter and disrupt both internal threats and foreign interference.
Second, a sustained policy of regional engagement is essential. While strategic competition with India may persist, Pakistan must continue building alliances with regional actors — particularly those with shared concerns about terrorism and cyber threats. Intelligence sharing, joint operations and diplomatic convergence, such as seen with Turkey and China, offer a pathway to collective security.
Third, internal consolidation is paramount. Socio-economic disparities, especially in regions like Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, continue to serve as recruitment grounds for extremist groups. Development, however, must be matched with political inclusion, institutional reform and restoration of state legitimacy through accountable governance.
Lastly, the narrative domain must not be ceded. Pakistan must invest in strategic communication — amplifying voices of national unity, countering propaganda and promoting critical media literacy. Civil society, academic institutions and religious leaders all have roles to play in rebuilding a national consensus rooted in pluralism and constitutionalism.
Pakistan's security dilemma is no longer confined to its borders. The instability it faces is both a consequence and a driver of wider regional volatility. If left unaddressed, the current trajectory could precipitate broader strategic disorder across South Asia.
By consolidating internal strength, refining external partnerships and investing in long-term social resilience, Pakistan can reposition itself not merely as a state under siege but as a proactive agent of regional stability — one that places sovereignty at the centre, balances coercive capability with socio-political outreach and embeds national security within a framework of regional cooperation.

Govt raises Rs1.1trin debt auctions,"GB
Rupee down 26 paisa at 282.47/$; gold gains Rs600
The government raised approximately Rs1.1 trillion through auctions of Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) and floating-rate Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs). In the MTB auction, bids worth Rs853 billion were accepted by the State Bank of Pakistan. Similarly, the bond auction saw total acceptance of Rs206.91 billion.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee weakened against the US dollar on Wednesday, slipping 0.09%. By the day's close, the local currency stood at 282.47 per dollar, down 26 paisa compared to the previous close at 282.21.
On the global front, both the US dollar and Chinese yuan remained stable as the two nations wrapped up trade negotiations in London, signalling a potential easing of their prolonged dispute, though details were limited.
Gold prices in Pakistan edged higher on Wednesday, mirroring gains in the international market, where bullion rose following softer-than-expected US inflation data.
The easing inflation bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve may begin cutting interest rates by September, lifting investor sentiment.
In the domestic market, the price of gold per tola increased Rs600 to Rs352,900 while the price for 10 grams rose Rs514 to Rs302,554, reported the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association.
This followed a sharp drop on Tuesday when the per-tola price fell Rs6,100.

NA nod sought for Rs345b spending,"US
Grants include Rs60b for defence not linked to war, largest share spent on IPPs
The government has sought ex-post facto approval from the National Assembly for nearly Rs345 billion in additional spending incurred during the current fiscal year without prior parliamentary approval. No war-related expenditures with India were booked in the accounts.
A Rs60 billion supplementary grant was allocated for defence purposes in the outgoing fiscal year, but it was not war related. Pakistan's armed forces met war-related expenses with India from their regular approved budgets, said Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
The National Assembly's approval is being sought along with the new budget. While the Rs344.6 billion figure appears high, especially against the government's claim of strict expenditure control, it is still lower than in the previous fiscal year.
Under the Constitution, the federal government can approve supplementary grants for unforeseen expenditures without prior National Assembly approval. However, it must later follow the same approval process as for the new budget. Over time, this constitutional provision has been used routinely rather than exceptionally.
Details show that Rs345 billion in additional spending was incurred on unbudgeted items by diverting funds from other heads. This has not impacted the overall budget size, but the volume of these grantsmost approved by the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinetreflects poor budgeting and financial control.
Under the $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package, the federal government has committed that – in order to ring fence the fiscal programme – no supplementary grants will be allowed beyond the approved budget, except in case of severe natural disasters. It has also pledged to seek ex-ante approval from the National Assembly for any spending exceeding budgetary appropriations.
Sources said discussions also took place at the IMF level about discouraging supplementary grants made through internal fund reallocation, to improve fiscal discipline.
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led government approved these additional grants for all kinds of expenditures, including power subsidies, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), armed forces, helicopter repairs, hosting the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, and discretionary spending on parliamentarians' schemes and civil armed forces' capacity building.
The single largest supplementary grant was for power sector subsidies, accounting for 37% of total additional spending. The government gave Rs115 billion in supplementary grants to pay independent power producers, while Rs308 million was allocated for structural reforms in the power sector.
An additional Rs14 billion was given to settle liabilities for solarising agricultural tube wells.
A Rs258 million grant was issued for financial compensation to families of Chinese nationals killed in a terrorist attack that Pakistani authorities attributed to foreign involvement.
The government allocated Rs59.5 billion to the armed forces in supplementary funding. This included Rs23.3 billion for Pakistan Army's counter-terrorism capacity enhancement, Rs8 billion for defence force projects, and Rs7 billion for the Jinnah Naval Base in Omara, according the finance ministry's budget book.
Additionally, Rs8 billion and Rs4 billion were allocated for the Special Security Division South and North, respectivelyunits that have existed for years and should be part of the regular budget.
The government also approved Rs5 billion for internal security duty allowances and Rs2 billion for technological upgrades at the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
A Rs1.3 billion supplementary grant was provided for fence maintenance along the Afghanistan and Iran borders, while Rs800 million was allocated for developing the naval air station in Turbat.
Another Rs1.8 billion supplementary grant has been allocated toward overhauling engines of VVIP aircraft, according to the finance ministry's budget documents.
The Reko Diq mining project received Rs3.7 billion in additional funds. A Rs1 billion grant was given for hosting the SCO summit, as per the budget book.
Despite some concerns, Rs2 billion was allocated to restructure Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited (PRAL) — a company and not a federal entity. An additional Rs2 billion was granted for Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officers, and Rs1.6 billion for setting up anti-smuggling posts.
For transition accommodation of FBR officers, Rs430 million was approved, and Rs869 million was provided to enhance the organisation's operational efficiency. Despite this, the FBR has posted a record Rs1.03 trillion shortfall in tax collection for the current fiscal year, with one month remaining.
A compulsory Rs1.3 billion grant was given to the Election Commission of Pakistan for holding local government elections. Rs7.2 billion was allocated for Sindh-specific discretionary spending on small schemes and for operationalising the Green Line Bus Rapid Transit project.
The interior ministry received a Rs4.3 billion development grant for initiatives such as transforming the National Forensic Agency, building women's facilities in tribal areas, setting up check posts, and launching water supply schemes.
A Rs30 billion supplementary grant was provided for flood-affected areas of Sindh, and Rs19.2 billion was allocated for small development schemes executed by the now-defunct Pakistan Public Works Department. Sindh also received Rs9 billion in additional financial support for projects, but the finance ministry did not detail the projects.
An additional Rs7 billion was given for parliamentarians' schemes and Rs23.4 billion grant was approved for the federal Directorate of Immunisation.

Curfew in LA as Trump vows to 'liberate' city,"AT
""I think that obviously they're doing it for safety,"" she said of the curfew.
A nighttime curfew was declared in Los Angeles on Tuesday as local officials sought to get a handle on protests that Donald Trump claimed were an invasion by a ""foreign enemy.""
Looting and vandalism has scarred the heart of America's second biggest city as largely peaceful protests over immigration arrests turned ugly after dark. ""I have declared a local emergency and issued a curfew for downtown Los Angeles to stop the vandalism, to stop the looting,"" Mayor Karen Bass told reporters.
One square mile (2.5 square kilometers) of the city's more-than-500 square mile area will be off-limits between 8pm and 6am for everyone apart from residents, journalists and emergency services, she added.
One protester told AFP the arrest of migrants in a city with large foreign-born and Latino populations was the root of the unrest.
""I think that obviously they're doing it for safety,"" she said of the curfew.
""But I don't think that part of the problem is the peaceful protests. It's whatever else is happening on the other side that is inciting violence.""
Small-scale and largely peaceful protests — marred by eye-catching acts of violence — began Friday in Los Angeles as anger swelled over ramped up arrests by immigration authorities.
At their largest, a few thousand people have taken to the streets, but smaller mobs have used the cover of darkness to set fires, daub graffiti and smash windows.
Overnight Monday 23 businesses were looted, police said, adding that more than 500 people had been arrested over recent days.
Protests have also sprung up in cities around the country, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago and San Francisco.

Fishing cat: Indus delta losing its lone surviving predator,"GB
Endangered Indus fishing cat faces alarming decline due to environmental, human-induced factors
Pakistan has long been struggling with the gradual disappearance of its rare wildlife species due to a lethal mix of environmental and human-induced factors, including habitat destruction, dwindling water resources, pollution, and poaching.
Among these vanishing species is the endangered Indus fishing cat, found mostly in the Indus River Delta and surrounding buffer areas, where its numbers have dropped dramatically over recent decades.
Habitat loss, food scarcity, hunting, and growing human populations have significantly impacted this rare feline, which plays a vital role in maintaining the balance of aquatic ecosystems, according to experts.
""The past two decades have appeared to be disastrous for this environment-friendly animal, mainly because of the destruction of wetlands and killings by local people,"" Saeed-ul-Islam, a senior Pakistani wildlife expert, told Anadolu.
Although official surveys have yet to determine precise figures, Islam explained that conservative estimates suggest the cat's population in Pakistan has declined by more than 50% in the last two decades alone.
Globally, the fishing cat population has declined approximately 30% since 2010, and the animal has been listed as vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List since 2016. In addition to decreasing water levels, deteriorating water quality has exacerbated the plight of these animals.
""Deterioration of water quality due to untreated water flowing directly into water bodies, and the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, are also taking a toll on conservation efforts,"" Islam noted.
Region's last surviving predator
Wildlife specialists consider the fishing cat the last surviving major predator of the Indus flood plains following the near extinction of others such as gharials, tigers, and leopards from the region.
""We have this last predator in the Indus flood plains that greatly contributes to keeping aquatic animal populations healthy,"" said Zafeer Ahmed Shaikh, head of the Indus Fishing Cat Project (IFCP). The IFCP, launched in 2021, forms part of the global Fishing Cat Conservation Alliance initiative, which seeks to protect and preserve this rare species.
The project engages local communities, governmental authorities, and wildlife organizations to support conservation efforts.
Before 2020, the status of the Indus fishing cat on Pakistan's IUCN country list remained uncertain, suggesting the species was nearing extinction, according to Shaikh. ""It was us (IFCP) who told the world that this animal not only still exists in Pakistan but that its distribution range has extended to the riverine areas of Sindh and Balochistan provinces through the canal network,"" Shaikh asserted. In addition to the Indus delta, recent sightings have occurred in Jaffarabad and Jhal Magsi districts in the southwestern Balochistan province.
Challenges in determining exact numbers
Shaikh acknowledged the difficulty in determining the exact population numbers due to a lack of comprehensive surveys by either government agencies or wildlife groups. ""We cannot give any specific number about its population in Pakistan. But one thing is sure — its number has reduced due to shrinking wetlands and water bodies,"" he said. Shaikh acknowledged that, although the IFCP has made ""a little difference"" in increasing the fishing cat's numbers, ""it's a long way to go.""
Kamal Palari, a community worker involved with IFCP conservation efforts in Sindh's Thatta district, noted a significant reduction in hunting incidents involving the fishing cat in recent years. ""Locals, especially farmers, would kill them because they falsely believed this cat was a threat to their livestock and crops,"" Palari told Anadolu. However, he said awareness campaigns launched by IFCP and increased community involvement have led to a noticeable decrease in such cases.
Shaikh also clarified that the fishing cat ""very rarely"" attacks goats and has no capacity to threaten livestock herds significantly.
Balancing aquatic ecosystems
Mumtaz Soomro, a deputy director at the Sindh Wildlife Department, believes that strict wildlife protection laws enacted in 2020 — imposing heavy fines and sentences for hunting rare species — have further helped reduce killings of fishing cats.
Soomro said the department has worked with local communities and wildlife groups on awareness campaigns to protect the cat, which he emphasized is ""very important for keeping marine life healthy.
In addition to shrinking wetlands, Islam cited overfishing by local communities as another critical reason for food shortages affecting the fishing cat.
He also stressed the fishing cat's vital role in maintaining the ecological balance within the Indus delta.
Shaikh echoed these views, underscoring the fishing cat's role in protecting crops by controlling populations of rodents. ""They control the population of small animals, so the ecosystem remains in balance,"" he concluded.
