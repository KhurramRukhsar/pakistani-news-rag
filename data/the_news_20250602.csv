"Bushra Bibi: ‘red line’ for Imran, ‘fault line’ for establishment",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317696-bushra-bibi-red-line-for-imran-fault-line-for-establishment,"ISLAMABAD: It was former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa who initially brought the issue to then prime minister Imran Khan’s attention — a folder containing details of alleged corruption linked to Bushra Bibi, the First Lady at the time.
Khan, however, immediately pushed back, reportedly telling Bajwa: “Bushra Bibi is my red line.”
According to insiders familiar with the exchange, Khan dismissed the contents of the folder as “one-sided”. When Bajwa suggested the prime minister look into the links of individuals close to Bushra Bibi -- including Farah Gogi, then Punjab chief minister Usman Buzdar, and others -- Khan once again reiterated that Bushra Bibi was off limits.
Later, then-DG ISI Lt Gen Asim Munir (now Field Marshal) attempted to brief the prime minister on the same allegations. This did not sitwell with Khan, who within 24 hours called Bajwa and demanded Munir’s removal from the top intelligence post.
Sources say Bajwa attempted to pacify the prime minister, but Khan remained firm and insisted that Asim Munir be replaced. Khan proposed Gen Faiz Hameed for the role of DG ISI -- despite the fact that Hameed’s name was not included in the official panel sent for the prime minister’s approval.
As Khan continued to push for Asim Munir’s removal, Bajwa reportedly advised him to at least invite the outgoing DG ISI for a farewell tea -- a gesture of protocol and respect. Khan refused.
In a recent statement issued via his official account on the social media platform “X”, Imran Khan confirmed that he had removed Gen Asim and said that afterward he tried to reach out to Bushra Bibi through intermediaries but she declined to speak with him. Neither Imran Khan explained who these intermediaries were nor has the claim been confirmed by any independent source.
This account sharply contrasts with Khan’s earlier public position. In May 2023, responding to a Telegraph report that claimed Asim Munir was dismissed because he sought to investigate corruption involving Bushra Bibi and her inner circle, Khan categorically denied the story. “This is completely false,” he wrote in a tweet. “Neither did Gen Asim show me any proof of my wife’s corruption nor did I make him resign because of that.”
The Telegraph had reported that Gen Munir, during his brief stint as ISI chief, clashed with Imran Khan in 2019 after raising concerns about financial dealings around Bushra Bibi. He was removed from his position just eight months into what was expected to be a three-year term.
Interestingly, in November 2022, Khan supported the appointment of Gen Asim Munir as Chief of Army Staff. A few weeks prior to this appointment, Khan had given a call for long march allegedly to block Asim’s appointment as the Army Chief.
Though the decision regarding the appointment of Army Chief legally rested with the sitting prime minister, then-PTI President Dr Arif Alvi flew to Lahore to meet Khan and publicly signal Khan’s endorsement of Munir’s promotion.

PMLN wins PP-52 Sambrial by-poll,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317697-pmln-wins-pp-52-sambrial-by-poll,"SIALKOT/ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) candidate won the by-election for Punjab Assembly constituency PP-52 Sambrial, Sialkot. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif greeted the winner of PP-52 Sambrial and said the people were supporting the PMLN.
According to unofficial results of all the 185 polling stations in the PP-52 Sialkot by-election, PMLN’s Hina Arshad Warraich won by securing 78,419 votes.
PTI-backed independent candidate Fakhir Nishat Ghuman came in second place with 40,037 votes.
Polling continued from 8am to 5pm in the by-election for the provincial assembly seat PP-52 in Sambrial. There was chaos throughout the day during polling, with workers arguing and shouting slogans, while allegations of rigging were also made.
In a conversation with Geo News, PMLN candidate Hina Arshad said that the people elected her not for politics but for service. “I am standing at this position because of Maryam Nawaz. If the Punjab chief minister had not trusted me, I would not be standing here,” she said.
Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz congratulated Hina Arshad Warraich on her victory in the PP-52 by-election and said that she would fully rely on the trust shown by the people of Sambrial. She said that the success of PMLN is an expression of the people’s confidence in the government’s policies. The people have identified those who serve and those who spread sedition and mischief, the Punjab CM maintained.
Meanwhile, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram Sunday alleged planned rigging in PP-52, Sambrial, but said that they will not allow the mandate to be stolen again in the constituency, claiming his party was still in the lead.
He told a news conference here that voters in this constituency of Sialkot were with PTI.
Waqas said that this seat was won by PTI on February 8 and PTI is still in the lead today, vowing not to allow the mandate to be stolen again. “That is why people came out since morning, but the goons of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz resorted to hooliganism there,” he charged.
The PTI spokesperson said, “Our people have been thrown out of every polling station; our people have been tortured, PTI people and agents have been thrown out of polling station 37.” He continued that all this is happening there under the patronage of the police, as they are forcibly entering every polling station and casting their votes by stamping their hands.
Waqas claimed that the presiding officer at polling station number 10 confessed to stopping the polling, whereas since last night, containers had been placed outside the office of the returning officer for rigging. He regretted that no check and balance policy has been seen at any station since morning.
He wondered what action the Chief Election Commissioner took on the rigging. He pointed out that the Chief Election Commissioner was continuing despite the completion of his term.
He said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has won the Sambrial election and that the people have been intimidated but despite this, the people are siding with the PTI.

Bilawal-led delegation to begin meetings at UN today,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317698-bilawal-led-delegation-to-begin-meetings-at-un-today,"NEW YORK: A delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari will begin its meetings and activities at the United Nations from today (June 2). It will meet with ambassadors of 14 member countries of the Security Council, including the five permanent members.
Bilawal Bhutto and Sherry Rehman have already arrived in New York, while the remaining members are arriving in New York on different flights.
The delegation, comprising senior political figures including Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Khurram Dastgir Khan, Bushra Anjum Butt, Sherry Rehman, Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani, aims to present Pakistan	s perspective on the recent military confrontation with India and counter New Delhi	s narrative on the conflict.
The Pakistani delegation will begin its meetings at the United Nations today (Monday). In addition to meetings with the UN Secretary-General and the President of the UN General Assembly, it will meet with the ambassadors of the remaining 14 member countries of the 15-member UN Security Council. It will also address the United Nations Correspondents	 Association (UNCA), an international organization of journalists established at the United Nations for 70 years.
In addition to addressing UN journalists, they will also address Pakistani journalists that evening. Other activities and meetings of the delegation include meetings with ambassadors of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) countries and ambassadors of the Organization of Non-Aligned Movement. However, there are no details about meetings with American media and their editorial boards, human rights and peace and security organizations.
Similarly, there is no program that includes meetings with organizations working against disinformation and for media accuracy to inform them about the disinformation and one-sided propaganda of the Indian media. Some quarters are also raising the question that most of the meetings of the Pakistani team are with diplomats of countries that already have friendly relations with Pakistan and are convinced of Pakistan	s position. Despite President Trump	s strong statement, it is not yet clear which officials of his administration will meet the Pakistani delegation.
There are reports of a meeting and talks with an American think tank on June 5, while Indian Congress Party leader Shashi Tharoor will be in Washington after visiting Latin American countries. India	s controversial Foreign Secretary Vikram Masri is already visiting Washington.

Haris hits maiden hundred as Pakistan whitewash Bangladesh,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317699-haris-hits-maiden-hundred-as-pakistan-whitewash-bangladesh,"LAHORE: Pakistan swept the three-match T20 International series against Bangladesh by winning the final encounter by seven wickets at the Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday evening, completing their first home series whitewash in three and a half years.
Mohammad Haris was the architect of Pakistan’s comprehensive triumph, cracking a maiden T20I century that proved to be the highlight of a memorable series finale.
Before an almost filled stadium that witnessed cricketing history, Pakistan overpowered the Bengal Tigers by overcoming their competitive total of 196 for six, mustering 197 for three in just 17.2 overs with 16 balls to spare. This victory capped off a dominant series performance where Pakistan won the opening two matches by 37 and 57 runs respectively, demonstrating their superiority across all three encounters.
Bangladesh delivered their most impressive batting performance of the series, posting a competitive total of 196 runs for six wickets after Pakistan won the toss and elected to field first. The visitors showed remarkable resilience and intent with both teams making one change each -- Pakistan rested Haris Rauf while replacing him with Abbas Afridi, and Bangladesh brought in Khaled Ahmed as replacement for the injured Shoriful Islam.
The foundation of Bangladesh’s fighting total was laid by their explosive opening partnership that completely dominated the Pakistan bowling attack in the initial stages. Tanzid Hasan and Parvez Hossain Emon combined for a spectacular 110-run opening stand that set the tone for the innings, with the duo reaching their fifty-run partnership in just 33 balls and the hundred-run milestone in 61 deliveries.
Parvez Hossain Emon emerged as the star performer, clobbering his first T20 international half-century in just 27 balls before going on to compile a magnificent 66 off 34 balls, an innings decorated with seven boundaries and four sixes that showcased his aggressive intent from the outset. Tanzid Hasan provided excellent support at the other end, contributing a valuable 42 off 32 balls with three fours and three sixes, ensuring the opening partnership maintained its momentum throughout.
The pair’s approach was relentless during the Power-play overs, where Bangladesh accumulated 53 runs without losing a wicket, providing the perfect platform for a substantial total. However, once the opening partnership was broken with Tanzid’s dismissal for 42 in the 11th over, followed immediately by Emon’s departure for 66 just three balls later, Bangladesh faced a challenging period as Pakistan’s bowlers fought back.
The middle order showed character and determination to rebuild the innings, with Litton Das and Towhid Hridoy forging a crucial 49-run partnership for the third wicket that prevented a complete collapse. Litton Das contributed a brisk 22 off 17 balls with one four and one six, while Towhid Hridoy played a measured knock of 25 off 18 balls, striking two fours and one six to keep Bangladesh’s scoring rate healthy.
Pakistan’s bowling attack showed mixed results, with Mohammad Abbas Afridi being the pick of the bowlers with figures of 2-26, proving his inclusion was justified as he provided crucial breakthroughs. Hasan Ali claimed 2-38 but was expensive, while Faheem Ashraf conceded 41 runs for his single wicket. Shadab Khan maintained his consistency with 1-26, providing control in the middle overs when Bangladesh threatened to post an even bigger total.
Chasing 197 for victory, Pakistan approached their target with typical aggression and precision, with Mohammad Haris producing a career-defining performance that will be remembered for years to come. The wicket-keeper batsman crafted a sensational unbeaten 107 off just 46 balls, an innings embellished with eight boundaries and seven towering sixes that left the Gaddafi Stadium crowd in raptures.
Haris’s journey to his maiden T20I century was nothing short of spectacular. He reached his half-century in just 25 balls, showcasing his intent from the very beginning, before accelerating even further to reach three figures -- marking not just his first T20I hundred but also his career’s first century in any format. His innings was a masterclass in power-hitting combined with intelligent shot selection, as he systematically dismantled Bangladesh’s bowling attack.
After the early loss of Sahibzada Farhan for just 1 run, Saim Ayub joined Haris to forge a crucial 92-run partnership that laid the foundation for Pakistan’s successful chase. Ayub played his part perfectly with a supporting knock of 45 off 29 balls, striking two fours and four sixes, allowing Haris the freedom to express himself at the other end.
Following Ayub’s departure, Hasan Nawaz continued the momentum with a quickfire 26 off 13 balls, including two fours and two sixes, ensuring Pakistan remained ahead of the required rate throughout their 37 runs third wicket partnership with Haris.
The final flourish came through an unbroken 60-run stand between Haris and Salman Ali Agha, who remained not out on 15. This partnership sealed the victory in emphatic fashion, with Haris continuing his boundary-hitting spree to guide Pakistan home with more than two overs to spare.
Despite setting a competitive target, Bangladesh’s bowling attack struggled to contain Pakistan’s aggressive approach. Mehidy Hasan Miraz emerged as their most effective bowler with figures of 2-26, claiming the wickets of both openers, while Tanzim Hasan Sakib managed 1-36. However, the bowling unit lacked the penetration and consistency required to defend their total against Pakistan’s determined batting lineup.
This comprehensive seven-wicket victory completed Pakistan’s first home series whitewash in three and a half years, marking a significant milestone in their T20I journey. Pakistan’s last series win was against the West Indies in December 2022. The 3-0 series result reflects Pakistan’s dominance across all departments -- batting, bowling, and fielding -- throughout the three matches.
The series statistics tell the story of Pakistan’s superiority: they won the first match by 37 runs, the second by 57 runs, and concluded with this seven-wicket triumph. In each encounter, different Pakistani players stepped up to deliver match-winning performances, demonstrating the depth and versatility of their squad.
Mohammad Haris’s magnificent unbeaten century undoubtedly makes him the standout candidate for Player of the Match, with his innings being the defining moment of not just the final game but potentially the entire series. His ability to chase down a challenging target with such authority and style showcased the temperament and skill that makes him such a valuable asset to Pakistan’s T20I setup.
This series whitewash provides Pakistan with tremendous confidence as they continue their T20I journey. The emergence of players like Mohammad Haris as match-winners, combined with consistent contributions from established stars, suggests a bright future for Pakistan’s shortest format ambitions.
For Bangladesh, despite the series result, the fighting performances in the final match, particularly the opening partnership, provide building blocks for future encounters.
The packed Gaddafi Stadium crowd witnessed not just a series victory but a statement of intent from Pakistan cricket, as they demonstrated their capability to dominate international opposition on home soil with a perfect blend of youth and experience.

Govt utilised 54% of development funds in 11 months of current fiscal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317700-govt-utilised-54pc-of-development-funds-in-11-months-of-current-fiscal,"ISLAMABAD: Against a total downward revised allocation of development outlay of Rs1.096 trillion, the federal government has so far utilised only 54 percent funds to the tune of Rs0.593 trillion in the first 11 months of the outgoing fiscal year.
The controversial SDGs Achievement Programme for parliamentarians, meant for only treasury benches, utilised 71 percent funds equivalent to Rs35 billion against the revised allocation of Rs48 billion in the outgoing fiscal year.
According to official data available with The News, the pace of utilisation of development funds was just 54 percent in the first 11 months but with only one month left, it is yet to be seen how much funding is going to be utilised in the outgoing fiscal year ending on June 30, 2025.
Now the government is all set to allocate Rs1 trillion for Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) in the next budget for 2025-26. The Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC) is all set to consider the next PSDP on Monday (today). The development spending of Rs1.4 trillion had been allocated for PSDP along with Public Private Partnership but it was revised downward twice to Rs1.25 trillion and then reduced to Rs1.096 trillion.
In the first 11 months (July to May) 2025-26 period, the government sanctioned Rs0.64 trillion out of which the rupee component spending on development budget stood at Rs0.47 trillion in the first 11 months. The foreign exchange component was envisaged at Rs226 billion for the whole fiscal year out of which the utilisation stood at Rs0.123 trillion in the first 11 months of CFY.
The sources said that the release of funds remained slow in the first half of the CFY due to which the development schemes could not get momentum.
The government is now going to allocate PSDP funding of Rs1 trillion against the ministries demand of Rs3 trillion. The Planning Ministry argued to increase the PSDP up to Rs1.6 trillion for completion of certain ongoing schemes but finally the allocation was proposed at Rs1 trillion. Initially, the Finance Ministry had given indicative budget ceiling of Rs0.921 trillion but later on it was increased up to Rs1 trillion for the next budget.

France-India lock horns over ‘Rafale misadventure’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317701-france-india-lock-horns-over-rafale-misadventure,"ISLAMABAD: What happens when two allies lock horns over a major defence matter? This question is not merely hypothetical in the realm of global politics as the Dassault Rafale fighter plane is at the center of an ongoing dispute between India and France.
This saga began with a recent conflict between India and Pakistan. During the conflict, Pakistan Air Force shot down six Indian fighter jets among which three were Rafale jets.
According to regional and western reports as well as analysts from the United States and France, PAF’s J-10C squadrons successfully downed multiple Indian aircraft in the opening salvo of the conflict.
In addition to the suspected loss of at least three Rafales, India is also believed to have lost one Su-30MKI, one MiG-29 and one Mirage 2000, bringing the total to six confirmed or alleged shootdowns, most of which occurred during India’s deep-strike operations against Pakistani territory.
Indian Chief of Defence Staff General Chauhan confirmed that Indian jets were downed in the opening hours of the conflict, but did not say how many were lost. “What is important is not the jet being down, but why they were being downed. What mistakes were made — those are important. Numbers are not important,” Chauhan told Bloomberg TV.
According to reports, Dassault, the French manufacturer of Rafale, has declined to provide India with the jet’s source code, further straining relations between the two nations. To defend Rafale’s reputation, Paris is also countering New Delhi’s claims by attributing any issues to maintenance and pilot error instead of flaws in France’s top fighter jet.
Compounding the situation, the Indian government is blocking Dassault’s audit team from inspecting India’s Rafale fleet. Dassault’s auditors had wished to evaluate the Indian Rafales to verify that there were no technical issues that the Indian Air Force (IAF) may have overlooked.
The Indians seem likely to be uneasy about this request. According to Indian reports, New Delhi is understandably wary that the French auditors may intend to attribute the lackluster performance of Dassault Rafales to the Indian Air Force itself.
However, the situation doesn’t conclude here.
The performance of Dassault Rafale fighter jets during the India-Pakistan conflict has drawn the attention of other nations. The Indonesian government, worried about the purported deficiencies of the aircraft, has begun its own audit of a recent agreement with Dassault. This incident has also prompted Europe to reassess its military strategies.  Meanwhile, it was reported that Dassault shares dropped after reports of downing came in.

Bangladesh top court restores largest Islamist party,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317703-bangladesh-top-court-restores-largest-islamist-party,"DHAKA: Bangladesh on Sunday restored the registration of the largest Islamist party, allowing it to take part in elections, more than a decade after it was removed under the now-overthrown government.
The Supreme Court overturned a cancellation of Jamaat-e-Islami’s registration, allowing it to be formally listed as a political party with the Election Commission.
“The Election Commission is directed to deal with the registration of that party in accordance with law,” commission lawyer Towhidul Islam said.
Jamaat-e-Islami party lawyer, Shishir Monir, said the Supreme Court’s decision would allow a “democratic, inclusive and multi-party system” in the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people.
“We hope that Bangladeshis, regardless of their ethnicity or religious identity, will vote for Jamaat, and that the parliament will be vibrant with constructive debates,” Monir told journalists.
After Sheikh Hasina was ousted as prime minister in August, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 high court order banning it. Sunday’s decision comes after the Supreme Court on May 27 overturned a conviction against a key leader of Jamaat-e-Islami, ATM Azharul Islam, who was sentenced to death in 2014.
Hasina banned Jamaat-e-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.
In May, Bangladesh’s interim government banned the Awami League, pending the outcome of a trial over its crackdown on mass protests that prompted her ouster last year.

Revealed: Pakistani-American tycoon met Imran seven times in Adiala jail,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317704-revealed-pakistani-american-tycoon-met-imran-seven-times-in-adiala-jail,"LONDON: Pakistani-American tycoon Tanweer Ahmed has confirmed that he met former prime minister and the jailed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf founder Imran Khan seven times last November in Adiala jail for a breakthrough but in the end Khan decided to get his demands met through last year’s march on Islamabad, led by Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi and KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
Speaking to Geo and The News in London, tycoon Tanweer Ahmed’s revelations were published by this reporter in a story in The News and Geo on 14 April 2025 that Khan held several rounds of talks with Tanweer Ahmed and talks progressed positively till a sudden breakdown after a few PTI leaders gave unrealistic advice to Khan.
Tanweer Ahmed, who has donated $9 million to Islamabad’s National University of Science & Technology (NUST), said, “We held extensive talks over several sessions in November last year. When I met him, his shave had grown. He had a grown beard. He was healthy and super fit. He said he was being lazy and didn’t shave as there was no court appearance and no meeting with anyone. Khan was in good health. I asked him if he was aware of the kind of atmosphere cyber warriors had created outside in his name that he was being tortured. I told him about the polarisation and division that existed outside. I told him that he had played his role in creating this kind of polarisation and division and that he should play his role in ending it.”
Tanweer Ahmed said that Imran Khan was worried and concerned at what was happening outside and it also looked like that he was not being provided the correct information.
The business entrepreneur said that Imran Khan has “some valid points” and he’s sticking to many of his demands, if not all. “I cannot share those classified details.” Tanweer Ahmed said, “Imran Khan was worried. It was clear that he was not in the full know of things and had no truthful picture of what was happening outside. We discussed a lot of things over the course of several days. These were good meetings. We discussed and agreed how to end polarisation and division in the society. We discussed how hatred and negativity was dividing and harming Pakistan and how as patriotic Pakistanis we should unite the young people and work for the progress of Pakistan.”
When asked how he was able to meet Imran Khan, Tanweer Ahmed said that the due court process was followed and the meeting was arranged. He didn’t share how and who helped to arrange these meetings.
Geo had earlier reported that a group of American-Pakistanis travelled to Pakistan in the third week of March this year for the sensitive talks with Imran Khan, several rounds of meetings took place in Adiala jail between ex-PM Khan and one of the persons involved in the recent negotiations and talks. That person, it’s confirmed, who met Imran Khan one-on-one was Tanweer Ahmed. He was also part of the delegation that travelled from the USA in March to Pakistan to break the deadlock between Khan and the powerful Pakistani administration. The delegation included food and real estate American-Pakistani tycoon Tanweer Ahmed, PTI USA senior leader Atif Khan, Sardar Abdul Sami, Dr Usman Malik, Dr Saira Bilal and Dr Mohammad Munir.
Tanweer Ahmed said that the whole idea behind these meetings was to end the deadlock and move towards reconciliation. “I am apolitical. I am not affiliated with any political party or any person. For me Pakistan comes first. All I care for it what is good for Pakistan and how to help Pakistan. When I spoke to Khan, it was all about Pakistan and putting Pakistan first.”
Tanweer Ahmed said that all was going well till Imran Khan decided that he would get his demands met through the means of agitation and street movement. “I told Imran Khan that this will not help him and his mission. I told him that he would call such a thing anarchy under his government, as he did in the case of Tehreek-e-Labaik when it gave a protest call during the PTI govt.”
Tanweer Ahmed said it was clear that the PTI leadership had not availed itself of several opportunities and failed to gain political space. “It’s not for the leaders to create followers but create leaders too so that the team backs the leader in difficult times. In PTI, they lack leadership skills and have failed to adapt to new realities. PTI’s confrontational politics has brought PTI to this stage. It has become a party that is at war with self. On each issue, various conflicting statements are issued by the leaders and no one knows who is doing what and who is leading,” he said.
During the November meeting last year with the Pakistani-American, Khan accepted the need for an understanding with the government and the establishment and almost agreed to a settlement of the issues — until he was assured in the same week that millions would join the long march on Islamabad, creating enough chaos to bring the system to the decisive negotiations. According to the sources, three senior KP leaders — including Ali Amin Gandapur — provided assurances to Khan during the jail meetings that millions would storm Islamabad, ensuring his release on the PTI’s terms.
Khan, said the trusted sources, was so convinced about the success of the march that he decided to end the talks with the Pakistani-American — and sent a stern message to the government officers that he hoped the street agitation and reaction would decide his fate.
Tanweer Ahmed has been a personal friend and donor of Khan for nearly two decades and frequently met him when he was the premier. He regretted that Imran Khan was ill-advised by his own people and made him do things which have only jeopardised his chances.

"Govt working on crypto framework aligned with FATF policies, says PM’s aide",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317705-govt-working-on-crypto-framework-aligned-with-fatf-policies-says-pm-s-aide,"ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Blockchain and Crypto Bilal Bin Saqib on Sunday stated that the government was formulating a digital currency regulatory framework aligned with the policies of Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body that combats terrorist financing and money laundering.
Speaking on Geo News programme “Naya Pakistan”, Saqib, who is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), said that the council would outline the country’s cryptocurrency regulatory framework. Crypto has many economic benefits, the SAPM said and warned: “Not regulating crypto poses a major risk.”
Globally, the rate of crypto usage for illicit activities is 0.024% while the rate of cash for such activities is 2% to 4%, he added.
Similarly, the use of cryptocurrency in money laundering was significantly lower than that of cash, the PM’s aide said. He maintained that there was a significant gap between policymakers and tech-savvy youth.
He further said that by regulating cryptocurrency, the government could also move towards AI data centres.
“We are not spending money to buy bitcoins; instead, we will utilise bitcoins seized by the government,” he added. The PM’s aide said that they would introduce a “Bitcoin National Wallet” and put the seized Bitcoins in it.
People wanted to support Pakistan, he said, adding: “Donations from across the world will come into the wallet.” Bitcoin mining in the country would be conducted through a public-private partnership, Saqib said, noting that the government’s share of Bitcoins earned would be credited to the same wallet.
Speaking on the occasion, the PM’s aide said that at least six countries contacted the government in this regard. “We want to convert expenses into assets,” Saqib stated.
Bitcoin mining is taking place in Ethiopia, Bhutan, and the United States, he said.
The PM’s aide that the government would only provide electricity to the investors, adding that the government had not set any price for electricity used in Bitcoin mining.
“How this partnership moves forward will be decided on a case-by-case basis,” he added.

Iran warns of retaliation if Europeans ‘exploit’ UN nuclear report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317709-iran-warns-of-retaliation-if-europeans-exploit-un-nuclear-report,"TEHRAN: Iran on Sunday warned it would retaliate if European powers that have threatened to reimpose nuclear sanctions “exploit” a UN report showing Tehran has stepped up production of highly enriched uranium.
The report by the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had sharply increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to up to 60 percent, close to the roughly 90 percent level needed for atomic weapons.
Iran’s total amount of enriched uranium now exceeds 45 times the limit authorised by a landmark 2015 agreement with world powers, and is estimated at 9,247.6 kilograms, according to the confidential IAEA report seen by AFP.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a statement he had told IAEA chief Rafael Grossi in a phone call that “Iran will respond to any inappropriate action by the European parties” to the 2015 agreement, referring to Britain, France and Germany.
The European trio have warned they could reimpose sanctions if they deemed Iran’s nuclear programme a threat to the continent’s security.
Araghchi urged Grossi in their Saturday call to stop “parties from exploiting” the nuclear watchdog report “to advance their political objectives,” according to the statement.
The IAEA Board of Governors is set to review Iran’s nuclear activities in its upcoming quarterly meeting in Vienna starting June 9.
Iran rejected the IAEA report, the latest move in years-long efforts to restrict its nuclear activities over fears that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.
The Islamic republic has denied seeking nuclear arms and says it needs the uranium for civilian power production.
The report was leaked as Iran and the United States have been engaged in negotiations towards a new nuclear deal, after Washington had unilaterally abandoned the agreement between Tehran and world powers in 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Araghchi said on Saturday that he had received “elements” of a US proposal for a potential nuclear deal following five rounds of talks mediated by Oman.
Iran would respond “in line with the principles, national interests and rights” of its people, Araghchi added in a post on X.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the United States “has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime, and it’s in their best interest to accept it,” the New York Times reported.
The proposal was described as a series of bullet points rather than a full draft, according to the New York Times, citing officials familiar with the diplomatic exchanges.
It calls on Iran to stop all enrichment of uranium and proposes creating a regional grouping to produce nuclear power, which would include Iran, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states, as well as the United States.
Trump adopted a “maximum pressure” policy against Tehran after withdrawing from the 2015 agreement and reimposed sweeping sanctions which the deal had lifted in return for UN-monitored restrictions on Iran’s nuclear activities.
Iran has ramped up its nuclear activities since the collapse of the deal, and is now enriching uranium to 60 percent -- far above the deal’s 3.67 percent cap but below the 90 percent needed for weapons-grade material.
The 2015 deal provides for the possibility of UN sanctions being reimposed through a mechanism called “snapback” if Iran fails to fulfil its commitments, an option that expires in October.

"‘I am not taking drugs’, Musk denies damning report",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317710-i-am-not-taking-drugs-musk-denies-damning-report,"WASHINGTON: Elon Musk denied a report that he used ketamine and other drugs extensively last year on the 2024 campaign trail.
The New York Times reported Friday that the billionaire adviser to President Donald Trump used so much ketamine, a powerful anesthetic, that he developed bladder problems.
The newspaper said the world’s richest person also took ecstasy and mushrooms and traveled with a pill box last year, adding that it was not known whether Musk also took drugs while heading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump took power in January.
In a post Saturday on X, Musk said: “To be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off.”
He added: “I tried ‘prescription’ ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven’t taken it since then.”
Musk first dodged a question about his drug use at a bizarre farewell appearance Friday with Trump in the Oval Office in which the Tesla and SpaceX boss sported a noticeable black eye as he formally ended his role as Trump’s main cost-cutter at DOGE, which fired tens of thousands of civil servants.
News of the injury drew substantial attention as it came right after the Times report on his alleged drug use. The daily recalled erratic behaviour such as Musk giving an enthusiastic Nazi-style salute in January of this year at a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration.
Musk said he got the injury while horsing around with his young son, named X, when he told the child to hit him in the face.
“And he did. Turns out even a five-year-old punching you in the face actually is...” he added, before
tailing off.
Later Friday, when a reporter asked Trump if he was aware of Musk’s “regular drug use,” Trump responded: “I wasn’t.”
“I think Elon is a fantastic guy,” he added.
Musk has previously admitted to taking ketamine, saying he was prescribed it to treat a “negative frame of mind” and suggesting his use of drugs benefited his work.

Thousands of GB students affected as teachers protest continues,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317676-thousands-of-gb-students-affected-as-teachers-protest-continues,"GILGIT: Government schools across Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) remained closed for a seventh consecutive day, as teachers continued their protest over delayed promotions and the non-implementation of pay scale revisions.
On the other hand, the regional government has initiated the verification of academic degrees of all the teachers, directing the School Education Department to complete the process on an individual basis and submit a report.
Led by the Teachers’ Coordination Committee, the protest earlier saw rallies and sit-ins in key districts including Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Nagar, Ghizer.
In Gilgit city, a major sit-in was underway outside the Directorate of Education, paralysing official work and drawing widespread attention.
The teachers are demanding enforcement of promotion orders issued by the Supreme Appellate Court of Gilgit-Baltistan.
While over 300 educators have reportedly been upgraded, protest leaders say hundreds others qualified teachers continue to be denied their due promotions.
“B.Ed holders are entitled to Grade 16, while CT-qualified teachers should be placed in Grade 14,” said a senior member of the coordination committee.
“We have fulfilled all requirements, yet the authorities remain unmoved.” The government’s decision to verify teachers’ degrees has raised eyebrows among protestors, who fear it could be used as a stalling tactic.

"Polio case ‘detected’ in GB’s Diamer, virus genetically linked to Karachi",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317678-polio-case-detected-in-gb-s-diamer-virus-genetically-linked-to-karachi,"GILGIT: A new case of wild poliovirus has been reported from Tangir Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, with preliminary lab analysis linking the virus to a strain previously detected in Karachi’s Liaquatabad area, officials told The News on Saturday.
According to health sources, the affected child is a two-year-old boy who had received oral polio drops but had not completed the full course of routine immunisation, which is essential for full protection against the virus.
Genetic sequencing has indicated that the virus belongs to cluster YB3A4A and bears a 99.45 percent similarity to a strain previously reported in Karachi Central’s Liaquatabad locality (PAK24-ES).
“The child has never travelled outside of his village, which suggests the virus may have been introduced by a carrier passing through the area,” a source familiar with the matter said. When contacted, Gilgit-Baltistan’s Secretary Health Asif Ullah Khan said that the case has not yet been officially confirmed, but a suspected case has indeed been reported. “Further verification and investigation are underway,” he added.
However insiders confirmed that lab test confirmed the child contracted the virus.
Diamer is classified as a high-risk district due to low immunisation coverage in several pockets and regular human mobility through major transit routes. Health officials caution that the risk of onward transmission exists unless immediate containment measures are undertaken and cooperation from local population is fully sought. Officials have raised concerns about possible surveillance gaps in Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) detection and environmental monitoring in the region. To contain potential spread, authorities have recommended a series of urgent measures. These include enhanced AFP surveillance, collection of stool samples from the child’s close contacts, and launching a Rapid Response immunisation round in Diamer and high-risk pockets of adjacent districts.
Special focus is being placed on reaching mobile, nomadic, and transit populations along the Chilas-Babusar and Chilas-Mansehra routes. Transit vaccination teams at key entry points - including Babusar Top, Thor Nullah, Gonar Farm, and the Chilas Bus Stand - are being strengthened. Efforts are also underway to engage local religious leaders and community influencers to build public trust in vaccination campaigns. The suspected polio case, with a viral link to Karachi, underscores the persistent risk of virus importation and highlights the urgency of coordinated action to safeguard Gilgit-Baltistan’s polio-free status.

Consumer confidence affirms improving economic outlook: Aurangzeb,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317680-consumer-confidence-affirms-improving-economic-outlook-aurangzeb,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, has welcomed the findings of the IPSOS Consumer Confidence Survey for the second quarter of 2025, calling it a strong affirmation of the improving economic outlook and public sentiment across Pakistan.
The survey reveals a significant surge in consumer confidence, with 42 percent of Pakistanis now believing the country is heading in the right direction - the highest level recorded in six years. Perceptions of the economy being strong have also reached their most favorable levels since August 2019. Notably, optimism has overtaken pessimism for the first time since consumer confidence tracking began, marking a key psychological shift among the population. The minister noted that this encouraging data reflects the success of the government’s disciplined and targeted macroeconomic strategy implemented over the last 14 months. The stabilisation of key economic indicators - including the containment of inflation, strengthening of the exchange rate, rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves, and improved fiscal discipline - has created a foundation for renewed public trust and economic recovery. He highlighted that consumer confidence in making major purchases and investments has doubled compared to the same period last year. Similarly, confidence in job security is now at its highest since 2019, a sign that labour market conditions are gradually stabilising in response to pro-growth policies and reforms.
The minister further pointed out that this upswing in confidence spans across urban and rural areas, and is particularly evident among youth and women -demonstrating the broad-based nature of the economic turnaround. Senator Aurangzeb reaffirmed that the government remains committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability, accelerating structural reforms, and ensuring that economic growth translates into real and inclusive progress for all the citizens. The findings of the IPSOS survey, he said, are a timely validation of Pakistan’s economic direction and a clear signal that the country is on a steady path towards recovery and resilience.

India-Pakistan hostility on display at Shangri-La meeting,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317682-india-pakistan-hostility-on-display-at-shangri-la-meeting,"SINGAPORE: The Shangri-La Dialogue security meeting in Singapore has long been marked by U.S.-China rivalry but Beijing’s relative retreat at the weekend exposed a new faultline -- tensions between the U.S. and Europe over Asia.
Even as he warned in a speech on Saturday that China posed an “imminent” threat, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth made clear he wanted Europeans to concentrate on European security as they boosted military budgets.
“We would much prefer that the overwhelming balance of European investment be on that continent...so that as we partner there, which we will continue to do, we’re able to use our comparative advantage as an Indo-Pacific nation to support our partners here,” he said.
Hegseth also noted the absence of his Chinese counterpart Dong Jun, as Beijing instead dispatched a low-level team of military scholars to the annual event, which attracts top defence officials, diplomats, spies and arms dealers from across the world.
The other highlight of the event was the presence of high-powered military delegations from India and Pakistan after four days of intense clashes between the nuclear-armed neighbours that were halted by a ceasefire on May 10.
The delegations, in full uniform and bristling with medal and service ribbons, were led by India’s highest ranking military officer and Pakistan’s Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. They pointedly kept out of each other’s way in the corridors and meeting halls of the sprawling Shangri-La hotel.
On engaging in Asia, at least some European nations signalled they would not be swayed by the U.S. exhortations. They insisted they would try to stay in both the Asian and European theatres, noting their deep links and vital trade flows as well as the global nature of conflict.
“It is a good thing we are doing more (in Europe), but what I want to stress is that the security of Europe and the security of the Pacific is very much interlinked,” said Europe’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas.
“If you are worried about China, you should be worried about Russia,” Kallas said, underlining the importance of Chinese assistance to the Russian war effort in Ukraine and Moscow’s deployment of North Korean soldiers.
French President Emmanuel Macron insisted that his nation remains an Indo-Pacific power, alluding to its enduring colonial presence in New Caledonia and French Polynesia and the basing of over 8,000 soldiers across the region.
“We are neither China nor the U.S., we don’t want to depend on either of them,” Macron said at a press conference on Friday, outlining a “third path” coalition between Europe and Asia that avoided having to choose between Beijing and Washington.
“We want to cooperate with both as far as we can, and we can cooperate for growth and prosperity and stability for our people and the world order, and I think this is exactly the same view of a lot of countries and a lot of people of this region,” he said. Beyond the rhetoric, regional military attaches and analysts say the European regional presence - and ambitions - may not be easy to shift.
Military deployments are mapped out over decades rather than months, and both commercial and defence relationships go back decades, some of them only rarely publicly acknowledged.
The visit of a British aircraft carrier to Singapore later this month is part of a programme first mentioned by then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in 2017 to stress British support for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
The carrier visit in part reflects Britain’s commitments under the 54-year-old Five-Power Defence Arrangement that links its military with counterparts in Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand.
British ties with Australia have been bolstered with the recent three-way AUKUS submarine and advanced technology sharing agreement struck with the U.S. -- a move that could see British submarines visiting Western Australia.
Singapore meanwhile keeps 200 personnel in France operating 12 of its light combat aircraft while Britain also has a jungle training camp and helicopters in Brunei and a 1,200-strong Gurkha battalion, according to International Institute of Strategic Studies data.
A report last month by the London-based IISS highlighted European defence firms’ long-standing and expanding defence ties to Asia, even in the face of competition, particularly from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as regional budgets rise.
“European companies, including Airbus, Damen, Naval Group and Thales, have a long-standing presence in Southeast Asia, and other European actors have established themselves in the market in the last decade, including Italy’s Fincantieri and Sweden’s Saab,” the IISS study said.
Saab is close to securing a deal with U.S. ally Thailand to supply its Gripen fighters, beating out Lockheed Martin’s F-16s. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has reported that Asian defence spending rose 46% in the decade to 2024, reaching $629 billion.
For Finnish officials at least, Hegseth’s remarks resonated - it is Moscow rather than the Indo-Pacific that looms large for Helsinki given the country’s long Russian border.
“When Europe’s defence is in a good shape, then you will have resources to do something more,” Finnish Defence Minister Antti Hakkanen told Reuters.
“But now all the European countries must do their main focus on European defence so that the United States can do a bigger share in the Indo-Pacific area,” Hakkanen said.

"Fazl rejects child marriage bill, announces protest across country",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317683-fazl-rejects-child-marriage-bill-announces-protest-across-country,"PESHAWAR: Rejecting the Child Marriage Restraint Bill, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUIF) chief Maulana Fazlur Rahman on Sunday said that ease was being created for the promotion of adultery in the country, while the process of nikah was being made difficult under the pretext of so-called legislation.
“There is no restriction of age for marriage in Islam. The only restriction is the attainment of puberty, which may occur at the age of 10, 12 or 14,” he said while addressing a news conference here.
He claimed that deliberate efforts were being made to erode the Islamic identity of the country. Previous legislation, he said, had been attributed to pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).
The recent legislation aimed at prohibiting the marriage of individuals under 18 was also based on certain sections of the UN Charter, he alleged. “It means that the country is still not free and remains under the clutches of a neo-colonial system,” he added.
The Maulana said that the so-called legislation was against the spirit of the teachings of the Holy Quran and Sunnah and constituted a blatant violation of the basic principles of the Constitution, which clearly stated that no law shall be enacted that was repugnant to the Holy Quran and Sunnah. He added that due to the flawed policies of the rulers, the country was not only losing its Islamic identity but also its democratic character. This, he argued, strengthened the narrative of militant organisations that believed that the parliament had failed to deliver.
“It is strange that anti-Islam legislation is being passed in an Islamic republic,” he remarked. He recalled that a similar attempt had been made during the Musharraf regime to promote adultery in the name of women’s rights.
The current law, too, he claimed, would make the process of nikah more difficult, which would ultimately lead to an increase in adultery.
The Maulana said that the Council of Islamic Ideology and religious scholars from all schools of thought had rejected the legislation as contrary to Islamic teachings, the Holy Quran and the Sunnah.
He declared that the JUIF rejected the law and would launch a massive protest campaign against it across the country. The first major political gathering in this regard would be held in Hazara Division on June 29, he announced.
Maulana Fazlur Rahman also criticized the rising number of mega-corruption scandals in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the prolonged PTI government. He said corruption in the province could not be eradicated unless the JUIF came to power.
He alleged that the establishment had launched a smear campaign against the JUIF, but not a single FIR had been registered against any party leader. “Had there been any truth in the accusations, we would have been in prison,” he said.
He further stated that he had never claimed 100 percent control over corruption during the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) government, but corrupt practices had certainly been curtailed and condemned at all forums.
“Now, under the current PTI setup, massive corruption is happening openly,” he alleged.
Referring to recent revelations, he said the Speaker of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, who belongs to the ruling party, had disclosed that the embezzled funds amounted to over Rs200 billion not just Rs40 billion.
He called for a judicial probe into the corruption scandals. “The government claims that Rs20 billion out of the Rs40 billion has been recovered,” he noted.
He ridiculed the Pakistan People’s Party’s protest against corruption, saying they seemed to be protesting because their own “record” had been broken.
Speaking on regional developments, the Maulana said that after the recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan, the regional dynamics had changed. China, he said, was rapidly emerging as a regional power and the region could be plunged into chaos due to the “insane decisions” of Indian rulers.
He said that they had long suggested strengthening ties within Asia rather than relying on Europe, but the ‘stupidity’ of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had pushed the region towards war. He urged the Indian people to think about the policies of Modi administration.
He also stressed the need for improved relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which he described as the most urgent need of the hour. He welcomed the Afghan government’s decision for asking militant groups to refrain from staging attacks in Pakistan.

Silence fuels sleaze — let’s speak out!,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317687-silence-fuels-sleaze-let-s-speak-out,"Islamabad:When a society  treats right and wrong, lawful and unlawful, good and bad with indifference, it paradoxically elevates corrupt, notorious, and dishonest individuals in its esteem. This dynamic extends to institutions where bribery flourishes unchecked; leadership is often reluctant to acknowledge the presence of corruption within their ranks. Such denial from the top, however, inadvertently emboldens the very elements undermining the institution’s integrity. Opportunities for subordinates involve in corrupt practices for example
The insidious entanglement of law enforcement with the criminal underworld reaches its zenith when officers themselves become integral cogs in the machinery of illicit enterprise. Bankrolled by the considerable wealth of criminal syndicates, these compromised guardians of order often exhibit a chilling pattern. Numerous instances reveal Station House Officers (SHOs) effectively transplanting their patronage of criminal magnates - encompassing the operators of brothel houses, drug trafficking hubs, and gambling dens - upon their transfer to new jurisdictions. This migration of allegiance ensures the continuity of protection, a shield forged from the very authority they wielded. This protection, in turn, empowers these criminal entities to liberally employ bribery, greasing the palms of other officers to turn a blind eye, leak crucial intelligence, or even actively participate in their nefarious schemes. The spectrum of this corruption ranges from petty inducements to substantial payoffs, all meticulously designed to ensure the uninterrupted flow of illegal operations.
Furthermore, this unholy alliance can, at times, manifest as a perverse symbiosis. Criminal gangs might furnish the police with intelligence regarding rival factions, a transactional offering in exchange for protection or a more lenient application of the law. In the darkest corners of this corruption, officers might directly benefit from the proceeds of illegal activities, cynically using these criminal networks as instruments for personal enrichment. This blurring of lines, where the protectors become complicit, if not active participants, in the crimes they are sworn to combat, represents a profound betrayal of public trust and a dangerous erosion of the very foundations of a just society.
Public perception overwhelmingly suggests that the registration of any case necessitates either bribery or significant influence. Indeed, in such environments, a bribe can often supersede even formal recommendations, allowing an individual to have a case registered with full procedure, regardless of its legitimacy.
Those with experience in police stations and courts frequently assert that corruption is deeply entrenched in our society, with bribery having effectively become a de facto prerequisite for many processes. Consequently, the common citizen has resigned themselves to the grim reality that even legitimate and lawful endeavours often require the payment of illicit sums.”
“Constrained by limited resources and manpower, the “Top Cop” often find their efforts to minimize crime seemingly futile. In such circumstances, authorities sometimes resort to a deceptive tactic: achieving crime control on paper by deliberately underreporting incidents. This creates a dangerous illusion of reduced crime, sharply contrasting with the public’s lived reality of its increase and the often-inadequate police response. This environment, where integrity wanes, fosters bribery within police stations, birthing the corrosive “Thana Culture.”
Recently, in the near past, a “Top Cop” introduced a novel method to simultaneously project crime control and appease the public: the “Front Desk.” This system mandated that all case reports pass through a designated officer. Complainants received a formal-looking receipt, presented as a preliminary step towards an FIR. However, this document was often a mere acknowledgment, neither recorded in daily logs nor used to initiate a formal FIR. This omission allowed crimes to remain off the books, perpetuating the statistical illusion of control while the community grappled with the unacknowledged reality.
This mirrors a broader societal issue where the lines between right and wrong blur, paradoxically elevating the corrupt. In institutions plagued by unchecked officials involved in corruption, the bosses often deny the problem, inadvertently empowering the corrupt elements. Public perception widely holds that case registration hinges on bribery or influence, often outweighing legitimate processes. For many, bribery has become a de facto requirement, leading to a grim acceptance that even lawful endeavours necessitate illicit payments.
It is the usual practice of the corruption departments that while accepting bribes, they portray themselves as helpless, claiming that the bribe is distributed from the bottom all the way to the top. People generally believe this narrative because, regardless of rank, the distribution of bribes does not hinder anyone’s work. A deeply concerning and, sadly, often acknowledged reality. If a nexus exists where gangsters are “feeding the police, FIA and other public dealing departments from top to bottom,” it represents a fundamental breakdown of law enforcement’s core mandate. Rebuilding trust and establishing genuine peace in such a scenario requires a systemic and multi-faceted strategy from police authorities. But, probably, the situation is beyond recovery.
The corruption grows in the police station level, is from Investigation Officers (IOs), Moharrars and Naib Moharrars who are so influential and believed to be un-transferable and irremovable from his post and often stick to his seat for unmeasurable time.

World Bicycle Day observed in Islamabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317689-world-bicycle-day-observed-in-islamabad,"ISLAMABAD: The World Bicycle Day (WBD) has been observed here Sunday through a bicycle rally for the promotion of health and sustainability that was organized jointly by Turkmenistan Embassy and Serena hotel.
They organized a vibrant and inclusive WBD Rally to promote health benefits of cycling and its positive impact on the environment. This marks the third consecutive year of this collaboration, underscoring a shared commitment to sustainability and community well-being.
The cyclists from all walks of life including diplomats, civil society members, corporate professionals, families, and youth gathered at D-Chowk for an early evening rally and cycled to Islamabad Serena Hotel embodying the spirit of unity and purpose behind the global observance.
The event was organized as part of Serena Hotels’ Sports Diplomacy initiative, which uses sports as a bridge to bring communities together and inspire healthy lifestyles. This platform has championed numerous inclusive programs, including free golf training camps and tennis clinics for young girls, blind cricket, squash, polo, and winter sports.
Speaking on the occasion, CEO Serena Aziz Boolani, emphasized the significance of cycling in modern urban life: “Cycling is more than just a mode of transport; it is a path toward personal well-being and a greener planet. Through this rally and many other initiatives under our sports diplomacy program, we aim to create inclusive opportunities for people of all backgrounds to engage, grow, and thrive.”
Additional Foreign Secretary Syed Ali Asad Gillani was the chief guest on the occasion. His remarks highlighted the value of collaborative diplomacy in promoting regional peace and environmental sustainability.

Apparel sector calls for PM’s urgent intervention on tariff barriers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317691-apparel-sector-calls-for-pm-s-urgent-intervention-on-tariff-barriers,"LAHORE: The Apparel sector, which contributes over $9 billion in export revenue, has warned that the country’s value-added textile industry faces serious setbacks due to continued tariff barriers and restrictive policies that are obstructing supply chains.
In a joint letter to the Prime Minister seeking timely intervening, the Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) and the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers & Exporters Association (PHMA) stated that the global buyers now demand certified, high-performance materials that are simply not available in Pakistan. Yet, import of such essential raw materials remains hindered by duties and outdated regulations.
PRGMEA Regional Chairman Dr. Ayyazuddin and PHMA Zonal Chairman Abdul Hameed jointly sought a direct and an immediate meeting with the prime minister ahead of the budget, warning that without urgent intervention, Pakistan could lose out on the global shift in sourcing patterns that has opened fresh opportunities for new exporters.
They emphasised that Pakistan still relies heavily on cotton-based exports — primarily denim and fleece — while nearly 80 percent of global apparel trade has moved towards synthetic and functional textiles. “We cannot expand or diversify if we don’t have access to the right raw materials,” the letter stated.
“We are being penalised for importing items that aren’t even produced locally.”
It was pointed out that man-made fibres, technical yarns, performance fabrics, and critical trims -- many categorised under HS Chapters 54, 55, and 96 — are subject to duties despite not being manufactured in the country. “Keeping tariffs on non-available raw materials is equivalent to taxing exports before they even happen,” it added.
Former PRGMEA chairmen Ijaz Khokhar and Sajid Saleem Minhas backing the joint demand highlighted that SMEs are particularly vulnerable due to rigid policies and lack of flexibility in global compliance. “We’ve sent a detailed letter to the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and commerce ministry outlining how certain recent policy changes, like the shortening of the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) input period from 60 to just 9 months, are unrealistic for the apparel sector,” Khokar said.
PRGMEA ex-chairmen Ijaz Khokhar added that the letter, addressed to the PM as well as the Commerce Minister Jam Kamal, strongly criticises the abrupt shift in EFS timelines. He argued that value-added exporters often operate under just-in-time and never-out-of-stock business models, requiring longer input cycles to fulfill diverse orders. He said that the current restrictions will disrupt operations and increase compliance burdens for exporters.
Sajid Saleem Minhas said that the local spinning industry has not evolved to meet the requirements of today’s global fashion market. “Since we don’t produce the materials our buyers demand, we should at least allow their duty-free import. Otherwise, we are locking ourselves out of high-growth product categories,” he said.
The PRGMEA and PHMA members also called for restoration of the Final Tax Regime (FTR) for exporters, stating that the shift to the Normal Tax Regime has led to complex audits and disrupted business continuity. “We need simplicity and certainty, not additional paperwork and scrutiny,” the statement noted.
Khokhar also raised concern over the lack of government push on trade diplomacy, particularly with the United States, where Pakistani textiles face an average import tariff of 29 percent, compared to lower rates for competitors such as Bangladesh and Vietnam.
The letter suggests Pakistan negotiate preferential terms or targeted tariff relief with the U.S., especially for eco-friendly and sustainable products that align with global ESG compliance. Refund delays were also highlighted as a chronic problem. Exporters are facing severe liquidity shortages due to delayed disbursement of DLTL, DDT, sales tax, and withholding tax refunds. The industry has requested an automated and time-bound mechanism for refund processing to ease working capital constraints.
Additionally, both associations emphasised the need for a strong national marketing campaign for “Made in Pakistan” garments. They urged the Ministry of Commerce to initiate global trade outreach through embassies, digital platforms, and targeted B2B events to increase visibility and improve brand image.
He said that this sector has the potential to double its exports in five years and added that “we need the government to first remove these structural roadblocks”.
Sajid Minhas said that Pakistan’s value-added textile sector is one of the largest employers and a key contributor to national exports. The country cannot afford to lose this opportunity. “We request the prime minister to meet us urgently and help align policy with global market realities.”

"Gilani, Turkmenistan president discuss collaboration in diverse sectors",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317692-gilani-turkmenistan-president-discuss-collaboration-in-diverse-sectors,"ISLAMABAD: Chairman Senate Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani called on President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedow on Sunday and exchanged views on matters of mutual interests, besides collaboration in diverse sectors.
Gilani is on an official visit to Turkmenistan along with a delegation of senators.
According to the Senate Secretariat, Gilani was warmly welcomed by the Turkmenistan president while reciprocating best wishes to the leaders of Pakistan. Expressing confidence that the visit of the Senate chairman will be successful, Berdimuhamedow said it will stimulate the development of parliamentary relations between the two friendly countries.
Both sides agreed that bilateral relations were being successfully carried out in political, diplomatic, trade and economic, energy, transport, education, and humanitarian sectors, and the two countries consistently support international relations.
The Turkmenistan president said: “According to a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the year 2025 has been declared the ‘Year of Peace and Trust’ on the initiative of Turkmenistan, and it coincides with the 30th anniversary of our neutrality role.”
He explained that a number of events have been planned in this regard and parliamentarians can participate in these activities.
Berdimuhamedow said Turkmenistan attaches great importance to the development of parliamentary relations between the two countries.
“Today, parliamentary relations help strengthen effective cooperation between countries. Parliamentary dialogue is an important part of the development of relations between the two countries. The parliamentary friendship group, which operates on a bilateral basis, provides opportunities for the exchange of experience in legislative work and the development of parliamentary diplomacy,” he noted.
Talking to the media, Gilani termed his meeting with Berdimuhamedov successful and fruitful, adding: “I conveyed best wishes to the Turkmenistan president from President Asif Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif”.
To a question, the Senate chairman said the activation of bilateral relations and further development were discussed while the importance of bilateral visits and the agreements reached were also emphasised.
He said the discussion with Berdimuhamedov also focused on development of several areas as they exchanged ideas on several implemented and planned projects. He observed that Turkmenistan’s policy of neutrality was highly valued for being an important tool for strengthening peace in the region.
“This year marks the 30th anniversary of the independence of Turkmenistan,” he said, adding: “Relations between Turkmenistan and Pakistan have become more active.”

Apolitical AIIB a partnership for inclusive development,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317693-apolitical-aiib-a-partnership-for-inclusive-development,"The world has witnessed two major changes or tremors over the past year. First, President Trump generated shockwaves by announcing an all-out trade war. This has shaken the global economy, which was already facing serious problems, including debt, slow growth, climate change, and inequality. Second, the USA relentlessly pursued the Gulf Plan to revive and strengthen its economy. President Trump made his first trip to the Gulf countries to convince them to approve the Gulf-Plan. This marks a significant event in the modern economic and diplomatic history. The US, once the architect and financier of the Marshall Plan, was seeking investments and plans from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE. This implies that traditional sources of investment have been exhausted, and the world is looking for alternative sources of funding. In this context, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has gained immense importance over the last few years. It is a relatively young multilateral financial and development institution, yet it has established a strong presence due to its clear vision, well-defined goals, and effective performance.
The AIIB is an alternative investment avenue proposed by President Xi in 2013 and launched in 2014. The AIIB was established with the vision of assisting Asia in building a prosperous future by “Building Infrastructure for Tomorrow,” adopting principles of sustainability, innovation, and prosperity for its people. The organization has undertaken numerous initiatives to achieve these objectives, including its Sustainable Cities Strategy and Sustainable Energy for Tomorrow, among others. AIIB is also helping countries explore innovative solutions and technology for building future infrastructure, which can generate economic activity and enhance connectivity by adhering to the principles of sustainable development.
Since its launch, China, under President Xi’s leadership, has ensured that the AIIB develops into a modern, innovative, inclusive, goal-oriented, and rule-based institution. President Xi envisioned that the AIIB must discourage geopolitics, a my-interest-first mentality, and mainstream economic rationales, while prioritizing sustainability principles. The AIIB must focus on bridging the investment gap, as Asia is facing a growing investment deficit exacerbated by climate change. Consequently, the global community, particularly developing and least developed countries, views the AIIB as a fair, inclusive, and timely initiative that can help them meet their investment requirements.
The analysis of past years indicates that from the outset, the AIIB has been committed to the prescribed vision and goals, working to bridge the investment gap and meet the needs of its member countries. It is continuously expanding its efforts across multiple sectors by providing funding to governments and private entities. The list of projects is extensive and diverse. It has financed 317 projects and programs, with many more currently under approval. As of 2024, it has disbursed US$60.59 billion for various interventions worldwide. Additionally, the AIIB is focused on building the capacity of its members to access funds, having extended US$30.14 million for project preparations.
The AIIB also contributed to the fight against COVID-19. It established a Crisis Recovery Facility to expedite the funding process. Originally, it decided to provide US$13 billion by 2022. However, due to demand, the availability of funds was later increased to US$20 billion. A special window was created for supporting productive expenditures in the fight against COVID-19. It was deemed necessary to build resilience and promote economic activities. Data suggest that, as of December 2023, the AIIB has approved 68 projects totaling US$18.48 billion. There was a special focus on the needs of developing and low-income countries, which account for 65% of the total disbursement of the approved projects.
Simultaneously, the AIIB has remained focused on the future needs of the planet and infrastructure. It promoted infrastructure that aligns with the requirements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
At the same time, AIIB is working to establish partnerships with multilateral institutions and organizations, including the World Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the New Development Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the African Development Bank, the Development Bank of Latin America, the United Nations (UN), the G-20, China Exim Bank, China International Development Cooperation Agency, IFAD, and others.
However, AIIB remained committed to President Xi’s vision of being an apolitical organization that operates independently. This commitment is evident in its decision-making process and how it disburses funds. For instance, India is the largest borrower from AIIB, having borrowed approximately US$9.7 billion as of 2024. Additionally, AIIB has committed US$2 billion to the Philippines. This funding occurs despite the ongoing border conflict between China and India, and the Philippines has also developed significant differences with China.
These factors have contributed to the growth and expansion of the AIIB. It began with a few members, and as of 2024, the AIIB has 110 members (42 in Asia, 26 in Europe, 22 in Africa, 10 in Oceania, 8 in South America, and 2 in North America). The AIIB initially focused on Asia and the Pacific, but its commitment to development and inclusiveness has allowed it to extend its work to other continents. The AIIB is also active in Africa and Latin America, with a US$100 million project in Brazil, among others. It has also invested in Sub-Saharan Africa. The AIIB concentrates explicitly on projects that enhance regional connectivity, such as the joint ASEAN 3-year program aimed at improving connectivity within ASEAN.
Based on the above discussion, we can draw two conclusions. First, the AIIB is working to bridge the investment gap by adhering to the principles of sustainable production and consumption, creating opportunities for livelihoods and wealth generation, and enhancing connectivity through the development of eco-friendly infrastructure. Second, it aims to bring new vigor to regional cooperation, promote the idea of partnership, and achieve win-win cooperation by building partnerships with other multilateral, regional, and bilateral institutions.
However, many experts believe that the AIIB was created to address the exploitative attitudes and influence of Western countries and institutions, such as the IMF and the World Bank.  Because the West openly dictated these institutions to enforce its policies and compel nations to comply. The Global South grew weary of this system and called for reforms to these institutions, advocating for voting rights to be re-calculated according to the agreed-upon formula: a weighted average of GDP (.5), openness (.3), economic variability (.15), and international reserves (.05). The West delayed necessary reforms at the IMF, World Bank, and other Western-dominated institutions, instead of allowing legitimate involvement and roles in managing these organizations. China, as an emerging power and a leading voice in the Global South, has repeatedly urged the West to listen to the concerns of the Global South and undertake urgent reform of these institutions to address challenges, but to no avail. Thus, rather than engage in conflict with the West, China chose a peaceful alternative and established the AIIB.
In conclusion, the AIIB is the first non-Western institution that is free from the influence of Western countries and systems. It is free from political interference and promotes the rule of law. It also indicates the emergence of a new China, which is ready to play a leading and influential role on the global level.  It further demonstrates China’s dedication to realizing the dream of a shared future and prosperity for all.

Punjab govt sheds light on civil service pension reforms,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317694-punjab-govt-sheds-light-on-civil-service-pension-reforms,"LAHORE: The Punjab government has issued a province-wide clarification on the implementation of its revised pension rules for civil servants, aiming to address administrative confusion and ensure uniform enforcement following the notification of major policy changes last year.
The directive from Finance Secretary Mujahid Sherdill available with The News has been sent to all major administrative offices, including the Additional Chief Secretary South Punjab, provincial secretaries, commissioners, deputy commissioners, heads of attached departments, the Registrar of the Lahore High Court, district and sessions judges, Punjab Public Service Commission, and other institutions concerned.
According to the directive, the amended pension rules will only apply to government servants who either retire or pass away on or after December 2, 2024. The pensioners who retired or died prior to this cut-off date will continue to receive pension benefits under the previous rules. This distinction has been introduced to protect the entitlements of existing pensioners while establishing a clear and consistent framework for future cases.
Among the most consequential changes is the redefinition of family pension eligibility. Under the revised rules, family pension is restricted solely to the spouse of the deceased employee and will be limited to a maximum duration of ten years, or until remarriage in the case of a widow, whichever comes earlier. However, this provision is not retrospective. Spouses of government servants who died prior to December 2, 2024, will continue to receive family pensions under the earlier regulations without time limitations. Additionally, the updated rules eliminate the eligibility of other dependents such as sons, unmarried daughters, widowed or divorced daughters, and unmarried sisters, once the spouse becomes ineligible after the effective date.
The notification further clarifies that the determining factor for the application of the new rules will be the date of entitlement to pension—not the date of submission of the pension case or the issuance of the sanction order. Pensions becoming due after the enforcement date will be governed by the revised regulations, while those entitled before will follow the previous structure. This policy aims to ensure administrative consistency and prevent delays from affecting pension classification.
Another significant amendment relates to the calculation of pensionable salary. Under the new methodology, the average emoluments used to compute pension will be based exclusively on basic pay, including personal pay, as drawn on July 1st of each of the last three financial years preceding retirement. Previously admissible allowances such as Notional Increment, Special Pay, Qualification Pay, Technical Pay, and Senior Post Allowance will no longer be included in the pension base. This change will affect those retiring between December 2, 2024, and July 1, 2025, whose pensionable salary will be computed using pay from July 1, 2022; July 1, 2023; and July 1, 2024.
In addition, the clarification links annual increases in pension to 50 percent of the Adhoc Relief Allowance (ARA) granted during each financial year. If no ARA is sanctioned for a particular year, no pension increase will be granted. The Finance Department has clearly stated that ARAs awarded in previous years—specifically 2011, 2015, 2022, 2023, and 2024—will not be retrospectively applied to individuals retiring under the new regime. This signals a shift in approach, where future pension adjustments are strictly tied to budgetary policy and will no longer be influenced by retrospective entitlements.
The department has also outlined the treatment of civil servants currently in the retirement process. Individuals on Leave Preparatory to Retirement (LPR), those availing encashment of LPR, those serving notice periods for voluntary retirement, or anyone else due to retire on or after December 2, 2024, will be subject to the revised rules in full. This includes changes in the method of calculating gross pension, application of revised reduction factors, and the narrowed criteria for family pension eligibility.
To promote consistency, the government has simplified the application of the age-based reduction factor used in pension calculations. It will now be determined based on the last completed year of age, ignoring additional months or days. For instance, a civil servant aged 58 years and 11 months will be treated as 58 years old, with a four percent reduction factor applied. This simplification is intended to reduce confusion in the implementation process and ensure uniformity across cases.
Lastly, the Finance Department has encouraged all administrative authorities to refer any ambiguous or exceptional cases back to the department for interpretation. The issuance of this clarification is part of the government’s broader reform effort to rationalize pension obligations, improve fiscal planning, and transition to a more predictable, rule-based retirement system for public sector employees.
The updated rules are expected to significantly influence retirement planning for civil servants across Punjab and are seen as a foundational step in modernizing the province’s pension framework in line with long-term financial sustainability goals.

"Karachi faces water, power crises due to conspiracy: Haleem Adil",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317631-karachi-faces-water-power-crises-due-to-conspiracy-haleem-adil,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh on Sunday claimed that a well-orchestrated conspiracy is under way to deprive the residents of Karachi of basic necessities, including water and electricity.
Speaking to the media at the Adil House, Sheikh accused the tanker mafia of exploiting the city’s residents for water. He urged the relevant officials to resign if they cannot resolve these issues.
Highlighting the Karachiites’ electricity woes, he noted that many areas endure up to 15 hours of outages on a daily basis, exacerbating the residents’ plight during the harsh weather. He warned that failure to cease unannounced power load-shedding would spark significant public protests.
He also criticised the city mayor for allegedly neglecting urban issues, especially as Eidul Azha approaches, warning that unpicked garbage can lead to a citywide crisis. He argued that the current representatives lack genuine public support, claiming that their assembly seats were obtained through dishonest means.
Emphasising on the PTI’s political influence, he claimed that the party’s electoral victories in the city were unfairly taken away. He lamented the judiciary’s allegedly weakened state after the passage of the 26th amendment, affecting the PTI’s legal battles.
He concluded by condemning the imprisonment of PTI leaders, including party founder Imran Khan, for their advocacy for national rights. He expressed hope for an end to injustice. Separately, Sheikh expressed sorrow over the death of Prof Iftikhar Ahmed Bhutto, who was killed by a dumper truck in the city. He urged strict measures against unauthorised vehicles and drivers, emphasising the need for accountability to prevent further tragedies. He offered his condolences to the bereaved family.

Prime suspect in Hussainabad food rider killing case surrenders to police,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317632-prime-suspect-in-hussainabad-food-rider-killing-case-surrenders-to-police,"In a significant development, the prime suspect in the murder case of a young food delivery rider has surrendered to police.
The victim, Haris, was shot in Hussainabad two days ago. According to police, the suspect, Dilawar, was directly responsible for the gunshot that fatally wounded the victim. Investigations revealed that the weapon used in the incident was unlicensed.
Police stated that four of Dilawar's friends were previously arrested in connection with the case. These individuals initially misled the authorities by falsely claiming that the incident occurred during a robbery attempt.
In a video statement recorded after his surrender, Dilawar admitted his role in the shooting. “Haris was my childhood friend,” he said emotionally. “He used to visit my cattle pen regularly.”
Dilawar claimed that the shooting was accidental. “I didn’t know the pistol was loaded. I had no idea it would go off,” he said, adding that he personally took Haris to the hospital and even registered the case under his own name.
The case remains under investigation as police continue to gather evidence and verify the claims made by the suspect during interrogation. According to media reports, Haris had come to Hussainabad to deliver food when Dilawar, acting like a street thug, used his weapon to intimidate him. He forced Haris to do physical punishments at gunpoint. When Haris tried to de-escalate the situation and apologised, Dilawar opened fire.

Three sacrificial animals stolen from house at gunpoint,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317633-three-sacrificial-animals-stolen-from-house-at-gunpoint,"With Eidul Azha just around the corner, cattle thefts have surged in the city, raising concerns among residents. In a brazen robbery in New Karachi’s Godhra area, unidentified men broke into a house, held a resident hostage at gunpoint, then escaped with livestock worth millions of rupees.
The incident’s CCTV camera footage shows the suspects arriving on motorbikes and in a pickup truck. It also shows them trying to load three large animals onto the truck, but due to limited space, they managed to flee with only two large animals and a calf.
Police have registered a case and launched an investigation. They are also carrying out raids in different parts of the city to trace the whereabouts of the suspects. The city’s residents have expressed frustration over the rise in cattle thefts, especially as Eidul Azha, a time when many keep sacrificial animals at home, approaches. They have urged the authorities to increase patrolling and provide protection to livestock owners.
A couple of days ago, unidentified suspects had snatched three sacrificial sheep from a rickshaw driver in Ayesha Manzil. The rickshaw and the snatched sheep are yet to be recovered.

SHC sets aside CAA’s vacancy advertisement for four joint directors,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317635-shc-sets-aside-caa-s-vacancy-advertisement-for-four-joint-directors,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has set aside the Civil Aviation Authority’s (CAA) advertisement for the appointment of four air transport & economic regulations (AT&ER) joint directors, ordering the CAA to first try to fill the vacancies from within the organisation, as envisaged in its service regulations.
Mohammad Suleman Ghouri and other petitioners had challenged the selection process initiated by the CAA to fill four positions of AT&ER joint director. Their counsel said his clients are working at executive grade-4 as senior deputy directors in the CAA’s AT&ER directorate, and in the next few months they would be eligible to be considered for their promotion to EG-5.
He said that the same post has been advertised on a three-year-contract basis in the impugned advertisement, reducing the eligibility criterion — in particular, the length of service — to five years from 12 years, as mentioned in the service regulations, only to accommodate their favourites.
He also said if the available vacancies at EG-5 as AT&ER joint directors are filled through the impugned advertisement, it is bound to jeopardise the career of his clients. The additional attorney general questioned the petition’s maintainability, saying that it is an executive decision and policy matter to issue such advertisements for selecting the best candidates.
Secondly, he continued, since the CAA’s service rules/regulations are non-statutory, the petitioners cannot, directly or indirectly, agitate any grievance relating to their employment through the present petition.
After hearing the arguments, an SHC division bench headed by Justice Mohammad Faisal Kamal Alam said that any organisation, even a state institution, cannot viably deliver results as required of them if their employees or team members become disenchanted and disengaged due to unreasonable, arbitrary and discriminatory policies adopted by those at the helm of affairs.
The court said that the total length of service required to fill the subject post of AT&ER joint director, as per the regulations, is 12 years, while in the impugned advertisement this crucial criterion has been reduced to five years.
The bench said that the names and credentials of the short-listed candidates are also mentioned in the compliance report and have been perused, and except one candidate, who has an educational background and experience in aviation, none of the candidates possesses a level of academic qualification or practical experience that can justify the CAA’s stance.
The court said that the CAA’s stance about short-listing candidates in pursuance of the impugned advertisement is in violation of the prescribed service regulations and cannot be endorsed.
The bench said that there is another aspect of the matter, which is the timing of the advertisement, which has been published around six months before the petitioners are poised to complete the 12-year threshold of service, one of the prerequisites for consideration for the AT&ER joint director post.
The court said that this last-minute rush to reduce the available slots before all the petitioners qualify appears oddly hastened on the part of the CAA, as the vacancy for the posts has not been articulated by the CAA’s counsel to be closed as a matter of national emergency, notwithstanding that the modus operandi as an objective and inclusive recruitment design process does not appear to meet such goals.
The bench granted the petition to the extent that the subject AT&ER posts cannot be filled through the impugned advertisement by circumventing and violating the prescribed eligibility criteria of the service regulations.
Thus, said the SHC, to the extent of the subject posts, the decision and steps taken so far by the CAA are illegal and are, therefore, being set aside.
The court directed the CAA to first try to fill the vacancies from within the organisation, as envisaged in its service regulations. The bench said the order is not a bar on the prerogative of the competent authority and management of the CAA to appoint the best of the best candidates from different channels through a legitimate selection process, but within the frame of the governing law, the CAA’s rules and service regulations.

Nasir Abbas Nayyar explains how Urdu novels have global presence,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317636-nasir-abbas-nayyar-explains-how-urdu-novels-have-global-presence,"The Arts Council of Pakistan Karachi (ACP) recently organised a lecture by literary critic Dr Nasir Abbas Nayyar titled “Absence of Urdu Novel in Global Context: Fact or Fiction?” at the Haseena Moin Hall.
The session was presided over by veteran poet Zehra Nigah. In her presidential address, she remarked that Dr Nayyar’s talk reminded her of Qurratulain Hyder and the unforgettable novel Aangan by Khadija Mastoor. She credited ACP President Ahmed Shah for transforming the ACP into a hub where intellectual and literary discussions continued.
During his lecture, Dr Nayyar challenged the prevailing notion that Urdu novels were confined to the Urdu-speaking world and lack global presence. He emphasised that this belief stemmed from a limited understanding of three key concepts: presence, global context and the Urdu novel itself. According to him, “presence” must be both material and experiential — a text must not only exist but also contribute to and shape the dialogic space of consciousness.
He argued that the so-called global context was largely shaped by Euro-American ideologies. The universality propagated during the colonial era was built on European philosophies and institutional structures, and continued in new forms today, he said.
He pointed out the ideological nature of global recognition by referencing major literary awards. The Booker Prize, for instance, originally recognised writers from Commonwealth countries, Ireland and Zimbabwe. Although eligibility was broadened in 2014, it remained limited to English-language works published in the UK or Ireland.
Similarly, the Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded 121 times, had recognized only 25 to 30 non-Western writers, with Asian authors being the least represented. Quoting the Booker website, “It is the prize that transforms the winner’s career,” Dr Nayyar noted that these awards conferred not just honour but widespread popularity. In contrast, South Asian literature remained underrepresented in global discourse, even when taught in select institutions across Germany, France, the UK, Turkiye, Egypt and Iran.
Dr Nayyar cited the rare acknowledgement of Qurratulain Hyder by 2008 Nobel Laureate Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio. He mentioned a curated list of 615 greatest books of the world that included Toba Tek Singh by Saadat Hasan Manto, Basti by Intizar Hussain, and Aag Ka Darya by Qurratulain Hyder — highlighting that some Urdu works had indeed gained recognition, albeit sparsely.

PDP chairman calls for making Karachi liveable city,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317639-pdp-chairman-calls-for-making-karachi-liveable-city,"Pasban Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman Altaf Shakoor on Sunday stressed an urgent need for transforming Karachi into a modern and efficient megacity.
In a statement, he lamented the current status of the city as one of the least developed major urban centres globally. He articulated the longstanding aspirations of Karachi’s residents for a liveable city stressing the necessity for an efficient urban environment that provided a high quality of life and opportunities of growth for its inhabitants.
The PDP chairman pointed out the city’s congestion and poor housing conditions, and advocated for affordable and high-quality housing solutions to accommodate people belonging to varying income levels.
Shakoor also called for a reliable public transportation system with the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) at its core to alleviate road congestion and reduce pollution. He also addressed the scarcity of parks and green spaces in the city underscoring the importance of recreational areas.
He called for improved safety standards and effective law enforcement. Shakoor mentioned the need for better health care and education facilities along with a robust economy to tackle the city’s joblessness. He urged the government to support small businesses and the maritime sector to create more employment opportunities.
Highlighting perpetual issues like water shortages and power loadshedding, he demanded that the federal and provincial governments prioritise these essential services and allocate sufficient funds in the upcoming budget to enhance Karachi’s infrastructure. He was of the view that modern megacities must be self-sustainable and effectively managed through transparent governance by elected representatives.

KWSC chairman wants uninterrupted water supply during Eid,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317640-kwsc-chairman-wants-uninterrupted-water-supply-during-eid,"In preparation for Eidul Azha, the chief executive officer of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), Ahmed Ali Siddiqui, has directed comprehensive arrangements to ensure uninterrupted water supply and efficient sewage management across the city during Eidul Azha.
Acting on directives of Karachi Mayor and KWSC Chairman Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Siddiqui instructed all departments to coordinate closely with district administrations, elected representatives and the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board for timely disposal of animal waste.
Siddiqui issued a strict warning against dumping animal remains into or near manholes, stating that such actions disrupted the sewerage system and caused public inconvenience. He directed that all the complaints related to water and sewerage — particularly around mosques, Eidgahs, Imambargahs and graveyards — must be resolved before Eid.
He said the executive engineers had been assigned the responsibility of ensuring smooth water supply and complete sewage cleanup in their respective areas. Additional instructions issued by the KWSC chairman included maintaining round-the-clock readiness of jetting and suction machines, ensuring driver availability and finalising duty rosters for the Eid holidays.
The hydrants cell was directed to provide free water tankers to social and religious organisations offering public refreshment (sabeel). “Facilitating citizens during Eid is our top priority,” said Siddiqui, adding that negligence in service delivery would not be tolerated.

WCLA to place electricity wires underground on Mall Road,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317575-wcla-to-place-electricity-wires-underground-on-mall-road,"LAHORE:The Walled City of Lahore Authority (WCLA) has embarked on a transformative initiative to enhance the aesthetic appeal and functionality of Mall Road by removing overhead electricity cables and burying them underground.
This project, spanning from State Bank to Hall Road signal, marks a significant milestone as the first-ever initiative of its kind outside the historic walled city area.  Building upon the success of ongoing efforts in areas like Royal Trail and Bhatti Gate, where overhead cables have been systematically replaced with underground infrastructure, this new phase underscores Walled City of Lahore Authority's commitment to preserving Lahore's cultural heritage while modernising its urban landscape.
As per the vision of Dr Asif Tufail, Director General of Walled City of Lahore Authority, removing the overhead cables and placing them underground will not only elevate the visual charm of this iconic route but also bolster safety and the dependability of power supply in the area.
The project is expected to enhance the visual appeal of Mall Road, making it more conducive to tourism, commerce, and daily life for residents.

Career counselling: questions and answers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317576-career-counselling-questions-and-answers,"Q1: Dear Mr Abidi, I have done BBA recently with 3.6 CGPA and I want to do MBA/MS Supply Chain Management. What are some of the best institutes in Pakistan and the UK that I should target?
(Aqib Rana, Mirpur, AJK)
Ans: Dear Aqib, Supply Chain Management is a highly in-demand field of education all over the world. Some top options in Pakistan are LUMS, Imperial College of Business Studies and IBA Karachi. As for abroad, University of Nottingham, Durham University and University of Manchester are my top picks in the UK.
Q2: Dear sir, I am an A Level student (currently in A1) and my subjects are Visual Arts, Computer and Business. What kind of activities do you recommend that can help build my profile for study in top universities in Pakistan such as LUMS and LSE?
(Haris Waleed, Islamabad)
Ans: Dear Haris, your choice of subjects is really commendable and it appears as if you are deeply interested in studying Visual Arts with focus on computation.
As you are aware that summer vacation is an ideal time for gaining new skills, I suggest that you can participate in LUMS Summer School which offers a variety of courses in this discipline. Also, National College of Arts and Institute of Arts and Culture offer variety of short courses in this field. I suggest that you start building your portfolio to streamline things before you start
looking for bachelor’s programs.
Q3: Dear sir, I am a final year student of Doctor of Physical Therapy. I want to know your opinion on whether I should do my master’s right after graduating or should I first gain experience in the field before the master’s?
(Aana Waseem, Lahore)
Ans: Dear Aana, Doctor of Physical/Physio Therapy is a very well-regarded field of study. As important as it is to continue upgrading one’s education is, DPT is a field of study that requires an individual to have hands-on experience. So, it’s only wise to first gain some experience in the field, either by interning at a hospital or by employment. Research shows that universities prefer students for master’s who have prior work experience in this field of study.
Q4: Dear Mr Abidi, I regularly read your column on study advice to students. I am asking this question for my niece who is studying FSc Pre-Medical. What are some alternatives for students who can’t afford to do MBBS?
(Mrs Khan, Faisalabad).
Ans: Dear Mrs Khan, ideally, every student studying Pre-Medical in Pakistan wishes to become a doctor in future but because of the highest merit requirement and financial constraints, very few get to do it. So, instead of getting disheartened, one should consider fields such as Bachelor’s in Bio Chemistry, Bio Technology and/or Veterinary Sciences which are also highly rewarding fields of study.
(Syed Azhar Husnain Abidi is a renowned educationist in Pakistan, with more than 20 years of experience as provider of education counselling services. He has represented Pakistan in over 100 national and international seminars, conferences and fora. He is a recipient of the most coveted civil award Tamgha-e-Imtiaz).

Call to boost furniture industry’s growth,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317579-call-to-boost-furniture-industry-s-growth,"LAHORE:Pakistan Furniture Council (PFC) on Sunday convened a pre-budget meeting to assess the potential implementation of its proposals submitted to the federal government.
Chaired by PFC Chief Executive Officer Mian Kashif Ashfaq, the session emphasised the need for policies to bolster the furniture industry’s growth and global competitiveness. Key proposals included tax relief for local manufacturers, subsidies on imported raw materials, and incentives to enhance exports.
Stakeholders highlighted the sector’s role in economic development, job creation, and reducing reliance on imported furniture. He urged the government to prioritise skill development programmes and infrastructure upgrades, stressing that such measures would align with broader industrial growth goals. Concerns were raised about high production costs and regulatory hurdles, which hinder scalability.
Kashif Ashfaq expressed optimism that adopting their recommendations would position Pakistan as a regional furniture hub, leveraging the industry’s untapped potential. The council awaits the federal budget’s unveiling, hopeful for targeted reforms to drive sustainable progress in this labour-intensive sector.
Steel melters demand relief in budget 2025-26
The Steel melters industry leader on Sunday reiterated demand of special incentives in the upcoming annual national budget to bolster the industry. In a statement issued here Sunday, Kashif Younis Meher, a veteran leader of the industry, said the steel industry in Pakistan is a cornerstone of economic development, providing vital raw materials for construction, infrastructure, and various manufacturing sectors.
Representing a significant segment of the national industrial base, the association emphasises that strategic support is essential for the sector's growth and sustainability. He said the association called for subsidised financing options to modernise and upgrade existing mills.
Access to low-interest loans and grants would facilitate the adoption of advanced technologies, improving efficiency and product quality. The association also highlights the need for improved infrastructure, including reliable power supply and transportation networks, which are critical for the smooth operation of steel plants.
However, the industry has been facing numerous challenges, including rising production costs, outdated technology, and competitive pressures from imported steel. He said genuine demands aim to address the industry's current challenges and set the stage for sustainable growth. By incorporating their demands into the national budget, the government can significantly contribute to the revitalisation and competitiveness of Pakistan's steel industry.

Modest rise in militant attacks in May 2025: PICSS report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317594-modest-rise-in-militant-attacks-in-may-2025-picss-report,"Islamabad:Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India in May 2025, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in Pakistan, according to data released by the Islamabad-based independent think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).
The PICSS monthly security assessment recorded 85 militant attacks in May, up slightly from 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members. A total of 182 people were injured, comprising 130 civilians, 47 security personnel, four militants, and one peace committee member.
This marks a 5 percent increase in militant attacks compared to April. Notably, there was a 73 percent rise in security personnel deaths, and a dramatic 145 percent increase in civilian injuries (from 53 in April to 130 in May). However, injuries among security personnel decreased by 20 percent, falling from 59 to 47.
In operations initiated by security forces during the month, at least 59 militants were killed, while five security personnel lost their lives. Additionally, seven security personnel and five militants sustained injuries. Security forces also arrested 52 suspected militants during various intelligence-based operations.
Combining militant attacks and security operations, the overall casualty toll for May stood at 172 deaths-including 57 security personnel, 65 militants, 46 civilians, and four peace committee members. A total of 194 people were injured, comprising 130 civilians, 54 security personnel, nine militants, and one peace committee member. Militants also abducted at least 19 individuals during the month.
A striking aspect of the May security landscape was a 78 percent rise in the deaths of security personnel, contrasted with a 68 percent decline in militant deaths compared to April. Notably, May was the first month since October 2024 in which militant fatalities were recorded in double digits (65), a sharp drop from 203 in April.
Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) remained the most affected provinces, accounting for 82 of the 85 attacks nationwide. Balochistan experienced the highest level of violence, with 35 militant attacks that left 51 people dead-including 30 civilians, 18 security personnel, and three militants-and 100 injured (94 civilians, five security personnel, one militant). Militants also abducted nine individuals in the province. A particularly tragic incident occurred in Khuzdar, where a blast targeted an Army Public School bus, killing eight children (mostly girls) and two staff members, and injuring 35 others.
In the merged tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile FATA), 22 militant attacks led to 45 deaths, including 23 security personnel, 12 civilians, six militants, and four peace committee members. Additionally, 58 people were injured, comprising 30 security personnel, 27 civilians, and one peace committee member. A controversial quadcopter strike in North Waziristan killed four children, sparking widespread public protests. Security forces blamed the device had been dropped by militants using a drone, but the public demanded an independent inquiry.
In mainland KP (excluding the tribal districts), 25 militant attacks resulted in 14 deaths, including 10 security personnel and two each from civilians and militants. Twenty-four people were injured, including 12 security personnel, nine civilians, and three militants. Sindh witnessed three militant attacks, resulting in the deaths of two civilians and one security personnel.
No militant attacks were reported from Punjab, Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), or Gilgit-Baltistan. However, Punjab recorded the highest number of militant arrests, with 39 suspects detained in intelligence-based operations. In Azad Kashmir, security forces conducted a raid in Rawalakot, killing four alleged militants reportedly affiliated with Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

"Shifa, Pakistan Army bring specialist healthcare to AJK’s doorstep",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317595-shifa-pakistan-army-bring-specialist-healthcare-to-ajk-s-doorstep,"Islamabad:In a heartfelt gesture of solidarity with the people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Shifa International Hospital, in collaboration with the Pakistan Army and the AJK Health Department, organized a two-day free medical camp at DHQ Hospital, Hattian Bala, District Jhelum Valley, extending expert healthcare services to over 1,800 residents of the remote region.
The multidisciplinary medical team-comprising specialists in cardiology, pulmonology, general surgery, gynecology, pediatrics, dentistry, and emergency medicine-offered on-site consultations, along with free medicines for all attendees.
The initiative was particularly welcomed by women, children, and elderly patients, who described the access to high-quality care in their home valley as “a blessing during difficult times.”
Held amid ongoing security operations under Banyan-ul-Marsoos, the medical camp reflected a dual commitment: strengthening national security and uplifting underserved communities through humanitarian outreach.
“Our mission is not only to heal but to bring dignity and hope to every Pakistani, no matter how far they live,” said Dr. Abdus Salam Khan, Consultant Emergency Medicine, who led the medical team.
The initiative was carried out under the directive of Chief Medical Officer Dr. Khawaja Junaid Mustafa and aligns with the vision of Shifa International Hospital’s CEO, Dr. Zeeshan Bin Ishtiaque, to provide inclusive, accessible healthcare across Pakistan’s most marginalized regions.
As the Pakistan Army continues its developmental and strategic efforts in AJK, the collaboration with Shifa International Hospital underscores a shared commitment to national service, health equity, and human dignity.

Kashmir resolution demanded amid renewed int’l focus,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317596-kashmir-resolution-demanded-amid-renewed-int-l-focus,"Islamabad:Prominent Kashmiri intellectual and President of the Jammu and Kashmir Council for Human Rights (JKCHR), Dr. Syed Nazir Gilani, has called for leveraging recent developments at regional and global level to resolve the longstanding Kashmir issue in accordance with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, says a press release.
Speaking at a ceremony organised in Islamabad on Thursday to honour the newly elected office-bearers of the United Kashmir Journalists Association (UKJA), Dr. Gilani emphasized that the re-internationalization of the Kashmir conflict presents a critical opportunity for its resolution.
“The Kashmir issue has once again drawn the attention of the global community. This is a pivotal moment, and we must act decisively to move toward a just settlement,” he said.Dr. Gilani noted that the international narrative surrounding Kashmir was shifting, citing remarks from world leaders-including U.S. President Donald Trump-that have rekindled hope for a solution grounded in United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. He criticized India’s long-standing approach of promoting bilateralism and even unilateralism, asserting that recent global developments have undermined these strategies.
Highlighting the historical and legal dimensions of the dispute, he pointed out that it was India itself that brought the matter to the United Nations in 1948, leading to a series of UNSC resolutions advocating a plebiscite to determine the region’s future. “Despite lacking any legal or moral claim over Kashmir, India continues its forcible occupation and subjects the Kashmiri people to systemic oppression and human rights abuses,” he said.
Gilani commended Pakistan for achieving a remarkable success against recent Indian aggression due to the courageous, wise, and commendable actions of Field Marshal General Asim Munir and the political leadership.
He welcomed renewed efforts for international mediation and urged the United Nations and global community to play an active role in facilitating a resolution. “Peace in South Asia remains unattainable without addressing the Kashmir conflict,” he stated, warning that continued tension between nuclear-armed neighbours Pakistan and India poses a grave risk to regional stability.
Calling for immediate confidence-building measures, Dr. Gilani urged India to halt human rights violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), repeal draconian laws, withdraw its military presence, and release all political prisoners to pave the way for meaningful dialogue.
He reiterated that the Kashmiri struggle was fundamentally about the right to self-determination-a right for which millions have sacrificed their lives. “We cannot compromise on this issue. The United Nations must fulfill its responsibility by ensuring the implementation of its resolutions,” he asserted.
Concluding his remarks, Dr. Gilani emphasized the role of the Kashmiri diaspora, describing them as ambassadors of the Kashmir cause. He called on them to keep the movement alive
on all international platforms and to continue advocating for justice and peace in the region.

Cracks in the facade,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317597-cracks-in-the-facade,"In a rare moment of candour, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Indian Cabinet Minister Dr. Subramanian Swamy has publicly acknowledged what New Delhi has long sought to conceal—India suffered greater losses than admitted during its 2019 air combat with Pakistan. According to Swamy, no fewer than five Indian Air Force (IAF) jets were shot down, a figure that starkly contrasts with India’s official claim of losing just one aircraft.
Speaking in a televised interview reported by Geo News and widely shared across digital platforms, Swamy stated, “Pakistan downed five of our planes. They used Chinese planes to down our planes, which were French.” He further lambasted the Rafale fighter jets—touted as India’s technological edge—calling them inadequate and alleging serious corruption in their procurement: “Corruption happened in Rafale which won’t be investigated till Modi is the PM.”
The Indian government has maintained a tightly curated narrative following the February 2019 Balakot airstrikes and the subsequent aerial encounter. While Pakistan claims to have downed two Indian jets—including a MiG-21 and a Su-30—India only acknowledged the loss of one MiG-21 and the brief capture of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.
Independent analysts and satellite imagery have long cast doubt on India’s official claims, but New Delhi has refused calls for transparency. Swamy’s revelation lends weight to earlier Pakistani and independent assessments suggesting a more severe setback for India. His remarks also echo findings by the European Foundation for South Asian Studies (EFSAS), which in 2020 highlighted the inconsistencies in India’s narrative and called for independent scrutiny.
Adding to the controversy, India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan recently acknowledged losses during “Operation Sindoor”—reportedly launched in response to the mysterious Pahalgam incident—while pointedly refusing to disclose numbers. At the Shangri-La Dialogue on May 31, 2025, General Chauhan remarked, “What is important is not the jet being down, but why they were being down,” sparking fresh criticism of India’s military opacity. A similar non-committal admission had earlier come from IAF spokesman Air Marshal A.K. Bharti, feeding public suspicion of a cover-up.
The Rafale deal itself has long been dogged by allegations. The $8.7 billion agreement for 36 jets, signed in 2016 with France’s Dassault Aviation, bypassed India’s public-sector Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) in favor of the relatively inexperienced Reliance Defence Ltd. Investigative reports by Mediapart in 2021 revealed Dassault paid millions in bribes and issued bogus invoices linked to Sushen Gupta, an Indian middleman with ties to defense officials. Despite mounting evidence, the Modi administration has consistently resisted calls for a formal inquiry.
Swamy’s assertion—that “corruption happened in Rafale which won’t be investigated till Modi is the PM”—suggests not just financial wrongdoing but a systemic suppression of accountability. It also speaks to broader trends in Indian governance: the concealment of military facts, an unwillingness to release evidence in high-stakes incidents like Pahalgam, and the preference for narrative over truth. These tendencies are not just domestic political failings; they pose risks to regional peace and stability.
Subramanian Swamy is no ordinary whistleblower. A Harvard-trained economist and long-time political insider, he remains part of the BJP’s upper echelon. His words carry weight and are often interpreted as signalling internal dissent within the ruling party. While Swamy has a history of political independence, his willingness to publicly criticize India’s defence narrative and expose possible corruption underscores the growing cracks in the official discourse.
This moment of truth is significant not just for India, but also for regional stability in South Asia. It highlights how political narratives often override military realities and how transparency becomes a casualty in the pursuit of nationalist bravado. For Pakistan, which has maintained its account of the air engagement with consistency, Swamy’s admission validates its position and raises critical questions about India’s military preparedness and political accountability.
As India gears up for upcoming elections, these revelations should prompt immediate and independent inquiries. The Indian public deserves to know how many jets were lost, why the Rafales underperformed, and whether corruption compromised national security.
The answers cannot remain buried forever. Swamy’s disclosures, along with top military officials’ vague admissions and international scrutiny, suggest the truth is slowly coming to light. India’s reluctance to offer transparency—be it over jet losses, defence scandals, or aggressive military actions without evidence—can no longer be masked by rhetorical bravado. The world, and indeed India’s own citizens, deserve a reckoning.

Educating against the odds,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317599-educating-against-the-odds,"Rawalpindi:It is often said that a man is known by the company he keeps. Across much of the world-especially in Europe-teachers are regarded as some of the most respected members of society. Unfortunately, in many developing countries, they are often undervalued and overlooked. Against this backdrop, the life and work of Qazi Ashfaq Ahmed stands as a powerful testament to dedication, perseverance, and the transformative power of education.
Born in April 1951 in the narrow, bustling streets of Rawalpindi, Qazi Ashfaq pursued technical education at the Polytechnic Institute. However, instead of taking a conventional career path, he chose to give back to society by teaching those who had been left behind-individuals who, due to family or financial hardships, never had the chance to receive an education.
In 1976, Qazi Ashfaq founded the Free People Technical Training Centre, a small but ambitious initiative that provided free technical education to underprivileged youth. His mission was clear: to empower young people with practical skills so they could earn a livelihood and become productive members of society.
The centre offered hands-on training in essential trades such as refrigerator and deep freezer repair, split air conditioner servicing, donkey pump maintenance, and various types of welding. By the late 1990s, Qazi Ashfaq had expanded his teaching efforts to include over 30 students per session, despite operating with very limited resources.
Throughout his journey, Qazi Ashfaq faced numerous challenges. Life threw many obstacles his way, yet he remained steadfast and committed to his cause. With the dawn of the new millennium, he began charging a nominal admission fee-just enough to cover the cost of practical materials-ensuring the sustainability of his work.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, he launched a YouTube channel that now boasts over 1,000 subscribers, offering accessible video tutorials to a broader audience. He also began contributing articles on social and educational issues to various daily newspapers, extending his influence and insight to the written word.
Qazi Ashfaq is the author of two books. The first, a technical manual on the repair and maintenance of refrigeration and air conditioning systems, is widely used by vocational institutes and has garnered over 10,000 views online. His second book addresses social issues in contemporary society and has attracted over 50,000 views, reflecting its broad relevance and appeal.
Now, at the age of 73, Qazi Ashfaq Ahmed continues to teach at a small scale, tirelessly working to uplift the lower strata of society through technical education. His story is one
of quiet heroism-a man who, against all odds, dedicated his life to others and left an indelible mark on his community.

Held in Shehbaz Azmatkhel and presided over by senior ANP leader and former senator Baz Mohammad Khan, the conference was attended by representatives from various political, religious, legal, social, and trade organisations. The participants expressed deep concern over what they termed as Centre’s interference, forced partnerships, and the promotion of external interests through the new legislation.The speakers, including former senator Prof. Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, Naz Ali Khan Wazir, Dr Pir Sahib Zaman, City Mayor Irfan Durrani, and multiple legal and tribal representatives, argued that the bill undermines the 18th Constitutional Amendment and poses a serious threat to the province’s natural resources, local employment, and economic autonomy.
They warned that the bill, under the guise of promoting investment and development, actually grants the federal government excessive authority and facilitates undue control over the mineral sector by external forces and federal institutions.
The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was a key point of criticism. The APC rejected any role of the SIFC or federal zoning in provincial matters, terming it an unconstitutional body aiming to take over sectors such as agriculture, minerals, tourism, environment, and IT.
The APC condemned the recently passed minerals law in Balochistan and demanded its immediate withdrawal.The participants opposed the ban on marriage under the age of 18 for girls, citing cultural and legal reasons. The conference strongly rejected the legal actions, including FIRs and Schedule IV listings, against citizens protesting the worsening law and order situation in Bannu.
It called for the reinstatement of dismissed police personnel, reopening of all blocked roads, and internal security arrangements within government facilities instead of disrupting public mobility.
A strong demand was made for the immediate recovery of kidnapped teacher Farman Ali Shah and other abductees, as well as urgent measures to counter kidnapping, extortion, and targeted killings in the region. The APC urged authorities to end unjust and excessive electricity load shedding by WAPDA and ensure uninterrupted power supply to the people of Bannu.

Talent Hunt Programme: Saif says govt striving to empower minority youth,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317619-talent-hunt-programme-saif-says-govt-striving-to-empower-minority-youth,"PESHAWAR: Adviser to Chief Minister on Information Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif on Sunday said that the provincial government was committed to empowering minority youth and helping them turn their dreams into reality.
He urged the youth to seek education not merely for jobs or degrees, but for awareness, consciousness, and service to humanity.An official handout said that he was speaking as chief guest at the concluding ceremony of the Minority Youth Talent Hunt Programme held in Peshawar under the auspices of the provincial Auqaf, Haj, Religious and Minority Affairs Department.
Over 600 youth from the minority of the province (both male and female) participated in the two-day event. They competed in 10 categories including Urdu and Pashto singing, essay writing, declamation contests, painting, art, and rap performances.At the closing ceremony, winners were awarded cash prizes. Participants also offered prayers for the peace and prosperity of Pakistan and performed patriotic songs.
In his address, Barrister Saif emphasized that the labels of “majority” and “minority” create divisions in society, whereas the truth is that we are all, first and foremost, human beings and Pakistanis. “Our true identity should be based on character, ethics, and humanity — not on religion, race, or language,” he stated.
Quoting teachings from Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, and Sikhism, Barrister Saif said all religions promote universal values of humanity, justice, love, and morality.He urged youth to seek education not merely for jobs or degrees, but for awareness, consciousness, and service to humanity. “Wealth and employment are for humans, not the other way around,” he remarked.
He stressed that granting equal rights to minorities is not only a constitutional obligation but also a divine command and a Sunnah of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). “Our government is fully committed to empowering minority youth and helping them turn their dreams into reality,” he added.
Among the top winners, Sajid Iqbal from Kalash secured first position in Urdu essay writing, while Surinder Singh from Buner stood second. Awards were also presented to outstanding performers in English essay writing, painting, thematic art, declamation contests, and singing competitions.
In Pashto singing, Kiran Zulfiqar and Ashbam Tanveer, both from Peshawar, stood out. Junaid Kalash received a special award in the rap category, while young vocalist Isaac Javed, also known as “Chhota Ustad,” and Mahak Javed each received cash prizes of PKR 20,000.
A distinguished panel of judges — including celebrated singer Sitara Younus, renowned actor Syed Rehman Shino, academic professors, and national assembly officials — evaluated the competitions.
On this occasion, Saif announced that dedicated slots will be allocated on Pakhtunkhwa Radio Stations of the provincial Information and Public Relations Department to showcase the talents of minority youth. “We want these young voices to go beyond local stages and resonate across the country,” he said. At the conclusion of the ceremony, Deputy Secretary of the Minority Affairs Department, Habib Khan Afridi, presented a commemorative shield to the chief guest, while renowned photographer and painter Uncle Tony gifted him paintings.

"Pakhtuns faced worst form of terrorism, says Achakzai",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317621-pakhtuns-faced-worst-form-of-terrorism-says-achakzai,"MINGORA: Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai on Sunday asked the federal government to give the Pakhtuns their due rights as they had been badly affected by terrorism.
Addressing a gathering in Kabal tehsil in the Swat district, he said that the Pakhtuns had been victims of terrorisms, therefore, the government should give them their due rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan. He criticized the government for the prevailing political situation and said that steps should be taken to protect the rights of the Pakhtuns. He said that the Pakhtuns had rendered matchless sacrifices for the restoration of peace.
Achakzai, who is also head of Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Ayeen-e-Pakistan, said that Pakistan’s progress was linked to upholding the Constitution. He said that the Pakhtuns had the right over their own resources.
This demand, he emphasized, aligned not only with international law but also with Islamic principles. Warning the ruling elite, he stated that bowing before any force other than Allah was against the fundamental tenets of Islam. He declared that the Pakhtuns faced existential threats, and without peace, justice, political autonomy, and rule of law, development could not be achieved.
Achakzai condemned all forms of discrimination based on religion, colour, race, ethnicity, or sect. He claimed that the Pakhtuns had become victims of global political and economic wars. He said that the Pakhtuns were being portrayed as extremists and terrorists, even though they were among the worst affected by these crises.
Achakzai recalled that from Mardan and Charsadda to Swabi and Swat, the region was once a cradle and sacred centre of Buddhist civilization, and Swat was still internationally recognized for religious and traditional tourism. However, due to deteriorating law and order — a consequence of the state’s flawed policies — tourism has been severely impacted, depriving the region and local population of a key source of income and development, he said.
He criticized the ruling elite for taking loans from the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions without informing the public where and how those funds were spent.
He alleged that the 2024 general elections were rigged under a well-devised plan. He claimed that the names of favoured candidates were simply marked and approved. He said that anyone in this country who refused to be bought or spoke of constitutional and parliamentary supremacy was branded a traitor or enemy of the state.
Achakzai announced that after Eid-ul-Adha, a nationwide public movement would be launched under the banner of Tehreek Tahafuz-e-Ayeen-e-Pakistan, with the goal of “restoring the constitution”.

New world no. 1 Kunlavut seals Singapore crown in style,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317560-new-world-no-1-kunlavut-seals-singapore-crown-in-style,"SINGAPORE: Kunlavut Vitidsarn celebrated becoming the first man from Thailand to top the badminton world rankings by winning the Singapore Open in style on Sunday. The 24-year-old demolished China´s unseeded Lu Guangzu 21-6, 21-10 in just 37 minutes with his range of powerful smashes and deceptive drop shots.
Paris Olympics silver medallist Kunlavut will replace another Chinese player, Shi Yuqi, as world number one in a landmark for Thai badminton. It was his fourth title this season. “There will be pressure to be the best player in the world, but it´s going to be a good pressure as that will give me the added motivation of doing my best to win all the tournaments I take part in,” said Kunlavut, who lost the Paris final to Viktor Axelsen.
Denmark´s two-time Olympic champion Axelsen, the former number one, is currently working his way back to fitness following surgery for a back problem. In an all-Chinese women´s final at the Singapore Indoor Stadium, the fifth seed Chen Yufei outplayed second-seeded Wang Zhiyi 21-11, 21-11.
Chen was runner-up to world number one An Se-young last year. Chen ended the South Korean´s unbeaten run in 2025 by defeating her in the quarter-finals this year. “I´m really very happy with this win because the draw was not exactly in my favour and every match felt like a battle,” said Chen.

LAFC qualify for Club World Cup with win over Club America,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317561-lafc-qualify-for-club-world-cup-with-win-over-club-america,"Los Angeles, United States: Denis Bouanga grabbed a dramatic extra-time winner to send Los Angeles FC into the Club World Cup with a 2-1 (aet) win over Mexico´s Club America on Saturday.
The team from Mexico City looked to have booked their place - and the guaranteed $9.5 million participation reward - after a penalty from former LAFC player Brian Rodriguez in the 64th minute.
But Brazilian Igor Jesus´s 89th minute header for LAFC took the game into extra-time and five minutes from the end of the second period Bouanga drilled home the dramatic winner. It was a game with high stakes played in front of a boisterous crowd divided between the two teams and the tension was palpable from the outset.
But it was the Californian club, who only began life in MLS seven years ago, who triumphed and earned a spot in the first edition of the expanded 32-team FIFA tournament. LAFC will line up in Group D of the Club World Cup, where they will face Premier League side Chelsea, Brazil´s Flamengo and Esperance Tunis of Tunisia in the tournament which gets under way on June 14.
The one-off ´play-in´ match came about following FIFA´s decision to ban Mexican club Leon from the tournament. Leon were barred because the club is owned by Grupo Pachuca, which also controls Liga MX side Pachuca, who are also taking part in the tournament.
LAFC were given the chance on the basis of finishing as runners-up to Leon in the 2023 CONCACAF Champions League. America, founded 108 years ago, were handed the opportunity due to their status as the “top-ranked team” in confederation rankings.
While LAFC had the nominal home field advantage, at their BMO Stadium, California is home to many Club America fans and the result was a de facto neutral venue. The atmosphere was electric but chances were rare in the opening half with the Mexican team enjoying the better possession but causing few problems for LA´s former France goalkeeper Hugo Lloris.
But when Mark Delgado´s challenge on Erick Sanchez in the box was ruled a foul, after a VAR review, substitute Rodriguez kept his cool and sent Lloris the wrong way to put America ahead.
Rodriguez had a chance to secure the outcome 10 minutes later but he floated his shot wide. The introduction of former France and Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud in the 74th minute proved to be decisive, however, with the 38-year-old´s presence causing plenty of problems for the America back line.
Giroud´s improvised shot with the outside of his foot forced Luis Malagon into a save and moments later the Club America keeper kept out a header from the Frenchman. With just a minute of normal time remaining, LAFC grabbed a lifeline when a Bouanga corner was met with a thundering header from Jesus.
LAFC almost won the game in regulation but Malagon did brilliantly to keep out a cross/shot from Timothy Tillman that was heading towards the top corner. Then it was extra-time and with penalties looming, Frankie Amaya fed a ball in to Giroud on the edge of the box who laid off to the on-rushing Bouanga whose fierce shot took a wicked deflection and flashed past the helpless Malagon.
The France-born Gabon international has scored 80 goals for LA, in all competitions, since joining the club from Saint Etienne in 2022 but none more valuable than this one. The win ensures that the tournament host nation will have three competing teams from Major League Soccer with the Seattle Sounders and Inter Miami already in the competition.

Messi double as Miami hit five past Columbus,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317562-messi-double-as-miami-hit-five-past-columbus,"Fort Lauderdale: Lionel Messi scored twice and created two more as Inter Miami warmed up for the Club World Cup in style with a 5-1 win over the Columbus Crew in Major League Soccer on Saturday.
Miami will open the new FIFA tournament on June 14 against Egyptian and African champions Al Ahly and after a major dip in form they have found their touch again in their last two MLS games.
A 4-2 win over Montreal in midweek, with Messi and Luis Suarez scoring two goals each, eased the tensions around Javier Mascherano´s team and their renewed confidence was evident from the outset.
Miami were helped by some uncharacteristically loose defending from Columbus, who have been one of the most consistent performers in MLS over the past three seasons but were easily opened up by Messi and Company.
Argentine Tadeo Allende opened the scoring in the 13th minute when Messi, who had dropped deep into midfield, sent him goalwards with a long ball over the top and the forward confidently slotted home.
Two minutes later, Columbus´s Guatemalan goalkeeper Nicholas Hagen, standing in for the injured Patrick Schulte, then gifted Miami´s second when he hesitated with the ball at his feet and passed straight to Messi, of all people, with the World Cup winner then attempting to chip him.
Hagen scrambled, getting an outstretched palm on the ball but the shot looped into the net to make it 2-0 and leave the visitors in deep trouble. Messi made it three in the 24th minute when Sergio Busquets spotted the Crew defence were asleep and floated a pass over the top which Messi raced on to before lobbing the advancing Hagen. Columbus gave themselves a glimmer of hope with a thundering header from Cesar Ruvalcaba in the 58th minute but six minutes later Miami had restored their three goal advantage.

Brilliant PSG demolish Inter Milan to win first CL title,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317563-brilliant-psg-demolish-inter-milan-to-win-first-cl-title,"Munich, Germany: Paris Saint-Germain won the Champions League for the first time as Luis Enrique´s brilliant young side outclassed Inter Milan on Saturday in the most one-sided final ever with teenager Desire Doue scoring twice in an astonishing 5-0 victory.
Doue supplied the pass for Achraf Hakimi to give PSG an early lead and the 19-year-old went from provider to finisher as his deflected shot doubled the advantage in the 20th minute. Doue scored again just after the hour mark, ending any doubt about the outcome before Khvicha Kvaratskhelia ran away to get the fourth and substitute Senny Mayulu, another teenager, made it five.
Inter were simply no match for the French club, who recorded the biggest victory by any team in the final in the 70-year history of the European Cup and Champions League. “This means everything. It´s our dream. It´s incredible. The result is not by magic. I´m happy we did it like this,” said PSG´s Portuguese midfielder Vitinha.
The triumph for the Parisians follows over a decade of huge investment from their Qatari owners, and comes five years after they lost to Bayern Munich in their only previous final appearance.
Already domestic league and cup double winners, they are just the second French winners of European football´s biggest prize -- Marseille were the first in 1993, when they beat AC Milan in a final also played in Munich.
It is also a second Champions League for PSG coach Luis Enrique, who won with Lionel Messi´s Barcelona in 2015. This youthful PSG side is arguably the best the competition has seen since, one that has been intelligently pieced together over the last two years and fully unleashed this season following the departure of Kylian Mbappe.
“It was the objective since the start of last season to make history. I have felt a really strong connection with the players and the supporters,” Luis Enrique told broadcaster Canal Plus. For a bewildered Inter, there was to be no first Champions League title since 2010 as they failed to add to their three previous triumphs in the competition.
Simone Inzaghi´s side have got to the final twice in three seasons and lost both, and this defeat comes a week after they missed out on the Serie A title to Napoli. They end the campaign trophyless, and their ageing side will need to be rebuilt.
“PSG absolutely deserved to win this match. We are very disappointed,” admitted Inzaghi. “As a coach I am proud of our campaign, but we´re not satisfied with tonight´s game. PSG outplayed us.
“I thanked the players for what they did this season. We won no silverware, but I´m proud.” PSG gave their opponents no chance from the off on a sweaty night at the Allianz Arena, going ahead in the 12th minute.
It was a glorious goal, Vitinha threading a pass to Doue who squared for Hakimi to finish before refusing to celebrate against his former club. It was also the earliest goal in a Champions League final since 2019, and recent history was firmly against Inter. The last final in which both teams scored was in 2018, while the last team to concede first but still win were Real Madrid in 2014.
But soon Inter were further behind with a goal from a counterattack. Willian Pacho prevented Inter from winning a corner, his clearance falling to Kvaratskhelia, who released Ousmane Dembele. His pass found Doue and the youngster, preferred in the starting line-up to Bradley Barcola, fired home via a deflection off Federico Dimarco. Inter only really came close to scoring in the first half when Marcus Thuram headed wide at a corner, but things got worse after the break.
Their back line was in disarray as PSG made it 3-0 on 63 minutes, Dembele´s flick releasing Vitinha before he set up Doue to beat goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Doue came off shortly after to rapturous applause, but his teammates were far from done. Dembele sent Kvaratskhelia away to to make it 4-0 in the 73rd minute, and the 19-year-old Mayulu played a one-two with Barcola before lashing in the fifth on 86 minutes. That rounded off an incredible night, with PSG becoming the first team to score five goals in the final since Benfica in 1962.

Doue caps dream season by starring in PSG’s Champions League triumph,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317564-doue-caps-dream-season-by-starring-in-psg-s-champions-league-triumph,"Munich, Germany: Teenage star Desire Doue topped off a dream season by scoring twice in a stunning performance as Paris Saint-Germain comprehensively beat Inter Milan 5-0 in Saturday´s Champions League final.
“I don´t have the words. It is a dream come true. It is just magnificent,” Doue told broadcaster Canal Plus in a brief interview as delirious PSG fans invaded the pitch at the Allianz Arena after seeing their team win the trophy for the first time.
No player embodies the youthful energy and dynamism of Luis Enrique´s thrilling PSG side quite like Doue, who has enjoyed a remarkable campaign and has now announced himself to the wider world with his display in Munich.
Doue´s masterclass, which came only three days before his 20th birthday, saw him set up Achraf Hakimi for PSG´s early opener. He then became just the third teenager to score in the final of the modern Champions League as he made it 2-0 on the night.
The French international followed in the footsteps of Patrick Kluivert, who was still 18 when he netted for Ajax in 1995, and the Brazilian Carlos Alberto Gomes, a 19-year-old scorer for Porto in 2004.
Doue later scored again before being brought off to rapturous applause and seeing another teenager get on the scoresheet, substitute Senny Mayulu wrapping up the victory with the fifth goal a fortnight after turning 19.
“What we have done today is magical. We have made French and Europan football history and I am so pleased with how everything has gone this season,” Doue said after what was the biggest ever win by any club in the final.
An astonishing season for PSG following talisman Kylian Mbappe´s departure has seen them win Europe´s elite club competition for the first time after also completing a domestic league and cup double.
It has been an especially remarkable year for Doue, whose dazzling feet recall former PSG superstar Neymar at his very best.  Doue joined PSG from Rennes in August for a reported 50 million euros ($56.7m), signing a five-year deal.

"PSG have achieved ‘our ultimate goal’, says Luis Enrique",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317565-psg-have-achieved-our-ultimate-goal-says-luis-enrique,"Munich, Germany, May 31, 2025 (AFP) -Paris Saint-Germain coach Luis Enrique said he and the club had achieved their “ultimate goal” by winning the Champions League after the 5-0 thumping of Inter Milan.
Since their Qatari takeover in 2011, PSG have won 11 of the past 13 French titles but the grand prize for which the club had spent big had always eluded them. On Saturday, PSG sliced Inter to pieces at the Allianz Arena to emphatically put that right.
Luis Enrique, who won the Champions League at the helm of Barcelona in Berlin in 2015, said he had his sights set on the title ever since he took over in the French capital in 2023. “On my first day at the PSG campus, my French was even worse than it is today. But I said the ultimate goal for me as a coach was to fill the trophy cabinet,” the Spaniard said.
“The only trophy missing was Champions League. And we´ve ticked that box. We were ambitious, and we did it. “It´s in the bag and it´s coming home with us tomorrow.” The manager singled out forward Ousmane Dembele for special praise, calling him “incredible” and saying “he deserves to win the Ballon d´Or.”
The coach paid tribute to his daughter Xana, who passed away from cancer in 2019 aged nine. After the full-time whistle, the French fans unfurled a banner depicting father and daughter planting a PSG flag into the ground, just as the two had done with a Barcelona flag in Berlin a decade earlier.

Scheffler grabs lead at PGA Tour’s Memorial Tournament,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317566-scheffler-grabs-lead-at-pga-tour-s-memorial-tournament,"Washington: World number one Scottie Scheffler conjured a late birdie blitz to fire a four-under-par 68 and grab a one-shot lead after the third round at the PGA Tour´s Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio on Saturday.
Scheffler, bidding to successfully defend his crown at Muirfield Village, rattled in four birdies in the final five holes to drop to eight under, one ahead of overnight leader Ben Griffin, who stumbled with an even-par 72.
“I don´t know what the scoring average was today, but I was definitely proud of the way I finished and it was really challenging,” Scheffler said afterward. “Through 13 holes I felt like I was playing really good and I was only even par. Just a hard golf course.” Three-time major champion Scheffler, who started the day three off the pace, was forced to bide his time after opening his round with 13 pars.
But the 28-year-old American got things going on the par-four 14th, draining a 10-foot birdie putt before making a birdie four on the par-five 15th, when his third shot from the edge of the green left him with a tap-in.
A par on 16 left him at two under for the day but Scheffler was soon on the move at the par-four 17th, when he stuck his approach to eight feet and then rolled in the birdie putt. Another birdie on the 18th, with Scheffler draining a 14-foot birdie putt, thrust him into a share of the lead alongside Griffin.
At that stage, Griffin looked to have overcome the worst of a roller coaster round to hang on to the lead. The in-form American, chasing his third PGA Tour win of the year, had got off to a smooth start after a trio of early birdies on the sixth, seventh and eighth holes. But four straight bogeys derailed his progress and allowed the chasing pack to close.
Griffin steadied the ship with back-to-back birdies on 14 and 15 leaving him on 10 under, five clear of the field. Yet Scheffler´s late charge narrowed the deficit and ensured Griffin headed to the 18th with a share of the lead.
He looked to have done enough to finish the day alongside Scheffler when his third shot from the greenside rough left him with a five-footer to par. But Griffin´s short putt rolled wide for bogey, leaving him with the daunting task of having to chase Scheffler in Sunday´s final round.

"Transgender teen wins gold, shares medals at California school athletics championships",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317568-transgender-teen-wins-gold-shares-medals-at-california-school-athletics-championships,"San Francisco: A transgender high school athlete won two gold and a silver and shared the medals with rivals under new rules aimed at tamping down controversy over her participation in the California State Track & Field Championships on Saturday.
AB Hernandez, 16, cleared 5 feet, 7 inches (1.70m) in the high jump with no failed attempts and shared first place with Jillene Wetteland and Lelani Laruelle -- who each cleared the same height with one failed attempt.
They topped the podium together at the championships held in Clovis, outside of Fresno, under new rules announced this week by the California Interscholastic Federation in response to criticism of the policy that allows transgender athletes to compete in girls´ events. CIF first modified their championship entry rules so that biological females were not excluded from competition due to the participation of trans athletes.
They then issued a rule change targeting events in which Hernandez had qualified to compete -- high jump, long jump and triple jump -- saying any “biological female student-athlete who would have earned a specific placement on the podium will also be awarded the medal for that place” in those events.
The changes came after days of controversy that included a social media post from US President Donald Trump, who threatened to withhold future federal funding from California if Hernandez was allowed to compete.

Piastri extends championship lead with Spanish Grand Prix victory,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317571-piastri-extends-championship-lead-with-spanish-grand-prix-victory,"Barcelona: Oscar Piastri drove with exemplary calm and control in a torrid race on Sunday to beat rival and team-mate Lando Norris as McLaren claimed their first Spanish Grand Prix victory since 2005 with a resounding 1-2 triumph.
The 24-year-old Australian came home 2.4 seconds clear of Norris for his fifth win this year to extend his lead over his teammate in the drivers´ championship to 10 points with Ferrari´s Charles Leclerc finishing third after a dramatic finale.
Four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull went for a three-stop strategy that resulted in him losing third place in the final laps before being handed a 10-second penalty for crashing into Mercedes´ George Russell who finished fourth.
Nico Hulkenberg, who started 15th on the grid, was a surprise fifth for Sauber ahead of seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Ferrari, Racing Bulls´ rookie Isack Hadjar and Pierre Gasly of Alpine.
Two-time champion and local hero Fernando Alonso finished ninth for Aston Martin with Verstappen classified 10th. “It´s toasty out there,” was Piastri´s description of the pre-race heat with temperatures of 32 degress celcius (air) and 51 degrees (track) ensuring high levels of tyre degradation and ice vests for the drivers.
Piastri rejected the soubriquet ´Ice Boy´ on Saturday but made a super-cool start to pull clear as Verstappen attacked and passed Norris for second out of Turn One as both Ferraris passed Russell to take fourth and fifth ahead of the two Mercedes. Everyone started on soft tyres, other than Tsunoda, from the pit-lane, who was 19th in the absence of Lance Stroll, who was unable to drive his Aston Martin due to hand and wrist pain.
Norris finally passed Verstappen on lap 13 on entry to Turn One and began his pursuit of Piastri, as the expected stops began early with the Dutchman, taking more softs - leaving two McLarens leading two Ferraris.
Ferrari called Hamilton in for mediums, on lap 17, to “protect against the undercut”. He rejoined ninth, to be followed in by Leclerc. Norris and Piastri pitted in sequence for mediums on laps 22 and 23, gifting Verstappen the lead thanks to his early stop. He led until lap 30, when he stopped again for mediums, and rejoined fourth just ahead of Hamilton.
Restored as leader, Piastri led Norris by 5.6sec at half-distance with Leclerc, who had saved two sets of new mediums for the race, third until the rapid Verstappen swept by at Turn One and began pursuit.
The second round of stops began on lap 41 with Leclerc who rejoined sixth on his shiny new rubber followed by Russell, to softs, and Hamilton again, on lap 47 for a slow 4.2 seconds that saw him rejoin seventh.
Verstappen pitted on lap 49, for more softs, to chase Norris, who had also taken softs, for the final 15-lap sprint to the flag, and Piastri, who had followed him in. The top three were separated by barely four seconds as they tangled with traffic amid a flurry of blue flags.
With 10 to go, on lap 56, Antonelli speared off with an engine failure to trigger a Safety Car that enabled Verstappen to stop for new hards, his only option, while the McLarens and Leclerc took used softs.
Verstappen made an error on lap 60, sliding as he exited the final corner allowing Leclerc to pass before a clash with Russell saw him take the escape road. Red Bull told Verstappen to give position back to Russell but the Dutchman collided with him again to incur his penalty before Piastri cruised clear to take his seventh career victory ahead of Norris.

Pacers beat Knicks to set up NBA Finals clash with Thunder,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317572-pacers-beat-knicks-to-set-up-nba-finals-clash-with-thunder,"Los Angeles, United States: The Indiana Pacers, fueled by 31 points from Pascal Siakam and a 21-point double-double from Tyrese Haliburton, beat the New York Knicks 125-108 on Saturday to reach the NBA Finals for the first time since 2000.
The Pacers used a big third quarter to break open a close game and kept the pressure on in the fourth period to win the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals 4-2. They reached the championship series for the second time in franchise history, and will be chasing their first title when the Finals open in Oklahoma City on Thursday.
Haliburton said the series triumph was especially sweet after the Pacers were swept in the conference finals last season by eventual champions Boston. “You know, we got to the same spot last year, fell short and we just worked our tails off as a group to get back here,” he said. “It´s been a bumpy road with our start and (I´m) just really proud of the resilience of this group.”

Mexicans elect their judges under shadow of organised crime,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317646-mexicans-elect-their-judges-under-shadow-of-organised-crime,"MEXICO CITY: Mexico began unprecedented elections on Sunday allowing voters to choose their judges at all levels, in a country where drug cartels and other vested interests regularly seek to alter the course of justice.
The government says the reform making Mexico the world´s only country to select all of its judges and magistrates by popular vote is needed to tackle deep-rooted graft and impunity. “Those who want the regime of corruption and privileges in the judiciary to continue say this election is rigged. Or they also say it´s so a political party can take over the Supreme Court,” President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a video on the eve of the election.
Critics and experts are concerned that the judiciary will be politicized and that it could become easier for criminals to influence the courts with threats and bribery. While corruption already exists, “there is reason to believe that elections may be more easily infiltrated by organized crime than other methods of judicial selection,” said Margaret Satterthwaite, the United Nations special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers.
But cartels were likely trying to influence the outcome in the shadows, said Luis Carlos Ugalde, a consultant and former head of Mexico´s electoral commission. “It is logical that organized criminal groups would have approached judges and candidates who are important to them,” Ugalde, general director of Integralia Consultores, told a roundtable hosted by the Inter-American Dialogue.

Trump says withdrawing Musk ally as nominee to head Nasa,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317647-trump-says-withdrawing-musk-ally-as-nominee-to-head-nasa,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was withdrawing his nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, a close ally of Elon Musk, to lead space agency Nasa.
Trump said last December, before returning to office, that he wanted the online payments entrepreneur and the first private astronaut to conduct a spacewalk to serve as the next head of Nasa.
But on Saturday, he said on his Truth Social platform that “after a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head Nasa.” “I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space.”
Earlier on Saturday, the New York Times had reported the move was coming, quoting unnamed sources as saying the decision had come after the president learned Isaacman had donated money to prominent Democrats.
Asked about that report, the White House had told AFP in an email that it was “essential that the next leader of Nasa is in complete alignment with President Trump´s America First agenda.” “The Administrator of Nasa will help lead humanity into space and execute President Trump´s bold mission of planting the American flag on the planet Mars,” it said.

Russia accepts Taliban’s nominated ambassador to Moscow,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317648-russia-accepts-taliban-s-nominated-ambassador-to-moscow,"KABUL: Russia has officially accepted the Taliban’s nomination of an ambassador to Moscow, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday, as economic and political ties grow between the two sanctions-hit nations.
Russia in April suspended its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated for more than two decades as a terrorist organisation, in a move that paved the way for Moscow to normalise ties with the leadership of Afghanistan. No country has formally recognised the Taliban’s government, which took over the country in 2021 as US-led forces withdrew.

BD ex-PM Hasina accused of ‘systematic attack’ in deadly protest crackdown,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317650-bd-ex-pm-hasina-accused-of-systematic-attack-in-deadly-protest-crackdown,"DHAKA: Fugitive former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina orchestrated a “systematic attack” that amounted to crimes against humanity in her attempt to crush the uprising that toppled her government, Bangladeshi prosecutors said at the opening of her trial on Sunday.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 after Hasina´s government launched its crackdown, according to the United Nations. Bangladesh´s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) is prosecuting former senior figures connected to Hasina´s ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League.
“Upon scrutinising the evidence, we reached the conclusion that it was a coordinated, widespread and systematic attack,” ICT chief prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam told the court in his opening speech.
“The accused unleashed all law enforcement agencies and her armed party members to crush the uprising.” Islam lodged five charges each against Hasina and two other officials that included “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy, and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising”. Prosecutors say such acts are tantamount to “crimes against humanity”. Hasina, who remains in self-imposed exile in India, has rejected the charges as politically motivated.

UK boosts weapons production capacity in new defence strategy,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317651-uk-boosts-weapons-production-capacity-in-new-defence-strategy,"LONDON: Britain will invest £1.5 billion ($2 billion) in new weapons factories to ramp up defence production capacity, the government said on Sunday, ahead of a major review of its armed forces and military strategy.
The Strategic Defence Review, due to be published on Monday, will assess the threats facing the UK amid Russia´s ongoing war in Ukraine and pressure from US President Donald Trump for Nato allies to bolster their own defences.
In February, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer committed to increasing defence spending to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2027, up from its current 2.3 percent.
The Labour leader also aimed to hike spending to three percent by the next parliament, due around 2029. The review will recommend “creating an ´always on´ munitions production capacity in the UK” which would allow weapons production to be “scaled up at speed if needed”.
It also urges the government to “lay the industrial foundations for an uplift in munitions stockpiles to meet the demand of high-tempo warfare”, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement. The government has said it would procure 7,000 domestically built long-rang weapons and build “at least six munitions and energetics factories”. This investment -- which will see £6 billion spent on munitions this Parliamentary term -- will also create and support 1,800 jobs, the ministry said.

"More than 1,100 migrants crossed Channel on Saturday",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317652-more-than-1-100-migrants-crossed-channel-on-saturday,"LONDON: Some 1,194 migrants arrived in the UK after crossing the Channel in small boats on Saturday, a record for this year according to AFP counting from government data.
It brings the overall number of migrant crossings this year to 14,808, an unprecedented figure despite several measures in place by the French and UK governments to curb the crossings. French coastal authorities said they also rescued nearly 200 migrants between late Friday and late Saturday.
The latest crossings, which UK Defence Secretary John Healey described as “shocking”, fall short of the all-time record of 1,300 migrants arriving on small boats in a day in September 2022.
But they will still prove a headache for UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been at pains to toughen his rhetoric on irregular immigration amid pressure from the far right to slash migrant numbers.
“We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security,” the Home Office said in a statement on the latest arrivals. Starmer unveiled tough new immigration policies this month that include doubling the length of time before migrants can qualify for settlement in the country and new powers to deport foreign criminals.

Poland’s Trzaskowski on course for tight presidential election win,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317653-poland-s-trzaskowski-on-course-for-tight-presidential-election-win,"WARSAW: Liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski appeared set for a razor-thin win in Poland’s presidential election on Sunday, an exit poll showed, in a vote seen as a test of the nation’s support for a pro-European course versus Donald Trump-style nationalism.
An exit poll by Ipsos for broadcasters TVN, TVP and Polsat showed Trzaskowski of the ruling centrists Civic Coalition (KO) winning 50.3 percent of ballots. His rival, a conservative historian and amateur boxer, Karol Nawrocki, backed by nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), was at 49.7 percent.
Official results were due on Monday, although a late poll that mixes some results with exit surveys was expected to be published overnight. The exit poll carries a margin of error of 2 percentage points.
Trzaskowski, 53, campaigned on a promise to help the government of Prime Minister Donald Tusk complete its democratic reforms, which they both say aim to repair an erosion of checks and balances under the previous nationalist government that lost power in 2023.
“We won,” he told jubilant party members after the exit surveys came out. “I will bring people together, I will be constructive, I will be a president for all Poles. I will be your president.”
Parliament holds most of the power in Poland, but the president can veto legislation, so the vote is being watched closely in neighbouring Ukraine, as well as in Russia, the US and across the European Union.
Both candidates agreed on the need to spend heavily on defence, as US President Donald Trump is demanding from Europe, and to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion.
But while Trzaskowski sees Ukraine’s future membership of Nato as essential for Poland’s security, Nawrocki said recently that if he were president he would not ratify it because of the danger of the alliance being drawn into war with Russia.
Nawrocki, who draws inspiration from Trump and his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, said it was too early to call Trzaskowski’s victory. “We will win and we will save Poland,” he said. “We will not allow for Donald Tusk’s power to be all-encompassing and the monopoly of evil power ... which takes away our great dreams ...to become complete.”
Coming around a year and a half since Tusk, a former president of the European Council, took office, the vote provides the toughest test yet of support for his broad coalition government, with Nawrocki presenting the ballot as a referendum on its actions.
The first round of the election on May 18 saw a surge in support for the anti-establishment far-right, suggesting that the KO-PiS duopoly that has dominated Polish politics for a generation may be starting to fracture.
Nevertheless, after a tumultuous campaign in which Nawrocki in particular faced a slew of negative media reports about his alleged past conduct, once again candidates representing the two main parties faced off in the second round.
PiS has traditionally enjoyed high support in small towns and rural areas, especially in the south and east. These areas are typically more socially conservative than larger cities and poorer, creating a sense of exclusion that PiS has tapped into.
KO, meanwhile, campaigns on a pro-European centrist agenda that appeals to more liberal-minded Poles who mainly live in cities or bigger towns.
Social issues were also at stake in the election. Trzaskowski has said he wanted to see Poland’s near total ban on abortion eased, something that outgoing nationalist President Andrzej Duda strongly opposed.

"Russia may attack Nato in next four years, German defence chief warns",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317654-russia-may-attack-nato-in-next-four-years-german-defence-chief-warns,"BERLIN: Members of the Western alliance Nato need to prepare for a possible attack from Russia within the next four years, according to Germany’s chief of defence.General Carsten Breuer told the BBC that Russia was producing hundreds of tanks a year, many of which could be used for an attack on Nato Baltic state members by 2029 or even earlier.
He also insisted that Nato, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, remains unified over the war in Ukraine, despite differences of opinion expressed recently by both Hungary and Slovakia.
Gen Breuer was speaking on the sidelines of the Shangri-la Dialogue, a defence summit in Singapore organised by the think tank International Institute of Strategic Studies.His comments come weeks ahead of a summit of Nato nations at The Hague where they are expected to discuss defence budgets, among other topics.
Gen Breuer said that Nato was facing “a very serious threat” from Russia, one that he has never seen before in his 40 years in service.At the moment, he said, Russia was building up its forces to an “enormous extent”, producing approximately 1,500 main battle tanks every year.
“Not every single tank is going to [the war in] Ukraine, but it’s also going in stocks and into new military structures always facing the West,” he said.Russia also produced four million rounds of 152mm artillery munition in 2024, and not all of it was going to Ukraine either, added Gen Breuer.
“There’s an intent and there’s a build up of the stocks” for a possible future attack on Nato’s Baltic state members, he said.“This is what the analysts are assessing - in 2029. So we have to be ready by 2029... If you ask me now, is this a guarantee that’s not earlier than 2029? I would say no, it’s not. So we must be able to fight tonight,” he said.

India’s monsoon rains kill at least 30 in northeast,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317655-india-s-monsoon-rains-kill-at-least-30-in-northeast,"GUWAHATI, India: Flash floods and landslides after torrential monsoon rain over the last two days killed at least 30 people in India´s northeast, officials said on Sunday.
State disaster management officials said eight people died in Assam, and nine in Arunachal Pradesh, many of them in landslides as earth loosened by the water slumped into the valley below.
Another five people died in a landslide in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, state authorities said. The officials said that six people lost their lives in Meghalaya and at least two others were killed in the states of Nagaland and Tripura.
A red alert warning was issued for several districts in the region after the non-stop downpour over the last three days. Rivers swollen by the lashing rain -- including the mighty Brahmaputra, which rises in the Himalayas and flows through India´s northeast towards its delta in Bangladesh -- broke their banks across the region.
The Indian army said that it had saved hundreds “in a massive rescue operation” across Manipur state. “People have been shifted to safer places”, the army said on Saturday. “Food, water and essential medicines were provided.” Conrad K Sangma, the chief minister of Meghalaya state, has ordered officials to remain on high alert “especially in landslide-prone and low-lying areas”, he said in a statement.

"Hungarians silently protest bill ‘muzzling’ NGOs, media",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317656-hungarians-silently-protest-bill-muzzling-ngos-media,"BUDAPEST: Thousands marched in silence, many with their mouths taped shut, in central Budapest on Sunday to protest a planned law that would allow the government to sanction “foreign-funded” NGOs and media.
Critics consider the bill “on transparency in public life” as the latest attempt by nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban to muzzle dissenting voices since returning to power in 2010. The legislation would empower the government to blacklist organisations that “threaten the sovereignty of Hungary by using foreign funding to influence public life”.
The government argues these measures are necessary to defend against “foreign interference”. “I believe it is important to have an independent press, and not to judge a publication based on where it gets its money from,” one of the protesters, 49-year-old Zsolt Solyom, a retired soldier, told AFP.
“What I see is that the government wants to silence any media outlet that does not speak or write according to its liking,” he added. An AFP photographer estimated that a few thousand people marched through Liberty Bridge in central Budapest in complete silence.
“Donation today, evidence of crime tomorrow?” read one of the banners. The crowd later erupted in boos and chants denouncing the ruling party as an organiser read the names of all 115 lawmakers co-sponsoring the bill.

South Korea election hit by misinformation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317657-south-korea-election-hit-by-misinformation,"SEOUL: A photo of the frontrunner bowing to a Mao Zedong statue? News reports claiming US President Donald Trump endorsed a long-shot candidate? Not true, just examples of South Korea´s election misinformation problems.
With the country set to vote on Tuesday for a new leader to replace ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached over a botched martial law declaration, there has been an explosion of false claims online.
Many of the claims focus on foreign interference, tapping into local fears of meddling by China, or fabricating support for the conservative camp from the United States. One of the most prominent falsehoods circulating online suggested weaknesses in the overseas voter registration system, with Chinese nationals exploiting the system to cast fraudulent ballots.
“Even foreigners can vote as long as they have an email address!” read one widely shared post, which AFP Fact Check debunked. Opposition leader and election frontrunner Lee Jae-myung is a popular target for disinformation.
Many claims focus on his purported allegiance to Beijing -- feeding into a long-running narrative among conservatives that casts progressive candidates as sympathetic to, or even controlled by, China. For example, photos debunked by AFP journalists showed Lee kowtowing to a Mao statue, and wearing a face mask with the Chinese flag on it.

Sudan’s prime minister dissolves government,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317658-sudan-s-prime-minister-dissolves-government,"CAIRO: Sudan’s new Prime Minister Kamil Idris has dissolved the country’s caretaker government, state news agency SUNA reported on Sunday.
SUNA did not specify when a new government, the first since war broke out between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, would be announced. Idris was appointed by army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s head of state. The RSF has said since earlier this year that it would form its own parallel government with allied parties. Idris took the oath of office on Saturday as the country’s first prime minister since a military-led coup in 2021.

China displaces old foe Japan in South Koreans’ minds ahead of vote,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317659-china-displaces-old-foe-japan-in-south-koreans-minds-ahead-of-vote,"SEOUL: Shops selling steaming snacks line the streets of Seoul´s Daerim neighbourhood, home to thousands of ethnic Chinese, some feeling the pressure from mounting anti-Beijing sentiment ahead of South Korea´s election.
China has displaced longtime foe and former colonial power Japan in many South Koreans´ minds as the country´s most distrusted neighbour in recent years. And ahead of Tuesday´s vote, anti-Chinese feeling has spread among South Koreans -- online, at right-wing rallies and in Seoul´s Chinatown.
Many of the quarter´s Chinese residents, such as 74-year-old Yu Shunzi, flocked to South Korea seeking economic opportunities in the 1990s and 2000s. “A lot of Koreans still think China is a very backward country and discriminate against Chinese a lot,” she told AFP.
Yu, who arrived in 2007 from the northeastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang, said the situation is so bad that she planned to move back when the economy allowed. “I want to go home, but with the exchange rate being this low, I´d lose a lot of money,” she said.
While former colonial master Japan has long had a difficult relationship with South Korea, Seoul´s ties with China have increasingly come under the spotlight. In 2022, polling conducted by Hankook Research showed for the first time that South Koreans distrusted China more than they did Japan -- a trend that has continued in recent years.
Former leader Yoon Suk Yeol referred to vague allegations of Chinese spying when he tried to justify his declaration of martial law, which led to his ousting.
Conspiracy theories have since run rampant among the South Korean right, fuelling the distrust. But analysts also say that a series of clashes between Beijing and Seoul in recent years over history, territory and defence are the deeper cause of the schism.
“China´s growing assertiveness is the main reason behind South Korea´s negative views about the country,” said Ramon Pacheco Pardo from King´s College London. “Most South Koreans have no affinity towards today´s China,” the international relations professor told AFP.
Seoul has long trodden a fine line between top trading partner China and defence guarantor the United States. Relations with China nosedived in 2016 following the South´s decision to deploy the US-made THAAD missile defence system.

China accuses US’s Hegseth of ‘vilifying’ remarks at security forum,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317660-china-accuses-us-s-hegseth-of-vilifying-remarks-at-security-forum,"BEIJING: China has protested to the United States against “vilifying” remarks made by Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, the foreign ministry said on Sunday, while accusing it of deliberately ignoring calls for peace from regional nations.
China has objected to Hegseth calling it a threat in the Indo-Pacific, the ministry added, describing his comments at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore on Saturday as “deplorable”. “Hegseth deliberately ignored the call for peace and development by countries in the region and instead touted the Cold War mentality for bloc confrontation, vilified China with defamatory allegations, and falsely called China a ‘threat’,” the ministry said on its website.
“The United States has deployed offensive weaponry in the South China Sea and kept stoking flames and creating tensions in the Asia-Pacific, which are turning the region into a powder keg,” it added in the statement. China’s defence ministry also weighed in, saying the US is “accustomed to using” the forum to “stoke disputes, sow discord and seek selfish interests”.
“China’s armed forces will work with other countries in the region to oppose hegemonism harming the Asia-Pacific region,” ministry spokesperson Zhang Xiaogang said in a statement posted on the ministry’s WeChat account. Hegseth had urged allies in the Indo-Pacific region, including key security partner Australia, to spend more on defence after warning of the “real and potentially imminent” threat from China.

Thousands protest in Serbia to demand elections,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1317661-thousands-protest-in-serbia-to-demand-elections,"BELGRADE: Thousands of Serbians including students gathered in over 30 cities on Sunday in the latest protest aimed at pressuring President Aleksandar Vucic to call early elections.
The Balkan nation has been rocked by student-led protests since 16 people were killed last November when the roof of a train station collapsed in Novi Sad, a disaster widely blamed on deep-rooted corruption.
“We want elections,” students chanted in Belgrade as they marched to block two major bridges in the capital Belgrade. “Over 30 cities in Serbia stopped today to send a message to the government that this can´t go on,” said Nikola, a music student.
