Sectarianism stoked to block Islamic rule: Fazl,"US
Denounces moon-sighting body, Muharram discord
JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman has claimed that certain forces stoke the flames of sectarianism to sow discord among religious scholars of different schools of thought whenever calls are made for the imposition of an Islamic system in the country.
""There are sectarian organisations in the country, but they fight each other only at the behest of some forces. Sectarianism is fanned whenever people raise their voice for an Islamic system,"" said Fazl on Saturday while addressing a digital media convention in the country's economic hub.
Denouncing the official moon-sighting system, Fazl noted that the Ruet-e-Hilal Committee has been operating without a legal framework, and attempts to access its founding documents or minutes have led nowhere.
He said if there were a proper law in place, it would lead to accountability. ""But the lack of legislation allows disputes among scholars over moon sighting to escalate into larger issues,"" he added.
Fazl lamented that no code of conduct had been developed over the past 77 years regarding Muharram processions, calling it a deliberate omission intended to pit religious groups against one another. ""At the state level, such measures are taken to keep religious factions in conflict,"" he said.
He also criticised those who advocate a wall of separation between religion and state, arguing that religion is blamed too quickly for disorder.
""However, sectarianism alone is not the sole cause of discord in the country. Ethnicity, provincialism, regionalism, and similar factors also contribute to unrest. At times, conflicts between Baloch and Pashtuns, Sindhis and Mohajirs, and other groups have led to disorder,"" he said.
He said there has never been any dispute over the Objectives Resolution, and all schools of thought are united on the Islamic provisions of the Constitution.
Fazl said the Constitution clearly states that no law can be made in the country that contradicts with teachings of Islam and its sharia. However, laws, according to him, are being made on the instruction of the International Monetary Fund, the Financial Action Task Force and the United Nations.
In this regard, he cited the example of the recent passage of a bill banning marriage under the age of 18 in Islamabad and said the religion does not impose any such restrictions.
Fazl said nowadays, highlighting vices is being considered news, especially when it comes to politicians.
""One should not go around searching for people's faults and mistakes; this is a grave sin. When a person pursues someone to exploit their weaknesses, it is highly condemnable,"" he added.
According to the JUI-F chief, some institutions running on our tax money sit in their offices and fabricate lies about politicians. He said in the media that the search for news and the effort to find good stories are natural.
""However, it is also essential to avoid evil and to distinguish between what is halal and haram.""

More than just a drink,"US
How coffee became the world's most favourite fix
Coffee's pop icon status is firmly established — from Starbucks' iconic Frappuccino turning 30 this year to the latest TikTok trends leading us to try Dalgona or cloud coffee. But beyond fads, coffee has been brewed in ceremonies and sipped in salons across time and geography. Its history is steeped in colonialism; establishments serving it have also fuelled revolutionary thinkers, reports DW.
Today, rising global temperatures and erratic rainfall are hitting farmers hard, leading coffee prices to soar to record highs. But the beverage remains — at least for now — an intrinsic part of world culture. Here's a (non-exhaustive) look at how and why it came to be that around 2 billion cups of coffee are reportedly drunk daily worldwide.
Mythical and spiritual roots
Legend credits an Ethiopian goatherd named Kaldi with discovering coffee after he'd noticed his goats becoming frisky from eating red berries. While the story is likely apocryphal, coffee — namely the Arabica variety — is indeed native to Ethiopia's Kaffa region, where it still plays a ritual role.
The Ethiopian coffee ceremony, where beans are roasted over an open flame and brewed in a clay jebena, is a moment of pause, hospitality and community.
In Senegal, cafe Touba — infused with Guinea pepper and cloves — originated from Islamic Sufi traditions and is both a beverage and spiritual practice.
In Turkey, unfiltered coffee brewed in a copper cezve is often followed by a reading of the leftover grounds, a centuries-old tradition that is still cherished, even among Turkey's Gen Zs.
In Brazil, the cafezinho — a tiny, sweet shot of coffee — is a symbol of welcome, offered everywhere from homes to street corners.
Finally in 2020, as the world hunkered down during the COVID lockdown, South Korea's Dalgona coffee — instant coffee whipped with sugar and water — exploded on TikTok. Beyond aesthetics, the trend offered people a simple, soothing ritual.
Unique flavours
Across cultures, coffee has taken wildly inventive forms. In Nordic countries like Finland and Sweden, black boiled coffee is sometimes poured over cubes of kaffeost, or ""coffee cheese,"" made from cow or reindeer milk, in a centuries-old tradition.
Vietnam's ca phe trung (or egg coffee) blends whipped egg yolk with sweetened condensed milk — a wartime improvisation that is now ubiquitous.
Then there's Indonesia's kopi luwak, often called the ""Holy Grail of Coffees,"" made from partially digested beans that have been eaten and defecated by the Asian palm civet. Though prized for its smooth, fermented flavour, kopi luwak has been ethically controversial. High demand has led some producers to cage and force-feed civets. Others now promote ""wild-sourced"" versions from free-roaming animals, but third-party verification has been inconsistent.
From sacred brew to global commodity
Coffee didn't just travel in sacks — it travelled with trade winds, spiritual journeys and imperial ambitions.
Though discovered in Ethiopia, the earliest written evidence of coffee cultivation points to Yemen. There, it earned the Arabic term ""qahwa"" — originally meaning wine - which gave rise to the words coffee and cafe.
Sufi mystics drank it to maintain spiritual focus during long night chants. The port of Mocha on Yemen's Red Sea coast became a centre of trade, shipping beans across the Islamic world and into Asia.
Another legend says that an Indian Sufi saint, Baba Budan, smuggled seven fertile beans from Yemen to southern India in the 17th century, defying an Arab monopoly. That act seeded coffee plantations in Karnataka's Chikmagalur region.
Soon, European colonial powers also grasped the bean's potential. The Dutch planted it in Java, the French in the Caribbean and the Portuguese in Brazil — each expansion driven by empire and built on the backs of enslaved labour. Brazil, introduced to coffee in the 1700s, would grow into the world's largest producer.
Even Australia, a latecomer, has developed a robust coffee culture. Fun fact: Both Australia and New Zealand claim to have invented the flat white in the 1980s.
Conspiracies, civil unrest and cats
Throughout history, cafes have been more than watering holes — they've been incubators of ideas, art and revolution.
In 16th-century Istanbul, authorities repeatedly tried to ban them, fearing that caffeine-fuelled gatherings could spark unrest.
In Enlightenment-era Europe, cafes offered a cup of coffee and a heady dose of radical thought, frequented by thinkers like Voltaire and Rousseau.
In colonial America, coffee became a patriotic substitute for British-taxed tea. Boston's Green Dragon Tavern, dubbed the ""Headquarters of the Revolution,"" hosted meetings of the Sons of Liberty — activists who organised resistance against British rule, particularly unfair taxation and policies that eventually led to the American Revolution.
Over the past decades, cafes have returned as a ""third place"" — neither home nor office, but somewhere in between. Coffeehouses have also evolved into refuges for modern life.
In the early 1990s, when home internet access was not yet widespread, many cafes started providing public internet access, which drew people to start working from those spaces.
Meanwhile, other cafe owners came up with unusual perks for their businesses.
In Taipei, the world's first cat cafe — Cat Flower Garden — opened in 1998, giving urbanites a cosy space to sip and socialise among feline companions. The trend exploded in Japan and now thrives worldwide, where the blend of caffeine and calm continues to comfort overstimulated cities.

Speak gently,"GB
Tone reveals one's hidden personality and can have severe repercussions
Throughout the centuries, rude and harsh behaviour has been a major factor in the destruction of peace and stable environments, often leading to conflict, instability, and disdain in people's hearts. A single word spoken harshly can throw the world into confusion and frustration, inviting despair and disappointment. Such behaviour can either stem from the nature or from the society that raises individuals who lack manners and gentle conduct — traits which are not inherently innate but must be nurtured.
Tone reveals one's hidden personality and can have severe repercussions. People often become reactionary when confronted with rudeness, mirroring the negativity they receive. This is the bitter harvest reaped from discourteousness. Words like ill-mannered, impertinent, impolite and thoughtless come to mind when thinking about those who misbehave. Isn't it so?
Plagued by such behaviour, countries frequently face political turmoil. This is visibly evident in state leaders who violate political decorum, often creating noisy and hostile environments in assembly halls or on media platforms — launching vitriolic attacks on each other. In doing so, they contribute to the erosion of human values. Strict social control, authoritative governance and human rights abuses often follow such displays of dominance, much to the dismay of the public.
In a world full of noise and harshness, even a small gesture of gentleness can disarm the warmonger and pave the way toward peace. A gentle speech can act as therapy during times of despair and disappointment, solving manifold problems that harsh behaviour only exacerbates. For instance, nations often resort to violence and war when faced with stern rhetoric and rigid stances. However, the same nations are willing to call a ceasefire when invited to the dialogue table - a peaceful alternative.
Kind words and moderate language open many doors to bonding and building relationships based on love and respect. The Quran emphasises this in Surah Al-Baqarah: ""And speak kindly to people."" (2:83)
All prophets throughout time have been epitomes of gentleness, teaching lessons of decency, sobriety and politeness. Yet, we seldom act upon these teachings.
Does it cost dollars to speak kindly and softly? Do we earn accolades for high-pitched voice or behaving rudely? Certainly not. Then why is the world so invested in such destructive and senseless behaviour just to showcase dominance?
Let us examine the reality: people often behave rudely to assert that ""might is right"". But in doing so, they reveal their lack of inner value, stooping to low levels while trying to belittle others. This doesn't impress the recipient — it only paints a picture of moral weakness and poor upbringing. Those who encounter such individuals often respond with dislike and contempt, rightly seeing them as troublesome and undignified.
Being kind and polite in communication wins hearts, earns respect and creates a lasting impression. Respect born out of fear is not true respect; it is mere compulsion bred from resentment. Even animals respond with loyalty when treated kindly. Humans, with their complex emotions, respond a thousand times more positively when shown love and regard.
Words carry tremendous power. Post-Pahalgam, India and Pakistan teetered on the edge of fragility. The nasty rhetoric exchanged — statements from Modi and military officials aired on the media — only inflamed hatred and animosity. If those same situations had been handled with diplomacy and dialogue, peace in the region might have been preserved. We all hoped for tranquility instead of belligerency.
In short, courteous behaviour and gentle words have the significant power to conquer everything. Therefore, create a world where people live with mutual respect and love, and let your words contribute to building an amiable environment for all. Moreover, let's avoid the world of mess and destruction. Hatred no more. Young and old, age and aged, all need the world where harmony prevails and love rules.

Minister's Bajaur house targeted once again
Unknown miscreants on Saturday launched a rocket attack on the house of the minister of state on tribal affairs, Mubarak Zeb Khan, in Bajaur district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
DPO Bajaur Waqas Rafiq confirmed the incident, stating that it occurred at 1am, after which the police immediately launched an investigation. ""The projectile damaged a portion of the minister's residence but no one was reported injured,"" he said.
This was the second attack on Khan in as many months. Last month, in May, alleged terrorists had blown up the main gate of his house with an improvised explosive device (IED).
Following the Saturday attack, Mubarak Zeb Khan issued a statement, stating that such cowardly attacks could not deter him from serving the people.
He said that the earlier attack, which occurred on May 14, was claimed by the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
He said he had been receiving threatening calls and messages from international numbers recently.
The minister suggested that operatives of the banned outfit near the Pakistan-Afghan border might have carried out the attack with the support of some local elements.
He claimed that he was being targeted due to his people-centered approach and his attempts to utilize available resources to uplift the region.
""Those involved in such attacks are clearly opposed to the ongoing development work,"" he noted.
""They contacted us through international numbers and issued threats to halt the developmental activities. But we are not afraid. The development of Bajaur will not stop."" he said.
Reaffirming their commitment, he said, ""We have confronted such elements in the past and will continue to do so. We will not back down from our mission to serve the people of this region.""
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the rocket attack, noting that such unacceptable acts of violence aimed at destabilizing peace in the region.
He directed the relevant authorities to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into the incident and to arrest the culprits. ""The government is committed to eliminate terrorism and ensure the safety and security of public representatives and citizens across the country,"" he said.

Centre agrees to resolve 'financial matters',"US
Finance advisor says NFC meeting scheduled for August
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Finance Advisor Muzammil Aslam has announced that the federal government is now willing to recognize the province's rightful shares in net hydel profit, National Finance Commission Award (NFC Award), royalties, and other revenue heads.
A meeting for the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) has been scheduled for August, and the Center has also agreed to resolve outstanding financial matters concerning the merged tribal districts, which are administratively integrated but still face economic challenges.
Addressing a post-budget press conference in Peshawar on Saturday, Aslam revealed that K-P has presented its largest-ever budget, amounting to Rs2,119 billion. He noted that the province is on track to generate Rs93 billion from its own resources. ""Whether the federation provides funds or not, we are committed to spending on the tribal areas from our own treasury,"" he declared. Aslam emphasized a shift away from reliance on federal support, announcing plans to construct the Peshawar-DI Khan Motorway independently.
He defended the provincial government's economic performance, recalling criticism when the current administration took office last year amid concerns of an empty treasury. ""Today, we have presented a Rs157 billion surplus budget,"" he said, highlighting timely salary payments and increases of 10 per cent in salaries and seven per cent in pensions for government employees in the new fiscal year. The minimum wage has also been raised to Rs40,000.
Aslam contrasted K-P's development budget of Rs547 billion with the federal government's Rs1 trillion-plus allocation, pointing out that despite being a smaller province, K-P has managed substantial development spending. He acknowledged that while the province remains under debt — currently at Rs680 billion — loan repayments have been made and a dedicated repayment fund established.
He clarified that any current inflows under debt are part of previously agreed contracts, and there are no plans for new borrowing unless required for a major project.
Criticizing the center for sidelining K-P, he stated that only Rs550 million have been allocated to the province this year. ""Despite minimal federal cooperation and receiving Rs90 billion less under NFC allocations, we increased our development budget,"" he noted. K-P also allocated Rs20 billion from its own funds to the tribal districts, demonstrating its commitment to inclusive development.

"PTI slams govt over 'bad economy, load-shedding'","US
.
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Saturday lambasted the federal government over the worsening electricity crisis, economic mismanagement and a growing assault on constitutional rights.
In a joint press conference held at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, senior PTI leaders, including Sheikh Waqas Akram, Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub and Taimur Jhagra, blasted the government.
Referring to the controversial February 8 elections, former provincial minister Taimur Jhagra warned the public not to forget how the current coalition government led by the PML-N and PPP came into power.
He said electricity tariffs under the present administration have become massively expensive compared to the previous PTI government.
""Where there used to be just a few hours of loadshedding in Punjab, now people are enduring outages lasting over 12 hours. In K-P, the temperature has hit 46 degrees Celsius and there is still no respite from prolonged power cuts,"" he said.
He dismissed the government's economic claims as ""fabricated figures"", arguing that it had failed to protect even the most basic rights of ordinary citizens. ""From agriculture to industry, all sectors are in decline. The required electricity supply is simply not reaching those who need it most,"" he said.
Jhagra also drew comparisons with regional competitors, lamenting, ""Today, Bangladesh is miles ahead of us in the power sector.""
He criticised the government's plans to privatise only three distribution companies – LESCO, FESCO and IESCO – asking, ""What national benefit can come from selectively privatising just three utilities?""
He said over six million people in the former FATA region remain without electricity access, and no one in government has taken responsibility.
""The K-P budget has been presented. Let the people see for themselves what makes the difference,"" he said, referring to the provincial government's unveiling of the budget with a total outlay of Rs2,119bn for the fiscal year 2025-26, a day ago.
Jhagra also protested that PTI leaders were being denied meetings with the incarcerated party founder, Imran Khan, questioning under what law or constitutional provision such restrictions were being imposed.
Electricity shortfall
Speaking on the occasion, Sheikh Waqas Akram lamented that the country was facing a growing shortfall between electricity demand and supply.
""The situation in rural areas is especially dire. Loadshedding in K-P and Balochistan now spans 12 to 18 hours daily. Even in Punjab, there is a minimum of four hours of outages,"" he said.
He slammed the utility privatisation narrative, saying, ""Go ahead and privatise FESCO if you wish, but what about improving the performance of LESCO, IESCO and others?""
Akram also raised alarm over the treatment of political prisoners, particularly those held in Kot Lakhpat military trials. ""These prisoners are being subjected to political vengeance. In this heat, they are being denied their basic rights, including the right to appeal,"" he said.
Senior leader Shibli Faraz stressed the power sector's centrality to the economy. ""Electricity is the engine that drives our economy. Our power sector is vast but has seen no meaningful development in recent years,"" he said, accusing PML-N and PPP of damaging the sector.
""Today, there are long hours of loadshedding in most major cities. When there's only one buyer for your power company, problems are inevitable. We introduced competition in the power sector during our tenure,"" he added.
Faraz also highlighted the growing burden of circular debt and unpaid dues of petroleum and power companies.
Omar Ayub said his speech during the federal budget session was deliberately taken off air. ""Even WiFi access was suspended during the session. They feared I would hold up a mirror to their failures,"" he claimed.
He noted that international markets are becoming unstable due to the Israel-Iran conflict, which could severely disrupt oil supplies. ""If this war continues, the country's Rs6.5 trillion deficit could worsen. Iran, a key oil hub, exports to Japan, Europe and others. Any disruption there will impact us all,"" he warned.
Ayub accused the current government of shelving PTI-era power projects and said the nation had access to significantly cheaper electricity during PTI's rule.

Man commits suicide after killing ex-wife,"GB
The victim supported herself by giving tuitions.
A prison police personnel killed his ex-wife in front of their two young daughters before taking his own life.
The police shifted both the bodies to a hospital for autopsy.
Shazia Bibi, a resident of Alvi Park in Jaranwala, had married Tanveer Ahmed, the prison police employee. It was a love marriage, but six years ago, the woman had obtained divorce through a court due to irreconcilable differences.
The victim supported herself by giving tuitions.
Tanveer, still harboring resentment, broke into Shazia's home and shot her dead in front of their daughters. He then turned the gun on himself and committed suicide.
The Jaranwala police took possession of the bodies and handed them over to the heirs after completing the legal formalities.
The police registered a case under Section 302 of Pakistan Penal Code against the deceased Tanveer on the complaint of Shazia's brother Muhammad Shehbaz.
In the FIR, Shehbaz maintained that Tanveer used to blackmail and threaten his sister for money after their divorce. On the day of the incident, he had demanded money from her and, upon her refusal, shot her dead before taking his own life.
The police said they were investigating the matter after registering the case.

An attempt to solemnise the marriage of a 13-year-old girl in Hijrat Colony was foiled on Friday after a joint operation by local police and the Women and Child Protection Cell.
According to a police spokesperson, the raid was carried out after the Women and Child Protection Cell received credible information regarding the planned child marriage. The cell immediately alerted District South SSP Mehtor Ali, who directed the Civil Lines police to take action.
A police team rushed to the address and found that preparations were underway for the underage girl's wedding. Officials intervened just in time, stopping the ceremony before it could take place.
Police asked the family to produce official documentation to verify the girl's age, which confirmed that she was only 13-year old. Acting on the minor's statement and other available evidence, police arrested the girl's parents and several others allegedly involved in organising the marriage.
A case has been registered at the Civil Lines police station under Sections 3 and 5 of the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2013, and Section 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which pertains to attempts to commit an offence.

Diesel most exposed to Mideast conflict,"US
Traders bet on rising oil prices as tensions escalate following Israeli strikes on Iran
US ultra-low sulphur diesel futures hit the highest level since February, outpacing gains in oil and gasoline as analysts warned that diesel supply is the most exposed to the conflict in the Middle East.
Israel on Friday launched the biggest-ever direct attack on Iran and said the huge wave of airstrikes was only the start of its campaign. Iran has since launched retaliatory strikes, with explosions heard over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.
Crude oil futures jumped about 7% as analysts worried Iran's response could include a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of global oil supplies traverses. Diesel futures jumped even more, surging about 8% for their biggest single-day gains since April 2022.
Diesel outperformed because the conflict's biggest impact is expected to be on the supply of medium heavy-sour crude grades, which are better suited for production of distillate fuels, StoneX oil analyst Alex Hodes said.
The Middle East is also a major export hub for distillate fuels like diesel, gasoil and jet fuel, said Matias Togni, analyst at oil market insights firm Next Barrel.
The conflict could impact liquefied natural gas (LNG) flows within the region and lead to higher diesel and fuel oil consumption for power generation, with Egypt already showing signs of such a switch, Togni said.
Combined diesel, gasoil and jet fuel exports from the Middle East averaged 1.76 million barrels per day in May, close to 2% of total world oil consumption, according to Kpler data.
Retail spike to follow
Existing inventories for diesel are already low, adding to concerns that the conflict will lower Middle East diesel exports and global production, said StoneX's Hodes.
US inventories of diesel and heating oil stood at 108.9 million barrels in the week ended June 6, about 15% below the past five years' average, US Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed.
Combined with the surge in crude oil prices, those tight inventories are likely to cause a 10-to-30-cent a gallon surge in retail diesel prices in the US over the next two weeks, GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan said.
By contrast, US gasoline stocks were slightly above the five-year average at 214.7 million barrels, the EIA data showed.
GasBuddy is estimating a five-to-15-cent per gallon jump in US gasoline prices over the coming weeks. US gasoline futures rose 8.47 cents to settle at $2.2276 a gallon on Friday, while ULSD futures rose 17 cents to settle at $2.3587 a gallon.
Traders pile into $80 oil bets
Traders on Friday exchanged the most $80 West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil call options since January, expecting more upside to prices after Israeli airstrikes on Iran sparked fears of a wider Middle East conflict.
Call options grant the holder a right to buy futures contract at the pre-set price and date and a rise in volumes can help gauge market sentiment.
About 33,411 contracts of August-2025 $80 call options for WTI crude oil were traded on Friday on a total trading volume of 681,000 contracts, marking the highest volume for these options this year, according to CME Group data
The last time trading was this high for $80 call contracts was on January 10, with 17,030 February-2025 $80 call options traded on a total trading volume of 301,866 contracts.
Oil prices jumped on Friday and settled 7% higher as Israel and Iran launched airstrikes, feeding investor worries that the combat could widely disrupt oil exports from the Middle East.
US WTI crude finished at $72.98 a barrel, up $4.94, or 7.62%. During the session, the WTI jumped over 14% to its highest since January 21 at $77.62.

India's bid to isolate Pakistan at FATF fails
India's efforts to push Pakistan back onto the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) grey list have once again failed, as the money laundering watchdog opted instead to keep the country under a ""reporting"" mechanism rather than downgrading its status, informed sources have revealed.
Pakistan was placed on the FATF's increased monitoring list (also known as the grey list) in 2018 due to concerns about its anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CFT) frameworks. However, in October 2022, the country was removed from the grey list following significant improvements and the completion of action items related to AML/CFT.
During the latest FATF meeting, the Indian delegation actively lobbied to reinsert Pakistan into the grey list. However, China supported Pakistan, advocating for relief, while Turkey and Japan also extended their full backing.
Sources said FATF opted instead to keep the country under a ""reporting"" mechanism rather than downgrading its status.
They further indicated that India, with backing from Israel, sought to use the FATF platform to pressure Pakistan. However, member states dismissed New Delhi's attempts as negative propaganda, choosing instead to recognise Islamabad's progress.
Following Operation Bunyamum Marsoos, Indian diplomatic missions had intensified campaigns against Pakistan in various countries but New Delhi's narrative failed to gain traction internationally.
Meanwhile, Federal Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb remarked that India has once again faced diplomatic failure on the global stage. He said the World Bank has approved a loan for the development of the Reko Diq mining project in Pakistan.
The FATF is the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog. It sets international standards that aim to prevent these illegal activities and the harm they cause to society.

The Pakistan People's Party (PPP) has rejected the federal budget and voiced strong reservations over the Punjab government's alleged disregard of the party in the budget-making process, sparking a war of words between PPP's Hassan Murtaza and Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari.
Speaking at a press conference at the PPP Model Town Secretariat, Hassan Murtaza, General Secretary of PPP Central Punjab, said the party was neither consulted nor were its suggestions included in the budget.
""The people will receive no relief from either the federal or the expected Punjab budget,"" he said, criticising the government's economic policies and claiming that the region's peace was being threatened by a 'Modi-style' mind-set.
Murtaza also used the occasion to launch a scathing critique of international powers, particularly the US and Israel, and questioned the credibility of global institutions like the United Nations.
""The Muslim Ummah is being forced to recite verses of jihad; this is the same strategy Modi used against Pakistan,"" he said, adding that Pakistan must strengthen its economy as much as its defense.
He lambasted the imposition of heavy taxes on agriculture, calling it a death knell for farmers. ""From petrol to fertilisers and seeds, everything has been taxed. And yet, wheat is being sold cheap while sugarcane is purchased on credit and sugar is sold in cash,"" he said.
Murtaza accused the Punjab government of operating a sugar mill mafia and claimed that rose water worth Rs320 million was sprayed on Lahore's roads while basic facilities remained unavailable to the poor.
He also criticised Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for allegedly misusing public funds for personal branding. ""Maryam Nawaz is so obsessed with self-promotion that even dustbins carry her picture. But she can't include the Prime Minister, her own uncle, in those images,"" he said.
Hitting back at the provincial government's performance, he said it had failed to deliver during its 16-month tenure. ""If you're putting your face on dustbins, then own up to the inflation too,"" he remarked. He also condemned the recent imposition of 18% tax on solar panels and said future taxes on essentials like oxygen would be the logical next step if such policies continued.
Murtaza criticised the 10% salary hike for government employees, terming it insufficient and demanded a 50% increase instead.
He also denounced what he called the humiliation of medical professionals and accused the government of pushing various departments to protest at Charing Cross rather than enabling them to serve in offices.
While reiterating the PPP's commitment to institutional reform, Murtaza said his party was ready to work with the government to fix the system but would not support exploitative policies.
He also opposed the proposed advertising bill and urged Pakistan to align itself more strongly with neighbouring Iran.
In a sharp rebuttal, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari dismissed Murtaza's remarks, saying, ""A person who couldn't even win his own seat shouldn't be lecturing us."" She claimed that in private gatherings, even Murtaza admitted that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz's governance was the real reason PPP lost ground in Punjab.
""Maryam Nawaz is not just making promises, she is fulfilling them. She's delivering real relief to people and translating dreams into reality,"" Bukhari said. Referring to Murtaza's recent visit to Sambrial, she said he had witnessed the government's work firsthand.
Bukhari further slammed the PPP leader for rejecting a budget that hadn't even been presented. ""This shows the state of your political judgment,"" she added. She emphasised that governments with vision can show results even in 16 months, while those lacking direction fail even after 16 years.

Karachi in grip of 'severe heatwave',"US
Karachi recorded a maximum temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius
The city endured second consecutive day of extremely hot and humid weather on Saturday, as low wind speeds and increased air humidity created heatwave-like conditions across the metropolis.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Karachi recorded a maximum temperature of 37.1 degrees Celsius. However, due to high humidity levels, which peaked at 65 per cent, the weather felt significantly hotter than the actual temperature, especially during the afternoon when extreme mugginess was reported.
The Early Warning Centre forecast suggests that similar hot and humid conditions are expected to persist through Sunday, with temperatures ranging between 35 and 37 degrees Celsius and elevated humidity levels continuing.
However, some relief is expected on Monday, as there is a likelihood of light to moderate rainfall accompanied by thunder and lightning.

CM hails women's interest in digital empowerment,"US
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said the centres were providing women a safe environment
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has commended the Punjab Information Technology Board's (PITB) digital programme for women's financial empowerment.
She stated, ""Integrated digital collaboration of Modern Skills Training Centres in every district of Punjab under the 'SheWins' programme is under way for women's financial independence and empowerment through e-commerce, social media marketing, content creation and other training courses.""

Gunfire targets MQM-P leader's home,"GB
MQM-P's central committee has strongly condemned the firing
The Madina Colony police have registered an FIR over a firing incident at the residence of Baldia Town Organiser of Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) Faizan Jafri.
The incident occurred in the late hours on Friday, when unidentified gunmen opened fire at Jafri's residence. The police found bullet marks on the wall of the house, and recovered five 9mm pistol shells from the scene.
The case, registered on the complaint of Jafri against unknown people, has been handed over to the investigation wing for further probe.
MQM-P's central committee has strongly condemned the firing, recalling that just days ago, party member Ali Adeel from Liaquatabad Town was martyred in a terrorist attack. The committee termed the recent assault as yet another alarming incident that raises serious concerns about the performance of Sindh Police in maintaining peace and order.
The committee demanded immediate arrest of the culprits and strict legal action against those responsible for the attack.
Meanwhile, an Anti-Terrorism Court has issued bailable arrest warrants for MQM leader Ahmed Ali, who is accused in a case of money laundering and illegal transactions worth billions of rupees.

"Iran, Israel exchange massive strikes as conflict escalates","GB
Pezeshkian vows severe, powerful response; Tehran cancels nuclear talks with Washington
Iran activated its air defences in several regions on Saturday and Israel told its citizens to take shelter ahead of a fresh barrage of missiles, as the arch-foes exchanged massive strikes in their fiercest direct confrontation in history.
The fresh attacks came after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to hit ""every target of the regime"", and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian warned further strikes would draw ""a more severe and powerful response"".
As calls for de-escalation grew, a new round of nuclear talks between the United States and Iran scheduled for Sunday was cancelled, with Iran saying it could not negotiate while under attack from Israel.
Israel's operation, which began early Friday, has targeted Iran's air defences and hit key nuclear and military sites, killing dozens of people including top army commanders and atomic scientists, according to Tehran.
On Saturday night Israel said it was simultaneously working to intercept a new salvo of missiles fired from Iran, while also carrying out strikes on ""military targets in Tehran"".
The Israeli military told citizens to heed air alerts and ""enter a protected space and remain there until further notice"".
Iran, meanwhile, announced a ""new wave"" of attacks targeting Israel.
Tehran's UN ambassador said 78 people were killed and 320 wounded in Friday's first wave of Israeli strikes.
Israel said three people were killed and 76 wounded by Iran's retaliatory drone and missile barrage overnight, which lit up the skies over Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Netanyahu vowed to keep up Israel's campaign.
""We will hit every site, every target of the ayatollah regime,"" he said in a video statement, threatening greater action ""in the coming days"".
He added that the Israeli campaign had dealt a ""real blow"" to Iran's nuclear programme and maintained it had the ""clear support"" of US President Donald Trump.
Netanyahu's defence minister, Israel Katz, warned ""Tehran will burn"" if it kept targeting Israeli civilians.
Israel's fire service reported residential buildings were hit following the latest launches.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian fired back that ""the continuation of the Zionist aggression will be met with a more severe and powerful response from the Iranian armed forces"".
According to a statement from his office, Pezeshkian also condemned Washington's ""dishonesty"" for supporting Israel while engaged in nuclear talks with Iran — which mediator Oman said would no longer take place on Sunday.
Western governments have repeatedly accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapon, which it denies.
Iran's top nuclear negotiator, Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, said the Israeli attacks undermined negotiations and were pushing the region into a ""dangerous cycle of violence"".
With world leaders seeking to contain the conflict, Trump said he and Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed in a phone call that it needed to stop.
""He feels, as do I, this war in Israel-Iran should end,"" Trump said on Truth Social.
After decades of enmity and conflict by proxy, it is the first time the arch-enemies have traded fire with such intensity, triggering fears of a prolonged conflict that could engulf the Middle East.
Highlighting the unease, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned against a ""devastating war"" with regional consequences in a call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Ankara said.
Israeli strikes have hit Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant and killed its highest-ranking military officer, Mohammad Bagheri, as well as the head of the powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami.
The Israeli military said its strikes had killed more than 20 Iranian commanders.
Iranian media reported five Guards killed Saturday in Israeli strikes, while authorities in one northwestern province said 30 military personnel had been killed there since Friday.
Iran's Red Crescent said an ambulance was hit Saturday in Urmia city, killing two.
Iran called on its citizens to unite in the country's defence, while Netanyahu urged them to rise up against against the government.
Iran's Mehr news agency said Tehran had warned Britain, France and the United States it could retaliate if they came to Israel's defence.
AFP images from the city of Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv showed blown-out buildings, destroyed vehicles and streets strewn with debris after Iran's first wave of attacks.
Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had struck dozens of targets in Israel. One Iranian missile wounded seven Israeli soldiers, the military said.
Firefighters had worked for hours to free people trapped in a Tel Aviv high-rise building on Friday.
Chen Gabizon, a resident, said he ran to an underground shelter after receiving an alert.
""We just heard a very big explosion, everything was shaking, smoke, dust, everything was all over the place,"" he said.
In Tehran, fire and heavy smoke billowed over Mehrabad airport on Saturday, an AFP journalist said.
The Israeli army said it had struck an underground military facility Saturday in western Iran's Khorramabad that contained surface-to-surface and cruise missiles.
Iranian media also reported a ""massive explosion"" following an Israeli drone strike on an oil refinery in the southern city of Kangan.
The attacks prompted several countries to temporarily ground air traffic, though on Saturday Jordan, Lebanon and Syria reopened their airspace.
Iran's airspace was closed until further notice, state media reported, as was Israel's, according to authorities.

Dualisation of Pindi-Kahuta Road greenlit,"US
Upon completion, travel time between Pindi & Kahuta will be reduced to just 40 minutes
The long-awaited project for the dualisation of the Rawalpindi-Kahuta Road, one of the most critical routes linking Rawalpindi to Azad Kashmir, has been officially incorporated into the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the fiscal year 2025-26.
The project also encompasses the construction of a four-lane overhead bridge at the Sihala Railway Gate and the development of bypasses at Sihala and Kahuta. The total cost of the project is estimated to exceed Rs23.84 billion. Upon completion, the travel time between Rawalpindi and Kahuta will be reduced to just 40 minutes.
The 28.4-kilometre stretch from Kacheri Chowk in Rawalpindi to Main Bazaar in Kahuta, passing through Sihala, serves as a vital link connecting to two key routes leading to Kotli and Rawalakot in Azad Kashmir. Currently, the absence of a dual carriageway and an overhead bridge at the Sihala Railway Gate has resulted in frequent traffic congestion, accidents, and daily casualties along this critical corridor.
The severely deteriorated condition of the single-lane road has stretched what should be a one-hour journey into a two to two-and-a-half-hour ordeal.
Increasing traffic pressure on this narrow route continuously hampers traffic flow.
To address these issues, the project has now been incorporated into the PSDP under the supervision of the National Highway Authority (NHA) as part of the ongoing development program in the federal budget.
The project got approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) on July 27, 2023. It includes the dualisation of the Kahuta Road, construction of the overhead bridge at the Sihala railway crossing, development of bypasses in Sihala and Kahuta, compensation for displaced properties, and the relocation of utility services.
It is worth noting that the Rawalpindi-Kahuta route via Sihala is the shortest path to several key destinations. Besides providing direct access to Kotli and Rawalakot in Azad Kashmir, this route also connects Kahuta to Matur, Bewar, and Kallar Syedan via Chowk Pandori, as well as Kotli Sattian and Murree.
Given the importance of this corridor, the need to dualise the Rawalpindi-Kahuta Road and construct an overhead bridge at the Sihala Railway Gate has been long-standing. Successive governments have made repeated promises to initiate and complete the project, but it remained unfinished, resulting in ongoing difficulties for commuters.
Sources say this route is an existing but incomplete NHA project. While some work had previously begun, it was left unfinished. However, it has now been decided to complete the project as swiftly as possible. The route falls under both Punjab and federal jurisdictions: from Kacheri Chowk to Sawan in Rawalpindi, including the Model Town Industrial Triangle to Sihala and Ari Syedan, the area lies within Islamabad territory; from Ari Syedan to Kahuta, the road falls under the jurisdiction of Punjab.

PM decries Israeli aggression as a threat to regional peace,"GB
Pezeshkian accuses US of 'dishonesty' amid nuclear talks
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday held telephonic conversations with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian and Turkish President Tayyip Recep Erdogan and discussed with them the Israeli aggression.
The prime minister said Pakistan stood resolutely in solidarity with the brotherly people and the government of Iran in the face of Israel's unprovoked and unjustified aggression.
He strongly condemned Israeli attacks against Iran, that violated its sovereignty and territorial integrity, and were in complete defiance of the UN Charter and international law. Iran had the right to self defence, as provided under Article 51 of the UN Charter, he added.
While expressing heartfelt condolences to President Pezeshkian over the loss of precious lives in the attacks, the prime minister recalled Pakistan's support to Iran at the UN Security Council's emergency meeting, held on Friday.
The PM denounced Israel's blatant provocations and adventurism as a grave threat to regional and global peace and stability. He also strongly condemned Israel's unabated genocidal campaign against the valiant Palestinians, carried out with complete impunity.
He urged the international community and the United Nations to take urgent and credible steps to put an end to Israel's aggressive behaviour and its illegal actions. He stated that Pakistan was fully committed to promoting peace in the region and stood ready to play its role in this context.
President Pezeshkian thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for Pakistan's support and solidarity with Iran at this difficult time, particularly at the UN Security Council. He said this gesture was reflective of the close and brotherly relations between the two countries.
He apprised the PM about Iran's perspective on the crisis with Israel and urged the international community, particularly the Islamic countries, to work together closely to counter these threats.
Both leaders agreed to remain in close contact.
The Iranian president criticised what he described as the United States' ""dishonesty"" for supporting Israel while Washington and Tehran were engaged in nuclear talks. ""The Zionist regime's coordination with the United States in its aggression against Iranian territory in the midst of negotiations is a sign of America's dishonesty and unreliability,"" Pezeshkian said in a phone call with the prime minister, according to the Iranian presidency.
He warned that there would be a ""more severe and powerful response"" if Israel continued to strike his country.
""The continuation of Zionist aggression will be met with a more severe and powerful response from the Iranian armed forces,"" Pezeshkian told the prime minister, according to the Iranian presidency.
The prime minister also held a telephone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkiye and the two agreed that ""Israel's unprovoked aggression against Iran"" was ""a blatant violation of international law and a threat to regional peace"".
Both the leaders discussed the deeply worrying situation in the region in the wake of Israel's unprovoked and unjustified aggression against Iran.
The two leaders agreed that Israel's military strikes had violated Iran's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in clear contravention of the UN Charter and international law, while seriously jeopardizing regional and global peace and stability. They also denounced Israel's brazen military aggression against the brave Palestinian people, that continued with complete impunity.
The two leaders emphasized that the international community and the United Nations must act collectively and urge Israel to immediately end its aggressive posturing and illegal actions against Iran, Palestine and other countries in the region.
While renewing Pakistan's firm and unwavering commitment to upholding international peace, security and stability, the Prime Minister said that Pakistan would continue to play a constructive role for peace, both as member of the UN Security Council, as well as in other forums such as the OIC.
In this regard, the prime minister said that Deputy Prime Minister & Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar would represent Pakistan at the upcoming OIC CFM meeting in Istanbul. He also congratulated President Erdogan for being decorated by the Islamic Cooperation Youth Forum (ICYF).
OIC session
Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif called on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to hold an emergency meeting to develop a joint strategy in response to Israel's ongoing aggression.
Speaking in the National Assembly, the minister condemned Israel's brutal actions, especially its military aggression against Iran.
He called it a serious threat to regional and global peace. ""Palestinian children are being killed, yet there are more protests in non-Muslim countries than in Muslim nations,"" he remarked with regret.
He warned that if the Muslim world doesn't act together, every country will eventually become a target. ""The way Israel has targeted Yemen, Iran, and Palestine shows a larger plan. Most Muslim nations are already facing security risks. Strong leadership is needed now,"" he said.
He highlighted how the world was closely watching Pakistan's coastal borders during recent tensions, and how Pakistan's armed forces defended the nation bravely. ""Our navy's response forced the enemy to retreat,"" he said.
The defence minister said that while Pakistan's military strength is commendable, the economy must also be strong.
He praised Pakistan's youth, especially cyber experts, for delivering a strong blow to India during a recent cyber conflict. ""Our young people shut down lights in stadiums, disrupted IPL matches, and even affected dams. Their skills surprised the world,"" he said.
He added that the recent military operation Bunyanum Marsoos was a turning point, both strategically and for national morale. He said Pakistan's response to Indian attacks was firm and timely. ""We struck back with full force,"" he said.
Members of parliament have called for an urgent meeting of the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) to stop the Israeli war in Gaza and now in Iran.
They said that the attack by Israel on Iran is an open terrorist act.
They said that it is the need of the hour that all Muslim states should show their unity against Israeli aggression.

Sir David Beckham achieves ultimate goal,"US
The 50-year-old was knighted on Friday for being a global football and fashion icon
David Beckham's knighthood is the culmination of years of tireless efforts to transcend football and turn himself into a global icon at the ""intersection of sport, fashion and business.""
He had long dreamed of becoming a sir and King Charles III made it a reality when he announced his birthday's honours list on Friday, marking the end of a decades-long journey travelled with his Spice Girl wife Victoria, creator of the eponymous fashion brand.
The honour, one of the highest bestowed by the UK state, ""is a powerful symbolic marker"", Marie Agnes Parmentier, professor of marketing at the University of Montreal and author of several papers on ""Posh and Becks"", explained to AFP. It ""reinforces his image as a respectable, committed, and, first and foremost, British man,"" she added.
The knighthood could present new opportunities for the 50-year-old former Manchester United and Real Madrid player, ""particularly in diplomatic, charitable or political spheres"", said Parmentier.
The former free-kick ace, from a modest East London background, diversified his career after retiring from football in 2013, but success was the result of planning long before he hung up his boots.
""I knew my career was going to end at some point and I wanted to have a career after football,"" he said in the documentary series ""Beckham"", which aired on Netflix in 2023.
Pioneer
At the height of his football career, Beckham was signing deals with top clothing and beauty brands, building an audience that cut across gender, age and nationality — becoming the first England player to crack the US market.
The successful brand was built on his always immaculate appearance and nearly-always exemplary off-field behaviour, coupled with an unwavering drive to become a pioneer.
This required a certain amount of courage, given that English football in the 1990s was generally the preserve of no-nonsense lads more interested in the pub than the catwalk.
His appearance in a sarong during the 1998 World Cup, revelations that he used make-up, and his eccentric hairstyles were all feverishly gobbled up by the UK's tabloid press.
Beckham is still capitalising on the fascination, almost 30 years later. He unveiled his first collection for Hugo Boss in April, is the founder of the Inter Miami football club and the ""Studio 99"" production company, and has been a UNICEF ambassador for 20 years.
He is now best known not for football, ""but for being Beckham, the brand"", said sociologist Ellis Cashmore.
It is a brand worth £500 million ($676 million), according to The Times newspaper's 2025 ranking.
From Outcast to Hero
The Netflix show exposed the couple to an emerging younger audience, cementing their fame for the foreseeable future.
Beckham ""embodies a celebrity at the intersection of sport, fashion, entertainment and business,"" explained Parmentier.
The couple's enduring visibility ""is based on a sophisticated media strategy and an ability to embody universal values such as work, family and style,"" she added.
But it has been a long and bumpy road, Cashmore pointed out.
In 1998, Beckham was called the most hated man in England after he petulantly kicked out at Argentina's Diego Simeone during their World Cup round of 16 game.
Beckham was harshly sent off and England lost to their bitter rivals in a penalty shoot-out. Those who had bitten their tongue about his off-field flamboyance gave full vent to their feelings.
National headlines the next day included ""10 Heroic Lions, One Stupid Boy"" (Daily Mirror) and ""You're Just A Joke Becks"" (Daily Mail). Months of ""hell"" followed, with death threats, spitting and boos accompanying Beckham wherever he went.
""Wherever I went I got abused, every single day,"" he said.
""I find it hard to talk through what I went through because it was so extreme. The whole country hated me."" But the ordeal only sharpened Beckham's focus.
A year later, he finished second in the Ballon d'Or as he helped Manchester United claim an unprecedented treble, winning the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup.
It was often said that Beckham's career seemed to be scripted by a movie writer, never more so than when the fallen idol took his revenge by scoring the winning goal against perennial rivals Argentina in the 2002 World Cup, redeeming his national hero status.

Hilly areas witness record holiday rush,"GB
The DG emphasised the authority's commitment to sustainable tourism
Director General of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Culture and Tourism Authority (KPCTA), Habibullah Arif, has reported a remarkable surge in tourism during the three-day Eidul Azha holidays, with approximately 700,000 tourists visiting popular destinations across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Speaking exclusively to a private news channel, DG Arif expressed enthusiasm over the strong turnout. ""We are thrilled to witness such an overwhelming response from tourists. K-P's breathtaking landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and warm hospitality have made it a preferred destination this year,"" he said.
Breaking down the numbers, Arif noted that Swat welcomed around 288,000 visitors, Galyat saw 177,000, and Chitral and Upper Dir jointly received 100,000 tourists.
Other top spots like Naran-Kaghan and Malam Jabba also drew large crowds, attracting visitors seeking natural beauty, adventure, and cultural experiences.
""Tourists were drawn by the region's stunning scenery, outdoor activities, and vibrant traditions,"" he added.
The DG emphasised the authority's commitment to sustainable tourism, stating, ""We are focused on enhancing our infrastructure, improving services, and providing facilities to accommodate the growing number of tourists. Our goal is to ensure every visitor enjoys a safe and memorable experience.""
He also highlighted efforts to maintain affordability and comfort, saying, ""Within our available resources, we are ensuring the provision of quality food and working to regulate the prices of food and hotel services.""
In a bid to diversify tourist offerings, Arif said the KPCTA is actively identifying hidden gems across the province and organising camping and adventure tourism activities to showcase K-P's lesser-known natural wonders.

A budget of contrasts,"GB
Federal revenues are chronically short of the target every year, leaving province at risk of a significant shortfall
The Sindh government's Rs3.45 trillion budget for the upcoming fiscal year sees an almost 13% increase while increasing much-needed public spending in some areas, but at the same time, leaving unanswered questions about fiscal sustainability. Sindh has outsized significance for our economy — mostly due to the country's commercial capital, Karachi — and its budget priorities can have a major influence on economic activity in other parts of the country.
The large projected deficit — almost Rs38.5 billion — and heavy reliance on federal transfers may face complications due to Islamabad's own precarious finances. But at least the money is being spent on the right things. Over Rs523 billion has been earmarked for education, including Rs156 billion for primary education.
Health funding rises to Rs326.5 billion, some of which will help cover the construction of a new hospital in Larkana and SIUT oncology centres across the province. Poverty alleviation measures, farm subsidies and upgrades to transportation infrastructure, including Karachi's public transport system, are among the other notable spending areas.
However, some of the relief measures in the budget could prove crippling, especially the removal of several taxes and reduction in others. Federal revenues are chronically short of the target every year, leaving the province at risk of a significant shortfall. Salary and pension hikes, though necessary, also represent a large outlay.
Given Sindh's high dependence on federal transfers, the federal shortfall alone could deprive the province of enough revenue to throw a spanner into the works. But if Sindh can stimulate significant improvements without republic support, it could become a national benchmark — as long as Washington, DC and other world capitals do not treat audiences too harshly. Rational decisions are rarely enough to inspire the US to take a break.

"Before 18 is not a crime, after 18 is not a cure: rethinking","US
The decree raises the legal age of marriage to 18 for both boys and girls in the ICT
Amidst the fête of a so-called HerStoric moment not only by Pakistani feminists but anyone with simple common sense, I am once again mentioning the unpopular questions I have been asking since 2003, long before this issue of legal age of marriage aligned with donor-driven priorities or became fashionable in policy circles. In chorus, a relapsing outbreak of moral panic is being orchestrated by self-appointed sentries of Islam and selectively spread ""ethics"" that almost always concern themselves with the conduct, corpora and choices of women and girls.
The decree raises the legal age of marriage to 18 for both boys and girls in the ICT and mandates strict punishment most notably for the nikkah-khawan who solemnises such unions. This may provide symbolic relief to rights-based stakeholders. What remains concealed is the country's continued inability to address the issue of adolescent sexuality, social vulnerability and child protection with depth and context. A daring detailed reevaluation reveals that Pakistan is celebrating a partial fix for a deeply complex problem.
As of now, only two regions, Sindh and Islamabad, have enacted laws clearly setting the minimum marriage age at 18. Sindh led the way in 2014 with the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act. In contrast, other four regions maintain to manage under the colonial-era Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929. Punjab could only amend the original 1929 Act in 2015, maintaining a minimum marriage age of 16 for girls. Meanwhile, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan continue to operate under the outdated 1929 Act, with no substantial amendments to address child marriage.
In December 2015, a bill tabled by the Parliamentary Secretary for Law, calling for making marriages under the age of 18 illegal in Gilgit-Baltistan, was blocked by legislators who called it ""un-Islamic"", and ""against divine law"". After the strong opposition, the bill was referred to a select committee for review where it remains buried. Even today, nearly all provinces lack a determined drive toward legal and social protection of millions of children and adolescents.
Not all early marriages are child marriages. But what we are witnessing in many cases is not marriage at all; it is institutionalised child sexual abuse and a legitimised harmful ritual. When such unions are later nullified, these victims are shoved to carry the stigma of being divorced. Can our system handle that reality?
Do we have support mechanisms in place? The answer is no. The state institutions are not available to fathom the compounding trauma and there is no accountability on inaction. Entitling an underage and uninformed arrangement a ""marriage"" should itself be a cognisable crime.
Rethinking without donor-supported projects is among many other tabooed territories and forbidden fruits in Pakistan. No wonder people like myself never got powerful allies who could dare Rethinking the ""Child"" in Child Marriage. The term ""child"" itself needs exploration. Legally, children are under 18. But functionally, our own laws allow for layered maturity: one can get a learner's driving licence at 16, work part-time in informal sectors even earlier, and face adult-style accountability in many contexts before turning 18. From a public health lens, the 10-19 age bracket covers early and late adolescence, a group often left in a policy vacuum. They are not children, and not fully empowered youth either.
Adolescents have distinct sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) needs, which neither laws nor public discourse are willing to acknowledge. This discarding stems from a toxic concoction of cultural abjuration, lack of sex education and fear of addressing ""morality"".
As per the WHO, pregnancy during adolescence can be associated with increased risks of preeclampsia, premature birth and other health complications. The real risk is pregnancy. Early marriage (post-18), if informed and consensual, is safer than delaying marriage while denying sexuality and reproductive rights. The social cost of delayed marriage in a selectively traditional society is high, particularly when there are no alternatives for safe relationships.
The call to action must extend beyond a single piece of legislation, because one law is neither a reform nor a revolution. If we correctly care about our children including adolescents, we must confront the root causes of child marriage and exploitation with a comprehensive, multi-layered approach. This includes introducing community-based, age-appropriate SRHR education; raising awareness about the safe age for pregnancy with a focus on reducing health risks; and guaranteeing compulsory education for all children for at least 14 years.
The burden should not fall on poor nikah-khawans alone, as scapegoating them ignores the systemic failure to prevent violence and protect children. We must promote responsible parenting, strengthen family and community-based support networks and provide helplines and counseling services for adolescents in distress.
Pakistan must develop and implement a strong national adolescent policy that addresses physical health, mental well-being, SRHR, education and livelihoods. And above all, the state must ban forced marriages at any age, because consent is not a comfort, it is a non-negotiable human right.
While fully regarding the hardwork of our legislators, especially the women lawmakers, it remains a fact that our legislators, largely from affluent backgrounds, have borrowed vision and continue to draft bills that reflect donor glossaries rather than ground realities. We must contextualise these issues within our own religious and socio-economic frameworks.
Islam does not oppose the safeguarding of public health through SRHR education and protection. These aspects deserve greater media attention, and the existing law should be expanded accordingly.
Do not call abuse ""marriage"". If Pakistan is to protect its young people not just from ""child marriage"" but from the embedded exploitation then we must build a society where sexuality is comprehended, not dreaded, and where rights are respected, not refuted.
A law in Islamabad is a (delayed) start. But justice for adolescents demands much more.

"As BTS completes 12 years, fans gear up for return","PL
All but one member left to finish military service
Dressed in purple, thousands of BTS fans marked the K-pop supergroup's 12th anniversary Friday, with all but one member now finished with their military service and a return to performance likely imminent, reported AFP.
The septuplet BTS, South Korea's most lucrative musical act, has been on a self-described hiatus since 2022 while its members separately completed their military service, which is mandatory in the South for all men under 30.
This week, four members of the band wrapped up their army duties and reentered civilian life, with the final member SUGA, who was doing alternative service for health reasons, due to be released next week.
Thousands of fans, many wearing purple outfits and carrying light sticks, started gathering Friday for the group's annual FESTA celebration, which marks the anniversary of their debut.
The main event is being held in a massive event space in Goyang, just outside of Seoul, with local authorities saying they had set up ""photo spots"" across the entire city, ""turning the whole city into an extended festival stage"".
""We warmly welcome ARMY fans from around the world who will be visiting the city,"" said mayor Lee Dong-hwan.
Last year's FESTA, held outdoors in scorching heat with midday temperatures reaching 32 degrees Celsius, drew criticism from fans after dozens reportedly suffered from heat-related illnesses.
""I'm so glad this time the FESTA is held indoors,"" Maria Wojcik, a 28-year-old fan from Poland, told AFP.
Fans have also been gathering in Seoul outside the group's agency HYBE's headquarters, which has been wrapped with the slogan ""WE ARE BACK"".
With the fan frenzy in full swing, a Chinese woman was briefly detained, police said Thursday, for a possible attempted break-in at BTS singer Jungkook's luxury apartment in Seoul, just hours after he was released from military service.
HYBE happy
BTS member J-Hope is set to hold a concert at a nearby venue on the day of the FESTA celebration, and many fans are hoping the recently discharged members will join him on stage for a special performance.
The fans may be excited for a reunion, but no one is more thrilled by the pending return to performance of BTS than their agency, HYBE, which stands to see a sharp rebound in earnings.
Before their military service, HYBE's CEO Lee Jae-sang said that the band's contribution to the company's revenue was exactly 95 per cent, adding that ""as of 2024, it is estimated to be under 20 per cent"".
But analysts are predicting a surge in profits with the group's return.
""HYBE recorded its first earnings decline during BTS's military service period, but with the group's full return, profits are expected to grow by around 150 per cent over the next two years through 2026,"" said Lee Ki-hoon, an analyst at Hana Securities.
""With BTS resuming a large-scale world tour, HYBE's operating profit is projected to rise 71 per cent on-year to 462 billion won ($340 million) next year,"" Hwang Ji-won from IM Securities told AFP.
The comeback also coincides with signs that China's unofficial ban on Korean pop culture — imposed in retaliation after Seoul allowed deployment of a US-made THAAD missile defence system — may be easing under South Korea's new administration.
South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung took office after a snap election last week, promising a more pragmatic diplomacy than his hawkish predecessor.
If so, experts say concert attendance is expected to soar, with China being a key market for K-pop.
""Considering the scale of the tour that was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19 and the pent-up demand, the group (BTS) is expected to draw at least 3 million concertgoers,"" added Hwang.

ICC turns down India's request to host future WTC finals,"GB
Confirms next three WTC finals will be held in England
The International Cricket Council (ICC) has turned down the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) request to host the upcoming World Test Championship (WTC) Finals, confirming that the next three finals — in 2027, 2029, and 2031 — will continue to be held in England, according to a report.
Despite repeated calls from the BCCI to rotate the WTC final among different Test-playing nations, the ICC has decided to maintain its current strategy of hosting the final in England.
As reported by The Telegraph UK, the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has already been informed of the ICC's decision to stage the next three finals in the country.
Since the WTC was introduced in 2019, England has hosted all of its finals. New Zealand defeated India in the inaugural edition at Southampton in 2021, and Australia beat India at The Oval in 2023. The ongoing 2025 final between Australia and South Africa is currently taking place at Lord's Cricket Ground in London.
""English cricket is close to securing hosting rights for the next three WTC finals, despite India's strong interest in bringing the event home,"" the report stated.
The final decision will likely be formalised during the ICC's Annual Conference in Singapore next month, with planning for the 2027 final expected to begin shortly after the current edition concludes. Interestingly, although England has hosted every WTC final so far, its national team is yet to make an appearance in one. However, the ICC continues to choose England as the host due to commercial benefits and convenient logistics.
Markram enters elite club
South Africa's Aiden Markram etched his name into the record books on Friday by scoring a remarkable century in the fourth innings of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) Final against Australia at Lord's.
After being dismissed for a duck in the first innings, Markram bounced back with a composed and unbeaten 102 off 159 balls on Day 3, helping South Africa take control of the match. His knock puts him alongside Australia's Travis Head and Steve Smith as only the third batter to score a hundred in a WTC final.
Head scored 163 and Smith 121 during the 2023 WTC final against India.
Batters to score a century in a WTC Final: Travis Head (AUS): 163 vs India, 2023, Steve Smith (AUS): 121 vs India, 2023, Aiden Markram (SA): 102* vs Australia, 2025.
Markram's century is also historic for South African cricket. He became the first South African to score a hundred in the fourth innings of a Test at Lord's. Additionally, he is the first overseas player to achieve this feat at the iconic ground since Michael Clarke did so in 2009.

Lawmakers demand tax relief for masses,"PL
PPP MNA opposes granting arrest powers to income tax officers
Lawmakers in the National Assembly on Saturday delivered a detailed and constructive review of the federal budget for FY2025-26 and called for providing more relief to the common man.
While participating in the general discussion on the budget, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said Pakistan suffered huge losses due to tax evasion, especially in sectors like tobacco, real estate, steel, and tyres. ""We lose around Rs300 billion annually in tobacco taxes alone.""
He acknowledged that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made some improvements, but much more needs to be done. ""If we can just improve our tax collection by 50%, we wouldn't need foreign loans,"" he noted.
He demanded accountability and urged the finance ministry and the FBR to brief parliament on the large-scale tax evasion and the people behind it. ""We need honesty in governance. Only then can we provide real relief to the people,"" he said.
He gave the example of how public shops in Punjab are rented for very low rates, while private shops in the same area earn ten times more. ""This has continued for decades without accountability,"" he pointed out.
He called for a national campaign to end corruption, particularly in sectors dominated by a few corrupt families.
Asif praised Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, calling him a professional and experienced person. He credited him for bringing back international trust in Pakistan's economy.
He shared encouraging economic data: GDP growth improved from -0.2% to +2.7%, inflation dropped to 4.6%, and the current account posted a $1.2 billion surplus. foreign investment rose by 20%.
He admitted that the public may still be feeling economic pressure but said positive changes are happening. ""The business community is showing more confidence, and the stock market recently hit a historic 125,000-point high,"" he said.
He criticized those who now attack the government's economic policy but had once urged the IMF not to support Pakistan. ""These people tried to sabotage our economy,"" he said.
""Pakistan is not about any one person. It is a mission, a belief, and a shared history,"" he added. He urged political leaders to rise above personal ambitions and serve the nation with sincerity.
PPP senior leader Mirza Ikhtiar Baig emphasised the pivotal role of the industry, agriculture and services sector in driving long-term economic stability.
Acknowledging the ongoing economic challenges, he said the government's push toward reforms, though modest GDP growth of 2.6% continues to be overshadowed by inflation, population pressure and mounting national debt.
He raised concern over pension reforms, particularly the withdrawal of posthumous benefits for pensioners' children after 10 years, warning this could create financial distress for many families.
The lawmaker also cautioned against harsh tax enforcement measures, such as granting arrest powers to income tax officers, which he said could dampen business confidence.
However, he welcomed incentives in the construction and property sectors, including the reduction in withholding tax on property transactions from 4% to 2.5%, elimination of federal excise duty on commercial property transfers and reduction of stamp duty in Islamabad from 4% to 1% — measures expected to boost real estate activity.
He also supported the increased defense budget, recognizing the valor and international standing of Pakistan's armed forces, particularly in light of recent hostilities.
Mirza Ikhtiar praised the record-breaking $38 billion in remittances sent by overseas Pakistanis and called for an export-led growth model, especially through sectors like IT and rice.
PTI legislator Asad Qaiser urged the government to revisit its decision to impose new taxes in the erstwhile FATA region, emphasising the area's sacrifices in the war on terror.
Qaiser warned that further burdens could hinder socio-economic rehabilitation.
He also highlighted issues of power outages and damage to household appliances in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa due to erratic electricity supply, urging greater PSDP allocations for the province.
Qaiser raised alarms about the tobacco sector, noting the lack of a fixed minimum support price, which is driving companies out of K-P. He called for urgent government intervention to protect farmers.
Senior MQM leader Dr. Farooq Sattar hailed the armed forces for their resilience during recent Pakistan-India tensions, crediting divine help and national unity under Field Marshal General Asim Munir.
He appreciated relief measures for salaried classes in the budget but warned that the middle class continues to bear a disproportionate tax burden.
Farooq Sattar urged reforms to reduce electricity and gas tariffs and proposed a national economic dialogue to adopt a unified ""Charter of Economy.""
He stressed the importance of taxing agricultural income through provincial consensus under Article 177 to improve Pakistan's fiscal credibility with international lenders. Condemning Israeli aggression, he reaffirmed solidarity with Iran amid recent tensions.
PPP stalwart Syed Naveed Qamar took a strategic view, asserting that the federal budget must not be limited to a balance sheet but should reflect a coherent economic vision.
He stressed that budgetary allocations must align with policy goals rather than serve as mere political optics.
Naveed Qamar criticized the neglect of agriculture, especially in terms of food security and misdirected subsidies that favor foreign producers over domestic farmers.
He lamented that serious economic reformers are often sidelined while superficial narratives dominate policymaking.
Naveed Qamar criticized Pakistan's reliance on international lenders and the failure to promote domestic exports, particularly in the cotton sector.
The fertilizer subsidies and price controls, he argued, have hurt small farmers while benefiting powerful industrial lobbies.
Naveed Qamar has called for the adoption of a clear, flexible, and consistent economic policy in anticipation of potential global oil price hikes, warning that the country cannot afford to remain tethered to outdated and reactive financial planning models.
He cautioned that international oil price fluctuations pose direct risks to Pakistan's fiscal strategy, inflation targets, and energy affordability.
He criticized the government for preparing budgets based on optimistic oil price assumptions without accounting for geopolitical volatility.
""In recent years, our budgets were framed based on declining global oil prices. But if the situation in the Middle East worsens and prices suddenly spike, do we have an alternative strategy in place?"" he asked, urging the finance ministry to explain whether price increases would be passed on to consumers or absorbed through subsidies.
He stressed that such vital economic variables demand transparency and contingency planning. ""There must be clarity. If the benchmark price increases by 20%, what is the fallback? Ad hocism will not take us forward.""
Naveed Qamar underlined the need for economic policies that transcend partisan agendas and prioritize institutional coherence. ""We hear at the Prime Minister's level about the need for policy consistency. But if decisions continue to be made in silos, without coordination, instability will persist.""
He also urged serious consultation among political leadership, bureaucratic institutions, and the business community, warning against policy capture by a select few. ""It's unacceptable that one individual travels abroad and makes decisions on the nation's behalf, while key institutions remain unaware. Responsible policymaking requires collective ownership.""
He criticized the enduring influence of those who, he alleged, negotiated economically detrimental deals in past decades, leading to chronic dependence on external actors. ""The same people who committed the country 30 years ago are still writing our policies. If we want sovereignty, we must abandon these recurring policy patterns.""
He stressed the need for a forward-looking, sovereign, and inclusive economic framework — one that replaces reaction with resilience. ""We must move beyond fire-fighting. Only with vision, transparency, and consensus can we break the cycle of economic instability.""
Taking part in the debate, MNA Zartaj Gul stressed the need for increased budgetary allocations for women empowerment, calling it vital for the uplift of a key segment of society.
She also warned of the grave threat posed by climate change and called for greater resources to mitigate its impact.
Stressing the importance of regional equality, she urged a fair share of development funds for the Saraiki belt, noting its population is comparable to other provinces.
Haji Jamal Shah Kakar lauded Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif for earmarking Rs 250 billion for Balochistan, terming it a long-overdue recognition of the province's importance. He welcomed allocations for infrastructure and highways but stressed the need for transparency and proposed the formation of a monitoring committee to ensure efficient fund utilization.
PPP MNA Syeda Shehla Raza condemned the Israeli aggression against Iranian civilians, calling for global accountability.
She criticized the federal budget for raising taxes and imposing a carbon levy while neglecting Karachithe country's economic hub. Opposing a new Danish university in Islamabad, she argued that existing institutions remain underfunded.
She also highlighted the decline in oil and gas output, despite discoveries in Khairpur, and advocated urgent reforms. On a positive note, she welcomed the Reko Diq project, saying it could contribute 1% to Pakistan's GDP next year.
Iqbal Afridi raised serious concerns regarding the rehabilitation of the merged districts (former FATA), urging the government to expedite the reconstruction of destroyed homes and ensure the return of displaced populations. He also demanded the withdrawal of newly imposed taxes in tribal areas and criticized delays in releasing development funds.
Asia Naz Tanoli commended Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for enhancing Pakistan's international image and improving the value of the green passport. She described the budget as balanced and people-centric, acknowledging the difficult decisions taken to pursue economic reform and national security.
PPP's Sharmila Faruqui pointed out that nearly 70% of the national budget is consumed by debt servicing, leaving limited space for development.
Citing Khawaja Asif's statement, she revealed that Rs 5.8 trillion was lost last year due to tax loopholes, subsidies, and concessions. She called for comprehensive tax reforms to ease the burden on the salaried and middle-income classes.
MQM-P MNA Sofia Saeed Shah noted that although Rs 3.2 billion has been allocated for the KV-4 water project in Karachi, the amount falls short of the rising costs. She recalled MQM's earlier proposal of Rs 30 billion for the project and questioned the government's claims of reducing electricity prices while increasing levies on fuel.
SIC lawmaker Shahzada Muhammad Gushtasap Khan stressed the need to increase allocations for education and health. He praised KP's 100% free healthcare program, attributing its success to effective provincial policy.
Syed Ali Qasim Gillani demanded more investment in higher education in South Punjab to improve access. Emphasizing agriculture as the backbone of the economy, he urged greater support for crop production. He welcomed increases in the budgets for the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and the information technology sector.
MNA Muhammad Aslam Ghuman condemned Israel's aggression, calling it the ""world's biggest terrorist,"" and reaffirmed Pakistan's solidarity with Muslim nations. He advocated for more support for farmers to ensure food security.
Moin Aamer Pirzada called for widening the tax base by expanding the filer network. He also urged a review of the decision to end pensions for deceased government employees, stressing the need for humane policy revisions.
PPP lawmaker Nawabzada Mir Jamal Raisani highlighted the federal budget's role in setting the country's economic direction. While welcoming the government's target of 4.2% economic growth and the allocation of special allowances for the armed forces, he expressed disappointment over the lack of substantial allocations for Balochistan.
However, he appreciated the establishment of four Daanish Schools in the province and called for vocational training institutes to empower local youth.
MNA Sajid Khan demanded the establishment of a Danish School in the merged tribal areas and emphasized coordinated efforts between federal and provincial governments to maintain peace in the region.
SIC legislator Umair Khan Niazi criticized the budget and urged the inclusion of more high-net-worth individuals in the tax net. He called for increased allocations for agriculture and concrete support for farmers.
PPP's Salahuddin Junejo raised the long-standing issue of the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway project and urged the Prime Minister to reconsider its funding. He advocated a structured agricultural policy to improve productivity. Highlighting injustices in his constituency, he said locals were not benefiting from natural gas extracted from the region and demanded job and resource rights for local residents.
Junejo also thanked the Prime Minister for dispatching Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on diplomatic missions, praising his effective representation of Pakistan on the global stage.

Health experts urge safe meat consumption,"US
Remove excess fat from the meat before cooking
Health experts have urged citizens to adopt proper meat preservation and consumption practices post Eidul Azha to avoid health risks, particularly in light of high temperatures and electricity load-shedding.
Speaking to a private news channel on Saturday, Associate Professor and Gastroenterologist Dr Abdullah bin Khalid from Aga Khan University Hospital, emphasised that qurbani meat should ideally be consumed fresh and prepared using healthy cooking methods such as steaming or boiling, rather than frying or processing.
Dr Abdullah warned that excessive consumption of red meat, especially in processed forms, poses health risks. He referred to World Health Organisation (WHO) findings that link red meat consumption to several health issues, adding that the American Heart Association recommends limiting red meat intake to 350 grams per week.
He offered the following guidelines for handling and preparing qurbani meat: Remove excess fat from the meat before cooking. Use healthy oils such as extra virgin olive oil, canola oil, or sunflower oil.
Avoid high flames and overcooking, as these reduce the nutritional value of meat. Cook on low heat to preserve nutrients. Pair meat with fresh salads and green chutney for a balanced meal.
For patients with heart conditions, high cholesterol, or angina, Dr Abdullah advised moderation rather than complete avoidance. ""We don't recommend cutting meat out entirely, but it must be consumed in controlled portions,"" he said.

The insecurity of power,"US
This manifests, among other ways, in the rising authoritarianism and securitisation of democracies worldwide.
For millennia, humankind has feared ferocious beasts, unforeseen calamities, ""divine retributions"", forces beyond comprehension, and natural phenomena beyond their control. Notwithstanding the powerlessness and inherent ignorance in prehistoric times, some individuals seized opportunities to emerge as leaders — such as the 'big men' or chiefs — who embodied mythical figures like Prometheus, Heracles, Theseus, Perseus, Apollo and Asclepius, selflessly pursuing their people's welfare and guiding them, however briefly and imperfectly, to safety and light.
This was primarily because the legitimacy of most of them was rooted in transparency, proven abilities and a consensus built sincerely, albeit informed by limited knowledge. However, as societies became more complex and knowledgeable, so did the rules of legitimacy and the nature and scope of transactions between the rulers and the ruled.
The evolution of language, which drives reason, logic, and philosophy, has equipped humans with reliable tools to examine themselves and their environment, shedding light on their ignorance and gaining a deeper understanding of their surroundings. From nascent reasoning to the Socratic and dialectical methods, and from the Age of Enlightenment and the Renaissance to the dawn of the scientific method, all helped liberate humankind from threats - real or perceived - posed by nature and from fears rooted in nature's apparent meaninglessness or the metaphorical tabula rasa of human cognition.
These developments, which have dispelled the fog of ignorance and introduced humanity to greater knowledge, ethical understanding and political education, should ideally have fostered greater transparency in statesmanship and collective affairs, promoting an informed collective will and legitimacy in statecraft. However, greater knowledge has fostered enlightened deceit and hypocrisy, which perpetuate carefully controlled ignorance or empower influential figures with vested interests in society, thus fostering opacity and undermining legitimacy in modern statecraft and statesmanship.
This manifests, among other ways, in the rising authoritarianism and securitisation of democracies worldwide. Under the guise of the people's will, totalitarian and Orwellian tendencies are being fostered by the very institutions and leaders tasked with upholding democratic values. Consequently, hard power and brute force supplant the collective public will, imposing self-serving policies that disregard the interests of the people.
Although marked by authoritarianism and disdain for the people's will, such regimes rarely abandon democratic forms entirely for three reasons: First, a democratic façade shields them from international sanctions. Second, it legitimises their authority under the pretense of democracy. Third, it sustains false hope among the populace, thereby deterring rebellion against those in power.
This is because, unless informed, transparent, and popular, those in power-whether individuals or institutions-tend — tend to channel most of their resources and energy into masking their insecurities, sustaining their authority, and guarding their misdeeds against potential retribution. In other words, power obtained through questionable means or brute force stems from and reveals underlying insecurities, driving all efforts to maintain it. This underlying insecurity of power ultimately and inevitably succumbs to the weight of its follies, corruption, and abuse. Had it not been so, all the states that our status quo gets inspiration from would not have been consigned to the dustbin of history.
Thus, rather than being lasting and self-sustaining, the autocratisation of democracy is both a cause and a manifestation of insecurity, fear of losing control, and potential retribution for wrongdoings. In other words, authoritarian power reflects the hidden insecurities of vested interests, ill-gotten resources, and fear of retribution for past transgressions. Like dogs or snakes that strike when threatened, authoritarian power escalates aggression toward its people as its insecurities deepen. These insecurities drive further aggression and unlawful acts, ultimately leading the regime to collapse under the burden of its errors, delusions and misdeeds.

SA stun Aus to clinch WTC crown,"GB
Markram's magnificent century helps Proteas to grand win at Lord's
Aiden Markram's magnificent century was the cornerstone of South Africa's five-wicket victory over Australia in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Saturday as the Proteas ended decades of cricket heartbreak by at last winning a major global title.
South Africa, set 282 to win, finished on 282-5 before lunch on the fourth day, with opening batsman Markram falling for 136 after taking South Africa to within six runs of the title.
""It's special in a lot of ways,"" said Proteas captain Temba Bavuma in front of what was effectively a 'home' crowd given the large number of South Africa fans who had packed into Lord's.
""Also, it's a chance for South Africa to be united,"" said Bavuma, who has now joined Springboks Rugby World Cup-winning captain Siya Kolisi in becoming a black African skipper of a South Africa side that has won a major global title.
The Proteas resumed on 213-2, needing just 69 more runs for victory.
Markram, dismissed for a duck in the first innings, was 102 not out and Bavuma unbeaten on 65 despite spending most of his innings limping with a hamstring injury.
But South Africa have such a long history of folding under pressure they could not take anything for granted against serial winners and defending WTC title-holders Australia.
In 18 previous attempts in the one-day international and T20 World Cups, South Africa had only reached a solitary final.
That was in last year's T20 World Cup in Barbados, when they lost to India despite needing just 30 runs from their last 30 balls, with six wickets standing.
But South Africa, so often labelled ""chokers"" for their failure to close out knockout games, held their nerve on Saturday as a largely unheralded side succeeded where star players such as Allan Donald, Shaun Pollock, AB de Villiers and Jacques Kallis had failed.
South Africa's path to the final was criticised, with the Proteas playing just 12 Tests in the WTC cycle and none against England or Australia.
But with Australia strong favourites to retain their title, South Africa posted an eighth successive Test win in impressive style.
""I hope our performance gives credit as to why we were in the final,"" said Bavuma.
""Whilst we were batting, we could hear the Aussies using that dreaded word 'choke'. We've been etched in history, we're part of something that has never been done.""
The celebrations spread across the Lord's turf as each of the players took their turn with the silver and gold mace.
""It is emotional, it's been a very long time coming,"" said Markram, who was named player of the match.
""We've got close in the past couple of years and not got over the line. The first one is always going to be the toughest.""
Australia led by 74 runs on first innings but never got completely away from South Africa, with Proteas fast bowler Kagiso Rabada returning superb match figures of 9-110.
""Unfortunately, it was a bridge too far,"" said Australia captain Pat Cummins, who led Australia to the 2023 WTC title after New Zealand won the inaugural 2021 final.
""They (South Africa) were fantastic in that fourth innings. There wasn't a lot in the wicket but they didn't give us a chance.""
South Africa suffered a setback early on Saturday when Bavuma, who had added just one run to his overnight score, was caught behind off Cummins to end a stand of 147 with Markram.
But Markram got the target down to 50 by pulling Cummins for four before left-arm quick Mitchell Starc (3-66) bowled Tristan Stubbs.
Australia took the new ball with South Africa needing just 14 more runs to win and Markram subsequently drove Josh Hazlewood for four and three to settle any nerves.
He couldn't quite finish the job, though. His pull off Hazlewood was brilliantly caught by Travis Head at midwicket to end a 207-ball innings featuring 14 fours.
As Markram received a standing ovation on his way back to the pavilion, several Australia players shook his hand.
It was left to Kyle Verreynne to hit the winning run as South Africa completed the second-highest chase to win a Test at Lord's, behind the West Indies' 344-1 against England in 1984.

Gandapur threatens armed march for Imran's release,"GB
K-P chief minister threatens to retaliate 'with full force'
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has once again issued a provocative call for the public to march towards Islamabad, this time urging people to take up arms for the release of PTI incarcerated patron-in-chief and former premier Imran Khan.
Addressing a rally in the suburban area of Mathra near Peshawar, Gandapur warned that if fired upon, ""we will retaliate with full force."" He declared, ""If bullets are fired, we won't just respond — we'll hit back hard"".
The gathering, organised by local PTI MNAs and MPAs to demand the release of the party's top leadership, was attended by former MNA Sajid Nawaz, former deputy speaker Mehmood Jan, MNA Sher Ali Arbab and other senior PTI leaders.
Fireworks were set off to mark the chief minister's arrival and he was presented with a traditional turban.
The current and former lawmakers addressed the crowd, urging people to prepare for mass resistance.
They said the only path left to secure the release of the party's patron-in-chief is through defiance.
""Whenever he gives the call, we will march with full force,"" they vowed, asking the participants of the rally to raise their hands and take an oath to join any such movement.
While local representatives raised various regional issues during the event, Chief Minister Gandapur kept his speech brief, focusing solely on party matters. He did not address local concerns, instead asking supporters to wait for a call for the patron-in-chief's release.
""This time, if they open fire, we will not hold back. We will go with weapons and, if need be, take bullets to our chests, but we will strike back,"" Gandapur said.
He also announced that province-wide protests would be held on June 22 at both the tehsil and district levels to demand the release of the PTI founder.

Time to de-escalate,"PK
It is a point of concern that Iran's allies and world bodies are muted
Tehran's sole consolation was that Tel Aviv was under flames. In retaliation to the unprecedented devastation of its military gear and command, the Islamic Republic reportedly flew more than 100 ballistic missiles and Arash Kamikaze drones late on Friday on the Jewish state, and many of them were able to hit their targets. Not just the independent media, Tel Aviv too confirmed that Israel was under attack from Iran, and vowed to ""burn Tehran"" if the onslaught continued.
Iran's new military command now seems to be in a jingoistic mood and has promised to ""annihilate"" the aggressor. But the volume of death and destruction in Iran is mounting as Israeli fighter jets and surface-to-air missiles struck hard once again in their second phase of bombardment after claiming to have neutralised Iran's air defence system.
Overnight casualty list for Iran was extensive, including cities in the west and northwest, like Tabriz, Lorestan Hamedan and Kermanshah, which house key defences and military bases. Mehrabad airport in Tehran also came under attack; and for the first time Israel seemed to be scot-free in flying salvos 1,500 km away on the capital city without the fear of any tactical obstruction.
With assured escalation in days to come, the critical question is, what will be the end-game? As far as Iran and its hardline leadership are concerned, it's time to fight it out. It is pleased to see that its enrichment sites are still safe and radiation is 'unchanged' in Natanz area, notwithstanding limited damage to Fordow and Isfahan nuclear sites.
On the diplomatic front, it is a point of concern that Iran's allies and world bodies are muted. Khamenei has rebuffed Trump over the 'talks under coercion', terming them as 'meaningless', but that is where the next critical confrontation pertaining to the future security and stability of Iran rests. All that the US-Israel duo wants at this time is a deal on the nuclear profile as a face-saving outcome. That, however, is tantamount to capitulation for the clergy regime and, thus, resorting to brinkmanship is the last available feature in power politics.

Google wins years-long Mexico antitrust case,"US
Faced fine of up to 8% of revenue if found engaged in monopolistic practices
Mexico's antitrust watchdog said on Friday it had closed a case against Google, clearing the tech giant from any potential fines, after a multi-year investigation determined it did not engage in monopolistic practices in the country.
The investigation by Mexico's Federal Economic Competition Commission (Cofece), which began in 2020, focused on Google's digital advertising services via its search page as well as third-party websites.
The investigation focused on Google's advertising services via its search page as well as third-party websites, examining whether the company had an undue advantage over competitors in the digital advertising sector stemming from the design of its platform for buying online advertising.
Cofece said in a statement on Friday that its analysis had determined that Google users were not required to purchase advertising on third-party websites in order to purchase advertising on the Google search engine.
""We appreciate Cofece's decision recognising that our products give advertisers the freedom and control to use our tools in the ways that best suit their needs,"" a Google spokesperson said.
Google had been facing a fine of up to 8% of its annual revenue in Mexico if Cofece determined it engaged in monopolistic practices.
Google parent Alphabet does not include specific revenue numbers for Mexico in its earnings reports, but according to annual results for 2024, the company's revenue for its ""other Americas"" region, which includes Latin America, was about $20.4 billion.
Google is facing antitrust challenges around the world as regulators fear how its search engine gives it an advantage.
In the United States, a US district judge last year ruled Google holds an unlawful monopoly in online search and related advertising.

Rybakina dumped out of Queen's by qualifier Maria,"US
Olympic champion Zheng joined Keys and Maria in the last four line-up
Former Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina was dumped out of the Queen's Club Championships on Friday by qualifier Tatjana Maria, who will face Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the semi-finals.
Chinese top seed Zheng Qinwen saw off the challenge of Britain's Emma Raducanu in straight sets and will meet US eighth seed Amanda Anisimova in the last four on Saturday.
German mother of two Maria shocked Kazah fourth seed Rybakina, keeping her composure after failing to serve out the match to complete a 6-4, 7-6 (7/4) win.
A single break in the first set put the 37-year-old Maria in charge and she broke twice to lead 5-3 in the second.
But Rybakina, Wimbledon champion in 2022, upped her game to level at 5-5 and the set went to a tie-break.
The players were locked at 4-4 before Rybakina double-faulted and Maria, ranked 86th in the world, sealed victory with an ace in one hour and 45 minutes.
The German, who reached the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022, was forced to qualify for the grasscourt tournament in London.
""It means so much to me,"" she said. ""It's like a perfect example to never give up and to always keep going, doesn't matter what.
""I'm still here and living this dream. I have my family with me and amazing team.""
She added: ""I'm super, super proud to be here in the semi-final and I hope in a few years you will see my daughter (aged 11) at the same stage here.""
In the first quarter-final on Friday, US second seed Keys came from a set down to beat Russian fifth seed Diana Shnaider 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.
Olympic champion Zheng joined Keys and Maria in the last four, breaking 2021 US Open champion Raducanu twice in the opening set and snuffing out a mini comeback in the second.

Man held for blackmailing woman,"US
Mobile phone of suspect containing inappropriate video, data seized
The National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has arrested a man accused of blackmailing a woman using a compromising video and extorting over Rs700,000 in cash from her, officials said on Friday.
According to an official statement, a case was registered on the complaint of the victim, who alleged that the accused, identified as Ghulam Kazim, had secretly recorded an inappropriate video of her. He allegedly used the footage to threaten and blackmail her, demanding both money and illicit favours under the threat of releasing the video on social media, she added.
The woman told investigators that Kazim had already extorted Rs700,000 from her in hush money. Acting on the complaint, the NCCIA arrested the suspect during a raid on Autobahn Road in Hyderabad.
The agency also seized his mobile phone, which reportedly contained incriminating data, including the video used for blackmail. The accused, a resident of Sobho Dero in district Khairpur, was taken into custody and an FIR was registered against him.
Officials said further investigations are under way to determine if the accused was involved in similar offences against other victims.

PSX hits record in volatile week,"US
Retreats from peak as Israel attacks Iran; KSE-100 index gains 0.4% WoW
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed the week on a positive note, with the benchmark KSE-100 index posting a modest gain of 0.4% on a week-on-week (WoW) basis.
Investor sentiment remained upbeat in the early part of the week as the federal budget for FY26 left capital gains and dividend tax rates unchanged, signalling moves towards fiscal consolidation without imposing a fresh burden on the equity market.
However, the momentum cooled towards the weekend amid geopolitical tensions triggered by Israeli strikes on Iran and the US imposing a 50% tariff on steel imports from key trading partners.
Key macroeconomic highlights shaping the market included a 1.8% year-on-year (YoY) uptick in March large-scale manufacturing (LSM) output, surge in May remittances to $3.7 billion – the second-highest monthly inflows on record, Rs853 billion T-bill auction where yields softened up to 25 basis points and 35% YoY jump in domestic car sales.
Trading activity also picked up, with average daily volumes rising 37% WoW and traded value climbing 33%. The KSE-100 hit an all-time high of 124,353 points during the week before profit-taking set in.
Analysts noted that the market welcomed the Rs17.3 trillion federal budget, which projected a revenue target of Rs19.3 trillion and a fiscal deficit of 3.9% of GDP, alongside tax relief for salaried individuals and incentives for the construction sector. Additionally, plans to secure $2 billion in commercial financing to bolster the State Bank's reserves further lifted investor confidence.
On a day-on-day basis, the PSX began the week with a record high close on Tuesday, though the benchmark KSE-100 index fluctuated within a narrow range amid uncertainty surrounding the budget announcement. The index recorded an increase of 384 points and settled at 122,024.
Bulls roared back to the market on Wednesday as investor appetite grew, which propelled the KSE-100 higher by 2,328 points to 124,353, fuelled by the announcement of federal budget, which maintained the status quo on equity taxes and signalled economic recovery.
However, the PSX experienced a turbulent session on Thursday, where the index hit a record intra-day high of 126,718 before reversing course to close modestly lower, reflecting both optimism fuelled by post-budget clarity and renewed pressure from geopolitical tensions. The KSE-100 lost 260 points.
The downturn continued on Friday, with the index plunging 1,950 points at 122,144 over rising geopolitical tensions following Israeli airstrikes on Iran.
Topline Securities, in its weekly review, wrote that the KSE-100 index gained 0.4% WoW. It started the week on a positive note where the budget increased investor optimism as the government kept capital gains and dividend tax rates unchanged and the overall theme of the budget was fiscal consolidation.
However, the market came under pressure by the end of the week on news of 50% tariff on steel by the US on its trading partners and an attack by Israel on Iran, which resulted in an increase in tensions in the Middle East, it said.
Other major developments during the outgoing week were LSM in March 2025 registering a YoY increase of 1.8%, remittances for May clocking in at $3.7 billion (up 16% month-on-month and 14% YoY), T-bill auction during the week raising Rs853 billion for the government against the target of Rs900 billion, where yields declined in the range of 1-25 basis points, and car sales for May reaching 14,762 units (up 35% YoY and 39% MoM).
Average daily traded volumes and value stood at 907 million shares (up 37% WoW) and Rs37 billion (up 33%), respectively, Topline added.
Syed Danyal Hussain of JS Global wrote that the PSX welcomed the FY26 budget as the government didn't announce any adverse steps for capital markets where capital gains tax measures were better than expected, encouraging mutual funds to divert funds towards equities.
The finance minister unveiled a Rs17.3 trillion budget for FY26, targeting revenues of Rs19.3 trillion (+15% YoY), fiscal deficit at 3.9% of GDP and a primary surplus of 2.4%.
The KSE-100 index hit an all-time high of 124,353 points during the week, reporting 2.2% gains in the first two sessions. However, the market underwent correction on Friday, led by escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. On a WoW basis, the index gained 0.4%, or 502 points, he added.

Ali Sethi vouches for NY mayor candidate Zohran Mamdani,"US
The politician is Indian filmmaker Mira Nair's son
Musician Ali Sethi cannot get enough of his friend and up and coming politician Zohran K. Mamdani. On Friday, Sethi posted a carousel on Instagram to show his support for Mamdani, who's a 2025 New York City mayoral election candidate.
""An absolutely inspirational campaign by my friend and brother Zohran K Mamdani for a better New York,"" wrote Sethi, applauding his friend's election campaign.
He added a message for those who felt dejected and disappointed with the situation in the city. ""If (like me) you had given up hope, and were resigned to all kinds of grim scenarios (""no point resisting""), with Zohran you have a real chance at renewal: renewal of self, community, city, party, country.""
He encouraged his fellow desi Americans to vote for Mamdani, who is the son of Indian-American filmmaker Mira Nair and Mahmood Mamdani, Indian-Ugandan postcolonial studies professor at Columbia University.
""So get thee to a ballot and vote for Zohran,"" said Sethi, sprinkling his message with a bunch of ballot emojis to drive the point home.
In the carousel, he posted four photographs with the two of them in the first one showing a toothy smile. ""The first pic of me and Zohran taken by his legendary mum [Nair],"" he wrote.
He added, ""And in the second pic, my mum is definitely giving him a lecture on Gandhian activism.""
The second photo shows Sethi's mother, politician and journalist Jugnu Mohsin standing with Mamdani. It appears to be a humbling pose where she is giving him blessings; that much is visible from the expressions on Mamdani's face while Sethi himself stands behind his mother.
The third photo shows Mamndani and Mohsin in a hug while the fourth is a poster, part of Mamdani's campaign, which states, ""Democrat for Mayor Zohran. For a New York you can afford."" It states Mamndani's website and the voting date, June 24.
Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and moved to New York with his family at the age of seven, considers himself a democratic socialist. He previously worked on an unsuccessful campaign for New York City Council candidate Khader El-Yateem, a Palestinian Lutheran minister and democratic socialist. He supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and has actively taken part in its protests.
His current campaign for mayorship include support for free city buses, a rent freeze for rent-stabilised housing, and city-owned grocery stores.

Messi magic needed for Inter Miami,"US
Coach Mascherano has been forced to re-shuffle his backline due to injuries crisis
Inter Miami will have to rely heavily on Lionel Messi's firepower as they prepare for Saturday's Club World Cup opener against Al-Ahly, with coach Javier Mascherano forced to re-shuffle his backline due to a string of injuries.
Fullback Jordi Alba, fellow defender Gonzalo Lujan and defensive midfielder Yannick Bright have all been ruled out of the Group A clash at the Hard Rock Stadium.
""They are not available for this game, hopefully they will be for the second game,"" Mascherano told a press conference on Friday.
Alba, one of Messi's former Barcelona teammates, is sidelined with a hamstring issue. There were also concerns regarding the fitness of centre back David Martinez.
""David had some kind of pain yesterday and we did not want to take any risks,"" said Mascherano.
""The reality is that throughout the season, the team have dealt with injuries, but the players who stepped in rose to the challenge. That gives us peace of mind,"" he said. Miami have conceded 16 goals in their last six competitive games.
Much of Miami's chances rest on Messi's shoulders.
""He's in good shape this season. There were moments when we had to give him some time to rest, but he's played the last 15 games, except for the match against Dallas when we rested the entire squad,"" said Mascherano.
""We were also fortunate he was able to rest during Argentina's last two games,"" he added referring to Messi playing 111 minutes in Argentina's World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Colombia earlier this month.
""It's our responsibility to create the right environment for him to shine.""
Miami will also take on Porto and Palmeiras in the 32-club competition.
Al Ahly coach Jose Riveiro, who took charge last month following the departure of Marcel Koller, believes Messi still has what it takes to shine. REUTERS

Worst foreign policy decision of 21st century,"US
Democracies all over the world are degenerating, lapsing, regressing and retreating
There are clear indications that the world is no longer traveling on an upward track. The current journey of the world is on a downward track, and the need for an immediate course correction is the responsibility of the four great powers — the United States, China, Russia and the European Union. Liberal internationalism has failed as an order, and so has the momentum of globalisation, which has been unsuccessful in bringing the world closer together.
Democracies all over the world are degenerating, lapsing, regressing and retreating. All anti-communist dictators that the United States supported in the past and installed during the Cold War to create favorable regimes in Latin America, Africa Middle East and Asia are dead, but others wearing democratic suits have taken their place.
Nationalism, protectionism and revisionism are eating what is left of cosmopolitanism, and anti-immigration laws and racism are back as the picture posters of a world in a downward spiral. The brutality of the two World Wars forced the world to understand the importance of adherence to international norms. These norms are being set aside now with impunity, and states like Israel now demonstrate that state behaviour is no more constrained by international norms.
During the bipolar moment of the world, the world order rested on both the balance of power and legitimacy — a world conforming to laws and rules. Legitimacy today is on a downslide. That can be seen in how Israel is carrying out genocide in Gaza with absolute freedom from the consequences of its actions.
Loss of legitimacy is being demonstrated in how the war in Ukraine is being fought, or how India initiated a thoughtless and unnecessary military action against Pakistan. As if this were not enough, the US-Iran nuclear talks have failed, and one can be certain that no international rules or laws may be followed once again to punish another sovereign nation — Iran.
Notable historians and scholars of international relations with pro-Western sentiments are referring to President Xi Jinping's no limits partnership with Moscow as arguably the biggest foreign policy blunder by him since his time in power. Yet, the Chinese President's decision is a copycat of what the United States has practiced earlier.
Under the Henry Kissinger doctrine of reducing tensions with the weaker rival to concentrate on the stronger, President Nixon warmed ties with China as the United States focused on and targeted the Soviet Union. China now plans to cook the American soup with the same recipe. However, if Israel attacks Iran with or without the consent of the Americans, it will constitute the biggest foreign policy blunder of the 21st century.
Calling an unlimited partnership between two great powers a foreign policy blunder is looking at the event from a liberal lens that views revisionism as an international offence. Seen from a realist perspective, the unchallenged power that the United States enjoyed during the unipolar moment changed the dynamics of the global balance of power. The current Sino-Russo partnership is a consequence of the shift in the global balance of power that emerged when the all-powerful American might pushed the interests of the other great powers aside to make the entire world a de facto American sphere.
The United States, as a global hegemon during the unipolar moment, had three clear choices to make: create an international system of absolute American dominance of power; allow creation of an international system of shared responsibility for global peace and security; or revert to an international system of power rivalry and sphere of influence.
Until the first decade of the 21st century, Americans dragged the international system of absolute American control and dominance of power. By 2012, both President Putin and President Xi rose to power as Russia's President and General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, respectively. Two years later, President Putin annexed Crimea.
The moment to create an international system of shared responsibility for global peace and security was lost, and an international system of power rivalry and sphere of influence replaced the system of absolute American dominance and power. This was acknowledged by the Trump administration in 2017 when the American National Security Strategy presented in that year welcomed the return of 'great power competition'.
Today, the war in Ukraine is a classic example of a return to the clash of spheres of influence in global politics. China showcases this contest in the Eastern Pacific, the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. Before the greatest blunder of foreign policy of the 21st century is committed, the United States and its ally, Israel, must give due consideration to the international system in vogue.
Sphere of influence is the space where one's great power exercises dominance and control, and if an outside power wishes to challenge that, it will only be at a cost that may be too high or unbearable. In a broader geopolitical sense, a military strike at Iran will hurt the political, economic and commercial interests of the other two great powers, and it is for this reason that such a military misadventure will be disapproved and contested by the rival powers.
Russia and China will not compete or cooperate but confront any challenge posed to the sovereignty of Iran. This assumption is based on the current dynamics of regional geopolitics, regional political, economic and commercial concerns, and wider regional insecurity, which is not acceptable and tolerable to both Russia and China. Not just the two great powers but many other countries in the region may cooperate and have their foreign policy driven by this very sensitive and main agenda.
President Trump, on his part, represents himself as a liberal internationalist and a peacemaker who rejects the use of military force as a preferred instrument of policy to resolve conflicts. He favours diplomacy, and if the world needs to get back on the right track, he must not become part of committing the biggest foreign policy blunder of the 21st century. Israel's military action in Gaza has already eroded the moral authority of the United States; any military action against Iran will erode the chances of the world traveling back on an upward track.
Post Script: As the article is being submitted for publication, Israel has carried out air strikes on Iran. The worst foreign policy decision of the 21st century has been taken.

"Bring India to table, Bilawal urges world","US

Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who is heading a parliamentary delegation to the West, on Saturday urged the international community to play its role in ensuring permanent peace in South Asia, including resolution of the longstanding Kashmir dispute, water issues and terrorism through a composite dialogue which, he said, India was unwilling to pursue.
Addressing a news conference for the international media in Brussels, the PPP chairman stressed that military confrontation was not a solution to the Kashmir issue or terrorism.
""Dialogue is the only way forward,"" he stressed, calling on the international community to actively engage with India to defuse tensions.
""It is a moral obligation for the international community to encourage both sides to engage in diplomacy for regional peace,"" he said, reiterating that Pakistan was seeking a bilateral composite dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues.
Bilawal also addressed the regional conflict involving Iran, saying, ""We certainly do not want a war on this border (with Iran). Pakistan has condemned the strikes that took place over the last couple of days on our neighbouring country.""
""We will continue to advocate for peace on all our borders, be it with Afghanistan, Iran, or India. We absolutely cannot afford this conflict in Iran to turn into Iraq 2.0 or World War III,"" he said.
He warned that it had become ""far too easy to have a war every month"", adding that war seemed to have become the default response to any conflict or dispute.
Calling on the international community to ""immediately impose a ceasefire in this Iranian conflict with occupying forces in Palestine,"" Bilawal stressed, ""We cannot have perpetual war. It serves none of our interests"".

President Donald Trump's administration on Friday proposed to increase the amount of biofuels that oil refiners must blend into the nation's fuel mix over the next two years, driven by a surge in biomass-based diesel mandates.
After months of lobbying on the issue, the biofuels industry welcomed the move, which also included measures to discourage biofuel imports.
The US Environmental Protection Agency proposed total biofuel blending volumes at 24.02 billion gallons in 2026 and 24.46 billion gallons in 2027, up from 22.33 billion gallons in 2025.
Under the Renewable Fuel Standard, refiners are required to blend large volumes of biofuels into the US fuel supply or purchase credits, called RINs, from those that do. Small refiners can apply for an exemption to the requirements if they can prove the obligations would cause undue harm.
The proposal is driven in part by an increase in biomass-based diesel requirements. EPA set a quota of 7.12 billion biomass-based diesel RINs for 2026 — a measurement of the number of tradable credits generated by blending the fuel.
It said it projected that mandate would lead to the blending of 5.61 billion gallons. The EPA expressed the biomass-based diesel requirement in billion RINs in accordance with the agency's proposal to reduce the number of RINs that could be generated from imported biofuels.
After accounting for the reduction for imported biofuels, the EPA said it projected the number of RINs generated for biomass-based diesel would be 1.27 per gallon in 2026 and 1.28 RINs per gallon in 2027. Previously, the EPA projected the average gallon of biomass-based diesel generated 1.6 RINs.

Boeing resumes China deliveries,"US
China and the US concluded two days of negotiations in London
Boeing delivered a new 787-9 aircraft to China's Juneyao Airlines on Saturday, Chinese media outlet Yicai reported, as trade tensions between Beijing and Washington ease.
The delivery comes two days after a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner with 242 people on board crashed in a fireball shortly after takeoff in western India.
The US aerospace giant had suspended new aircraft deliveries to China in April as President Donald Trump's tariff war escalated between the world's two largest economies.
Boeing said at the end of May that deliveries would resume this month after the tariffs were temporarily scaled back for 90 days.
China and the US concluded two days of negotiations in London on Tuesday to resolve key trade issues in the two superpowers' bruising tariff war, where negotiators from Washington and Beijing agreed on a framework covering tariff rates.

"Dua Lipa, Callum Turner confirm engagement","US
Singer puts an end to months of speculation
Pop sensation Dua Lipa has confirmed she is engaged to actor Callum Turner, putting an end to months of speculation that began when fans spotted a diamond ring on her left hand in a Christmas Eve Instagram post.
""Yes, we're engaged,"" the singer told British Vogue in its July cover interview. ""It's very exciting. This decision to grow old together, to see a life and just, I don't know, be best friends forever — it's a really special feeling.""
Dua revealed that Callum had the ring custom-made for her, consulting her inner circle — including her sister Rina and close friends — to ensure it reflected her personality. ""I'm obsessed with it,"" she said. ""It's so me. It's nice to know the person that you're going to spend the rest of your life with knows you very well.""
The couple, who began dating in January 2024, have mostly kept their relationship off the red carpet, instead offering fans the occasional soft-launch via sweet Instagram posts. That changed this year, when they made their official red carpet debut at the 2025 Met Gala. Dua wore a striking black Chanel halter dress with a plunging V-neck, while Callum complemented her look in a custom Louis Vuitton black suit, as reported by Vogue.
Despite the public debut and engagement, wedding bells won't be ringing just yet. ""I want to finish my tour, Callum's shooting, so we're just enjoying this period,"" Dua explained. ""I've never been someone who's really thought about a wedding, or dreamt about what kind of bride I would be. All of a sudden, I'm like: 'Oh, what would I wear?'""
The two first met at London's River Cafe, introduced by the restaurant's co-founder Ruth Rogers. They reconnected a year later over dinner in Los Angeles, where Dua was dining with poet Mustafa Ahmed and recognised Callum as ""that really hot guy from The River Cafe."" A shared love for books — specifically Hernan Diaz's Trust — sealed the connection.
Since their relationship went public in early 2024, the couple have made several low-key appearances together, from vacationing in Mexico to attending the Glastonbury music festival, where Dua headlined. In October, she posted a photo of Callum kissing her cheek after one of her shows, writing: ""Post-show fun and so much love!""
As the couple look ahead, both are juggling packed schedules. Callum will next appear in Atropia, a war satire produced by Luca Guadagnino, and in a TV adaptation of William Gibson's Neuromancer. Meanwhile, Dua continues her Radical Optimism world tour, with stops across Australia and North America including a show at New York's Madison Square Garden.

PPP leaders' interim bail extended in protest case,"US
.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Peshawar, Ismatullah Wazir, on Saturday extended the interim bail of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Central Secretary General Humayun Khan and PPP Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa President Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha till June 23 in a case related to a protest on Khyber Road and the alleged burning of a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) protest camp.
During the hearing, the petitioners' counsels, Gohar Rehman Khattak and Lajbar Khan Advocates, appeared before the court. They informed the judge that their clients are affiliated with a political party and were named in the FIR for participating in a peaceful protest against the provincial government.
The lawyers argued that peaceful protest is a fundamental right of every citizen. However, instead of allowing the demonstration, the police resorted to baton charging and tear gas shelling. Later, cases were registered against their clients, despite no violent actions on their part. The court extended the interim bail of both PPP leaders until June 23.
Speaking to the media after the hearing, Humayun Khan said that the PPP has always represented the people. ""PTI regularly storms Islamabad and damages public property, yet when cases are registered against them, they claim it's their democratic right to protest,"" he said. ""When PPP holds a peaceful protest, the PTI-led government tries to suppress it.""
He added that after the elections, PPP offered PTI the opportunity to form the government and supported the PML-N for the sake of democratic continuity. ""PPP is not part of the federal cabinet, and we will not support any taxation measures in the budget that go against public interest.

Reimagining cricket,"GB
.The ICC Hall of Fame includes a total of 15 women
History was rewritten in the ICC Hall of Fame on June 9, 2025, when Sana Mir became the first Pakistani woman to be inducted in the prestigious list. Her induction marks a significant step in breaking gender barriers in Pakistani sports and also signals renewed hope for the future of the country's cricket scene.
Sana Mir debuted in 2005 and played 226 international matches, including 120 ODIs and 106 T20Is, during her 14-year-long career. She also led the team in 137 of these matches. At one point, she was the most-capped female cricketer in Pakistan.
The ICC Hall of Fame includes a total of 15 women, with Sana Mir inducted alongside England's Sarah Taylor and South Africa's Hashim Amla. This achievement brings Pakistan's women cricket to the forefront, reminding the public that cricketing milestones are still being reached — even if not in the arenas they are most accustomed to.
Simply Sana Mir's name plastered across public platforms helps challenge long-held perceptions about women's participation in a sporting culture so heavily dominated by men that their contributions are often left relegated to the sidelines. In her celebratory status, Sana proclaimed, ""Tonight is not just mine. This is for every girl who picks up a bat or a ball in the street where they're told cricket isn't 'for them'.""
In a country where girls are barred from sports early on due to traditional reasons such as rigid gender roles, societal expectations and limited access to facilities, her words echo throughout the nation as a powerful symbol of defiance and possibility.
Sana Mir's journey, from street cricket to the world stage, stands for personal achievement as much as it does for a landscape that is hopefully changing in the wake of prominent players. This is a national moment of pride that urges institutions, communities and families to reimagine a future where talent is not restricted by gender.

PSG sights set on Club World Cup glory,"US
The UCL champions are treating the lucrative new tournament as a serious objective
Freshly crowned kings of Europe, Paris Saint-Germain arrived this week in the United States for the Club World Cup and are treating FIFA's lucrative new competition not as a nuisance at the end of an exhausting season but as a serious objective.
""I think it is an incredible competition,"" PSG coach Luis Enrique said of the Club World Cup in the immediate aftermath of his team's UEFA Champions League triumph in Munich two weeks ago.
""Our aim is to be competitive and try to win a fifth trophy of the season.""
The Qatar-backed French giants could be forgiven for wanting some time to bask in the glory of their 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich which allowed them to finally win the Champions League for the first time in their history.
There had been numerous agonising failures in Europe's elite club competition, as well as billions of euros spent on transfer fees on stars like Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, prior to captain Marquinhos raising the trophy aloft.
""We have made history for the club, for the city and for the whole country,"" defender Lucas Hernandez told sports daily L'Equipe after the PSG squad paraded their trophy down the Champs-Elysees avenue in Paris, attended a reception with President Emmanuel Macron and celebrated with almost 50,000 fans at their Parc des Princes stadium.
PSG have played 58 matches since last August and also swept all the available domestic trophies in France this season, as has become the norm in recent years.
But there is simply no time to stop and reflect.
Many of their players, including Champions League final hero Desire Doue, spent last week on international duty before returning to their club and departing for Los Angeles, where they will begin their Club World Cup adventure this weekend.
""The tournament itself is a really attractive prospect,"" Luis Enrique told FIFA.com.
""We have to strike the balance between managing the physical and mental fatigue we're experiencing now at the end of a long season and harnessing the motivation that comes with being involved in the competition.""
PSG's opening game will be against another European heavyweight as they take on Antoine Griezmann's Atletico Madrid at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, just outside Los Angeles, on Sunday.
They will then also face South American champions Botafogo, of Brazil, before moving north to take on Seattle Sounders in their remaining Group B matches.
Expected to qualify for the knockout phase without too many issues, PSG could end up playing a total of seven matches if they make it all the way to the final in New York on July 13 — just a month before their scheduled first game of next season in the UEFA Supercup against Tottenham Hotspur.
The strain of such a long campaign is telling, with Ousmane Dembele — their top scorer this season with 33 goals — struggling with an injury picked up playing for France last week.
They did not manage to add any new players to their squad during the brief transfer window that opened at the start of this month ahead of the tournament -- reported interest in Bournemouth's Ukrainian defender Illia Zabarnyi did not turn into anything concrete.
But the rewards for success in the Club World Cup are enticing and should be enough to keep Luis Enrique's squad focused on their objective, with up to a stunning $125 million in prize money on offer for the best performing European team if they manage to go all the way. AFP

Faceless customs system rollout halted on flaws,"US
Committee finds 57% increase in clearance time, 2% to 23% drop in revenue between Feb-April'25 under new FCA model
A review committee has recommended that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) halt the further rollout of the much-publicised Faceless Customs Assessment (FCA) system after discovering that it caused a 57% increase in container clearance time and a decline in revenue.
The Review Committee on FCA also questioned the system's design, stating that it had been tested 20 years ago and later discontinued due to similar flaws. After early reports of success, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif travelled to Karachi in January to inaugurate the new system. The FCA was introduced to eliminate physical contact between importers and customs officers, aiming to increase revenues and speed up clearance of imported containers.
""This committee does not recommend implementation of further phases or rollout of FCA unless its efficacy is confirmed through other means or with larger datasets, or its design is reviewed,"" the three-member committee stated in its report finalised last month.
According to FBR's original plan, the second phase of the FCA was to be implemented by June 2025 at all Appraisement Collectorates, dry ports, and land border stations. The third phase, scheduled for September 2025, would extend the system to all airports and Export Collectorates.
However, the committee has now advised halting the expansion due to major issues in the first phase. The FCA's implied objective was to curb collusion between importers and customs officers, which was seen as a cause of revenue loss. But the report states the system ""has not achieved this objective.""
FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial told the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance this week that the system was not primarily aimed at increasing revenue.
The report noted that two of the FCA's basic design concepts — hiding trader information from assessing officers and ending specialised assessment groups — had already been tried and abandoned 20 years ago when Pakistan Customs' first computerised system was introduced. The reasons for their earlier failure remain valid today.
The committee found that specialised assessment groups helped build sector-specific institutional memory and stronger customs controls, while also reducing clearance time through repeated handling of similar products.
Langrial acknowledged the implementation problems during a meeting with the Finance Committee on Friday and said they would be resolved by next month. However, the very committee formed under his orders has recommended halting the rollout.
The final report on FCA and Centralised Assessment Unit (CAU) performance was submitted to FBR management last month, in response to a review ordered by Langrial.
The report revealed that in November 2024, before the FCA was implemented, the average clearance time for goods declarations was 25.6 hours. This rose steadily, peaking at 46 hours in April 2025. On average, clearance time increased 57% to 40.2 hours.
""It is evident that the dwell time has significantly increased after the implementation of FCA,"" the report noted. Between July and November 2024 (pre-FCA), 84% of declarations were cleared within 48 hours. This dropped to 70% between December and April 2025 (post-FCA).
For goods declarations that were both assessed and examined, average clearance time increased from 74 hours to 81 hoursa 10% jump.
The committee also evaluated the system's impact on revenue. Under the previous system, duties collected exceeded declared values by 13% to 17%. But following FCA's introduction, duties and taxes fell. Between February and April 2025, total revenues dropped by 2% to 23% compared to prior months. ""The value addition by assessing officers is reflected in the extra revenue collected,"" the report stated. This contribution dropped from 16% in July-November to 13% in December-April.
However, the number of documents called for examination dropped from 37% to 21%.
The Director General of Risk Management System and the Member Operations FBR Customs, both part of the review committee, did not respond to requests for comment. The report showed that customs officers now refer more goods declarations to senior officers after assessment. Referrals rose from 6% in the old system to 11% under FCA. Lab referrals also doubled.
The WeBOC system allows traders to file reviews before principal appraisers and assistant collectors. Under FCA, such appeals increased from 6% to 14%, further delaying clearance and increasing workload. ""Increased examinations, senior officer referrals, lab tests, and especially reviews have offset any time saved from reduced document calls, thereby increasing overall dwell time,"" the report stated. It also noted that the quality of assessments had deteriorated, as indicated by the surge in review filings.
Langrial admitted that clearance times at appraisal and examination stages had risen due to the increased number of reviews filed by importers. ""At the design stage, we did not anticipate the rise in reviews,"" he said, adding that FBR would introduce virtual hearings by assistant and deputy collectors starting July to address the issue.
The new FCA system was designed to address long-standing issues in customs processes by enabling remote, technology-driven assessments and minimising physical contact through automation. During the first few weeks of FCA's implementation, the average time for container clearance had initially improved, dropping from 108 hours to 66. However, the long-term data now shows the opposite trend.

Rs20bn development push for Hyderabad misses the basics,"US
Water, sewerage and park projects left out of Sindh's 2025-26 PSDP
The Sindh government is going to inject more than Rs20 billion on an array of development schemes in Hyderabad in fiscal 2025-26. However, some of the most needed development projects pertaining to water filtration plants, sewage treatment plants and public parks do not find a mention in the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
The pollution of the Indus River and its canals in Hyderabad will continue unabated for the years to come because the government appears least bothered in treating municipal, commercial and industrial sewage, released in the waterways.
Besides, the city's water needs have increased manifold due to the population surge but only small capacity water filtration facilities of around six million gallons per day are being built instead of a central plant with a higher capacity.
The toxic industrial wastewater from Hyderabad SITE area is discharged in Phuleli canal, which is a drinking and irrigation water source for Hyderabad, Tando Muhammad Khan and Badin districts.
The zone's industrialists are being assured for some years that the provincial government will build for them a combined effluent treatment plant.
The budget, however, has kept the status of CEPT for Hyderabad SITE as unapproved with an outlay of Rs100 million and zero allocations for this year.
Moreover, there are also reflections of schemes, which have witnessed years-long delay in release of the earmarked funds, consequently delaying the projects' completion and ending up in increasing the costs. There are some other projects which although appear less significant but have secured massive funds.
Two years ago in 2023 the government had approved installation of three traffic signals in Hyderabad with the expenditure of Rs233.486 million. A paltry sum of Rs11.674 million was released in the outgoing financial year while the next year Rs30 million more will be provided, totalling 18% of the total allocation.
This abundantly shows how the authorities waste years to complete some of the vital projects for the city, which ought to be rounded off in a few months in view of the rampant traffic congestion issues.
The phase III of the greater Qasimabad drainage scheme was kicked off in 2017 with a revised budget of Rs3.1 billion. That project is likely to be completed by June 2026 with the release of the remaining total amount of Rs230 million.
Another project approved in 2017 concerns construction of road, retaining wall, drain and prestressed bridge on the right side of old Phuleli canal, stretching from Preetabad to Darya Khan pumping station.
A revised sum of Rs4.923 billion is to be spent on the project whose completion status will be 85% in June 2026, even after eight years. The provincial government had approved the construction of a sanitary landfill site for Hyderabad in February 2017. Out of the total estimated cost of Rs461.9 million, it will get only Rs25 million in 2025-26.
The construction of 9.66-kilometer long Tando Jam bypass road on Hyderabad-Mirpurkhas road was also approved in May 2017, with over Rs2 billion outlay. With Rs98.5 million fund allocation for next fiscal, 90% of the total budget for the bypass road will be released by June 2026.
The authorities have also planned to recondition and construct two of some most important roads in Hyderabad. One of them stretches from Shahbaz Flyover on Thandi Sarak to Latifabad Unit 7 railway underpass and the other from the grid station in Qasimabad to former National Highway.
However, shockingly though, a colossal sum of Rs1.038 billion has been proposed in the budget for the two roads whose combined length is around 2 kms. The government will release Rs519.3 million for the project in the upcoming budget year.
The ongoing widening and reconditioning of Autobahn, the longest commercial road in the city, has already taken too long to utter dismay of the traders and the commuters.
The Rs3.2 billion project, which also includes construction of a new drainage system under the road, will receive 94% of the total sanctioned funds. The scheme was approved in October 2022, and it was revised on May 29, 2023.
In the higher education sector, the Government College University will receive Rs119.7 million to complete the construction of boundary wall at the total cost of Rs200 million while for varsity's upgrade Rs17.8 million will be given.

Rain likely as heatwave eases,"US
Dust storms forecast for Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad
Widespread dust storms and scattered rain are expected across much of upper and central Punjab this weekend, bringing temporary relief from the intense heat that has gripped the region in recent weeks.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said on Saturday that a westerly weather system currently moving across the country is likely to continue influencing weather patterns through Monday.
While most of Punjab will continue to experience hot and dry weather during the day, isolated areas — particularly in Murree, Galliyat, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Multan, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad and surrounding districts — could see dust storms and thundershowers. Kashmir is also likely to receive scattered rainfall and thunderstorms.
By Sunday, the weather is expected to remain warm and partly cloudy across most districts, but the chance of dust storms and rain will spread to additional areas, including Gujranwala, Sargodha, Bhakkar, and Jhang. The PMD also noted the possibility of hail in some places during the period, especially in upper Punjab and Kashmir.
In the last 24 hours, several areas in Punjab reported light rainfall. Gujrat recorded the highest rainfall at 11.6 millimetress, followed by Mangla with 5.8 and Sialkot Airport with 3.8 millimeters. Light showers were also reported in Murree, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Bahawalpur. Despite these scattered showers, most districts in the province remained hot and dry. Temperatures continued to soar, with Bahawalnagar recording the highest maximum temperature in Punjab at 49 degrees Celsius, while Murree remained the coolest at 17 degrees.
The forecast comes as the country begins to see a slight break in the prevailing heatwave. According to the PMD, moist air from the Arabian Sea is interacting with the incoming westerly system, creating conditions for intermittent dust storms and thunderstorms. These weather patterns are expected to affect not only Punjab and Kashmir, but also parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and northern Balochistan, continuing through June 16.
The authorities have been urged to remain alert as strong winds and thunderstorms could damage trees, power lines, solar panels, and other exposed infrastructure.
The public, especially farmers, tourists, and travelers, were advised to take precautionary measures and plan activities with changing weather conditions in mind.
The Meteorological Department said the ongoing heatwave is likely to subside during this period, offering much-needed respite to residents across the region.
Dengue risk
Talking to the participants of an awareness walk at Lahore General Hospital (LGH) about the prevention of dengue virus, Ameerud Din Medical College Principal Professor Farooq Afzal said dengue fever is a medical as well as a social problem and citizens should keep their homes and surrounding environment clean and dry to protect themselves.
He asserted that women associated with the health and education sectors should spread awareness about the prevention of dengue virus as well as other diseases.

"Centre, Sindh clash over motorway delay","US
Putting up a long list of complaints against the Centre, the chief minister said
The Centre and Sindh on Saturday came face-to-face on the much-delayed Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway project along with the reconstruction of the Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway, with the latter accusing the former of dragging its feet when it comes to development projects in the province.
Addressing his post-budget news conference in Karachi on Saturday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said, ""Sindh is not a colony of the federation as the province is not getting its full share from the Centre"".
Putting up a long list of complaints against the Centre, the chief minister said that first Rs30 billion were allocated for the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway and now the allocation was reduced to Rs15 billion. ""If the trend persists, this project will not be completed even in the next 12 years.""
Commenting on the chief minister's comments, Federal Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan expressed that as the federal minister, he takes responsibility for the past year only, but does not want to comment on the inaction of previous governments regarding the construction of the Sukkur, Hyderabad and Karachi motorways.
He said the construction of the Karachi-Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorways would commence this year and added that the Islamic Development Bank has expressed willingness to fund the project, while the final decision regarding the loan approval is expected in September this year after its board meeting, said a press release issued here.
He stressed the corporate importance of connecting Karachi Port to the National Motorway network, saying that without this connection, the motorway's utility for import, export and business would be of no use.
He pointed out that different political parties, including the PPP, remained in power, but unfortunately, several years were wasted due to the failure to initiate these critical infrastructure projects like the motorways of Karachi-Hyderabad-Sukkur.
Abdul Aleem Khan reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to construct not only the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway but also the Hyderabad-Karachi section as well while the aim is to complete the entire route within two years.

"CM outlines fiscal, development agenda","US
Slams centre over withheld funds, cuts for various projects in Sindh
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah outlined a fiscal and development agenda for the province while highlighting serious financial challenges and federal shortfalls.
Addressing a post-budget press conference on Saturday, the CM criticised the federal government for failing to meet its financial commitments, revealing that Sindh was informed just one day before the budget presentation that Rs105 billion in expected funds would be withheld.
Sindh has received Rs1,478.5 billion from the divisible pool since last year, but Rs422.3 billion remains outstanding. He expressed hope that the withheld amount would be disbursed by the end of June.
Despite being under an IMF programme that demands strict fiscal discipline, the Sindh government will allocate Rs590 billion for development projects this year, with a total budget of Rs3.45 trillion, Rs1 trillion for development and Rs2.15 trillion for current expenditures.
Notably, Rs1.1 trillion is earmarked for salaries and pensions, leading to salary increases of 12 per cent for lower-grade employees and 10 per cent for higher grades.
Sectoral budget increases include an 18 per cent rise in education funding and an 11 per cent increase in health. Funding for agriculture, irrigation, and local government projects has also seen significant boosts.
Furthermore, Rs236 billion has been allocated for infrastructure projects in Karachi, including public-private partnership initiatives.
CM Shah highlighted Sindh's social welfare achievements, particularly in housing for flood victims, with 500,000 homes built and another 850,000 under construction, totalling 1.3 million.
To enhance rural living standards, the CM announced a Rs600-billion-project for rural water and sanitation, benefiting 4.5 million villagers.
Regarding taxation, Murad noted that no new taxes were introduced in the budget, with some taxes eliminated or reduced, including the abolition of the entertainment tax and cuts to restaurant taxes. The stamp duty on third-party vehicle insurance has been reduced to Rs50, with a drop in the insurance tax from 15 per cent to five per cent.
To modernise governance, the Sindh government is digitising land records through block chain for easier access. The CM claimed that free laser levellers will be provided to small farmers, with subsidies for larger ones, alongside the implementation of cluster farming technology. The CM said that improvements in education and health include the establishment of 34,000 new caste centres and expanded support for persons with disabilities.
Cognitive Remediation
The CM outlined the K-4 water project structure, where the federal government is responsible for sourcing water from Keenjhar Lake, while the Sindh government manages distribution and has allocated necessary funds. A total of Rs20 billion is earmarked for the K-4 feeder, alongside plans for a costly five-million-gallon desalination plant.
The CM also noted 20,000 to 25,000 job vacancies in grades I to IV, with plans for recruitment via IBA-administered tests for BPS-V to VII and filling higher Grade 16 positions. The CM mentioned Sindh's conditions for supporting the federal budget, emphasising equitable distribution of development schemes and the detrimental cut of university funding from Rs4 billion to Rs2 billion, which has sparked protests.
On the critical Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, the CM expressed concern over the halving of federal funding from Rs30 billion to Rs15 billion.
The CM emphasised that major projects are not included in the Federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) and criticised the 18 per cent tax on solar panels as unjust. He warned that the Pakistan Peoples Party would not support the federal budget if unresolved.

Fertiliser reaches Gwadar via transit trade,"US
Ship arrival marks efforts to operationalise Gwadar Port as strategic gateway
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Saturday welcomed the successful berthing of the second Afghan transit trade ship at Gwadar Port.
The vessel, carrying 20,000 metric tons of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser, marks another milestone in enhancing regional trade connectivity. He noted that the fertiliser shipment originated from Townsville, Australia and represented the second successful docking under the revised Afghan transit trade framework, following the arrival of MV Beyond 2 on February 4, 2025.
""This is part of our sustained efforts to operationalise Gwadar Port as a strategic trade gateway for landlocked Afghanistan,"" the minister remarked. ""Gwadar's growing role in transit trade reflects our commitment to enabling smooth access for Afghanistan to international markets.""
He emphasised that the recent decision by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) to replace the bank guarantee requirement with an insurance guarantee for Afghan transit trade through Gwadar had significantly improved ease of doing business and expedited cargo clearance processes. He added that the arrival of MV ASL Rose was a strong indicator of increasing international trust in Gwadar's operational readiness and infrastructure, highlighting Pakistan's role in promoting efficient and reliable transit trade in the region.
Junaid Anwar directed Gwadar Port authorities to ensure quick berthing and seamless cargo unloading and reiterated that the port was fully equipped to handle rising volumes of transit goods under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA).
He expressed confidence that the development would help lower transit costs, increase trade efficiency and reinforce economic ties between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Businessmen reject both budgets,"US
Say federal, Sindh allocations ignore Karachi's needs, fail small businesses
After condemning both the federal and Sindh budgets for 2025-26, business leaders called for mandatory amendments before their approval.
They said neither budget fulfills serious commitments nor offers direct financial relief to micro and small businesses. They demanded substantial revisions to increase allocations for Karachi-centric development projects. The prosperity of Pakistan is tied to Karachi's, they said, warning that neglecting the city amounts to sabotaging the national economy.
Businessmen Group (BMG) Chairman Zubair Motiwala and Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) President Muhammad Jawed Bilwani blasted the federal and Sindh budgets for sidestepping Karachi's needs. Condemning the budgets as deeply disappointing and discriminatory towards Karachi, the country's economic hub, they expressed serious concern over the continued neglect and denial of essential development funds to Karachi and Sindh at large.
Motiwala and Bilwani warned that chronic underinvestment and token budget allocations will worsen the city's infrastructure, civic conditions, and business confidence.
They stressed that Karachi contributes 67% to the national exchequer, 90% to the provincial revenue, and 54% of the country's exports. Denying it fair development funds is not just a regional injustice but a national threat, they lamented. They called on both the federal and provincial governments to revise their priorities and ensure Karachi receives its due share. The time for symbolic allocations is over. Karachi's citizens and business community now demand concrete action, adequate funding, and political will.
The two leaders also highlighted underfunding of the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, a key project for Sindh and Karachi's connectivity. Though the project's cost exceeds Rs400 billion, the federal budget allocates only Rs15 billion — an amount they said reflects disregard for Sindh's development priorities.
Karachi, Pakistan's commercial capital, would benefit directly from the project's completion, making the lack of funding more concerning. Similarily, they pointed to the stalled K-IV Water Supply Project. Despite being critical for a water-starved Karachi, the project remains in limbo.
Though top officials, including the prime minister, have repeatedly promised support, the federal government has allocated only Rs3.2 billion of the Rs150 billion needed.
This minimal allocation, they said, casts doubt on the government's seriousness about solving Karachi's water crisis.
KCCI leaders expressed disappointment with the Sindh Budget 2025-26, saying the provincial government has also failed to address Karachi's needs. In its development outlay, the Sindh government allocated only Rs100 million for the K-IV project and Rs15 billion for the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway — amounts they called meaningless for project execution.
Alarmingly, they said, this marks the third year without a single new mega project for Karachi. The only move was an Rs8 billion allocation to continue earlier projects, most of which are progressing at a snail's pace. They criticised the ongoing delay in the K-IV project. Despite growing water demand, the city's main lifeline remains stalled. Meanwhile, millions of gallons are wasted and discharged into the sea, while residents and industries suffer water shortages.
Federal B Area Association of Trade & Industry (FBATI) President Shaikh Muhammad Tehseen also criticised the inadequate allocations by both governments for Karachi's industrial sector, infrastructure, and water projects.
The budget reflects no serious effort to resolve chronic industrial issues such as crumbling infrastructure, water scarcity, and power instability — all of which undermine productivity and investor confidence, he said. He urged both governments to revisit their budgetary decisions and allocate sufficient resources to support the revival of the industrial sector. Former president of the Hyderabad Chamber of Small Traders & Small Industry (HCSTSI), Muhammad Farooq Shaikhani, said the federal budget includes digital reforms and SME policy initiatives that sound good on paper but offer no direct financial relief for micro and small businesses.
He said the new taxes on digital services and cash-on-delivery (COD) are premature and will burden small enterprises. While the Sindh budget includes funds for infrastructure and social sectors, it does not prioritise industrial zones or SME support.
Both budgets, he said, focus on macroeconomic goals but ignore grassroots business sustainability. There is a clear gap between the government's documentation drive and the actual incentives offered to small traders and manufacturers.
Shaikhani added that both budgets fail to create a conducive environment for small businesses.
The federal budget introduces new taxes — on digital services, cash on delivery (COD), and higher withholding rates — without providing simplified schemes or financial support for small enterprises. The Sindh budget also neglects trade infrastructure and offers no tax relief or subsidies for SMEs. It fails to address the rising cost of energy and unaffordable raw materials, he said.
Without practical incentives or consultations with affected sectors, both budgets appear more focused on revenue collection than on industrial or trade development, he added.

Govt borrowing crowds out private sector,"PL
Banking sector tilts heavily towards state lending due to high returns
The Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 has highlighted a persistent structural imbalance in the country's banking sector, where lending to the government continues to dominate over credit disbursement to the private sector.
Commercial banks have largely preferred investing in risk-free government securities, such as treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), which offer secure and high returns, especially given the elevated interest rate environment that prevailed for most of FY24.
The policy rate remained at a record high of 21% during much of the year as part of State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) efforts to curb inflation. This made government securities particularly attractive to banks, leading to a further rise in their share within banks' asset portfolios.
In terms of domestic debt, the government relied mostly on long-term borrowing through PIBs and Sukuk for financing the fiscal deficit. During the period, Rs2.4 trillion worth of treasury bills were retired. The government also introduced a new two-year, zero-coupon bond through which Rs610 billion was raised. These measures helped improve the maturity profile, reflected by the extension of the average time to maturity of the domestic debt from 2.9 to 3.5 years, according to the survey.
""Regarding the auction of domestic debt securities, robust market participation was witnessed,"" said the report. Total bids received for treasury bills were Rs28.230 trillion (acceptance of Rs9.473 trillion), PIBs Rs23.540 trillion (acceptance of Rs9.682 trillion) and Sukuk Rs4.889 trillion (acceptance of Rs1.562 trillion). The government followed a calibrated acceptance strategy to manage cost and rollover risk.
As a result, credit to the private sector remained subdued throughout the year. High borrowing costs discouraged private sector firms from taking new loans while macroeconomic uncertainty and weakened business confidence also dampened demand for credit. Furthermore, restrictions on imports and foreign exchange shortages earlier in the fiscal year adversely impacted industries that rely on imported raw material and machinery, further reducing the need for private borrowing. The survey suggests that private sector credit growth was either stagnant or negative in real terms when adjusted for inflation, signalling constrained access to affordable financing.
On the other hand, the government's borrowing requirements remained elevated due to a large fiscal deficit and the need to meet substantial debt servicing obligations. Consequently, banks found it easier and safer to park their funds in government debt rather than riskier private sector lending.
This behaviour has caused a ""crowding out"" effect, limiting credit availability for productive sectors such as small and medium enterprises (SMEs), agriculture and export-oriented industries – sectors that are essential for economic diversification, job creation and sustainable growth.
Recognising this imbalance, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) introduced various policy measures to promote private-sector credit. These include the Export Finance Scheme (EFS), Long-Term Financing Facility (LTFF) and SME Asaan Finance (SAAF), designed to offer concessional financing to priority sectors. However, the uptake of these facilities has remained moderate, largely due to the high cost of borrowing, uncertain economic prospects and low-risk appetite among both lenders and borrowers.
The Economic Survey cautions that unless private sector credit conditions improve, the country's broader goals of industrial modernisation, technological upgrading and export competitiveness may remain unfulfilled. The limited flow of financing to the private sector restricts the potential for new investment, expansion of productive capacity and diversification of the economy.
This structural weakness poses a long-term challenge to Pakistan's growth trajectory and must be addressed through coordinated fiscal, monetary and structural reforms aimed at reducing the government's borrowing needs and enhancing the creditworthiness of private enterprises.
Financial inclusion remains a strategic priority but continues to face hurdles. The survey notes encouraging growth in microfinance and branchless banking sectors, yet large segments of the population – particularly women and rural communities – remain underserved.
The microfinance sector reported significant expansion, with active borrowers increasing from 9.56 million in December 2023 to over 12.34 million by the end of 2024. Total deposits in microfinance institutions rose from Rs597 billion to Rs732.9 billion over the same period. However, the average loan size decreased from Rs59,988 to Rs48,971, indicating smaller loan amounts that may limit economic empowerment potential.
Branchless banking, a vital tool for reaching the underserved population, saw positive momentum as well. The number of branchless banking accounts increased 11% to 126.7 million in December 2024, with transaction volumes growing 38% to over 5.4 billion during the year. The value of these transactions surged 42% to Rs25.8 trillion, highlighting growing reliance on digital financial services.
Despite these gains, infrastructure gaps, limited digital literacy and low trust in formal financial institutions continue to impede broader financial inclusion.

WWF warns of plastic perils in Pakistan,"US
Says country generates 2m tonnes of plastic waste annually, with 86% mismanaged
Pakistan generates nearly two million tonnes of plastic waste annually, of which 86% is improperly managed, severely harming human health and the environment, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature-Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan).
In a statement issued on World Environment Day, WWF highlighted that over 1.7 million tonnes of plastic end up in landfills, open dumps, waterways, and even food systems — placing Pakistan among the top 10 plastic-polluting countries globally.
WWF-Pakistan noted that plastic pollution is now one of the country's most pressing environmental challenges, contributing significantly to ecosystem degradation, biodiversity loss, and water contamination.
Pakistan also ranks among the highest in South Asia for plastic mismanagement, further burdening urban waste systems and increasing public health risks.
Globally, plastics have revolutionized industries due to their low cost and durability. However, the proliferation of single-use plastics (SUPs) — such as bottles, bags, wrappers, and cutlery — has created a growing crisis. According to the UN Environment Programme, approximately 400 million metric tonnes of plastic waste are generated worldwide each year, 36% of which consists of SUPs.
A 2023 study by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency revealed that less than 10% of the country's plastic waste is recycled. The rest contributes to landfill overflow, inefficient waste diversion, and pollution due to a lack of integrated waste management and limited investment in recycling infrastructure.
Plastic packaging, which constitutes 40% of global plastic production, is especially harmful due to its non-biodegradable nature. Composed of long-lasting polymers like polyethylene and polystyrene, these materials persist in the environment for centuries, polluting land, rivers, and oceans.
Studies estimate that over 14 million tonnes of plastic waste enter the oceans annually. Microplastics — tiny fragments resulting from plastic breakdown — have now been found in seafood, drinking water, and even human blood.

Kanye appears in court to back Diddy,"US
'Donda' singer watched trial from separate room
US rapper Kanye West showed up at a Manhattan federal courthouse Friday to support music mogul Sean Combs, who is on trial for alleged sex trafficking and racketeering, reported AFP.
West, who has legally changed his name to Ye, never entered the courtroom; he briefly watched the proceedings in an adjacent room on closed-circuit video with one of Combs's sons and then left.
When asked by broadcaster ABC whether he was there to support Combs, the 48-year-old West nodded and replied: ""Yes.""
His brief appearance came one day after a former girlfriend of Combs wrapped up her testimony.
The woman, speaking under the pseudonym Jane, delivered emotional, graphic details about how he allegedly pressured her into drug-fuelled sex sessions with escorts.
Her description closely tracked with the testimony of a previous star witness, Combs's longtime girlfriend Casandra Ventura, who said the encounters were called ""freak-offs.""
In her testimony, Jane described travelling to Las Vegas last year on a well-known rapper's private plane, and that she had recommended a male escort to that rapper and his girlfriend.
For nearly a month, jurors in the Manhattan court have heard a series of witnesses describing the influence the 55-year-old Combs exerted over staff and ex-girlfriends.
When Ventura – who last month testified of physical and psychological abuse in similarly excruciating detail – filed her 2023 civil lawsuit that opened the door for a federal investigation, Jane said she ""almost fainted.""
""There was a whole other woman feeling the same thing,"" Jane said.
""I feel like I'm reading my own sexual trauma. It makes me sick how three solid pages, word for word, are exactly my experiences and my anguish,"" she messaged Combs, in text records read in court.
Combs faces life in prison if convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking.
The music mogul has pled not guilty to the charges against him, with his lawyers arguing that what prosecutors deem to be sex trafficking was in fact consensual.
The trial is expected to continue at least through June.

"Beckham, Oldman knighted","US
The Who singer Roger Daltrey also received the honour
Former England football captain and global fashion icon David Beckham was knighted on Friday for his services to sport and charity, with The Who singer Roger Daltrey and actor Gary Oldman also receiving the honour, as reported by AFP.
Beckham, who played 115 times for England as well as for some of the world's most high-profile clubs including Manchester United and Real Madrid, will now be known as 'sir' and his wife Victoria, a former member of the Spice Girls pop group, will be known as Lady Beckham.
The 50-year-old, who has long been in the running for a knighthood, was appointed an officer of the Order of the British Empire in 2003 – a lesser award in Britain's honours system.
Victoria later received the same award for services to the fashion industry.
""Growing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honour,"" Beckham said in a statement issued to the Press Association.
""I'm so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I'm grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment,"" he added.
Daltrey, who co-founded The Who in 1964, will also take the title of sir having been recognised for his services to charity and music in King Charles III's Birthday Honours list.
The 81-year-old singer has been a patron of Teenage Cancer Trust since 2000, holding fundraising concerts at London's Royal Albert Hall for more than two decades.
Daltrey 'dream'
""It's kind of weird, but I am deeply honoured to get this, especially for the charity for the Teenage Cancer Trust, and I accept it on their behalf really, because this honour is really for all unsung heroes,"" the My Generation singer told the Press Association.
""It's a dream come true for me, but it's especially a dream because the charity means so much,"" he added.
Oldman, who won a best actor Oscar for his portrayal of Winston Churchill in 2017's Darkest Hour, also received a knighthood for his services to drama.
The 67-year-old's films have earned over $11 billion, and his credits include the Harry Potter series, The Dark Knight Trilogy and Air Force One, along with cameo appearances in sitcom Friends and music videos for David Bowie and Guns N' Roses.
Stage star Elaine Page, who played Eva Peron in the first production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Evita, and novelist Pat Barker have both been made dames.
Barker is known for her World War I Regeneration Trilogy, the first book of which was turned into a Hollywood film starring Jonathan Pryce.
Brand Beckham
Beckham's knighthood is the culmination of years of tireless efforts to transcend football and turn himself into a global icon at the intersection of sport, fashion and business.
The honour, one of the highest bestowed by the UK state, ""is a powerful symbolic marker"", Marie Agnes Parmentier, professor of marketing at the University of Montreal and author of several papers on Posh and Becks, explained to AFP.
Even at the height of his football career, Beckham was building his global brand with thought to his retirement.
His appearance in a sarong, revelations that he used make-up and his eccentric hairstyles were all feverishly gobbled up by the UK's tabloid press.
He also had to overcome the tag as England's 'most-hated man' after being sent off during the 1998 World Cup in a knockout game against Argentina.
Beckham is understood to have been on the verge of receiving a knighthood after helping London win its bid to host the 2012 Olympic Games.
But UK authorities placed a red flag on his nomination due to his involvement in an alleged tax avoidance scheme, according to previous reports. He was subsequently cleared.

Panel to monitor impact on oil prices,"GB
Sixteen-member committee led by FinMin to ensure supply of fuel
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has formed a 16-member committee to monitor the impact of the volatility in oil prices in the wake of Israel's attack on Iran, a major oil producing country.
A notification issued on Friday by the Ministry of Energy said there has been a sudden spike in oil prices in the international market after the start of the Israel-Iran conflict.
According to the notification, the committee — to be convened by the minister and finance — includes petroleum, power ministers, state minister for finance as well as the governor of the State Bank.
The committee will closely monitor the forward/futures prices of Petroleum Products and the predictability of supply chain in view of the current conflict in the region.
It will also determine forex implications of price volatility for the short and medium term and suggest a plan if required — to ensure that there are no supply  disruptions and the market is well supplied.
It will also carry out a detailed analysis of the fiscal impact, in the event of a protracted conflict. The committee may co-opt any other member as deemed necessary for the fulfillment of its mandate.
""The Petroleum Division shall provide secretarial support to the committee. The committee shall submit its recommendations on a weekly basis for the perusal of the prime minister,"" it added.
Fuel prices
Consumers brace for yet another hike in fuel prices as estimates suggest that petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) rates may increase in the upcoming fortnightly review, largely driven by a surge in international oil prices.
According to official sources familiar with the pricing structure, petrol is expected to see a marginal rise of around Re1 per litre, while the price of high-speed diesel could go up by approximately Rs5 per litre.
The changes would apply from June 16 to June 30, with the final decision to be made based on import cost calculations on June 15.
At present, the ex-depot price of petrol stands at Rs252.63 per litre. Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws and private cars, any change in petrol price significantly impacts the expenses of the middle and lower-middle income groups.
Meanwhile, the ex-depot price of HSD is Rs254.64 per litre. Diesel fuels the bulk of Pakistan's heavy transport sector, including trucks, buses, tractors and farm machinery such as threshers and tube wells.
Given its broad use in agriculture and freight, an increase in diesel price typically triggers inflation across food supply chains.

John Lennon love letter goes on sale,"US
The Beatles' singer bemoans Paul's snoring
A 1962 love letter from John Lennon to his future wife Cynthia, in which he complains about Paul McCartney's snoring, will be sold at Christie's next month, the London auction house said.
The 21-year old Lennon wrote the four-page letter over five nights in April 1962, during the Beatles' residency at the Star-Club in Hamburg.
""I love love love you and I'm missing you like mad,"" wrote the songwriter, before adding a lewd suggestion.
The letter is expected to fetch up to £40,000 ($54,000) when it is sold on July 9.
Lennon's letter opens referencing the death of his close friend and his anxieties about going to visit Sutcliffe's fiancée. ""I haven't seen Astrid since the day we arrived, I've thought of going to see her but I would be so awkward — I won't write any more about it 'cause it's not much fun,"" he wrote.
He opposed Cynthia's plans to share a house with McCartney's then girlfriend Dot Rhone in Liverpool, saying ""we would never be alone really ... imagine having her there all the time when we were in bed — and imagine Paul coming all the time"".
He complained about his bandmate's bedtime habits, writing ""Paul's leaping about on my head (he's in a bunk on top of me and he's snoring) ... Shurrup M carntey (sic)!...
Lennon signed off the letter: ""I love you I love you please wait for me and don't be sad and work hard be a clever little Cyn Powell"".
Cynthia Powell dated Lennon from 1958 and they married in August 1962, giving birth to their son Julian in April 1963.
They divorced in 1968, and a year later Lennon married Yoko Ono.
