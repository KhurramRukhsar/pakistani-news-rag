Air India black box data downloaded,"SG
The black boxes of the plane - the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) - were recovered
Investigators have downloaded flight recorder data from an Air India crash this month that killed 260 people, India's civil aviation ministry said on Thursday, a long-awaited step towards understanding the world's worst aviation disaster in a decade.
The London-bound Boeing 787 Dreamliner crashed moments after takeoff from India's Ahmedabad city on June 12, killing 241 of the 242 people on board and the rest on the ground.
The black boxes of the plane - the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) - were recovered in the days that followed, one from the rooftop of a building at the crash site on June 13, and the other from the debris on June 16.
The ministry said data from the front recorder was accessed on Wednesday by a team led by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB), with the US National Transportation Safety Board.
""These efforts aim to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the accident and identify contributing factors to enhance aviation safety and prevent future occurrences,"" the ministry said in a statement.

Pakistan pledges to stamp out torture,"NL
Pakistan remained committed to eradicating torture and strengthening protections for all individuals
As the world observes the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture on Thursday, Pakistan reiterated its solidarity with torture victims globally and reaffirmed its commitment to eradicating torture and upholding human dignity.
""Islam upholds the sanctity and dignity of every human being. Any act of torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is incompatible with the values of justice, mercy, and compassion that are at the core of Islamic teachings,"" the Foreign Office spokesperson said in a message on the Day.
He said that guided by these values and its international obligations, Pakistan remained committed to eradicating torture and strengthening protections for all individuals.
""Legal reforms, institutional safeguards, and oversight mechanisms continue to be strengthened by Pakistan to ensure accountability and uphold the rule of law. Measures are also being taken to provide victims with medical, legal, and psycho-social support,"" he remarked.
The spokesperson said that Pakistan remained gravely concerned at the widespread and systematic use of torture as an instrument of oppression in situations of foreign occupation.
He highlighted that the people of the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the IIOJK continued to be subjected to the worst forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the occupying powers to suppress their right to self-determination.
""Pakistan reiterates its call on the international community to condemn the crimes of these occupying powers and to hold them accountable, in addition to helping end the plight of the victims of their torture and oppression,"" he added.

Performances that shaped Mahira,"NL
The unforgettable fourteen years of Pakistan's favourite superstar
Mahira Khan marked 14 years in the industry with an Instagram post on Wednesday that read: ""Today marks 14 years of my debut. Today, in this very moment, I am sitting under the same skies where I prayed, dreamed, worked hard, manifested... Today I bow my head in gratitude.""
Today, Mahira Khan is a household name across South Asia, but her legacy has been built gradually through a body of work that has helped shape the landscape of Pakistani cinema and television. Known for portraying women who are vulnerable, flawed, resilient, spiritual, and brave, Mahira has consistently taken on roles that challenge and expand the representation of femininity on screen.
Her breakout role, Ayesha, came in Bol (2011), marking the beginning of her ascent as one of the region's most influential actors. As the quiet, supportive sister to Humaima Malick's Zainab, her lightheartedness and inner strength reflected the lives of many women caught in abusive family dynamics in Pakistan. The film changed the course of Pakistani cinema and launched Mahira into stardom.
Throughout her ongoing career, Mahira has been part of many iconic projects, portraying her acting chops through incredible characters alongside some of the biggest names in the industry.
'Humsafar' (2011)
Humsafar is arguably Mahira's most beloved role and made her shy heroine, Khirad, a national sweetheart overnight. Starring opposite Fawad Khan's suave Ashar, Mahira's character starts out as a simple, educated girl forced into a marriage of convenience. As the two develop feelings for each other, a sinister scheme by her mother-in-law, played by Atiqa Odho, tears the couple apart. When betrayed and cast out, she raises her child alone, returning not for revenge, but to be heard and to fight for the rights of her daughter. Khirad's strength and dignity highlight the power of mothers.
'Shehre Zaat' (2012)
Adapted from Umera Ahmad's novel of the same name, Shehre Zaat finds Mahira playing Falak, a self-centred sculptor from a wealthy family, obsessed with outer beauty and romantic ideals. After her marriage to Mikaal Zulfiqar's character fails due to his infidelity, she turns inward, questioning ego, faith, and identity - and giving one of the best performances of her career. She ultimately turns to God, going through a spiritual journey with the help of her grandmother, played by Samina Peerzada. The TV series has been praised for showing strong female characters, a break from the mopey, weak portrayals of women commonly written.
'Bin Roye' (2015)
Her first role next to superstar Humayun Saeed was for Bin Roye, a film adapted from a novel by Farhat Ishtiaq. Mahira plays Saba, a naive and emotional girl who is deeply in love with her cousin, played by Humayun. However, he falls in love with her sister and marries her, and Saba's grief turns to bitterness. After her sister passes away in an accident, Saba goes into guilt-ridden shock, but she is married off to Humayun's character to accompany him to America and also to take care of his son. Her journey moves from possessive love to self-realisation. Saba is one of Mahira's most emotionally volatile roles, showing jealousy, vulnerability, and redemption. The success of this film resulted in it being adapted into a television series with the same name, with the same cast.
'Verna' (2017)
Verna is a powerful story of Sara, played by Mahira, who is kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a powerful politician's son. She refuses to stay silent, fights the system, and takes matters into her own hands. This gut-wrenching story becomes an inspirational tale of a woman who goes against all odds to fight back against the injustices done to her. Near its release, Central Board of Film Censors stated, ""The general plot of the movie revolves around rape, which we consider to be unacceptable,"" as they moved to ban it in Pakistan. However, after an outcry from women's rights activists, the film was released and well-received for its portrayal of jarring and real issues women in Pakistan go through, especially if they have been victims of sexual violence.
Right now, Mahira is making waves in the media for her new film with Humayun, released on Eidul Adha. Love Guru is a modern-day love story, where Humayun plays a ""love guru"" who helps people find love and get married, until he is tasked with breaking up the forthcoming wedding of the character, played by Mahira. As reactions and reviews are pouring in, the film has received mixed reviews on story and acting; however, the chemistry between the leads has been highly praised.
Not only has Mahira shone as an actor, but she has also emerged as a vocal advocate for human rights. Her career reflects a deep commitment to telling stories that matter, both on screen and beyond it.

KMC Council passes Rs55b budget with majority,"NL
In a rare display of political maturity, no ruckus in the house during session
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) Council approved a budget of Rs55.28 billion for the fiscal year 2025-26, by a majority vote, during a session chaired by Mayor Karachi Murtaza Wahab. Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad and Municipal Commissioner Afzal Zaidi were also in attendance, along with other notable figures. For the first time in KMC's history, all council members were given the opportunity to participate in discussions and offer suggestions before the budget was passed.
Wahab stated that the new budget will open fresh avenues for the city's development and ensure equal treatment for all union committees. He reassured that the promises made to the people of Karachi would be fulfilled, emphasising that development funds had been allocated fairly across all areas. The mayor acknowledged input from both the treasury and opposition benches, noting that useful proposals had been presented for the improvement of the city's development projects. He also expressed hope that all elected representatives would support public welfare initiatives through mutual consultation.
Meanwhile, Parliamentary Leader Karamullah Waqasi appreciated the manner in which the budget was presented, allowing every member to express their views. He noted that development work was underway across 246 union committees, with 71% of the planned work completed. Further, Waqasi urged accountability in case of any corruption, and clarified that the Rs3 billion allocated for the K-IV water project had been provided by the federal government, not the city administration.
Separately, Council member Najmi Alam highlighted equal spending of the CLIP fund across towns, confirming that Rs20 million had been allocated to each union committee. He also pointed out that stormwater drains were clogged with plastic bags, proposing a ban on plastic use.
Deputy Parliamentary Leader Juman Darwan, stating that a budget reflects the performance of an institution, criticised the federal government for making promises to Karachi but failing in deliverance. He praised the KMC budget for addressing key urban challenges including sewerage, water supply, roads, and other critical sectors.
Following approval of the budget, the city council meeting was adjourned indefinitely.

"K-P budget decision unanimous, says Shibli","NL
.
Opposition Leader in the Senate Shibli Faraz on Thursday said the PTI political committee had unanimously decided to present the Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa budget and that they would consult PTI Patron-in-Chief Imran after meeting him.
Any suggestions from Imran would be approved by a two-thirds majority, he added.
Speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail alongside K-P government Finance Adviser Muzammil Aslam, Faraz alleged that there was a conspiracy to prevent the presentation of the K-P budget in order to create a constitutional crisis.
He said before tabling the budget, the PTI founder had instructed him, Muzammil Aslam, Omar Ayub, Taimur Jhagra and Ali Amin Gandapur to consult with one another.
""We made several attempts to meet the PTI founder, but permission was not granted,"" Faraz said. ""Therefore, the budget was presented in line with the political committee's decision.""
He dismissed talk of ""minus one"" or ""minus two,"" saying that people still firmly stood with the PTI founder. Passing the budget had defeated the conspiracy, he noted.
He further stated that the budget is provisional and that changes can be made at the PTI founder's direction.

Safety off track,"DE
.
Pakistan Railways is lurching from one preventable disaster to another. In just the first six months of 2025, the network has witnessed 45 train-related accidents. Of the 45 incidents, 22 involved passenger trains and 20 freight trains. No amount of official statements or half-hearted safety ""initiatives"" can now mask the dangerous reality that our railways are neither safe nor reliable.
The consequences extend beyond physical injuries and financial losses running into tens of millions of rupees. Each accident disrupts lives, paralyses trade and erodes public confidence. The recent kidnapping of passengers on the Jaffer Express marks a new low — one that exposes the railway's failure not just in safety, but also in security.
For years, Pakistan Railways has operated on outdated infrastructure and a bureaucracy that prioritises damage control over meaningful change. That has to end. The way forward is clear, but it requires political will and administrative resolve. First, unmanned level crossings — death traps across the country — must be eliminated through either full automation or permanent staffing. Second, real-time monitoring and fail-safe signalling systems must be made standard. Third, any staff negligence — from drivers to supervisors — must face swift and transparent accountability. And finally, the security apparatus on trains needs to be overhauled. If passengers cannot travel without fear of abduction, then Pakistan Railways has failed in its most fundamental duty.
The tracks are stained with negligence, and each new incident should serve as a final warning. Pakistan cannot afford to lose more lives and billions in economic losses due to institutional inertia. The railways serve as a lifeline for millions — especially those who cannot afford alternatives. Dismantling the system is not the solution. Reforming and rebuilding it from the ground up is.

ICC enforces key changes in all formats,"DE
The changes for white-ball formats will take effect from July 2
The International Cricket Council (ICC) has introduced several important changes to its playing conditions, which will apply across all formats of the men's game. These changes aim to improve the pace and fairness of play and will come into effect from July 2, 2025, for white-ball matches, while some are already active in the current World Test Championship (WTC) cycle.
Stop clock introduced in Test cricket: After being trialled in limited-overs formats, the stop clock will now be used in Test matches to address slow over rates. The fielding team must be ready to start the next over within 60 seconds of the previous one ending. Umpires will give two warnings before awarding five penalty runs for each further delay. The countdown will reset every 80 overs and will be visible on screen.
Updated saliva rule: The ban on using saliva to shine the ball remains, but umpires will no longer need to change the ball immediately if saliva is applied accidentally. Instead, they will assess whether the condition of the ball has been affected. If the ball behaves unusually but hasn't changed significantly, five penalty runs will be given to the batting side, but the ball will not be replaced. New DRS dismissal protocol: A major change has been made to the Decision Review System (DRS). If a batter is given out caught, but replays show no bat involved, the third umpire will now check for a possible lbw dismissal. If ball-tracking shows the ball hitting the stumps and the decision falls under ""umpire's call,"" the original out decision will still stand.
Catch review allowed on no-ball: If a no-ball is called during a delivery where a catch is taken, the TV umpire will still review the catch. If it's clean, the batting team will only get the run for the no-ball. If it's not a fair catch, the batting side will receive any completed runs as well. These changes are part of the ICC's efforts to modernise the game, make it more efficient, and ensure fairer play across formats.

Mayor cancels bus stand tender,"PL
Zubair orders probe into fake bids
Serious irregularities and fake bids have been uncovered in the annual tender process for the General Bus Stand in Peshawar. Taking prompt notice, Mayor Haji Zubair Ali has ordered the immediate cancellation of the entire tender.
An important meeting chaired by Mayor Zubair Ali was convened to discuss the matter in detail, attended by all relevant stakeholders. The meeting resolved that strict legal action will be taken against those involved in submitting fake or unverified bids, along with their facilitators.
To investigate the issue thoroughly, the Mayor has announced the formation of a formal inquiry committee to bring the facts to light and ensure strict accountability for those responsible. He also instructed that all submitted funds be immediately transferred to the official government account and directed the issuance of a fresh tender advertisement based on transparency and merit.
Mayor Zubair Ali emphasized that the limited resources of the Metropolitan Government cannot be allowed to fall prey to misuse. ""The General Bus Stand is a vital source of our revenue and protecting it from corrupt elements is a shared responsibility,"" he stated.
He further revealed that the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has also been approached for an independent investigation into the non-transparent tendering process. It was noted that several contractors had submitted bids during the online e-bidding process without depositing the mandatory call deposit, prompting the Mayor to take swift action and halt the entire process.
Mayor Zubair Ali has also indicated that in the coming days, he will personally oversee all tendering matters to ensure future transparency and prevent any form of corruption or malpractice.

Dortmund through to Club World Cup last 16,"NL
Daniel Svensson goal was enough to secure a win against Ulsan HD
A solitary first-half goal by Daniel Svensson gave Borussia Dortmund a 1-0 win against Ulsan HD on Wednesday as the Germans secured a place in the last 16 of the Club World Cup.
Dortmund's second straight victory by a one-goal margin, following their 4-3 defeat of Mamelodi Sundowns on Saturday, was watched by only just over 8,000 spectators in Cincinnati, among them US Vice President JD Vance and FIFA chief Gianni Infantino.
It means Dortmund qualify for the last 16 as winners of Group F, while Fluminense go through behind them in second after holding off Sundowns in a goalless stalemate played at the same time in Miami.
""We can be satisfied. I think our performance was better than in the first two matches,"" said Dortmund coach Niko Kovac.
He has spoken regularly at the tournament about the difficulties posed by the searing June heat in the United States, and this was another game played in sweltering mid-afternoon conditions.
""We keep saying the same thing. What the boys are doing is incredible. Thirty-six degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Fahrenheit) and 43 degrees in the stadium. This is incredible,"" Kovac said.
""Even if you just stand around it can get very taxing but I think they are doing a great job. Now we have a day off and I hope the players recover for the next match.""
Kovac only made two changes to his starting line-up as Karim Adeyemi and Julian Ryerson came in, while Jobe Bellingham kept his place in the team.
The Bundesliga giants should have won by a greater margin on another hot day in Cincinnati, but Serhou Guirassy was denied by a good Jo Hyeon-woo save on 27 minutes.
Bellingham then fizzed a volley just over from an Adeyemi cross moments later, but the crucial goal arrived on 36 minutes -- soft defending by Ulsan saw the Koreans lose possession on the edge of their own box before Bellingham teed up Svensson and the Swede fired in low on his left foot.
Guirassy, who has had a prolific season, should have scored in first-half stoppage time with a header from close range which was straight at the goalkeeper.
Sun sets on Mamelodi campaign
Dortmund's Gregor Kobel was then called into action on the hour mark to deny Lee Jin-hyun, while Yan Couto came close to making it 2-0 late on.
Kovac's team will now play their last-16 tie in Atlanta next Tuesday and will find out the identity of their opponents later on Wednesday when Group E concludes.
""Now we have to leave everything on the pitch. The stakes are high. It is about prestige and money. I think we will see an increase in quality,"" said Kovac.
Ulsan go home with three defeats from three games, while Fluminense are through, meaning all four Brazilian teams in the competition have progressed to the knockout phase.
Conditions were also tough in Miami, where captain Jhon Arias flashed a shot across the face of goal and wide for Fluminense late in the first half.
German Cano came close for the Rio de Janeiro side after the break, while Sundowns enjoyed more of the possession over the 90 minutes but could not get the win they needed to progress in front of a crowd of 14,312.
Their exit means none of the four African clubs who came to the tournament will feature in the last 16, but Sundowns' performances mean they can go home with their heads held high.
""We are not happy. We had a clear objective in this match, but I am very proud of the level the players performed at,"" said the South African champions' coach, Miguel Cardoso.
""We leave and go home with our heads up because we are much stronger than we were when we came here.""

Low funding to spike varsity fee,"NL
Punjab government allocates Rs18 billion for 51 public sector universities
Facing financial constraints in pursuing research and development projects, several big government universities in Lahore are considering a hike in their fees.
According to the budget documents, the Punjab government has allocated Rs18 billion for the 51 public sector universities in the province for the coming year. As compared to that, the Sindh government has allocated Rs42 billion for its 32 universities.
The government universities in Punjab, especially the large institutions, may face problems in promoting research and development because of shortage of funds.
Sources in the higher education sector said the big government universities in Punjab were already facing shortage of funds and are now thinking about increasing their tuition, examination, hostel and transport fees from the coming academic session.
On the other hand, university teachers say the government should increase the budget to avert a financial crisis for the institutions.
The administrations of the universities are also concerned about the impact of the low allocation of funds on their thousands of students. An increase of about 20 per cent in the fees would result in a large number of students finding higher education unaffordable.
Some government university student groups were already protesting against increase in fees. The Punjab University, University of Engineering and Technology, Bahauddin Zakaria University and Government University Faisalabad were already by increasing their fees ilarecent years.
The sources said the Punjab University had been allocated Rs70.8 million in the budget for the coming year, while Sindh government has allocated Rs3.5 billion for Karachi University. About 54,000 students are enrolled at Punjab University, while the number in Karachi University is 45,000.
""The universities in the world are only recognised due to research activities and contribution but what can we do when there is shortage of funds,"" said Dr Munawar Sabir, a Professor of Punjab University. He said the university had faced delay in salaries last year the situation might worsen now, making university education more difficult for the middle class.
He said most of the students of the government universities were from remote areas and poor families who could not afford expensive education, but it would be difficult to run the government universities without increasing the fees.
The Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association has also expressed concerns over the budget allocations and its members have also tried to persuade Punjab government to increase the funds for the public sector universities.
FAPAUSA President Dr Amjad Magsi said the teachers were disturbed over the low budget allocation for the universities. He said grants from the Punjab government were essential for the universities to meet their research, development and operational costs.
He said it was already difficult for the universities to function effectively with itching their financial allocations. Better funding is critical not only for sustainability but also for maintaining global standing. Punjab University has been ranked among the top 5.2% universities in the world, according to the independent Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR). Sustaining and improving this position requires strategic investment in faculty, research infrastructure and student support systems, he said.
The leader said the association had also voiced concern over the federal government's proposal to withdraw the existing 25% income tax exemption for teachers and researchers, warning that such a move would discourage research, innovation and knowledge production, which were pillars of progress.

SESSI asked to expand registration of workers,"NL
Public spending watchdog panel head tells social security institution to get audited
Sindh Assembly Public Accounts Committee Chairman Nisar Khuhro has said that since its inception, the Sindh Employees Social Security Institution (SESSI) has not undergone an audit.
SESSI informed the PAC that its governing body had decided against conducting an audit, but Khuhro questioned whether SESSI considers itself above the constitution, refusing to undergo an audit. He stressed that SESSI is not exempted from audits and therefore ordered an audit of the institution.
Khuhro, the president of the Sindh chapter of PPP, expressed these views while addressing a ceremony to mark the 72nd birth anniversary of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, organised by the People's Labour Bureau at the SESSI headquarters on Thursday. Provincial Labour Minister Shahid Abdul Salam was also present on the occasion.
Nisar Khuhro pointed out that SESSI's medical supplies worth Rs8 billion are not being audited. He questioned the functioning of hospitals under the institution despite the large amount of funds allocated for medicines.
He stressed that an audit of the Rs8 billion allocation is essential to determine the proper utilisation of funds and the functioning of hospital equipment.
The SESSI informed that out of the Rs13 billion funds, 70 per cent were spent on healthcare services, including medicines for hospitals, and 30 per cent on SECCI's directorate.
Khuhro suggested that the Labour Department should focus on ensuring the provision of medicines to workers through SESSI hospitals. He pointed out that out of 670,000 industrial units, only 240,000 are registered with SESSI, whereas the actual number of workers is around six million.
Khuhro said, non-registration of industrial units and their workers is a major weakness of the welfare institution. He suggested that the Labour Department should take steps to register workers, including those working in shops. He pointed out that the minimum wage of Rs37,000 for workers in the private sector is not being implemented. If the minimum wage of Rs37,000 is not being enforced, then how can the implementation of a higher wage of Rs42,000 be expected? Therefore, the Labour Department should ensure the implementation of the Sindh government's minimum wage policy for workers in both public and private sectors.

India left red-faced at SCO ministerial moot,"US
10-nation organisation refuses to toe Delhi's line on terrorism
India suffered a diplomatic humiliation on Thursday at the meeting of Defence Ministers of Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) when member states refused to back New Delhi's stance against Pakistan.
The defence members from 10-nation SCO, including host China, Russia, Iran, India, Pakistan and others came together for a two-day huddle in the Chinese city of Qingdao.
The meeting ended without the issuance of a joint communiqué as India refused to sign the document, citing reservations and claiming the statement to be aligned with Pakistan's stance.
The draft joint statement did not mention the Pahalgam attack, despite India's best efforts, but made reference to terrorist incidents in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan. Except India, all other members endorsed the joint statement.
However, India refused to sign the document, leaving the host country not to issue a joint statement.
Diplomatic sources told The Express Tribune that it was a major diplomatic success for Pakistan and a blow to India, which tried to politicise the SCO meeting and implicate Islamabad.
Although the Indian media tried to spin the narrative and insisted the Indian defence minister stood his ground, former Indian foreign minister and BJP leader Yaswant Singha admitted that it was a total failure of the Modi government.
""India stands completely isolated at the global stage. The SCO communiqué is the latest example where the terror attack at Pahalgam has been ignored and Balochistan has been mentioned. The prime minister has failed completely and must resign,"" wrote Sinha on X, who served as India's foreign minister during Vajpayee's government.
The reason India could not muster support from other countries was its failure to present any shred of evidence against Pakistan following the Pahalgam attack.
Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, when addressed the SCO meeting did not offer anything new. Instead he referred to the past terrorist incidents as evidence of Pakistan's involvement.
Singh reportedly argued that the joint statement ""aligned with Pakistan's narrative"" because it did not include the attack, but mentioned terrorist activities in Balochistan, according to the Indian media.
Singh, without explicitly naming Pakistan, urged the SCO to criticise countries that use ""cross-border terrorism as an instrument of policy and provide shelter to terrorists"". He said members should unite in eliminating terrorism and ensure accountability for those who aid such activities, without mentioning Pakistan.
""Peace and prosperity cannot co-exist with terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of non-state actors and terror groups. Dealing with these challenges requires decisive action,"" said Singh, according to a defence ministry statement.
Taking a jibe at his Indian counterpart, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif told the SCO that Pakistan condemned the terrorist attack in the internationally-recognised disputed and illegally-occupied region of Kashmir. ""We call upon all states to hold these states to account who planned, financed and sponsored terrorist attacks such as Jaffar Express in Balochistan,"" he demanded.
He pledged Islamabad's unwavering commitment to SCO's principles and objectives but highlighted the need for resolving long standing issues.
""The international community should ensure a peaceful resolution of the long-standing unresolved conflicts of Kashmir [as such] unresolved conflicts remain a constant threat to global peace and security,"" he stressed.
The defence minister described terrorism as a common threat which needed to be dealt with collectively.
""All states should refrain from politicising joint efforts against terrorism,"" the minister added.

Credit guarantee for Rs10 billion green funding agreed,"NL
Minister holds meeting to finalise major financial collaboration for green development
National Credit Guarantee Company Limited (NCGCL) has agreed to support green financing up to Rs10 billion in a bid to create a conducive ecosystem for climate-smart entrepreneurship, particularly for young innovators and women-led green startups.
NCGCL, which has recently been awarded 'AAA' rating by Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (Pacra), will provide support for green financing through a structured guarantee programme. The Ministry of Climate Change has expressed its readiness to striking a Rs10 billion green financing deal with NCGCL to boost green entrepreneurship.
Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Musadik Malik held a high-level meeting with NCGCL CEO Ammar Habib to finalise a major financial collaboration aimed at supporting green development across Pakistan.
Under the arrangement, NCGCL will evaluate projects to add a guarantee cover for both convertible bonds and hybrid structures as well as guarantee for credit, loans and to de-risk equity investment through a structured approach, depending on the financial and operational viability of green ventures.
This partnership signals the ministry's commitment to creating a conducive ecosystem for climate-smart entrepreneurship, particularly for young innovators and women-led green startups.
Malik welcomed the collaboration as a meaningful step towards mainstreaming green finance and mobilising private sector partnerships in Pakistan's climate and sustainability goals. NCGCL issues credit guarantees to financial institutions for unserved segments of the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector.
""The SME sector is the backbone of any resilient economy,"" Ammar Habib, CEO of NCGCL, had told media earlier, adding that credit guarantees are a strategic lever, giving financial institutions the confidence to lend where they currently hesitate. He stressed that NCGCL is not just a credit guarantee company, but a market reform institution.
Pakistan has currently witnessed a burgeoning landscape of climate startups and a growing recognition of the need for sustainable solutions. These innovative ventures have emerged across diverse sectors, largely targeting key environmental challenges such as energy transition, resource scarcity and waste management.
Initiatives like Climate Innovation Pakistan and the Green Tech Hub, launched by NUST, are climate tech startups aimed at developing their climate-focused technologies and business models.
Many of these startups are also directly aligning with Pakistan's ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets, which include 50% reduction in projected emissions by 2030, a 60% renewable energy target and 30% electric vehicle uptake.
Companies like EzBike and Vlektra are working on electric mobility revolution, aimed at decarbonising urban transportation. In the renewable energy sphere, startups such as EcoEnergy have focused on providing affordable solar solutions, particularly to off-grid communities through solar installations nationwide.
Pakistani climate startups are also making significant contributions in areas like waste management and sustainable agriculture. Companies such as Trashit and ConceptLoop are innovating in circular economy models, transforming waste into valuable resources or new products.
Meanwhile, agritech startups are leveraging data and AI to enhance crop productivity, optimise water use and promote climate-resilient farming practices, directly addressing food security and water scarcity.
Funds have been a challenge for such startups and recent deals between the Ministry of Climate Change and NCGCL will give a boost to both startups and entrepreneurs in green technology.

Timely completion of city's sewerage projects ordered,"NL
The S-III project is one of the most significant efforts to address city's sewage problems
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has directed the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board to ensure that the TP-I component of the S-III Sewerage Project is fully operational by the end of August and that work on TP-IV is accelerated to complete it within a year. He issued these instructions at a high-level meeting held at the CM House.
The S-III project is one of the most significant efforts to address city's sewage problems, where 400 to 450 million gallons of wastewater is generated daily, much of which is discharged untreated into the Lyari and Malir rivers. The project aims to intercept, treat, and safely dispose of sewage to protect the environment, marine life, and public health.
Key components of the project include transmission packages in the Lyari and Malir basins, upgrading existing treatment plants, and constructing new facilities.
TP-I involves the rehabilitation and expansion of an old treatment plant and is expected to be commissioned by August 2025. TP-IV, meanwhile, is a comprehensive wastewater treatment and recycling system that includes flow and quality monitoring at various sites.
A recent industrial survey revealed that over 3,600 industries in the area require around 42 million gallons of water daily, highlighting the significance of this initiative for integrating efficient sewage management into the city's infrastructure.
The meeting was informed that 67 per cent of TP-I's civil works has been completed, with only electrical work remaining, which depends on the availability of funds. The chief minister also directed the local government minister and mayor to personally monitor progress to ensure the work is completed within the stipulated timeframe.

Pak bags silver in Asian Doubles Squash final,"NL
India's Abhay, Velavan defend title against Noor and Nasir
Pakistan on Thursday secured silver medal at the Asian Doubles Squash Championship after a valiant performance in the men's doubles final, where they went down 2-1 to arch-rivals India who bagged the gold medal after successfully defending the title in Malaysia.
The Pakistani duo of Noor Zaman and Nasir Iqbal fought hard but eventually succumbed to the Indian pair of Abhay Singh and Velavan Senthilkumar, who successfully defended their Asian title with a 9-11, 11-5, 11-5 victory.
The intense final lasted one hour and 27 minutes.
It is pertinent to mention that Zaman and Iqbal had delivered an impressive campaign en route to the final.
In the semifinals on Wednesday, the pair edged past host nation Malaysia in a tightly contested three-game match, winning 10-11, 11-9, 11-9 in a clash that stretched to one hour and eight minutes.
They overcame Malaysia's experienced duo of Syafiq Kamal and Duncan Lee to book their place in the final.
Earlier, Pakistan earned a 2-1 victory over Korea in the quarterfinals. The Iqbal-Zaman pair emerged victorious in another thrilling contest against Jiang Min Ryu and Jaijin Yoo, with game scores of 11-3, 5-11, 11-4.
The Pakistani team also performed strongly in the group stage, where they secured qualification to the knockouts with a comprehensive win over Chinese Taipei.
Nasir and Noor dispatched Chi Yu-Wei and Chen Ching-Fu in straight sets, 11-2, 11-9, in just 11 minutes.
Seeded second in the tournament, Pakistan started their campaign on Monday with dominant wins over the Philippines (11-7, 11-4) and South Korea, showcasing consistent form throughout the championship.
Individually, Noor Zaman had previously competed in the Asian Individual Squash Championship, where he bowed out in the pre-quarterfinals after a hard-fought five-game battle against Malaysia's Joachim Chuah.
Battling a back spasm, Zaman lost the first two games 3-11, 3-11, made a comeback by taking the next two 11-3, 12-10, but eventually fell 2-11 in the decider.

Heavy rain lashes Jaranwala,"NL
WASA MD, DC lead field inspections; major roads cleared
Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) Managing Director Sohail Qadir Cheema, conducted an early morning field visit to oversee emergency drainage operations after a record-breaking 101 mm of rainfall drenched parts of the city on Wednesday.
Cheema visited the relief camp at Mandi Morr on Samundari Road and reviewed the progress of the drainage efforts.
Ghulam Muhammad Abad and Madina Town received the highest rainfall - 101mm each - followed closely by Iqbal Colony (99mm), Dogar Basti (98mm), and Gulistan Colony (97mm).
As rain began early in the morning, WASA operations officers and staff were placed on high alert.
De-watering machines and emergency vehicles were deployed and special measures were implemented to ensure rapid drainage of accumulated water.
Major thoroughfares including Sheikhupura Road, Lasani Pully on Sargodha Road, Station Chowk, Saad Belah, Mandi Morr, Iqbal Stadium, and Abdullah Pur were cleared shortly after the rain subsided.
Speaking on the situation, MD WASA Sohail Qadir Cheema said the response followed direct instructions from Director General WASA Punjab. ""All machinery was functional and staff were deployed at strategic locations to aid citizens,"" he stated, assuring that ""no negligence will be tolerated in public service delivery.""
Cheema added that the drainage operation is being carried out in two phases - the first phase covered main roads and intersections, while the second involves clearing water from side streets using mobile units.
Meanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Captain (retd.) Nadeem Nasser visited several affected areas, including Gulistan Colony, Millat Chowk, and the Gatti Disposal Station in Bhai Wala, to monitor ongoing operations.
He issued directives on-site, urging WASA officials to intensify efforts and ensure relief reaches all areas.
During his inspection, the deputy commissioner emphasised the importance of maintaining an uninterrupted response, particularly in low-lying neighbourhoods.
""All disposal stations must remain fully functional, and coordination between WASA, Waste Management Company, the Municipal Corporation, and other relevant bodies is crucial,"" he stated.

F1' revs up racing history mixed with Hollywood flair,"NL
Lewis Hamilton says Brad Pitt is 'ageing backwards'
The racing scenes in Brad Pitt's new F1 film are impressively authentic but the filmmakers have also made much of how the sport's past is woven into the plot – with a hefty slice of Hollywood artistic licence.
""We just drew from history. A little this, a little that, then we had Lewis Hamilton keep us straight,"" commented Pitt at a New York premiere ahead of this week's general release in cinemas.
Apple's senior vice-president of services Eddy Cue, a lifelong Formula One fan and Ferrari board member, told reporters after a media screening that ""there's not a single event in here... that hasn't happened in a real race.""
That does not mean, of course, that such events could still happen now or that they served as anything more than inspiration.
The Apple Original Films blockbuster – with scenes shot during grand prix weekends – is a redemption story, with Pitt playing ageing driver Sonny Hayes on an unlikely comeback alongside a young hotshot at a struggling team.
Seven-times world champion Hamilton provided advice and is credited as a co-producer on a film scripted for audiences unfamiliar with the sport.
Pitt's age – 61 in real life – has been called out as unrealistic for a driver in the modern era but as Hamilton, 40, said when filming started in 2023: ""Brad looks like he's ageing backwards.""
The oldest current F1 driver is Spaniard Fernando Alonso who will be 44 next month but in the 1950s, when physical demands were less but dangers greater, Philippe Etancelin and Louis Chiron raced at 55. Luigi Fagioli was a winner at 53.
F1 comebacks also tend to follow short absences nowadays, one or two years at most, but it was not ever thus.
Dutch driver Jan Lammers raced from 1979-82 and was out for more than a decade – when he won Le Mans and raced at Daytona – before returning in 1992. Italian Luca Badoer also had 10 years between races before a short-lived comeback in 2009.
Last to first
Drivers have indeed gone from last to first in barely believable circumstances, made winning strategy calls and taken triumphs with unsung teams that would not normally be considered contenders.
The 2011 Canadian Grand Prix lasted more than four hours, featured six safety car deployments and was won by Jenson Button who at one point was at the back of the field and had two collisions including one with McLaren teammate Hamilton. Button made five pitstops, plus a drive-through penalty, and picked up a puncture in a race halted for two hours.
Hayes' backstory is of racing Ayrton Senna before suffering a crash so violent he was flung from the car still attached to his seat.
That is modelled on Northern Ireland's Martin Donnelly who crashed at Jerez in practice for the 1990 Spanish Grand Prix and was left inert in the middle of the track. He survived, miraculously, but there was to be no F1 comeback.
Drivers have escaped blazing crashes, Frenchman Romain Grosjean after his car erupted in a fireball at the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix while Niki Lauda suffered serious burns in a 1976 Nuerburgring crash. The Austrian returned to racing six weeks later.
There are nods to the Crashgate scandal, when Brazilian Nelson Piquet Jr crashed deliberately at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix and triggered a safety car that helped teammate Alonso win.
A female technical director? Not yet, but women have run teams and work as strategists, race engineers and pitlane mechanics – although the film is far from realistic in that regard.
For F1 fans of a certain age there is the 'Easter egg' of a glimpse of the Monza banking in homage to 1966 film Grand Prix. F1 director Joseph Kosinski said that classic, and Steve McQueen's 1971 movie Le Mans, were his touchstones.
""Those movies are now almost 60 years old but you can still watch them and still marvel at the cinematography and the feeling of being there,"" he said. ""The whole practical nature of this film was inspired by those classics"".

Aus hit back after strong WI effort in Test,"DE
The visitors were bowled out for just 180 in their first innings
Australia's pacers struck back with four wickets after they were dealt some of their own medicine in being dismissed for 180 by the West Indies fast bowlers on the opening day of the first Test in Barbados on Wednesday.
Seeking their first Test match victory on home soil against Australia for 22 years, the Caribbean side will resume on the second morning at 57 for four at Kensington Oval.
Mitchell Starc, captain Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood replicated the devastation of West Indian counterparts Jayden Seales and Shamar Joseph to bring Australia right back into the first of a three-match series.
Seales capitalised on the early blows inflicted by Joseph, polishing off the lower order to finish with five for 60, his third five-wicket innings haul in his 19th Test.
Joseph, who enjoyed a sensational debut series at the expense of the Australians, highlighted by a match-winning innings haul of seven for 68 in Brisbane 17 months ago, was again in devastating form against the same opponents, prising out four of the first six wickets to fall over the first two sessions.
He cast aside the ordinary performances of most of the previous year and a half to claim four for 46 from 16 overs of sustained pace where he continuously challenged all batsmen and would have enjoyed greater success but for poor catching by his teammates.
Debutant Brandon King was the chief culprit, missing three chances at gully. But the most expensive lapse was from new captain Roston Chase who, in his 50th Test, dropped Usman Khawaja at first slip when the opener was just on six.
Khawaja and Head in key stand
Khawaja battled to 47 before eventually falling to Joseph, featuring in an important 89-run fourth-wicket stand with Travis Head after the Australians had slumped to 22 for three in the morning following Cummins' decision to bat first on winning the toss.
Head's top score of 59 was highlighted, as usual, by flamboyant drives and pulls, the left-hander counting nine boundaries in his 78-ball innings.
Earlier, Australia's captain had cause to immediately ponder on the wisdom of his decision when Joseph dispatched Sam Konstas and Cameron Green in quick succession with the new ball and should have also accounted for Khawaja, who had another reprieve on 45.
However, the opener's luck eventually ran out when he under-edged a pull at Joseph to be caught behind while Beau Webster was comprehensively bowled by arguably the best ball of the day from the Guyanese pacer.
Seales, who had dispatched Josh Inglis in the morning via a skied catch to wicketkeeper Shai Hope from a miscued pull, claimed a vital second wicket when Alex Carey edged a drive high to Chase at first slip on the stroke of tea.
""This was really special for me,"" said Seales in reflecting on his effort at the end of the day.
""I was injured when last I played a Test against them so to come back here and get five was really satisfying.
""With the new ball we knew we had to bowl a bit fuller. This pitch was also a bit slower than the Australians would have expected and that worked in our favour with them playing at balls they didn't have to.""
Following Head's swift demise at the start of the final session to medium-pacer Justin Greaves, Seales removed Starc, Cummins and Hazlewood without too much fuss, leaving the West Indies top-order batting with a challenging passage of play before the close.
It proved a task beyond four of them, Starc accounting for openers Kraigg Brathwaite and John Campbell before Cummins removed Keacy Carty and Hazlewood dispatched nightwatchman Jomel Warrican, leaving King and Chase to carry the fight into the second day.

K-P launches safe city project in South,"NL
The provincial government had already kick-started the long-delayed Peshawar Safe City Project on an emergency basis
In a major step toward enhancing public safety and combating terrorism, the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Police has officially launched the Safe City Project in the most terrorism-affected southern districts of Dera Ismail Khan, Bannu, and Lakki Marwat.
A formal agreement signing ceremony was held at the Central Police Office between the police and the National Radio and Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC). The contract was signed by DIG Information Technology and Project Director for Safe City, Rai Ejaz Ahmad, on behalf of police, and GM Commercial Syed Amir Javed on behalf of NRTC.
The event was attended by IGP Zulfiqar Hameed, Additional IGP Headquarters Awal Khan, Additional IGP Operations Muhammad Ali Babakhel, Additional IGP Training Dr Muhammad Akhtar Abbas, DIG Headquarters Rizwan Manzoor, DIG Operations Rabnawaz Khan, DIG Finance Fida Hassan, DIG Security Dr Mian Saeed, Traffic Police Chief (retd) Capt Jawad Qamar, CCPO Peshawar Qasim Ali Khan, AIG Establishment Sonia Shamroz, and PSO to IGP Imran Khan.
The provincial government had already kick-started the long-delayed Peshawar Safe City Project on an emergency basis. Following the commencement of work in the provincial capital, surveys were conducted in the southern districts. With survey completion and PC-1 approval, formal implementation in these regions has now begun.
Under the project, over 400 high-resolution cameras will be installed at 86 key locations in DI Khan, more than 300 cameras at 69 locations in Bannu, and over 250 cameras at 41 locations in Lakki Marwat.

Compromised budget,"NL
.
Fragility in the coalition came to the surface as the PPP pushed the PML-N to the wall to drive maximum leverage from an untenable federal budget. The Finance Bill, however, was passed by the parliament after a hue and cry, exposing the inherent partisanship. The Rs17.57 trillion budget was approved after a give and take within the ruling dispensation, as the opposition, PTI, was somewhere lost in the woods.
The compromise arrived as the government gave in to most of the PPP demands — exemption on income tax on annual income of Rs1.2 million; an increase in BISP budget by 20%; reduction in solar tax by 50%; limiting FBR arrest powers to matters pertaining to sales tax forgery, and that too not at the inquiry stage; and treating tax fraud as a bailable offence. These concessions have almost made the revenue generation machinery toothless, and literally subservient to the executive.
The treasury, nonetheless, carried the day as amendments to various legislation, including the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, and amendments to the Sales Tax Act, 1990, were approved. These amendments granted the Finance Committee powers to arrest traders involved in tax fraud exceeding Rs50 million, and not to the tax commissioner.
The budget proposals since inception were in doldrums as the government had projected a utopian growth rate of 4.2%. Likewise, the 'Restrictions on Economic Transactions By Ineligible Persons Lacking Sufficient Financial Resources Bill' hit snags as the proposal to raise new taxes to the tune of Rs432 billion, as recommended by the IMF, were obstructed by the ruling coterie, which in case of non-legislation would have incurred an additional Rs500 billion worth of new taxes.
The budget representing a 6.9% decrease from the previous year's estimates will certainly be in rough waters and a mini-budget seems indispensable.

SCO cooperation in energy sought,"NL
Leghari calls for more cross-border power trade, investment in shared infrastructure
Federal Minister for Energy (Power Division) Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari on Thursday virtually addressed the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Energy Ministers Conference, where he outlined Pakistan's vision for a clean, secure, and collaborative energy future.
Speaking under the theme ""Integrate Innovation for Energy Future,"" Leghari stressed the urgent need for regional cooperation, technological advancement, and policy reforms to confront global energy challenges.
According to an official statement from the Ministry of Energy (Power Division), the minister highlighted Pakistan's ongoing energy sector transformation, underscoring the shift from short-term fixes to long-term structural reforms in the energy sector. He pointed to the establishment of several new institutions — such as the Power Planning & Monitoring Company (PPMC), Energy Infrastructure Development and Management Company (EIDMC), National Grid Company (NGC), and Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO) — as a foundation for improved governance, modernisation of the grid, and promoting transparent market operations.
Leghari reaffirmed Pakistan's clean energy targets, reiterating the government's commitment to reaching 60% renewable energy and 30% electric vehicle penetration by 2030. He outlined initiatives such as the deployment of smart meters, enhancement of operational efficiency through data-driven systems, and the launch of a dedicated Research & Development (R&D) Secretariat to encourage local innovation and technology transfer.
Underscoring Pakistan's geographical position as a regional energy bridge between Central Asia, South Asia, and the Gulf, Leghari called for greater cross-border electricity trade, investment in shared infrastructure, and the creation of joint security frameworks for energy systems. He stressed the importance of completing the CASA-1000 project and urged Afghanistan to fully participate as both a transit and offtake country to support regional energy integration and stability.
To strengthen collaboration under the SCO framework, Leghari proposed five initiatives: the creation of an SCO Secretariat for Energy Innovation and R&D Collaboration, an Energy Innovation Fellowship Programme for young researchers, joint demonstration sites in Pakistan for renewable and smart grid technologies, a web-based Energy Cooperation Dashboard for project tracking, and a Project Prioritisation Committee to focus on high-impact initiatives.
Looking ahead, the minister announced Pakistan's upcoming energy infrastructure investment plan, which will offer international partners bankable opportunities, supported by promising a transparent and investor-friendly environment. He invited international partners to invest in the nationwide rollout of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), estimating a $3 billion need to serve over 30 million consumers.
""Pakistan is not only seeking investment,"" Leghari said, ""we are offering long-term partnerships built on trust, innovation, and mutual benefit. We are ready to work with all SCO member states to turn our shared energy goals into practical solutions that benefit our people and our region.""

Man robbed of Rs3m at his doorstep,"NL
The footage shows passers-by present at the time of the robbery
A man was robbed of Rs3 million in broad daylight, outside his home, in the upscale Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area on Tuesday.
According to police, four unidentified armed men riding two motorcycles snatched the cash from Shahid Hussain near Rehman Mosque in DHA Phase IV, within Gizri Police Station limits. CCTV footage of the incident has surfaced, showing the suspects committing the crime.
Hussain had just returned from a bank in Badr Commercial Area, located in the jurisdiction of Darakhshan Police Station, and was stepping out of his car when the robbers struck. One suspect pulled out a weapon from a bag and forcibly took the cash-filled bag from the vehicle. The suspects even opened the bag on the spot to confirm the amount before fleeing the scene.
The footage shows passers-by present at the time of the robbery, but the suspects managed to escape without resistance. One suspect's face is clearly visible in the footage, while the others wore caps, masks, or helmets, to hide their identities. Police have registered a case on the complaint of the victim and launched an investigation.

Govt denies high interest on EV financing,"NL
Plans Rs100b subsidy for electric two, three-wheelers over five years
Commercial banks are demanding higher interest rates on financing for electric two and three-wheelers but the government has turned down their request.
At present, the interest rate is 11% but they are demanding 5% additional interest to cover insurance and operational expenses. The Steering Committee on the Electric Vehicle Policy has decided to hold a meeting with banks to negotiate the provision of financing at fair rates for electric two and three-wheelers.
The government has announced a Rs9 billion subsidy in the federal budget and plans to give a total subsidy of Rs100 billion for two and three-wheelers over five years.
Experts say bank financing should ideally not exceed Karachi Inter-bank Offered Rate (Kibor) plus 1% or 2%. Fifth meeting of the Steering Committee on the Electric Vehicle Policy was held on Thursday, headed by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan.
The meeting brought together representatives from key federal ministries, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and coordinators from the Prime Minister's Office to review progress on the New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Policy 2025-2030.
It was discussed that two-wheeler prices should not be above Rs200,000 as the government would provide a subsidy of Rs60,000 whereas the remaining amount would be given as bank loan.
Meeting participants said that companies engaged in manufacturing electric two and three-wheelers would be bound to use lithium batteries. Moreover, the option to swap batteries in two-wheelers should not be available to mitigate chances of battery theft.
China has also banned battery swaps and meeting participants suggested that the same should be done in Pakistan. They noted that a single battery charge should provide a range of 60 kilometres for two wheelers and 180 kilometres for three wheelers.
They held detailed discussions on the first phase of the proposed subsidy scheme for electric vehicles. A technical briefing was also given regarding battery performance and specifications, specifically considering Pakistan's unique climatic conditions and their impact on electric vehicle performance.
Speaking on the occasion, Haroon Akhtar Khan said that the Ministry of Industries and Production was engaged in consultations with provincial governments regarding the policy and emphasised that this intergovernmental cooperation would continue to ensure effective and consistent implementation across the country.
He highlighted that the policy's environmental impact would be assessed using international standards to measure reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and to explore opportunities for carbon credits. He reiterated the government's commitment to promoting eco-friendly technologies under the guidance of the prime minister.
According to Haroon Akhtar, the NEV policy is aligned with the vision of steering Pakistan toward a greener, cleaner and more sustainable transportation system. He emphasised that electric vehicles would not only reduce Pakistan's reliance on imported fuel but would also contribute significantly to lowering environmental pollution.
The PM aide concluded by stating that the government was fully committed to developing green transport infrastructure and the new policy aimed to achieve integrated progress in technology, economy and environmental sustainability.

Bilawal explains why PPP supports federal budget,"NL
Cites gains on BISP, tax relief, and FBR curbs
Pakistan People's Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Thursday outlined his party's reasons for supporting the PML-N-led ruling coalition's second budget, saying key amendments were made based on PPP's input.
Addressing the National Assembly ahead of the budget's passage, Bilawal explained why the PPP Parliamentarians – a major coalition partner – had decided to back the finance bill, despite earlier objections.
The PPP's support comes just days after it strongly criticized the federal budget, accusing the government of discriminating against Sindh and threatening to boycott the approval process. A similar standoff occurred last year between the PPP and the PML-N, which the PTI had described as a ""fixed fight"" meant to deflect public scrutiny.
Nevertheless, things remained largely calm between the PPP and the PML-N during this year's budget session.
In his speech, Bilawal noted that the government had increased funding for the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), a welfare scheme introduced by his mother & former premier Benazir Bhutto, by 20 per cent.
The PPP leader criticized the previous PTI government for attempting to undermine BISP in every budget and commended the incumbent Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for consistently increasing its funding since assuming office.
The PPP chairman further noted that the government raised the income threshold for tax exemption from Rs600,000 to Rs1.2 million annually. Additionally, he highlighted that the tax on solar panels was reduced from 18 per cent to 10 per cent following objections raised by PPP members.
Bilawal also welcomed the decision to curtail the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)'s arrest powers. Under the new policy, arrests in tax cases can now only be made in instances of proven fraud and not at the inquiry stage. Moreover, such offences have been declared bailable. ""These are the reasons why the PPP is supporting this budget,"" he said.
Earlier, the PPP chairman chaired a meeting of PPP parliamentary party, attended by all PPP lawmakers. During the session, PPP members briefed Bilawal on their proposals regarding the federal budget. He was also informed about the amendments incorporated into the budget as a result of PPP's input.
Bilawal was given a detailed briefing on the acceptance of the party's demand for a 20% increase in the budget of the BISP program, a party statement said, adding he was also apprised that the tax on solar panels has been slashed by nearly 50% in response to PPP's consistent advocacy.
Bilawal was also informed about how the government withdrew the controversial amendments related to FBR's powers to arrest owing to PPP's strong reservations. On PPP's suggestion, the PPP lawmakers were told that the federal budget now includes a 10% increase in government salaries and a 7% rise in pensions.
Moreover, PPP legislators were briefed that the party secured complete income tax exemption for salaried individuals earning up to Rs100,000 per month. Another key achievement highlighted during the briefing was the restoration of budgetary allocations for universities in Sindh following PPP's demand.

Man booked for killing sister for 'honour',"NL
.
Police on Thursday registered a case against a man and his two accomplices for allegedly killing his sister and injuring brother-in-law over a love marriage in the jurisdiction of Taxila Police Station.
According to the police, Aamir Shehzad stated in his complaint that he works at a cardboard factory in Karachi and is a permanent resident of Attock. He had contracted a court marriage with 24-year-old Iqra Bibi some time ago.
On Wednesday, after recording statements under Section 164 at the Taxila court, he was traveling in a rickshaw with his wife Iqra Bibi, mother Naseem Bibi, and sister Nosheen Bibi to visit a relative's house near Bara Phatak.
During the course of time, three armed motorcyclists — Talal Shah, his employee Abbas, and an unidentified accomplice — forced their rickshaw to stop.
Talal opened fire on Iqra, who was fatally injured and died on the spot. Abbas allegedly shot and injured Aamir Shehzad, while his sister Nosheen Bibi managed to save herself by taking shelter in a nearby shop.

PTI fumes over 'unjust' taxes on ex-FATA,"NL
Demands release of party founder Imran Khan
The PTI on Thursday denounced what it called an ""unjust"" taxation system imposed on the long-neglected former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) without fulfilling the promises of peace, development and complete integration.
In a news conference at the Parliament House, PTI leaders warned that the region could not be treated as a revenue source while its people were denied basic services, security and constitutional rights.
The senior PTI figures also demanded an immediate release of party founder Imran Khan, linking the alleged suppression of judicial independence to his continued detention. They urged the judiciary to assert its autonomy and called for an end to political victimization.
During the news conference, former speaker of the National Assembly and senior PTI leader Asad Qaiser raised critical concerns regarding judicial independence and the ""unjust taxation imposed"" on FATA.
Expressing deep concern over the state of the judiciary, a party statement said, the former NA speaker stated that the judiciary was under undue influence, ""demanding the immediate release of judges and their freedom to perform their duties without interference.""
Qaiser claimed that Imran Khan was being ""unlawfully detained"" and called for his legal rights to be upheld. ""The judiciary must stand firm for its own authority,"" he said while strongly condemning any alleged interference in judicial matters.
Turning to taxation in FATA issue, Qaiser criticized the government for imposing taxes without justification. ""Until peace is restored and a level-playing field is established, no taxes should be imposed,"" he asserted, adding that the people of FATA would willingly pay taxes if the government ensured stability.
He also highlighted ""the unfulfilled promise of Rs1,000 billion for FATA's development,"" vowing that PTI would continue to resist this injustice alongside the people of the region.
Junaid Akbar, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and PTI Khyber Pakhtunkhwa President, also condemned the government's neglect of FATA, recalling that Rs100 billion was supposed to be allocated annually for development after the merger. ""Instead, the people face extortion and unjust taxes while the wealthy have left the region,"" he said, calling the taxation policy cruel and unacceptable.
PTI leader Atif Khan pointed out the direct impact of FATA's instability on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, arguing that the government was unfairly targeting FATA for revenue collection while failing to curb smuggling. He also criticized the exorbitant electricity bills and the new taxes on solar energy, saying the government had completely mismanaged the energy crisis.
MNA Iqbal Khan Afridi highlighted the severe economic struggles of FATA's residents, claiming that petrol was being sold at Rs350 per liter while people struggle to afford basic necessities. He urged the government to engage in dialogue and consider a referendum to address the region's grievances, proposing fair revenue mechanisms instead of blanket taxation on the impoverished population.
The PTI leaders reaffirmed their commitment to justice, judicial independence and the rights of FATA's people, demanding Khan's release, the suspension of unjust taxes, fulfillment of development promises and relief for citizens burdened by rising costs.

Global matcha craze sparks shortages,"DE
Japan's iconic green tea faces high demand and looming tariffs
At a minimalist Los Angeles matcha bar, powdered Japanese tea is prepared with precision, despite a global shortage driven by the bright green drink's social media stardom, reports AFP.
Of the 25 types of matcha on the menu at Kettl Tea, which opened on Hollywood Boulevard this year, all but four were out of stock, the shop's founder Zach Mangan told AFP.
""One of the things we struggle with is telling customers that, unfortunately, we don't have"" what they want, he said.
With its deep grassy aroma, intense colour and pick-me-up effects, the popularity of matcha ""has grown just exponentially over the last decade, but much more so in the last two to three years,"" the 40-year-old explained.
It is now ""a cultural touchpoint in the Western world"" – found everywhere from ice-cream flavour boards to Starbucks.
This has caused matcha's market to nearly double over a year, Mangan said.
""No matter what we try, there's just not more to buy.""
Thousands of miles (kilometres) away in Sayama, northwest of Tokyo, Masahiro Okutomi – the 15th generation to run his family's tea business – is overwhelmed by demand.
""I had to put on our website that we are not accepting any more matcha orders,"" he said.
Producing the powder is an intensive process: the leaves, called ""tencha,"" are shaded for several weeks before harvest, to concentrate the taste and nutrients.
They are then carefully deveined by hand, dried and finely ground in a machine.
'Long-term endeavour'
""It takes years of training"" to make matcha properly, Okutomi said. ""It's a long-term endeavor requiring equipment, labour and investment.""
""I'm glad the world is taking an interest in our matcha... but in the short term, it's almost a threat – we just can't keep up,"" he said.
The matcha boom has been fuelled by online influencers like Andie Ella, who has more than 600,000 subscribers on YouTube and started her own brand of matcha products.
At the pastel-pink pop-up shop she opened in Tokyo's hip Harajuku district, dozens of fans were excitedly waiting to take a photo with the 23-year-old Frenchwoman or buy her cans of strawberry or white chocolate flavoured matcha.
""Matcha is visually very appealing,"" Ella told AFP.
To date, her matcha brand, produced in Japan's rural Mie region, has sold 133,000 cans. Launched in November 2023, it now has eight employees.
""Demand has not stopped growing,"" she said.
In 2024, matcha accounted for over half of the 8,798 tonnes of green tea exported from Japan, according to agriculture ministry data – twice as much as a decade ago.
Tokyo tea shop Jugetsudo, in the touristy former fish market area of Tsukiji, is trying to control its stock levels given the escalating demand.
""We don't strictly impose purchase limits, but we sometimes refuse to sell large quantities to customers suspected of reselling,"" said store manager Shigehito Nishikida.
""In the past two or three years, the craze has intensified: customers now want to make matcha themselves, like they see on social media,"" he added.
Tariff threat
Anita Jordan, a 49-year-old Australian tourist in Japan, said her ""kids are obsessed with matcha.""
""They sent me on a mission to find the best one,"" she laughed.
The global matcha market is estimated to be worth billions of dollars, but it could be hit by US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Japanese products - currently 10 per cent, with a hike to 24 per cent in the cards.
Shortages and tariffs mean ""we do have to raise prices. We don't take it lightly,"" said Mangan at Kettl Tea, though it hasn't dampened demand so far.
""Customers are saying: 'I want matcha before it runs out'.""
At Kettl Tea, matcha can be mixed with milk in a latte or enjoyed straight, hand-whisked with hot water in a ceramic bowl to better appreciate its subtle taste.
It's not a cheap treat: the latter option costs at least $10 per glass, while 20 grams (0.7 ounces) of powder to make the drink at home is priced between $25 and $150.
Japan's government is encouraging tea producers to farm on a larger scale to reduce costs.
But that risks sacrificing quality, and ""in small rural areas, it's almost impossible,"" grower Okutomi said.
The number of tea plantations in Japan has fallen to a quarter of what it was 20 years ago, as farmers age and find it difficult to secure successors, he added.
""Training a new generation takes time... It can't be improvised,"" Okutomi said.

Mindset change behind success: Duckett,"NL
Opening batter smashed a match-winning 149 in the 4th innings against India
Ben Duckett believes a change of mindset has inspired his successful return to Test cricket after a brilliant century laid the foundation for England's remarkable win in their series opener with India. Duckett's commanding 149 was the key innings as England successfully chased an imposing total of 371 to win by five wickets in the first Test at Headingley on Tuesday.
It was another milestone moment for 30-year-old Duckett since returning to the England side in December 2022.
His 30 appearances in his second spell as a Test cricketer have yielded 2,511 runs at an average of 47.37 and a strike rate of 88.07.
Duckett's heroics at Headingley saw him lauded by former England captain Nasser Hussain, who labelled him ""the best multi-format batsman in the world"". Duckett said his success was down to an improved mentality after he had been criticised for getting himself out with needlessly flamboyant shots.
""My mindset personally is a bit different to what it has been over the last couple of years,"" he told reporters.
""Potentially there's a bit of maturity kicking in. Playing more Test matches, learning from mistakes, is number one. ""Failures are easy to make changes and learn from, rather than just when you do well.""
""It was pretty obvious Jasprit was a big threat of theirs,"" he said. ""It was about realising whenever he came on it was going to be a short, sharp burst, trying to see him off and not necessarily playing any big shots.
""It's just realising that and taking the ego out of things. When he's coming on it's to get the breakthrough, get me out, and if you get through that period it gets easier.""

Denis Villeneuve to helm next 'Bond' film,"NL
Director referred to himself as a die-hard fan
Oscar-nominated Denis Villeneuve will direct the next James Bond film, Amazon's MGM Studios said on Wednesday, taking charge of one of Hollywood's most enigmatic spies and longest-running movie series, as per Reuters.
Villeneuve, the Canadian film director and writer, has earned critical acclaim for films such as Sicario, Dune, Dune: Part Two, Blade Runner 2049, and Arrival.
He was nominated for Best Director at the 2017 Oscars for sci-fi film Arrival, which starred Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner, and for Best Adapted Screenplay for Dune, based on author Frank Herbert's highly acclaimed 1965 novel of the same name, at the 2022 Oscars.
""Some of my earliest movie-going memories are connected to 007. I grew up watching James Bond films with my father, ever since Dr No with Sean Connery, said Villeneuve said in a statement.
""I'm a die-hard Bond fan,"" he continued. "" To me, he's sacred territory. I intend to honour the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honour. ""
The upcoming Bond film will be the first under Amazon's MGM Studios, which took creative control of the film franchise under a new joint venture with longtime rights holders Michael Wilson and Barbara Broccoli earlier this year. As previously announced, Amy Pascal and David Heyman will serve as producers for the Bond venture.
However, the franchise is yet to name a new lead actor following Daniel Craig's departure after No Time to Die in 2021, which earned nearly $800 million in global box office collections.
Inspired by Ian Fleming's novels, the Bond franchise has spanned over 60 years, grossing more than $7 billion at the global box office, making it one of the most successful ever.
As per Deadline, the Bond directing gig has been the most closely watched in Hollywood ever since Amazon MGM acquired full creative control of the franchise in February.

'Are you trying to pressure court?',"NL
The acting chief justice objected to the crowd of lawyers at the rostrum
Acting Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar on Thursday objected to the crowd of lawyers gathered at the rostrum during the £190 million case hearing, questioning whether they were trying to pressure the court and reminded them that such behaviour violated courtroom decorum.
A division bench of the IHC comprising acting chief justice and Justice Muhammad Asif heard PTI Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi's appeals for the suspension of sentence in the case.
During the hearing, PTI counsel Barrister Salman Safdar appeared in the court on behalf of the petitioners, accompanied by a large number of lawyers at the rostrum.
The acting chief justice objected to the crowd of lawyers at the rostrum. ""If only one lawyer will argue, why are so many gathered? Are you trying to pressure [the court]? This is not courtroom decorum. The rest should take their seats. If this situation persists, I will not hear this case.""
Special Prosecutor for NAB Javed Arshad requested four weeks' time to prepare, noting that he was appointed only a day ago and the case involved lengthy volumes of records.
Barrister Safdar argued that under Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi's leadership, NAB had already notified its prosecution team, and on June 5 Prosecutor Rafay Maqsood had stated they were not ready to argue.
Barrister Safdar further pointed out that one of the convicted is a woman and, as per practice, women's sentences are often suspended.
He requested the court to grant them an opportunity to start their case, saying it would only ensure transparency.
Arshad responded that he deserved a ""fair opportunity"" to prepare, as he had never been part of the case before. I need time to review the record, he said.
Barrister Safdar noted that the case was finally fixed after a long delay and requested the hearing be scheduled for Monday.
The court accepted NAB's request seeking time to prepare the case and adjourned the hearing, stating that the next date would be announced later.

KCCI slams FBR proposals,"NL
Bilwani condemns Section 37AA as 'draconian', warns of business relocation, nationwide protests
President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), Muhammad Jawed Bilwani, has strongly criticised the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for what he termed its authoritarian conduct and disregard for the Business Anomalies Committee, comprising presidents of chambers and trade bodies from across Pakistan.
Following extensive consultations with its members, KCCI has launched a citywide protest by displaying banners across Karachi against what it calls ""oppressive"" provisions in the Finance Bill 2025-26, particularly the proposed Section 37AA in the Sales Tax Act.
""This is just the beginning,"" Bilwani said in a statement. ""The protest will escalate, with press conferences by KCCI and other major chambers. If our demands are ignored, we may have no choice but to call for citywide or even nationwide strikes.""
He dismissed the finance minister's claims of a ""public-friendly"" and ""business-friendly"" budget as detached from reality. ""Industrialists and exporters unanimously agree — there is no relief."" Bilwani outlined a grim outlook for the business environment, citing high energy costs, poor infrastructure, gas shortages, water scarcity, and delayed tax refunds. ""Our exports survive not because of policy support, but due to the resilience of our business community. Some buyers are even advising us to shift operations to more stable, business-friendly countries.""
Criticising Section 37AA as a ""draconian law,"" he said it allows FBR to freeze bank accounts, seize funds, and arrest taxpayers based solely on suspicion, regardless of their past compliance. ""Who will continue to do business under such hostile conditions?""
He revealed that many businessmen have asked KCCI to help them explore options for relocating abroad. ""We still want to stay and contribute. But we need the government and prime minister to listen and give us confidence.""
Bilwani stressed that this frustration is nationwide. ""Faisalabad, Lahore, Sialkot — all major export hubs — are raising the same concerns.""

"Savouring history: a reflection on food, art and culture","NL
.
Dear Lahore foodies,
Calling Gadrung an eatery would be like referring to Monalisa merely as a painting and the Sistine Chapel ceiling as a fresco to decorate the building. In the first instance, Da Vinci's portrait is not just a representation of a woman but an example of the humanistic ideals of the European Renaissance. It has captivated its audience over the centuries with enduring mystique, technical brilliance and cultural impact. The second artwork, I shall say, illustrates much of the doctrine of the Catholic Church. Several 15th-century artists had already contributed to rationalising this vision in the Vatican City.
Yet, the Chapel's ceiling, painted by Michelangelo based on stories from The Book of Genesis, with 'The Creation of Adam' at its centre, proved to be a thing of beauty and passion. When the chapel opened to the public, people from everywhere rushed to see it and the sight alone was sufficient to leave them amazed and speechless. The scene can be considered the closest visual representation of 'Kun Fayakoon', only if the viewer understands the concept of art as a cultural expression that does not and should not always cater to or challenge religious beliefs.
Visiting Gadrung yesterday was nostalgic. Reconnecting with an old associate from NCA, Shireen Bano, the mastermind behind the project, was refreshing. An academic and a miniature painter by training Shireen celebrates her family's Deccani roots through this cozy, homely dining place where everything is prepared with affection and attention. She cherishes growing up in a Hindustani household, one that is usually celebrated in novels by Qurat-ul Ain Haider or Razia Butt. If you're unfamiliar with these references, a refresher course in Urdu literature might be in order.
Given the time and patience required for a 1000-page novel, I would suggest exploring the 80's PTV spectacle with several dramas set in the typical 20th century Indian, Muslim household. If Urdu is an issue, go for Salt and Saffron by Kamila Shamsie. The novel explores feminist identity in diverse contexts, drawing heavily on the region's cultural history to crystallise a postmodern, postcolonial perspective on the subject. What is more interesting is that Shamsie refers to food as a common interest that can bring people closer.
The sumptuous Hyderabadi cuisine, the ambiance and the chit-chat with Shireen also rekindled an old passion for doing a contemporary cookbook (this one for my darling Mehroze) to match the spirit of Naimatnama-i Nasirudin Shahi — a 15th-century Persian manuscript. The English translation, The Book of Delights, is fondly reviewed as a recipe book that somewhat diminishes the authenticity and robust approach of its patron, the Sultan of Malwa. While a recipe book provides instructions on how to prepare a certain dish, a cookbook is much more than that. A cookbook, at its best, is also a chronicle and treasury of the fine art of cooking, an art whose masterpieces — created only to be consumed — would otherwise be lost.
Naimatnama is known for its detailed recipes, illustrations and insights into the culinary practices and courtly life of the period. If interested, one may learn about socio-political situations, systems of knowledge production and transmission and transculturation to the extent of tracing trade routes. The recipes are detailed and illustrated with notes on the sides. The illustrations are Persian in appeal with a strong indication of an emerging 'Indo-Persian' style of painting that would fully develop in the later century under the Mughal patronage.
The Naimatnama's significance also lies in its role as a precursor to later Mughal culinary texts, including Ain-i-Akbari, Alwan-e-Naimat and Nuskha-i-Shahjahani. However, the earliest surviving specimen I know of is a 2nd-century treatise written by a Greek gourmet in the form of a dialogue between two banqueters who talk for days and relate recipes for dishes such as stuffed vine leaves and a variety of cheesecake. The said book also mentions at least 20 texts that preceded it, Pleasant Living from 350 BC being one.
Long live the Lahori passion of khabas.

Tensions flare as PA clears Rs3.67tr in grants,"NL
The grants were part of the total Rs4,306 billion budget for the fiscal year 2025-26
The Punjab Assembly on Thursday approved 36 out of 41 demands for grants worth Rs3,667.71 billion for various departments, rejecting all cut motions presented by the Opposition.
The cut motions, which sought to reduce budgetary allocations on grounds of alleged mismanagement and poor performance, targeted key departments such as police, education, health, agriculture, and public health. However, the treasury benches dismissed them by majority vote.
The grants were part of the total Rs4,306 billion budget for the fiscal year 2025-26.
A day earlier, on June 25, the Assembly had passed five of the demands amounting to Rs638.29 billion.
The presentation of grants followed the conclusion of a five-day general discussion on the budget, led by Provincial Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman.
Among the grants approved was Rs1,036.96 billion for miscellaneous expenditures, which drew particular criticism from Opposition lawmakers. Sheikh Imtiaz, a member of the Opposition, argued that this amount made up 20% of the total budget and questioned the lack of transparency about the institutions covered under this category. In response, Finance Minister Rehman clarified that this amount included allocations for various authorities, the Pay and Pension Fund (PF), as well as initiatives related to Women Development, Baitul Maal and Zakat and Ushr. The Assembly also approved Rs125.23 billion for general administration and Rs9.54 billion for housing and physical planning, despite similar objections raised by the Opposition regarding lack of clarity and alleged overlaps with other departments. With the Opposition's cut motions exhausted, the remaining grants were presented and passed through voting.
These included allocations of over Rs.462 billion for pensions, more than Rs.910 billion for development projects, Rs200.10 billion for the police department, Rs258.97 billion for health services, Rs137.53 billion for education, Rs26.53 billion for agriculture, and Rs15.16 billion for public health. Several other departments, including those related to justice, jails, museums, and infrastructure, also received substantial funding through approved demands.

Raducanu's suffers Eastbourne exit,"NL
She was stunned by Australian teenager Maya
Emma Raducanu suffered a setback ahead of Wimbledon as the former US Open champion crashed to a shock defeat against Australian teenager Maya Joint in the second round at Eastbourne on Wednesday.
After a difficult year marred by poor form and back problems, Raducanu had hoped for a morale-boosting run at Eastbourne before Wimbledon starts on Monday.
But the British star slumped to a 4-6, 6-1, 7-6 (7/4) loss that leaves her short of match practice leading into the grass-court Grand Slam.
Raducanu missed last week's Berlin Open due to the back problem she has been nursing since before the French Open.
On Tuesday, the 22-year-old held back tears after recovering from a set down to defeat American Ann Li in the Eastbourne first round.
""I'd prefer to not go in to it, if that's OK, but I just received some really bad news so I'm trying to overcome that in the background,"" she said after beating Li.
World number 38 Raducanu is building towards her fourth Wimbledon appearance, where she has twice reached the fourth round since her debut in 2021.
A run to the quarter-finals at Queen's Club two weeks ago was enough to see the 2021 US Open champion regain the British number one position for the first time in two years.
But Joint had knocked out two-time Wimbledon runner-up Ons Jabeur in the first round on Monday and the 19-year-old made Raducanu her second high-profile victim of the week.
""Today was really tough, there were a lot of ups and downs and momentum switches. I was really glad I could tough it out in the end. The atmosphere was amazing,"" the world number 51 said after the second grass-court win of her career.
""I'm an aggressive player, I like to use my backhand and I'm trying to learn to play on all courts.""
Joint, who was ranked 684th at the start of 2024, faces world number 69 Anna Blinkova in the quarter-finals.
Wimbledon champion Barbora Krejcikova saved three match points to reach the quarter-finals with a gutsy 6-4, 4-6, 7-6 (7/3) against Britain's Jodie Burrage.

12-day war,"NL
.
If we take a step backwards and look at the United States' general strategic design over the decades, post-WWII, we find it unconcerned with winning or losing its wars. Rather its purpose has been just to keep starting new wars. If that is correct, no amount of calculation would have stopped the US from attacking Iran.
The US has lost half of the wars it has been involved in, in the Cold War era, like in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Lebanon and Cuba; while most of the wars it was involved in post-Cold War were utter failures, like in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Syria. In the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza, the US does not seem to be winning either. Yet, in the face of unfinished wars, and the colossal destructions they are delivering, the US President comes out and says he is weighing a US attack on Iran.
The US has a long playlist of around 200 interventions, post-WWII, in the name of removing dictators, bringing democracy and countering terrorism. There have been similar playbooks in Iraq, Libya and Syria, wherein leadership was decapitated — with the help of sanctions, economic sabotage, internal revolts and western media propaganda. A playbook that brings all-destruction and no-construction, and the nation ceases to exist as a nation guarded by the state, anymore!
But, as yet, this same playbook has been unsuccessful in Iran, though it has been tried many times. The 2009 Iranian Green Movement, aimed at the removal of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is deemed to be a colour revolution orchestrated by the West. Several dissident Iranians have been allowed to operate political parties in France, Albania and other European states. They are being readied to take the reins of the power in Iran once the Ayatollahs have been compromised. But will Iran face a similar fate?
To the West's chagrin, Iran has learnt from the examples of others. It has successfully undermined colour revolutions against it; disallowed the penetration of foreign-funded militant on its soil; kept dissidents in check; and beaten Western sanction by building indigenous civilian and defence industries and by finding ways to trade with its friends. Iran has rather taken the leap of harbouring its own militias around the Middle East theater, which gives it a regional presence rather than a national one.
So, when the US attacked Iran's nuclear sites with B2-bombers, Iran attacked Israel and a US base in Qatar the very next day. Later Trump announced a ceasefire! Both the Israeli goals of ending Iran's nuclear capabilities and carrying out regime change were abandoned. But what everyone is thinking is, has the war ended or is this just a pause?
Regime change seems to be a daydream, because Ayatollah is not a person, it is an institution that produces, nurtures and educates an assembly of candidates that are potential Ayatollahs. Therefore, removal of one Ayatollah will only bring forth a younger, more energetic Ayatollah.
The people of Iran, who have stood with their leadership in the long decades of sanctions and global isolation, have resolved for themselves that they have to survive this unpredictive West-dominated environment, and believe that they are alone and need to stand united. They have prepared for this war, with long hardships of producing indigenous defence capabilities, including naval ships, fighter jets, missiles and drone. And they have prepared well, by securing their defence and nuclear arsenal in huge tunnels deep down the soil. They have a second tier fighting force in the form of militias that are spread around the country and also beyond borders.
So, when the Americans attack from air, it can bring minimal damage to Iran's underground arsenal hidden in undisclosed locations; if they puts boots on the ground, they will soon be surrounded by revengeful militias; and if they dare attack by sea, they will find the Persian Gulf teeming with small and big Iranian vessels, that will compromise billion-dollar US carriers with their cheaply made missiles.
Moreover, a prolonged war like this would push the US to economic strangulation in an already weak post-2008 recession era. Iran would close the Strait of Hormuz, cutting of global oil trade supply, jamming world economy. And it will attack US bases in the region — in Kuwait, Qatar, the UAE and Saudi Arabia — breaking the façade of the global military prowess of the US.
On one side, the US would be attacking Iran, which is a limited, definite, predictable target; whereas on the other, Iran's retaliation would be unpredictable, wide-ranging and potentially destabilising across the region.
Having all this at the back of our minds, we should also consider that this is a new era, a new time. It is not 2001, when the US entered Afghanistan, stayed for 20 years, with the Fed relentlessly churning out dollars, and the US boastful of its superpower status. Now, 25 years later, states around the world are beginning to circumvent the dollar, regional power centres challenging the US have emerged, Western economies are in decline, and the US has been rendered practically irrelevant in most global matters.
At home, the American public is already feeling the pain of unfruitful trade wars and economic isolation, and the burden of a military state. Trump's entry would add the burdens of high oil prices and inflation.
So, what strategic thinking had led the US to enter the war by attacking Iran? If you look at it from their standpoint, they may be thinking that in Iraq, Syria and Libya they have successfully obliterated national cohesion needed to rebuild the political framework and infrastructure of the state. So maybe just by relentlessly bombing all Iranian cities and razing them to the ground they would throw Iran back into the stone age, and with the leftover broken society they would be able to dictate its will and even take out the oil. And Israel would be safer!
The irony is that the US and Israel think they can only feel safe and powerful when others are destroyed and suffering.
So, if Iran shows restraint, it will be for the sake of peace in the wider region and in Asia. But Israel's falling in line with the ceasefire will be due to its embarrassing defeat and heralding an ill-fate for Netanyahu.

US claims strikes on Iran N-programme a success,"US
Defence secretary accuses media of anti-Trump bias
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth on Thursday said he was unaware of any intelligence suggesting Iran had moved any of its highly enriched uranium to shield it from US strikes on Tehran's nuclear programme over the weekend.
US military bombers carried out strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities early Sunday local time using more than a dozen 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs. The results of the strikes are being closely watched to see how far they may have set back Iran's nuclear programme.
""I'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be, moved or otherwise,"" Hegseth said in an often fiery news conference that was also watched by President Donald Trump.
Trump wrote on his social media platform it would have taken too long to remove anything. ""The cars and small trucks at the site were those of concrete workers trying to cover up the top of the shafts. Nothing was taken out of (the) facility,"" he said, without providing evidence.
Several experts cautioned this week that Iran likely moved a stockpile of near weapons-grade highly enriched uranium out of the deeply buried Fordow site before the strikes, and could be hiding it and other nuclear components in locations unknown to Israel, the US and UN nuclear inspectors.
They noted satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies showing ""unusual activity"" on Thursday and Friday, with a long line of vehicles outside an entrance at Fordow. An Iranian source told Reuters that most of the 60% highly enriched uranium was moved to an undisclosed location before the US attack.
Whereabouts of uranium
The Financial Times, citing European capitals, reported that Iran's highly enriched uranium stockpile remains largely intact since it was not concentrated at Fordow. Hegseth, however, accused the media of downplaying the success of the US strikes.
A leaked preliminary assessment from the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) suggested the US strikes may have only set back Iran by months. At the Pentagon news conference, Hegseth described the strikes as ""historically successful.""
The defence secretary said the assessment was low confidence, and, citing comments from CIA Director John Ratcliffe, said it had been overtaken by intelligence showing Iran's nuclear programme was severely damaged and would take years to rebuild.
Ratcliffe was one of the four top national security officials due to hold a classified briefing on the strikes later on Thursday for the Senate. That briefing had been scheduled for Tuesday, but was postponed. The Senate is expected to vote this week on a resolution that would require approval for strikes against Iran.
Hegseth His comments came after Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday that Iran would respond to any future US attack by striking American military bases in the Middle East. He claimed victory after 12 days of war, and promised Iran would not surrender despite Trump's calls.
Media 'hatred'
During the news conference, Hegseth criticised the media, without evidence, for having an anti-Trump bias. ""It's in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against Trump because you want him not to be successful so bad,"" Hegseth said.

RDA officers fail to satisfy probe panel,"NL
Inquiry flags serious lapses in financial oversight and transparency
Senior officers, including the director-general, of the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) recently failed to satisfy the fact-finding inquiry committee regarding queries involving Rs1.94 billion scandal.
The second session of the fact-finding inquiry committee, constituted by the Punjab Chief Secretary to investigate the transfer of Rs1.94b from the RDA bank account to various individuals and companies concluded in Lahore. The third session is scheduled for July 2.
Director of Administration and Finance, Sohaib Ahmed Qazi, was designated as the official RDA representative before the inquiry panel.
The fact-finding committee, chaired by Mudassir Waheed Malik, Member of the Board of Revenue (Taxes), included Moazzam Supra (Managing Director, Punjab Government Servants Housing Foundation) and Madiha Tahir Shah (Additional Secretary, A&H) as members.
On June 25, RDA DG Kinza Murtaza, Director Admin & Finance Sohaib Ahmed Qazi, Deputy Director Iftikhar Janjua, and Assistant Director Waqar Asghar Raja appeared before the committee.
The committee reviewed banking records and various documents, and asked several questions. However, the officers failed to provide convincing explanations for key concerns.
They were asked why a CDR (Cash Deposit Receipt) system was adopted for bank transactions — allegedly to evade federal income tax, why financial transparency practices were overlooked for over a decade, why departmental audits over the past 10 years failed to uncover these massive fund transfers, and why the DG and Director Finance, being the authorised signatories, didn't regularly check the bank statements.
The RDA officials attempted to shift the blame onto a deceased Deputy Director of Finance, a move the committee notably flagged and questioned further.
In the upcoming third session on July 2, the committee has summoned two retired officials — Asif Mahmood Janjua, former Director Admin & Finance, and Khawaja Arshad Javed, former Assistant Director.
The current RDA representative, Sohaib Ahmed Qazi, was directed to present detailed records of the disputed bank transactions and relevant financial data.
It is noteworthy that parallel investigations into this financial scandal are also underway by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE).
The premier accountability watchdog has begun summoning both current and former RDA officials, as well as private individuals and account holders who received funds from the RDA account.
On the other hand, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has begun summoning both serving and retired officers of the RDA in connection with the alleged embezzlement in government funds.
All former directors of administration and finance who served over the past decade are being called in phases, with summons already issued.

Elderly man tortured over financial dispute,"NL
Suspects arrested after video surfaces on social media
A 70-year-old man was brutally assaulted by his neighbours, leaving him unconscious, in the Qaimpur area, reportedly over a financial dispute.
According to residents, the victim, Hafeez Sajid, of the Fordwah area in Bahawalpur, has a son, Waqar, working in Malaysia with one of his neighbours, Shahroz Arshad. A financial dispute arose between the two, leading Shahroz to return to Pakistan. After his return, Shahroz's brothers reportedly began threatening Waqar's father, Hafeez Sajid.
A few days ago, Asif, Shahroz, and Adeel abducted the elderly man in broad daylight and took him to their outhouse, where they subjected him to torture while filming his ordeal.
During the assault, they took Hafeez Sajid's mobile phone and made a video call to his son in Malaysia, showing him his father being tortured. The son was seen pleading and begging them to release his father.
The torture caused the elderly man to fall unconscious. After some residents intervened and pleaded with the attackers, the accused released Hafeez Sajid, but not before threatening him further.
Following the circulation of the video on social media, SHO Ayub Gujar of Qaimpur Police Station registered a case against the suspects, and they were arrested as legal proceedings got under way.

"DEO fires, reinstates teachers, sparks uproar","NL
The dismissal was made official through a formal notification issued by the DEO's office
In a major administrative move, the District Education Officer (DEO) for male staff in North Waziristan — part of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa's merged districts — has terminated 56 primary school teachers for prolonged absenteeism.
The dismissal was made official through a formal notification issued by the DEO's office. Later, however, all of them were reinstated, sparking another controversy.
According to Additional Director Iqbal Khan, the DEO has no legal authority to reinstate the dismissed teachers. ""If the officer withdraws the termination orders and reappoints the teachers, such a move would be deemed illegal,"" he clarified.
The incident unfolds in a region already struggling with access to quality education. In addition to the mass termination, the DEO has also halted two annual increments for 38 teachers and withheld one annual increment for another 53.

NA passes Finance Bill with Rs463b new taxes,"PK
House okays Rs17.6tr budget with PPPP support; All amendments moved by opposition rejected
The National Assembly on Thursday approved the Rs17.6 trillion worth budget along with Rs463 billion new taxes, bringing the digital economy under the purview of tax laws but almost nullified the single largest enforcement measure to ban economic transactions by ineligible persons.
The National Assembly approved the second budget of the government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif with a comfortable majority. During a voting on one clause, the coalition government mustered the support of 201 Members of the National Assembly as against 57 votes of the opposition parties.
It was also the second budget presented by Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb in the National Assembly. With the approval of the assembly and subsequent assent by President Asif Ali Zardari, the Finance Act 2025 will come into effect from Tuesday.
The National Assembly approved a Rs17.6 trillion budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, making the single largest allocation of Rs8.2 trillion for the interest payments.
The defense spending would consume Rs2.55 trillion, the single largest expense in the budget, excluding expenses on the armed forces development programme and military pensions.
The subsidies are the third biggest head with over Rs1.1 trillion allocation, followed by over Rs1 trillion for pensions, Rs1 trillion for development spending and another Rs917 billion for running the civil government.
The National Assembly also approved to effectively exempt the income of Beaconhouse National University, Federal Ziauddin University, Punjab Police Welfare Organization and Army Officers Benevolent Fund and Bereaved Family Scheme from the tax.
Tax on the contracts of the National Logistic Cell (NLC) has been set at a minimum of 3% of the gross value of the contracts. But if the total liability is more than the collected tax, the NLC will be charged at the normal income tax rate of 29%, according to the bill approved by the National Assembly.
Arrest powers for the Federal Board of Revenue will stay in the law but with inclusion of some more safeguards, as stated by both Pakistan People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar.
This is the best budget that any government can give in challenging circumstances, said the chairman FBR while talking to The Express Tribune. He said some fundamental principles have been set in the budget, including creating deterrence against frauds and giving a framework for registration of taxpayers for the sales tax purposes.
To discourage use of cash, the chairman FBR said that the National Assembly has approved not to give expenses' allowance in case the value of the cash payment is over Rs200,000. Likewise, the input tax adjustment has also been disallowed on cash payments of supplies beyond a certain threshold, he added.
Langrial said that the foreign vendors and the digital marketplaces have also been brought under the ambit of the tax laws.
The National Assembly approved Rs463 billion worth of new tax measures, including Rs36 billion that were introduced after the presentation of the budget in the National Assembly on June 12th. The biggest measures in the budget were imposing taxes, both on sales and income, on the online platforms, e-commerce, cash-on-delivery by couriers, and tax on digital services like streaming.
A new climate support levy Rs2.5 per liter levy is imposed on every liter of petrol and diesel. Another new tax of 1% to 3% has been imposed on conventional fuel-based cars to subsidize electric vehicles. The pensioners have been brought in the tax net, but only annual pensions of above Rs10 million are taxed at the rate of 5%. The fourth new tax is Rs10 federal excise duty on every one-day-old chick sold in the country.
The government had claimed collecting Rs389 billion in the next fiscal year on the back of the single largest enforcement measure of banning the economic transactions by the ineligible persons. The Finance Minister had warned in his post-budget press conference that if the Parliament did not pass this law then up to Rs500 billion mini-budget would have to be introduced.
The government on the ""instructions"" by the Prime Minister has tamed down these stringent powers.
The National Assembly approved that the ban on buying a residential plot or houses by an ineligible person will apply only if the value of the property is over Rs50 million. This limit is over Rs100 million for commercial plots or properties. The ineligible persons can still buy up to Rs7 million cars.
The chairman FBR Rashid Langrial said that in the first step, the government has established the principle of ineligible and the limits can be revised in the future.
Early this year, the FBR chairman had informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that due to almost no capacity of the FBR to audit the tax statements, the rate of success in inquiring the people about the source after making these purchases was only 3.7%.
The ineligibility condition will apply only if the value of cash withdrawal from the bank account is more than Rs100 million per annum. The ineligibility condition on stock market investment would be applicable, if the cumulative investment in a year is more than Rs50 million.
However, the ineligible persons cannot maintain saving accounts in the banks.
The finance minister also announced to exempt a residential property owner from payment of up to 6.5% withholding tax at the time of sale, if the property is sold after retaining it for at least 15 years.
The National Assembly also approved to increase the income tax rate on the income derived from the debt portion of mutual funds issued to companies from 25% to 29%. It also approved to increase the income tax rate on profit earned from giving loans to the government from 15% to 20%.
The National Assembly slapped a Federal Excise Duty (FED) of Rs10 per day-old chick. The government has estimated that about 1.5 billion chicks are produced every year and it will collect Rs15 billion by taxing a product that is a common diet of the poor and the rich.
The National Assembly approved 10% sales tax on the import of solar panels.
Tax Fraud arrest powers
The National Assembly approved to give the arrest powers to the FBR in the sales tax fraud cases after multiple rounds of negotiations between the PPP and the PML-N.
According to the law passed by the National Assembly, a person cannot be arrested at the inquiry stage of the sales tax fraud. In case of arrest, the accused will have the right to get bail from the court. These two new safeguards were added after the latest round of negotiations between the PPP and the PML-N on Wednesday.
Chairperson of the Pakistan Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said on Thursday that his party was wholeheartedly supporting the federal budget after the government accepted its demands to exempt income tax on salaried individuals earning Rs100,000 and reduce sales tax on solar panels.
However, contrary to Bilawal's claim, the government has not exempted the Rs1.2 million salaried incomes from the tax. The rate of income tax on up to Rs1.2 million annual incomes will be 1%, compared to 5% before the budget, according to the bill approved by the National Assembly.
The income tax on annual income of Rs1.2 million has been exempted on the PPP demand, said Bilawal Bhutto while speaking at the floor of the house.
Bilawal further said that the government also agreed to the PPP's reservations about giving arrest powers to the FBR. The government agreed that the arrest powers will only be limited to sales tax forgery and at the inquiry stage no arrest will be made, said Bilawal.
The tax fraud will also be a bailable offense, said the PPP chairperson while announcing his party's agreement with the government on the arrest powers.
The Express Tribune reported on Thursday that the PPP had refused to vote on the bill due to a proposal to give arrest powers to the FBR. However, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar convinced PPP to withdraw the objections.
Dar also told The Express Tribune that new safeguards have been added in the Finance Act to address the PPP's concerns.
The PPP chairman said that the government also increased the BISP budget by 20% on the demand of the PPP. The government has allocated Rs716 billion for the BISP for the next fiscal year.

Countries agree on 10% UN climate budget rise,"US
The deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries
Countries agreed on Thursday to increase the UN climate body's budget by 10% for the next two years, a move the body welcomed as a commitment by governments to work together to address on climate change, with China's contribution rising.
The deal, agreed by nearly 200 countries - from Japan to Saudi Arabia, to small island nations like Fiji - at UN climate negotiations in Bonn, comes despite major funding cuts at other UN agencies, triggered in part by the US slashing its contributions, and political pushback on ambitious climate policies in European countries.
Countries agreed to a core budget of 81.5 million euros for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) over 2026-2027, up 10% from 2024-2025.
The core budget is funded by government contributions. The deal includes an increase in China's contribution, reflecting the country's economic growth. China, the world's second-biggest economy, would cover 20% of the new budget, up from 15% previously.

Govt plans new housing scheme,"NL
Experts urge tax cut to catalyse affordability; say scheme will fail without coordination
With Pakistan's mortgage-to-GDP ratio abysmally low — below 1% — owing to the absence of a proper mortgage system, the federal government intends to launch a new subsidised housing finance scheme in the upcoming fiscal year. The initiative aims to spur demand in the real estate and construction sectors while making homeownership more accessible to middle- and lower-income groups. However, the scheme, loosely modelled after the earlier Mera Pakistan Mera Ghar programme, may face significant challenges, including a lack of clarity on eligibility and structure, persistently high land and construction costs, and limited affordability among target beneficiaries.
Despite a Rs5 billion subsidy proposed in the 2025-26 federal budget, concerns remain over banks' willingness to lend aggressively, given Pakistan's mortgage-to-GDP ratio is still languishing below 1%. Experts caution that unless the scheme is backed by strong institutional coordination, tax reforms, and public awareness, it may fall short of its objectives — much like the previous attempt, where only Rs235 billion was approved out of Rs514 billion in financing requests.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) will oversee the rollout of the new scheme. While the proposed housing finance will subsidise a portion of the markup rate to make it affordable for beneficiaries, the eligibility criteria, categories, name, and structure may differ from the previous initiative.
Ibrahim Amin, a real estate valuation and engineering expert, noted that the government is considering the launch of the housing finance scheme due to favourable conditions following a gradual reduction in the policy rate, which may decline further in the coming months if macroeconomic indicators improve.
""The housing finance scheme will help revitalise economic activities in real estate, construction, and allied sectors, attracting local and foreign investments from residents and overseas Pakistanis while generating jobs across the entire ecosystem,"" said Amin, who is also the CEO of TriStar International, a real estate valuation company.
He added that the scheme could improve sales of hundreds of unsold or undersold housing units in private residential societies across major cities, which have struggled due to rising inflation and declining purchasing power among target buyers.
The government has also announced tax relief on property transactions, which may further stimulate the market in the coming months, Amin noted.
The previous subsidised housing finance scheme, introduced in 2019 by the central bank, was discontinued by mid-2022 due to high interest rates. Despite overwhelming public responsewith participating banks receiving financing requests worth Rs514 billiononly Rs235 billion was approved across thousands of applications.
""The banking regulator, alongside commercial banks, played a crucial role in facilitating the public through awareness campaigns, dedicated facilitation desks, and revised scheme conditions,"" Amin said. ""The initiative also boosted economic activity in real estate and construction while providing long-term consumer financing opportunities for banks.""
He emphasised that Pakistan's banking system now has a well-tested and researched framework for housing finance, with stakeholders fully prepared to execute their roles. ""It is high time for the government to announce the policy to benefit the masses,"" he remarked.
Pakistan currently faces an estimated shortage of 1.2 million housing units relative to its population, while its mortgage-to-GDP ratio remains below 1%the lowest in the region.
""Reviving affordable housing finance could play a crucial role in addressing both housing needs and broader economic recovery,"" said Karachi-based realtor Maaz Liaquat.
He pointed out that high land and construction costs have dampened bookings for small and mid-sized apartments in major cities in recent years. The new subsidised financing scheme could support builders and developers of ready and under-construction vertical housing projects, attracting overseas Pakistanis and middle-income buyers.
Liaquat suggested that the government collaborate with district authorities to streamline real estate regulations while reducing the tax burden on scheme beneficiaries to make homeownership more affordable for first-time buyers.

CB refuses to adjourn reserved seats case till Aug,"NL
PTI's Salman Akram Raja concludes arguments in support of SC's July 12 ruling
A constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Thursday turned down the request of one of the PTI counsels to defer hearing of the reserved seats case till August, noting that the bench intended to hear the case on a daily basis.
Earlier, Salman Akram Raja, resumed his arguments in support of the July 12, 2024 majority order of a full SC bench. He referred to the SC judgment in the Sindh High Court Bar case, which, he said, serves as an example of how the SC can intervene for the restoration of the Constitution.
""After the emergency imposed on November 3, 2007 several actions were taken, but the Supreme Court declared that emergency unconstitutional, and all actions taken in its aftermath were also annulled.""
""The court had ruled that the judges appointed after the emergency held no legitimate status, and their removal of sitting judges was also declared unlawful; the removed judges were reinstated.""
During the hearing, Raja also referred to the allocation of reserved seats in the general elections of 2013, 2018, and 2024. He stated that the record shows that in previous elections, the political party that won general seats received reserved seats in roughly the same proportion.
""However, the situation is different in the recent general elections. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a party [PTI] that secured 83% of the general seats was allotted zero reserved seats,"" he said.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail asked Raja as to how can the Supreme Court stop any politician from contesting elections independently.
""Suppose Imran Khan, Nawaz Sharif, Asif Zardari, Bilawal Bhutto, or Maulana Fazlur Rehmanbeing major party leadersdecide to contest independently, how can we prevent them?"" he asked.
Justice Musarrat Hilali stated that losing an election symbol does not mean the political party's registration is canceled. PTI candidates joined the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), but that the SIC was not present in parliament, she said.
Justice Mandokhail noted that Raja cited the Sindh High Court Bar Association case, but in that case, the facts were undisputed.
Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi commented that in the 1985 non-party based elections, a political party called itself the 'Awam Dost' party. ""Did you introduce any such term [for the PTI for the polls]"" The lawyer responded that the PTI introduced the term ""Kaptaan ka Sipahi"".
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar observed that there seemed to be a lack of coordination within the PTI. Justice Mandokhail added that it appeared that the 39 members of the assembly who openly declared their affiliation with the PTI were more sensible."" ""Either they were more sensibleor they had a higher tolerance for pressure,"" commended Justice Hilali.
Recalling the past political events, SIC's counsel Hamid Khan said the decision in the PTI intra-party election case was announced on the very last day for the allotment of election symbols.
""It was a Saturdaya holidaybut the case was heard until 11pm that night. Our candidates kept waiting, wondering what the verdict would be. At midnight, our election symbol was taken away from us, and the deadline for symbol allotment passed. After that, where did we stand?
He said the ECP gave more time to the ANP despite the fact that the ANP had not even held any elections ""We had conducted elections but the ECP did not accept them. We urged it to fine us, if needed, but it stripped us of our election symbol. On the same day, the ANP and the PTI were treated differently,"" he said.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar responded that the ANP was being given an opportunity for the first time while the PTI had already been given several years. ""Your party constitution was made more foolproofwe can even say it's better than others,"" he noted
Hamid Khan remarked that it seemed the PTI was punished for drafting a better constitution. The CB also dismissed Hamid Khan's request to defer the case till August. The court will resume hearing at 9: 30am today.
On January 13, 2024, a three-member SC bench upheld the Election Commission of Pakistan's (ECP) December 22, 2023 order declaring the PTI's intra-party polls null and void.
As a consequence of the SC verdict and its misinterpretation by the ECP, the PTI candidates had to contest the February 8, 2024 general elections as independents.
Eighty such independent candidates reached the National Assembly and later joined the SIC in an apparent bid to claim reserved seats for women and minorities. The ECP, however, refused to allocate the seats to the party, a decision that the SIC challenged in the Supreme Court.

SC calls for review of Nikahnama form,"NL
Court seeks stronger safeguards to uphold women's marriage rights
The Supreme Court has asked the federal government as well as the provincial governments to review the 'Nakahnama form' in order to make it user-friendly, effectively safeguarding the rights of the parties, particularly the women.
A three-member bench of the apex court, led by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, noted that without reviewing the Nikahnama form as a whole, the positive step taken by the Punjab government might not achieve the intended goal of protecting the rights of women.
The Nikahnama form has been prescribed in the Ordinance of 1961 and notified as part of the schedule of the Rules of 1961. However, the federal government is empowered to make rules in respect of the cantonment areas and the provincial governments in their respective areas of jurisdiction.
According to a 22-page judgment, authored by Justice Athar Minallah in a family dispute case, the expressions used in the current Nikahnama form were ambiguous and, therefore, open to be misconstrued.
The judgment said that the federal and the provincial governments might consider reviewing the Nikahnama form ""to make it more user-friendly"", so that ""even a literate person of ordinary prudence does not have difficulty in understanding its requirements"" and the columns.
The judgment stressed the need for removing the ""ambiguities likely to arise from the vague and ambiguous expressions used in the headings of the columns in the form currently prescribed"" under the Ordinance of 1961, read with the Rules of 1961.
""This would not only protect the rights of the parties in general and the women in particular but would also reduce litigation since a more user-friendly prescribed form of the Nikahnama will give rise to lesser disputes,"" the judgment said.
The court noted that Nikah might also be solemnised by a person other than a Nikah registrar. However, it stated that the integrity, competence, knowledge and understanding of the Nikah registrars were crucial for effectively safeguarding the rights of the parties, particularly the women.
In the province of Punjab, the judgment continued, the Act of 2015 imposed a statutory upon the Nikah registrar to accurately fill all the columns of the Nikahnama with specific answers of the bride and the groom.
The court said that a breach of this statutory duty exposed a Nikah registrar to penal consequences ie imprisonment for up to one month and a Rs25,000 fine. It added the purpose was to protect women from exploitation and provide them with expeditious resolution of family disputes and ancillary matters.
""The legislature [Punjab Assembly] was, therefore, conscious of the challenges faced by women in the context of exercising their rights relating to settling the terms and conditions of marriage,"" Justice Minallah wrote.
""The Act of 2015, through which sub-sections (2A) and (4)(i) were inserted in Section 5 of the Ordinance of 1961, was definitely appreciable in securing the rights of the parties, particularly the women, keeping in view the social and cultural norms prevalent in many parts of the country,"" he said.
The court also said that it was indeed a step in the right direction in order to reduce the number of disputes and consequently the volume of litigation as well.
""However, we are of the opinion that without reviewing the prescribed form of the Nikahnama as a whole, particularly the expressions used in the headings of the columns, this positive step taken in the province of Punjab may not achieve its intended goal of protecting the rights of women in particular.""
The Nikah registrars, the judgment stated, had the most important role in ensuring that each party exercised her or his rights and that the entries recorded in a Nikahnama correctly reflected their intention.
""It is a statutory duty of each Government to guide the Union Councils in setting out adequate qualifications and criteria for the granting of licences to persons for performing the functions of Nikah registrars,"" it stated.
""Moreover, training and evaluation of performance of those who have been licensed would further guarantee that the social or cultural norms and influences do not prevail over the absolute rights bestowed upon women under the law,"" it added.
""The Governments may also consider taking steps to ensure that persons of integrity and those who possess the required qualification and knowledge are granted licences and regular audits of the record relating to Nikahnamas maintained by the Union Councils are conducted.""
The court directed the Registrar Office to send copies of this judgment to the cabinet secretary, government of Pakistan, and the chief secretaries of the respective provinces so that they might place it before the competent authorities and forums for considering the observations.
The court expected that effective steps would be taken to ensure safeguarding the rights of the parties to a marriage contract, particularly the bride, who might be more vulnerable on account of multiple factors, including the cultural and social norms and beliefs.

Disney's 'Hercules' opens in London West End theatre,"NL
Stage musical differs from source film in several ways
Disney takes London audiences back to Ancient Greece with its new musical Hercules, bringing alive its 1997 animation on the West End stage, reports Reuters.
Showing at composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's Theatre Royal Drury Lane, the show is inspired by the much-loved Disney film, itself based on the ancient myth.
It follows the titular character and son of Zeus who, upon losing his immortality as a baby due to the plotting Hades, god of the underworld, goes from zero to hero to stop his uncle from taking over.
""It's a myth that reflects contemporary culture and still honours the DNA of (the) animated movie,"" Robert Horn, who wrote the show's book with Kwame Kwei-Armah, told Reuters late on Tuesday at the musical's press night.
""It's its own new thing and yet fans of the movie will absolutely come and recognise it and love it.""
Central to the show are the five Muses, who sing their way through the story with energetic gospel-like tunes and plenty of costume changes.
""I think I speak for all of us ... we have idolised these women. We have looked at these women and seen ourselves in times when we weren't really represented,"" actor Malinda Parris, who plays Calliope, said. ""So being able to be that representation for other young girls ... who ... want to be The Muses ... it's living the dream.""
The show differs from the film in several ways, including Hercules' mentor, Phil, no longer being a satyr but a taverna owner.
""The main thing is that he still is there ... to love and support Hercules on his journey,"" actor Trevor Dion Nicholas said.
""It really is about building this bond between the two of them that kind of builds this paternal relationship that I think we were able to deepen more so than the animated film was.""
Hercules is the latest Disney stage adaptation in London, showing in the same theatre where the hit show Frozen ran up until last year.
It features songs written by Oscar-winning composer Alan Menken and lyricist David Zippel from the animation, including Go the Distance and Zero to Hero, as well as new tunes.
As per UK daily The Independent, while the film wasn't an immediate box office smash Hercules has garnered a cult following over the years. The musical, which began life as a workshop in Central Park in 2019, was previously performed in German in Hamburg.
Hercules will play at Theatre Royal Drury Lane from June 24 until March 28, 2026.

K-P CM warns Centre of tit-for-tat response,"US
Gandapur, Javed Hashmi denied meeting with Imran
Rawalpindi Central Jail authorities on Thursday once again refused to allow key PTI leaders including Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and veteran politician Makhdoom Javed Hashmi to meet PTI founder Imran Khan, who is detained at the prison facility.
Talking to the media later, Gandapur expressed his anger at the ""unjustified restrictions"" imposed on the executive head of a province and vowed to pay the PML-N led federal government in the same coin. Hashmi, who also remained a part of the PTI from 2012 to 2014, also condemned the move.
The K-P chief minister stated that they had to meet the former prime minister in order to brief him on the K-P budget but the authorities did not allow this to happen. ""The K-P budget approval process has not yet been completed and the budget session is ongoing,"" he added.
Cracks in the former ruling party became more pronounced after the K-P Assembly on Tuesday approved the provincial budget. Some PTI leaders expressed amazement at the provincial government's ""haste"" with Imran's sisters claiming that the PTI founder was not consulted ahead of the approval.
Gandapur said he could respond to refusal by authorities to let them meet their incarcerated leader by imposing restrictions on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during his visit to the K-P. The PTI has been in power in the K-P since 2013.
He said Imran, the PTI patron-in-chief, was to give his input before the budget was passed but he, the K-P chief minister, was prevented from meeting him. He said law or the Constitution are being violated; institutions are not functioning and even the judiciary is not independent.
""We were told by jail authorities that we could not meet Imran as a precautionary measure, as if we are terrorists. A meeting with the party founder will eventually happen, but the current method is wrong,"" he said.
He said the party has filed a civil miscellaneous application (CMA) in the Supreme Court as well and asked as to what action has been taken on the letters that Imran Khan wrote to the chief justice of Pakistan,
Gandapur also asked Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz as to how much authority does the Punjab Home Department actually have in allowing and disallowing a meeting between Imran Khan and his party leaders. He said as a chief minister, it is his right to visit any jail and meet with any prisoner.
Makhdoom Javed Hashmi also spoke on the occasion, stating that no one could implement ""the minus-Imran formula"". He said he had come to Adiala Jail to express solidarity with the PTI founder.
Hashmi said he had distanced himself from Imran when he had got closer to the establishment. ""Imran does not want freedom, he only demands rule of law,"" he added.

"ANP slams budget, 18th amendment assault","NL
Iftikhar vows resistance to curbs on provincial autonomy
Awami National Party (ANP) Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa President Mian Iftikhar Hussain has strongly condemned what he described as an attack on the 18th Constitutional Amendment, national rights, and provincial autonomy.
He said the recently presented federal budget has deliberately ignored K-P — particularly the merged tribal districts — which amounts to a grave injustice on constitutional, political, and state levels.
He made these remarks while presiding over a high-level meeting at Bacha Khan Markaz. The session was attended by provincial general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai, other senior party officials, legal advisors, and presidents and secretaries from the merged districts. The meeting thoroughly reviewed the current political and financial situation.
Participants expressed deep concern that the promises made to the merged districts were neither included in the federal budget nor mentioned in the provincial budget. Mian Iftikhar said this reflects a deliberate policy by the state to sideline and disappoint these regions.
He emphasized that if the merged districts are granted their constitutional, political, and financial rights, not only will these areas strengthen, but the entire province will benefit. Unfortunately, he said, the state continues to act in the opposite direction.

Israel halts aid into Gaza,"US
The Israeli prime minister's office and the defense ministry did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment
Israel has stopped aid from entering northern Gaza but is still allowing it to enter from the south, two officials said on Thursday after images circulated of masked men on aid trucks who clan leaders said were protecting aid, not Hamas stealing it.
A video circulating on Wednesday showed dozens of masked men, some armed with rifles but most carrying sticks, riding on aid trucks.
The US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which operates aid distribution sites in southern and central Gaza, said on X that it was the only humanitarian organization permitted on Thursday to distribute food in Gaza.
A spokesperson said the foundation was exempt from a two-day suspension of humanitarian aid deliveries into the territory.
The Israeli prime minister's office and the defense ministry did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
The Higher Commission for Tribal Affairs, which represents influential clans in Gaza, said that trucks had been protected as part of an aid security process managed ""solely through tribal efforts"".
The commission said that no Palestinian faction, a reference to Hamas, had taken part in the process. Hamas denied any involvement. Throughout the war, numerous clans, civil society groups and factions have stepped in to help provide security for the aid convoys.
Clans made up of extended families connected through blood and marriage have long been a fundamental part of Gazan society.
Amjad al-Shawa, director of an umbrella body for Palestinian non-governmental organisations, said the aid protected by clans on Wednesday was being distributed to vulnerable families. There is an acute shortage of food and other basic supplies after the nearly two-year military campaign by Israel that has displaced most of Gaza's two million inhabitants.
""The clans came ... to form a stance to prevent the aggressors and the thieves from stealing the food that belongs to our people,"" Abu Salman Al Moghani, a representative of Gazan clans, said.

Pak presence in FIH League in limbo,"US
USD 2.5m needed to ensure Green shirts' participation in Pro League
Pakistan's participation in the upcoming FIH Pro Hockey League hangs in the balance as the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) has yet to provide a clear commitment on funding to the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF). A crucial meeting between PSB Director General Yasir Pirzada and PHF Secretary General Olympian Rana Mujahid ended without a breakthrough.
Speaking to the media, Rana Mujahid said that the costs of participating in the Pro League are significantly high and appealed to Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Army Chief General Asim Munir for urgent assistance. He noted that while India receives an annual grant of 3 billion rupees for hockey, Pakistan's funding situation remains dismal.
""The expenses of the Pro League are enormous. We hope the Prime Minister will come to our aid. We have also appealed to Field Marshal Asim Munir,"" Mujahid stated.
He added that Pakistan's performance in the FIH Nations Hockey Cup was satisfactory, and that the federation is committed to following government and PSB guidelines. He also confirmed that senior team head coach Tahir Zaman will soon present his training and competition plan.
Mujahid warned that if Pakistan commits to the Pro League but fails to participate, it could face sanctions from the International Hockey Federation (FIH). ""We have reached out to the FIH President and requested more time to resolve the situation,"" he said.
Meanwhile, DG PSB Yasir Pirzada said that approximately USD 2.5 million is needed for Pakistan's participation in the Pro League. ""We have asked PHF to submit a working paper. The financial requirement is substantialthis is not cricket, where funds flow easily. We will present the matter to the government and the Prime Minister,"" Pirzada explained.
He also mentioned that the usage charges of Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium were increased to meet maintenance costs but promised to review club-level fees. ""Hockey is our national sport and should be given priority,"" he affirmed.
The fate of Pakistan's appearance in the prestigious international league now rests on swift government intervention and timely financial support.
Yasir Pirzada unveils roadmap for sports development
Director General of the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), Yasir Pirzada, has unveiled an ambitious roadmap focused on infrastructure development, athlete training, and long-term sports promotionunderscoring Pakistan's determination to reclaim its sporting stature on the regional stage.
With Pakistan set to host the South Asian Games in January 2026, the PSB has entered a decisive phase in its efforts to uplift sports nationwide.
Speaking to a delegation of the Rawalpindi Islamabad Sports Journalists Association (RISJA), led by President Abubakar Bin Tallat, DG Yasir Pirzada provided a detailed overview of preparations for the upcoming regional event.
""Hosting the South Asian Games is a matter of national pride, and we are taking all possible measures to meet international standards in infrastructure, training, and athlete welfare,"" Pirzada stated.
He highlighted the ongoing renovation and development work at the Pakistan Sports Complex, where significant upgrades are underway to transform the facility into a state-of-the-art venue capable of hosting international events.
Pirzada emphasized that under the visionary leadership of Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif, Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah, and Federal Secretary IPC Mohyuddin Wani, the government is strongly committed to reviving and promoting sports across the country.
He added that special attention is being given to national training camps, which now include advanced coaching, nutritional planning, and psychological support to help athletes compete at the highest level.
Beyond the Games, DG PSB also outlined broader sports development initiatives, including grassroots talent identification programs, school and college competitions, and public-private partnerships aimed at strengthening the foundation of sports in Pakistan.
The session concluded with an open exchange of suggestions from journalists, reinforcing the PSB's commitment to media collaboration and the long-term growth of sports in the country.
The RISJA delegation included Abdul Mohi Shah, Shakeel Awan, Zulfiqar Baig, Nasir Naqvi, Shakir Abbasi, Afzal Javed, Shahryar Khan, Arfa Feroze Zaki, Awais Abbasi, and Kiran Khan.

Child's killer dies in 'police encounter',"NL
.
A highly wanted suspect, who was involved in the sexual assault and murder of a nine-year-old child, was killed in an alleged police encounter in the Wah Cantt area, police said on Thursday.
The suspect, accompanied by an accomplice, opened fire on a police team. In retaliatory firing, the suspect was killed, while his accomplice managed to escape.
According to the police, the suspect was identified as Rizwan Khan alias Buddah, who was wanted for the sexual assault and murder of a nine-year-old child three years ago. The child had left his home in Wah Cantt with his brother and was later found dead in a field. The post-mortem report and forensic evidence confirmed that the child had been sexually assaulted before being murdered.
Police officials said that solving this ""blind murder"" and arresting the perpetrator was a significant challenge for Rawalpindi police. For the past three years, the police had been continuously investigating the case.
Solid evidence emerged indicating that Rizwan Khan was indeed responsible for the sexual assault and murder and had been in hiding to evade arrest.
Various special teams were working on the case to apprehend the suspect. During the operation, the suspect opened fire when confronted by the police, leading to his death.

The current situation in Afghanistan,"NL
.
Although the international community is preoccupied with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and the lingering crisis triggered by Israeli aggressions in the Middle East, the situation further afield in the South Asian region remains tenuous as well.
Besides the potential risk of another Indo-Pak flare-up, Pakistan's relations with Afghanistan are tense. The possibility of cross-border proxies engaging in terrorist attacks within Pakistan is a major threat. In addition to trying to secure the long and porous Af-Pak border, around 800,000 Afghans seeking refuge in Pakistan have been expelled since 2023.
The latest UN report on Afghanistan describes the troubled state of our northwesterly neighbour. It points out how the security situation in Afghanistan has not stabilised despite the end of major military conflict between the US-led NATO forces and the Taliban. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) continues to defy the domination of the Taliban regime.
Besides attacking 'soft targets' such as religious minorities, ISIL-K continues high-profile attacks, for example, at the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing earlier this year. Other opposition groups such as the National Resistance Front led by Ahmad Masood, and the Afghanistan Freedom Front, comprised of former government and military officials, are still operational. However, neither the ISIL-K nor these other opposition groups have the capability to threaten the Taliban's vice-like hold on the war-ravaged country.
The above-mentioned UN assessment further notes how the new school year, which started in spring, has again barred girls and women from going to secondary schools or from pursuing higher education. Humanitarian needs in the country remain dire too. Yet, the UN's own humanitarian response plan for the current year, which aspired to support nearly 17 million Afghans barely managed to secure over 15 per cent of its proposed $2.42 billion budget.
International funding, on which nearly half the Afghan population remains so dependent, has been shrinking, and it seems unlikely to rise again under present circumstances. Global US aid cuts have severely undermined UN affiliated efforts by the World Food Program, for instance, as well as the work of many major non-profits, such as the International Red Cross. Other rich western countries are not stepping up their commitments to compensate for the loss of American aid.
Conversely, China's influence in Afghanistan has grown. China is currently trying to mediate the resumption of bilateral ties between Islamabad and Kabul, which had been suspended for nearly four years. Earlier this month, Pakistan announced that its charge d'affaires stationed in Kabul would be elevated to the rank of ambassador, and Kabul followed suit by announcing that its representative in Islamabad would also be upgraded to the same rank. Only a handful of countries — including China and Russia — have yet agreed to host Taliban-appointed ambassadors since their return to power in 2021. However, none of these countries, including Pakistan, has yet formally recognised the Taliban rulers.
The Taliban have been in power for nearly four years now, so they have had ample time to make a transition from an insurgency movement to a more functional government. Their hardline and iron-fisted stance was initially explained as being motivated by their fear of losing the support of hardline elements who may have joined even more extreme outfits such as the ISIL-K. However, the Taliban regime now has no excuse. It must broaden its myopic approach, and make a genuine effort to deliver responsible governance, via incremental representation rather than continued repression. Otherwise, Afghanistan will remain a pariah state.

Escalation hotspot,"US
.
Kashmir is being ranked among the world's most critical escalation hotspots, as nuclear-armed India and Pakistan face ""perilously high"" tensions. The Global Peace Index, published by the highly-regarded Australian think tank Institute for Economics and Peace, noted how the four-day Indo-Pak conflict in May 2025 — the deadliest in years - exposed how quickly the Kashmir dispute could ignite a catastrophic war. The report also notes the fragility of the ceasefire - India won't even explicitly admit the circumstances around the agreement, including the role Washington played.
The May 2025 clashes saw BrahMos cruise missiles, Rafale jets, J-10Cs and hundreds of drones in the skies above the Indo-Pak border and the Line of Control. Pakistan's downing of advanced Indian aircraft, including French-built Rafales, also proved that even ""limited"" conflicts risk rapid escalation. The embarrassment of having to ground the pride of the Indian Air Force saw the conflict spread well beyond traditional skirmish zones in Kashmir, dragging the world toward crisis.
Meanwhile, the threat to cut off Pakistan's water — a war crime — shows that India's leaders are more than willing to act like a rogue state just to keep up their prime minister's strongman image and delusions of grandeur.
India's spokespersons can run themselves hoarse calling Kashmir a bilateral issue, but that doesn't make it so. Remember the day India asked the UN to intervene in the first conflict over the region. Modi and his regime are clearly not students of history — not even Indian history — so they are unlikely to be familiar with the events of 1914, when a regional conflict tainted by mistrust and disinformation exploded into what is now better known as the First World War. India's far-right government has been using conflict as a political tool for the past decade. Without domestic or foreign intervention soon, one day it will end up going too far.

Glastonbury begins amid controversy,"NL
UK music fest will include Kneecap despite backlash
The UK's iconic Glastonbury Festival opened its gates on Wednesday amid controversy over the inclusion of Irish rap trio Kneecap on the bill.
The group has made headlines with their outspoken pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel stance. One of their members has been charged with a ""terror"" offence for allegedly supporting Hezbollah.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Saturday said it was not ""appropriate"" for the band to perform at Glastonbury, the country's biggest and most famous music festival.
Acts due to perform from on Friday include chart artists Charli XCX and Olivia Rodrigo as well as veteran stars Neil Young and Rod Stewart, who has said he will be joined by his former Faces band member Ronnie Wood.
Other big names on the bill include Raye, The Prodigy, Alanis Morissette and Snow Patrol.
Tickets for this year's Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm in southwest England sold out within 35 minutes when they went on sale in November, with standard tickets priced at £373.50 ($471.50).
The festival officially opened at 10:00PM (2100 GMT) on Wednesday with a theatre and circus act followed by fireworks.
But many ticket-holders, ladened with tents and backpacks, arrived hours earlier to claim the vast site's prime camping spots.
Glastonbury attracted more than 210,000 fans in 2024, hosting 3,000 performances across some 80 stages. Many of the gigs were broadcast by the BBC, which has partnered with the festival since 1997.
Glasto, as the festival is popularly known, was inspired by Britain's 1960s counterculture and hippie movements. Its first iteration was as the Pilton Festival in 1970.
Glam rockers T. Rex were the first headliners. Since then, it has attracted cult status and big names, from David Bowie and Paul McCartney to Stormzy and Elton John, who played his final UK gig there in 2023.
The British weather is often the headline act, some events turning into mud baths, but the forecast is largely dry for the next five days. afp

UN charter 'not an a la carte menu',"US
Guterres warns 80-year document under assault like never before
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned on Thursday that the UN Charter was under assault like never before as the 193-member world body marked the 80th anniversary of the signing of its founding document.
""We see an all too familiar pattern: Follow when the Charter suits, ignore when it does not. The Charter of the United Nations is not optional. It is not an a la carte menu. It is the bedrock of international relations,"" Guterres said.
Countries regularly accuse each other of breaching the Charter, but few face concrete consequences. In recent years Russia and Israel have been called out by the General Assembly for violating the Charter with their wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, respectively.
Both conflicts still rage. In the past week, Iran accused the United States of violating the Charter with its strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and the US justified them under the Charter as self-defense.
The United Nations was born out of the end of World War Two and the Charter was signed in San Francisco by an initial 50 states on June 26, 1945. It came into force four months later with the aim of saving succeeding generations from war and upholding human dignity and the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small.
While the United Nations had done a lot of good over the past eight decades, senior US diplomat McCoy Pitt said the world body should not ""overlook the shortcomings that limit the UN's potential.""
""We regret that the U.N. has lost sight of its founding mission. In this regard, wars still rage on multiple continents,"" he said.
""The principles of the UN Charter must remain at the heart of this institution, not just as an agreement for a better world, but also as a continuing call to action.""

SBP reserves drop by $2.7b,"US
It marks second-largest decline since 2011 owing to debt repayments
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) fell sharply by $2.66 billion during the week ended June 20, 2025, bringing the total to $9.06 billion.
""This marks the second-largest weekly decline since data was available, ie, 2011,"" noted Arif Habib Limited (AHL). The steepest fall on record was the $2.91 billion drop seen in March 2022.
The decline was driven primarily by external debt repayments by the government of Pakistan, with a major portion attributed to the repayment of commercial loans, the State Bank said. However, the pressure on reserves is expected to ease in the coming days.
During the current week, the SBP has received $3.1 billion in fresh commercial borrowing and over $500 million from multilateral sources. These inflows are expected to be reflected in reserves data for the week ending June 27, 2025, the central bank added. As of June 20, 2025, Pakistan's total liquid foreign currency reserves stood at $14.4 billion, comprising $9.06 billion held by the SBP and $5.33 billion held by commercial banks.
JS Global Head of Research Waqas Ghani Kukaswadia stated that the drop in reserves is likely due to a payment rollover and the corresponding inflows should appear in next week's figures. The situation highlights the sensitivity of Pakistan's reserves to debt repayments, even as incoming inflows are expected to stabilise the outlook in the short term.
Moreover, as of May 2025, Pakistan's Roshan Digital Account (RDA) gross inflows reached $10.381 billion. Of the total funds received, $1.787 billion has been repatriated by account holders while $6.648 billion has been utilised within the country. Consequently, the net liability stood at $1.947 billion, representing the portion of funds available for potential repatriation, according to AHL.
Furthermore, the Pakistani rupee saw a slight uptick against the US dollar on Thursday, appreciating by 0.02% in the inter-bank market. By the end of trading, the local currency closed at 283.67, marking a modest gain of five paisa compared to Wednesday's close at 283.72.
Globally, the US dollar weakened, hitting multi-year lows against both the euro and the Swiss franc. The decline was driven by growing concerns over the future independence of the US Federal Reserve.
Meanwhile, gold prices in Pakistan rose, though international bullion rates saw a slight decline, influenced by reduced geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and ongoing uncertainty surrounding the US Fed's rate outlook. In the domestic market, the price of gold increased by Rs1,335 per tola, reaching Rs356,000.

"Netanyahu, Trump 'agree' on ending war","US
This victory presents an opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements
Israel Hayom newspaper, quoting an unnamed source, reported that Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump agreed in a phone call this week on a rapid end to the war in Gaza, potentially within two weeks.
Israel Hayom said the deal could include expanding the Abraham Accords between Israel and its Arab neighbors to include Saudi Arabia and Syria. The prime minister's office declined to comment on the report.
Later, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday the outcome of Israel's war with Iran presented opportunities for peace that his country should not waste. In a statement, Netanyahu said: ""This victory presents an opportunity for a dramatic widening of peace agreements. We are working on this with enthusiasm.
Alongside the freeing of hostages and defeat of Hamas, there is a window of opportunity that must not be missed. We cannot waste even a single day.""
On Sunday, Netanyahu said that with Iran weakened, he expected more countries to join the Abraham Accords.
""We have broken the axis,"" Netanyahu told reporters. ""This is a huge change and Israel's status is rising, not just in the Middle East but also in the world. This is a tectonic shift.
We will see a bright new future, of security, of prosperity, of hope and of peace.""
Airstrikes killed at least 21 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, local health authorities said, as mediators reached out to Israel and Hamas to seek a resumption of ceasefire talks to end the war. Local health authorities said an Israeli airstrike killed at least nine people at a school housing displaced families in the Sheikh Radwan suburb in Gaza City, while another strike killed nine people near a tent encampment in Khan Younis in the south of the enclave.
Three other people were killed by Israeli gunfire and dozens were wounded as crowds awaited UN aid trucks along a main route in central Gaza, medics said, the latest in a series of multiple fatalities at aid distribution points.

"Trump wants more missiles, drones","NL
Seeks fewer F-35s in $893b budget request
US President Donald Trump wants a pay raise for troops and more high-tech missiles and drones in next year's defense budget, while cutting Navy jobs and buying fewer ships and fighter jets, according to budget materials posted on Wednesday.
At $892.6 billion, the defense and national security budget request for fiscal 2026 is flat compared with this year. The budget, which also includes nuclear weapons-related activities carried out by the Department of Energy and increases funding for homeland security, puts Trump's mark on the military by pulling funds away from weaponry and services to fund his priorities.
The Pentagon's portion of the national security budget is $848.3 billion. The White House said the funding will be used to deter Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific region, and revitalize the US defense industrial base.
A senior defense official told reporters on Thursday that at the request of the Pentagon, funding for Trump's marquee but controversial ""Golden Dome"" missile defense shield was included in a separate budget request and is not part of the latest proposal sent to Congress.
In the 2026 budget Trump requested fewer of Lockheed Martin's F-35 jets and only three warships. Procurement of a Virginia-class submarine made by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries and 15 other ships are expected to be included in a separate appropriation bill, the Navy said.
The budget asks for a 3.8% pay raise for troops, but also trims costs by retiring older weaponry that is more expensive to operate, such as the entire fleet of 162 A-10 Warthogs, which provide air support to frontline troops.
Under the plan, the Navy will reduce its civilian employee workforce by 7,286 people. The senior defense official said investments in systems in the bill will enable the Pentagon to pass an audit by the end of 2028.
Compared to former President Joe Biden's budget from his last year in office, which had asked for 68 F-35 jets in fiscal 2025, Trump's fiscal 2026 request seeks only 47 of the fighter jets. The budget has already sparked debate in Congress where a draft bill for fiscal-year 2026, currently under consideration by lawmakers in the US House of Representatives, boosts the F-35 purchases to 69, one more than Biden's 2025 request.
The Pentagon continues to prioritize purchasing munitions and key weapons systems. The Air Force is continuing its investment in the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile-Extended Range (JASSM-ER) and the Long-Range Anti-Ship (LRASM) missiles, both of which have ranges that can be helpful in the Pacific where distances are a big factor.
The budget also seeks far fewer Precision Strike Missiles, which will replace the Army Tactical Missile (ATACM) used in Ukraine. Lockheed Martin makes all three missiles. The budget boosts spending on small drones — in part because of lessons learned during Russia's war in Ukraine, where unmanned aircraft have proven to be an integral part of low-cost, yet highly effective fighting.

The decision was taken in a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi on Thursday at the Supreme Court Branch Registry, Lahore.
Emphasizing the importance of synergy, the chief justice urged bar representatives to sensitize their respective bar associations about these developments and to proactively engage in these reform initiatives.
He further directed that all support and facilities extended to the bar associations by the federal government must be streamlined and structured to avoid duplication and ensure efficiency.
The CJP also called upon provincial line departments to remain actively engaged with the resident additional secretary of the commission for timely and effective implementation of district-level projects forwarded by district coordination committee headed by the district and sessions Judge.
He noted with concern the lack of infrastructure, including solarization and digital integration, in less developed districts, and stressed the need for targeted interventions in such areas.

Grok churns out fake facts about Israel-Iran war,"US
AI platform offered different responses to the same prompts
Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok produced inaccurate and contradictory responses when users sought to fact-check the Israel-Iran conflict, a study said on Tuesday, raising fresh doubts about its reliability as a debunking tool.
With tech platforms reducing their reliance on human fact-checkers, users are increasingly utilising AI-powered chatbots – including xAI's Grok – in search of reliable information, but their responses are often themselves prone to misinformation.
""The investigation into Grok's performance during the first days of the Israel-Iran conflict exposes significant flaws and limitations in the AI chatbot's ability to provide accurate, reliable, and consistent information during times of crisis,"" said the study from the Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab) of the Atlantic Council, an American think tank.
""Grok demonstrated that it struggles with verifying already-confirmed facts, analysing fake visuals, and avoiding unsubstantiated claims.""
The DFRLab analysed around 130,000 posts in various languages on the platform X, where the AI assistant is built in, to find that Grok was ""struggling to authenticate AI-generated media.""
Following Iran's retaliatory strikes on Israel, Grok offered vastly different responses to similar prompts about an AI-generated video of a destroyed airport that amassed millions of views on X, the study found.
It oscillated – sometimes within the same minute – between denying the airport's destruction and confirming it had been damaged by strikes, the study said.
In some responses, Grok cited a missile launched by Yemeni rebels as the source of the damage. In others, it wrongly identified the AI-generated airport as one in Beirut, Gaza, or Tehran.
When users shared another AI-generated video depicting buildings collapsing after an alleged Iranian strike on Tel Aviv, Grok responded that it appeared to be real, the study said.
The Israel-Iran conflict, which led to US airstrikes against Tehran's nuclear program over the weekend, has churned out an avalanche of online misinformation including AI-generated videos and war visuals recycled from other conflicts.
AI chatbots also amplified falsehoods.
As the Israel-Iran war intensified, false claims spread across social media that China had dispatched military cargo planes to Tehran to offer its support.
When users asked the AI-operated X accounts of AI companies Perplexity and Grok about its validity, both wrongly responded that the claims were true, according to disinformation watchdog NewsGuard.
Researchers say Grok has previously made errors verifying information related to crises such as the recent India-Pakistan conflict and anti-immigration protests in Los Angeles.
Last month, Grok was under renewed scrutiny for inserting ""white genocide"" in South Africa, a far-right conspiracy theory, into unrelated queries.

Body found in drain identified as schoolteacher,"NL
.
The body of a woman found in a stormwater drain near Bhoosa Godown in the Ratta Amral area of Rawalpindi was identified as that of a schoolteacher on Thursday.
Anum Bashir had booked an online cab to go to work on Wednesday. The vehicle was later found in a deteriorated condition near a stormwater drain in Westridge, while the cab driver remains missing.
Originally from Mandi Bahauddin's Malakwal area, Anum was currently living in Rawalpindi's Afshan Colony. She worked as a teacher at a private school. Her family identified the body at the hospital but declined to pursue any legal action or request a post-mortem, claiming it to be an accident.
Preliminary police investigations revealed that Anum had booked an online ride to reach her workplace in Islamabad. However, due to heavy rainfall on Wednesday morning, water from the nearby storm drain had flooded Lane 4 of Range Road. It is believed the car got trapped in the water and was swept away.
Later, Anum's body was found near the Bhosa Godown stormwater drain. Local residents who spotted the body informed the authorities, and it was retrieved and transported to the hospital by Rescue 1122.
The cab she had booked was found stuck in a narrow lane near the drain in the Westridge area, in a poor condition. The driver, identified as Hasnain, is still missing.
The police traced the car's ownership through its registration and contacted the owners, who confirmed that Hasnain had been driving the vehicle as a cab.
Officials at Ratta Amral Police Station, in whose jurisdiction the body was found, confirmed that the body has been handed over to the family.
Meanwhile, Westridge police — under whose area the vehicle and driver went missing — stated that efforts to locate Hasnain were ongoing, but no progress had been made so far. Investigations are underway.

The useless war,"US
.
The US blundered into an unnecessary war. Without a rationale and out of some unexplained compulsion, stories have emerged how Trump made the decision on the spur. Iran-Israel war got more intense with greatly more lethal longer-range weapons joining the fracas. Israel and its people bore the brunt. Russia-Ukraine war goes on relentlessly. Israel's Gaza expedition has gained even greater intensity to balance the negative perception of Israel being bombed from the skies and half of Israeli population forced to live in shelters than the comfort of their homes.
India and Pakistan are in a kinetic pause. Houthis are well and alive, and the Red Sea is still their backyard. The Persian Gulf freeway is on tenterhooks while escalating oil prices can detract any plans anywhere of a rebounded economic outlook. US allies in the Gulf, where American forces are stationed — those nations have successfully negotiated a space for themselves to live in relative safety and comfort — were quite unnecessarily sucked into a war which could only bring even greater pain to a large swathe, and possibly most of Asia. What has the world, or America, gained by President Trump's action of entering the war with Israel against Iran?
No one knows how deep did the MOP GBU-57 penetrate. No one knows if Fordow still exists as a viable enrichment facility. It may still be safe, if not functional. At least part of it. It is possible that enriched fissile material may have already been moved somewhere. It is possible that Iran will recover the site or its infrastructure and reconstitute it at another location in another time and commence its journey to wherever it was heading.
The B-2s may have flown a flawless mission and all components of this mission may have, over a long range, coordinated exquisitely, but that is what they do as a staple, day-in and day-out. That is how an air force worth its name would execute any such mission. No gains there. They will drop their weapons where asked but can do little beyond it to know if they worked as intended and in the right chambers. Only the Iranians can tell if the damage indeed was sufficient to degrade if not obliterate Iran's nuclear programme effectively. Only Iranians know if the mission was a success.
The world is rightly concerned about where Iran may be heading with its nuclear programme. After all, the world formed and agreed to a Non-Proliferation Treaty as a collective and signed on it for joint responsibility in a rule-based order. If a signatory violates the covenant it is bound to be reprimanded and treated per the stipulated law. But this is not the only Agreement the world made to live in congeniality of a rule-based order. And that is the rub. There are a dozen others that the UN Charter carries as rules all must live by without exception, hubris and entitlement.
Civilisational hate cannot turn into wrath and impunity around superior force. Today's rule-based order is under threat of unravelling because of arrogated unilateralism and wholesale disregard of what is necessary for respectful coexistence. International covenants and statutes meant to conduct international and inter-state business were underwritten by the US as its prime guarantor. She cannot be seen to abdicate from this responsibility and render the global community to chaos, disorder and rampant instability. Nor must any nation assume its whim to dismiss the rules for coexistence around any perception of excusive power.
Unfortunately, how Iran has been dealt with in the last some weeks was haughtiness and disrespect. Rights and responsibilities go hand in hand. People cannot be denied one to carry the other. You don't like a people, or a nation or a state; you gather your wares and march into, with the deadliest arsenal mankind has known in the name of righting presumed wrong, or labeled wrong? Have a heart. People will react and respond. There are higher things in life than submission, subservience and servitude. Israel should have learnt its lesson from the people in Gaza. Iran has brought forth the lesson once again.
Finally, a ceasefire was agreed upon after a lot of huffing and puffing. President Trump as the leader of world's prime superpower exhibited his frustration for being coerced into a misjudgment in attacking Iran. The test that Iran was put through in the last two weeks was spectacularly handled by Iran, its leadership, its people and its depleted military capability.
Israel boasts of world's most efficient and effective military machine proven over time, except that it now faced a people who may be short on much but carried the depth of civilisational strength and confidence in their destiny. Militarily, they responded to Israel's provocations with resolve and spirit with the tools at their disposal while Israel despite all that they possessed could not overwhelm the adversary. There are issues that Iran needs to work on with the international community and it will do itself well by satisfying the world on its conduct as a responsible member of the global community — international agreements and statutes must hold. Israel though must be reined in, and Gazans and the Palestinians spared the genocide they have been under. Their blood is as valuable as any other.
The world in the larger sense, and the middle east in particular, has been saved from an inferno of another unnecessary war. If Asia was to light up China and Russia would have been sucked in. This would have been the Archduke Ferdinand moment for the twenty-first century world. It has returned from the brink. Israel's demeanour and swagger around its uncontested superiority against marginal forces stands punctured and called into serious question.
The myth is no more. Iran's regime will survive but Netanyahu's may be the only casualty. Trump saved himself some serious blushes. Having faltered into one, more likely to impulse than cold calculus, he is lucky to have restituted his credibility and his politics somewhat. What was intended to be gained through negotiations was bartered for an egoistic urge by joining an inconsequential war. The world must now deal with another Iran in another way, not so complementary to its earlier intent.
Iran has recovered its dignity and respect as a nation having gone through the test. It deserves to be mainstreamed in the global community. That alone will force it to respect and comply with international norms, agreements and statutes. For it, all proclivity among those who have arrogated exceptionalism as their right and unilateralism as their way must become equal and respectful subscribers to the global covenants against which we hope to judge Iran.
Gaza and Kashmir deserve their chance to fairness as a starter. This is the Yalta moment. Let Trump, Xi and Putin not fail the world. Bretton Woods, with alterations, needs to be tweaked and reinforced as the set of rules that the world community must live by in this century. Every war has a purpose. This one served none.

US tightens visa rules for Pakistani applicants
Pakistani applicants for the for F, M or J categories of non-immigrant visa were advised by the United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore on Thursday to make their social media accounts public for vetting, according to a report.
""The instructions followed a similar advice issued by the US Embassy in New Delhi earlier this week. The move came after President Donald Trump's administration ordered the resumption of student visa appointments, accompanied by significantly stricter social media vetting of applicants.
""Effective immediately, all individuals applying for an F, M, or J nonimmigrant visa are requested to adjust the privacy settings on all of their social media accounts to 'public' to facilitate vetting necessary to establish their identity and admissibility to the United States,"" the consulates said in Instagram post.
The post stated that since 2019, the US has required visa applicants to provide social media identifiers on immigrant and non-immigrant visa application forms. it added that applicants had to fill out social media identifiers and account handles for each platform on the application form.
F and M are different student visa types, while the J visa is a non-immigrant visa for individuals approved to participate in exchange visitor programmes in the US. ""Omitting social media information on your application could lead to visa denial and ineligibility for future US visas,"" the consulate warned.
The Trump administration paused the issuance of new education visas late last month as it mulled new social media vetting strategies. The US had also targeted Chinese students for special scrutiny amid a tense negotiation over tariffs and the supply of rare-earth metals and minerals to the United States.
The state department directive allowed diplomatic posts to resume the scheduling of interviews for educational and exchange visas, but added that consular officers would conduct a ""comprehensive and thorough vetting"" of all applicants applying for F, M and J visas.
The screening for ""antisemitic"" activity matches similar guidance given at US Citizenship and Immigration Services under the Department of Homeland Security and has been criticised as an effort to crack down on opposition to the conduct of Israel's war in Gaza.

PSX faces profit-taking after two days of gains,"NL
Benchmark KSE-100 index drops 715 points, settles at 122,046
Stocks came under selling pressure at the Pakistan bourse on Thursday as the benchmark KSE-100 index gave up early gains and closed with a drop of over 700 points amid profit-taking.
At the commencement of trading, the market extended its healthy momentum of the past two days, hitting intra-day high at 123,418 within the very first hour. However, profit-taking emerged soon afterwards, which gradually took the index to intra-day low of 122,142 before the end of trading.
""Stocks closed under pressure amid economic uncertainty ahead of the outcome of Pakistan-US reciprocal tariff talks to avoid potential 29% tariffs on exports,"" said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.
Uncertainty about federal cabinet's approval of the revised Finance Bill 2025, along with concerns over tax collection targets and expanded powers for taxmen, which could affect industries, fuelled the bearish close, he added.
At the end of trading, the KSE-100 index settled at 122,046.46, down 715.18 points, or 0.58%.
Early gains were extended up to 123,418 before the market came off highs to close 0.58% lower day-on-day at 122,046, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote in its daily report. On KSE-100, 71 stocks declined and only 27 advanced, reflecting a broadly negative sentiment. Engro Holdings (+2.22%), National Foods (+8.07%) and Pakistan Petroleum (+0.79%) were the top contributors to index gains. On the other hand, Bank AL Habib (-2.84%), Lucky Cement (-1.86%) and HBL (-2.59%) were the major drags, it said.
AHL pointed out that the Supreme Court granted relief to the cement sector by suspending the Lahore High Court's directive that required Punjab-based manufacturers to pay 6% of the ex-factory price in royalty on limestone.
Apart from that, The Organic Meat Company (+5.64%) announced plans to export beef casings to Europe, a significant move seen by investors as a step towards diversification and growth.
""Heading into last session of the week, the KSE-100 is up 1.69%,"" AHL said and anticipated that 120k would continue as the support level and a base for push towards 130k.
Topline Securities reported that after two consecutive sessions of strong gains, the local bourse witnessed a round of profit-taking, driven by fiscal year-end considerations and short-term portfolio rebalancing.
The benchmark index saw a volatile ride, climbing as high as 656 points before slipping to the low of 715 points. It settled at 122,046, reflecting a cautious investor mood as the quarter was drawing to a close.
Engro Holdings, National Foods, Pakistan Petroleum and Tariq Glass Industries provided the biggest support, adding 228 points to the index. Meanwhile, Bank AL Habib, Lucky Cement, HBL, Pakistan Services and Systems Limited dragged the index down by 407 points, it said.
KTrade Securities observed that the PSX showed signs of buyers' exhaustion as investors booked profits following a recent rally driven by the US-brokered ceasefire between Iran and Israel.
Selling pressure was concentrated in banking, cement and technology sectors and market sentiment remained cautiously optimistic, contingent on the ceasefire's sustainability, it mentioned.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala, in his review, wrote that the market opened on a positive note, touching intra-day high of 123,418 early in the session. However, broad-based profit-taking set in after two strong bullish days, which dragged the index into the red. Naviwala saw a positive near-term outlook as dips may offer attractive entry opportunities.
Overall trading volumes increased to 758.5 million shares compared with Wednesday's tally of 749.8 million. The value of shares traded was Rs30 billion. Shares of 473 companies were traded. Of these, 200 stocks closed higher, 237 fell and 36 remained unchanged.
Pakistan International Bulk Terminal was the volume leader with trading in 37.5 million shares, losing Rs0.06 to close at Rs8.52. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 33.3 million shares, falling Rs0.04 to close at Rs1.45 and Pervez Ahmed Consultancy with 33 million shares, gaining Rs0.25 to close at Rs3.29. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs967 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

"PHC orders LG funds, shields Swati","NL
Court directs fair fund release; bars NAB from arresting PTI leader in Kohistan probe
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has directed the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government to release development funds to local government representatives in accordance with the law.
The court issued these orders while disposing of a petition filed against the withholding of funds from elected local officials.
A two-member bench comprising Justice Muhammad Naeem Anwar and Justice Kamran Hayat Miankhel heard the case on Thursday. The petition, filed by Humayun Mayar and others, was argued by Advocate Babar Khan Yousafzai.
The counsel informed the court that despite local government elections being held in 2021-22, the provincial government has not provided a single rupee in development funds to opposition-affiliated representatives. He added that the law clearly mandates that a specific portion of the annual development budget must be spent through local bodies.
""In the 2024-25 development budget, the government allocated funds to 56 of its own local representatives, while denying any funds to 71 opposition-aligned mayors and tehsil chairmen,"" he stated. ""Under the law, 30 per cent of the annual development budget is required to be allocated to local government representatives.""
He further argued that such discriminatory actions undermine the rights of LG representatives elected by the public, and are in violation of the government's own legislation. Therefore, he requested the court to compel the government to fulfill its legal obligations and release the appropriate share of the development budget.
After hearing all arguments, the court ordered the government to ensure that local government representatives are allocated funds in accordance with the law in the upcoming 2025-26 development budget.
Azam Swati
PHC has barred the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from arresting Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Azam Swati in connection with the Kohistan mega corruption scandal. However, the court directed Swati to cooperate and join the ongoing investigation.
The ruling came during the hearing of a writ petition filed by Swati, which was taken up by a two-member bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal.
During the hearing, Swati's counsel, Barrister Waqar, informed the court that NAB had issued a notice to his client regarding the Kohistan corruption case, summoning him on June 23. Instead of appearing personally, Swati's lawyer represented him before NAB. The counsel further informed the court that multiple FIRs had already been registered against Swati in various police stations across the country, details of which are known.
He argued that while NAB had now issued a ""call-up notice"", it failed to specify in what capacity his client was being summoned.

"Selfies at Gawalmandi, silence elsewhere","PK
Site unofficially becomes a symbolic 'photo-op point' for flood assessment
With the pre-monsoon season underway, the district administration has once again designated the Gawalmandi Bridge — a high and secure vantage point — as the central monitoring site for flood damage caused by the 22-kilometre-long Nullah Leh and 15 tributary stormwater drains.
Despite severe urban flooding on Wednesday that submerged 70pc of the city's Cantonment areas and major markets — such as Raja Bazaar, Moti Bazaar, and others — under 2 to 3 feet of water, no senior officials visited the affected neighbourhoods.
Instead, key figures including the commissioner, deputy commissioner, RDA director general, WASA MD, and other officials arrived at Gawalmandi Bridge after the rain had stopped, took selfies, gave brief statements about drainage efforts, and left in vehicles.
This location has unofficially become a ""photo-op point"" for flood assessment. The bridge is cleaned and freshly painted before each high-profile visit, and nearby traffic is halted during these inspections. Unlike other vulnerable bridges over Nullah Leh, which officials avoid due to potential public backlash, Gawalmandi Bridge remains the preferred spot due to its security and easy access.
Sources indicate that all federal and provincial ministers, MPs, and department heads will be brought to this same site during the monsoon season.
Even if Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz visits Rawalpindi for flood assessment, she is expected to be taken to this bridge.
Local civic groups, including the Citizen Action Committee, have strongly criticised the practice. Chairman Malik Zaheer Awan has demanded that officials visit flood-affected areas and announce immediate relief of Rs100,000 per victim.
District Bar Association President Sardar Manzar Bashir also condemned the symbolic monitoring from Gawalmandi, calling it inadequate for understanding the full extent of the disaster.
Citizen Action Committee warned of a mass protest at Gawalmandi Bridge if this ""selfie drama"" does not end.

Pacquiao 'hungry' for comeback after four-year layoff,"US
The 46-year-old icon faces World Boxing Council (WBC) champion Barrios in Las Vegas
Manny Pacquiao said Wednesday that his lengthy layoff from boxing has reignited his passion for the sport as he prepares for next month's world welterweight title comeback against Mario Barrios.
The 46-year-old Filipino boxing icon faces World Boxing Council (WBC) champion Barrios in Las Vegas on July 19, four years after his last fight ended in defeat.
Pacquiao has reunited with long-time veteran trainer Freddie Roach for next month's title tilt, and spoke to journalists on Wednesday as he worked out at the Hall of Famer's Wild Card gym in Hollywood.
""Four years rest has been good for me,"" Pacquiao said after showing off some impressive hand speed in an open pads session.
""I've been in boxing for so many decades, so it's good for my body to rest for four years.
""Now I'm back, I'm hungry to fight again. I'm hungry to fight in a big fight like this. To work hard, have discipline, everything like that.""
""I've missed boxing. I feel like the passion, the fire in my eyes, working hard -- it's still there.""
Pacquiao said while his recovery times were now slightly longer, he had not noticed any drop off in his physical conditioning.
""I'm fast, I can move like I did before. I can run in the mountains with the young boxers, so I'm happy,"" he said.
""I'm enjoying this training camp. There's a couple of adjustments for bodily recovery. We have to control the body, give my body time to rest and recover.""
Pacquiao, who won 12 world titles in eight different weight classes during a glittering professional career that began in 1995, refused to be drawn on whether his comeback next month would be ""one and done"" or just the first step of a full-fledged return to the sport.
""It's hard to say,"" he said when asked about future bouts. ""Now I'm back so one at a time, after this fight we can plan whatever we want.""
For some in boxing, however, Pacquiao's return to the ring represents an unnecessary risk.
British promoter Eddie Hearn was the latest to cast doubt on the wisdom of the Filipino's comeback earlier this month, predicting that the 30-year-old Barrios will be ""too young and too strong"" for Pacquiao.
Pacquiao smiled on Wednesday when asked for his response to Hearn's remarks.
""Just watch on July 19th,"" he said. ""It will be a good fight.""
