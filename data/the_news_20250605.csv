Pakistan to chair UN Taliban Sanctions Committee,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318656-pakistan-to-chair-un-taliban-sanctions-committee,"KARACHI: Pakistan has assumed the chairmanship of the United Nations Security Council’s (UNSC) 1988 Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions targeting the Taliban.
In a statement on Wednesday, the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the UN said the appointment reinforces Islamabad’s growing role in global diplomatic and counterterrorism efforts. Pakistan has also been named vice-chair of the UNSC’s Counter-Terrorism Committee. The 1988 Sanctions Committee is tasked with implementing measures such as travel bans, asset freezes, and arms embargoes against individuals and entities associated with the Taliban. Pakistan’s leadership of the committee positions it at the centre of deliberations on Afghanistan’s future, where it continues to advocate for a constructive, regionally led approach.
The statement further highlighted that Islamabad has also been appointed co-chair of the Security Council’s Informal Working Group on documentation and the newly established Informal Working Group on Sanctions. These groups focus on improving the working methods, transparency, and effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes.
The development has triggered several Indian commentators and media outlets on X (formerly Twitter), many of whom expressed surprise over what they view as a diplomatic setback. They reiterated the Indian government’s narrative that its neighbour has harboured and financed terror groups. Some analysts see the reaction as part of a broader narrative struggle playing out between the South Asian rivals on international platforms.
An Indian delegation is currently in the US, reportedly to advance its narrative against Pakistan on the international stage, as New Delhi seeks to shape opinion among Western allies on counterterrorism-related matters. The timing of the visit has not gone unnoticed in diplomatic circles.
The appointment signals broader international confidence in Islamabad’s capacity to contribute meaningfully to global peace and security frameworks.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s concurrent diplomatic engagement with China and its expanded role within the UNSC underscore its efforts to rebalance regional dynamics and play a stabilising role in Afghanistan.

BJP accuses Rahul of ‘treason’ over ‘surrender’ remark,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318657-bjp-accuses-rahul-of-treason-over-surrender-remark,"KARACHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of committing an act “no less than treason” by branding Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s foreign policy a “surrender” in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor.
On Wednesday, BJP President J P Nadda said Gandhi’s remarks were an insult to the Indian armed forces and tantamount to echoing Pakistani propaganda.
“This is no less than treason”, Nadda posted on X (formerly Twitter). “Rahul Gandhi, you, your party and your leaders might have surrendered because this has been your history, but Bharat never surrenders.”
In a series of sharp posts, Nadda accused the Congress party of a legacy of capitulation: “Surrender is in your party Congress’ dictionary, it is in your DNA... You surrendered to terrorism, surrendered in Sharm-al-Sheikh, surrendered at the table in Shimla after winning the 1971 war, surrendered in the Indus Water Treaty... and even surrendered to the Muslim League at the time of independence of the country.”
Echoing Nadda’s sentiments, BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi escalated the attack in a press conference, branding Gandhi as “Rahul Munir” and “Rahul Sharif” and claiming the Congress leader had gone further than even Pakistan’s top leadership in allegedly undermining India’s position.
The BJP’s counteroffensive came in response to increasing criticism from the Congress and other INDIA bloc parties over the Indian government’s handling of foreign affairs, the Pahalgam terror attack, and what they see as an opaque and manipulated narrative around Operation Sindoor.
On Wednesday night, Congress MP Jairam Ramesh took to social media to target the government’s global outreach initiative. Referring to the External Affairs Minister (EAM), Ramesh wrote: “Tomorrow, the unusually low-profile EAM is meeting with some MP delegations that have returned. Hope there will be an honest assessment of what was actually accomplished -- not what was spin doctored. There are reliable reports that the welcome in some countries was very lukewarm -- to put it mildly -- and that the political value of the people the MPs met was below par. Videos of the MPs engaging in silly fun and frolic while on a serious national mission have also been surfacing.”
Earlier the same day, Ramesh had criticised the government’s scheduling of the upcoming monsoon session of parliament, calling it a tactic to avoid convening a special session as demanded by the opposition. “Never before in India’s parliamentary history has a session been announced 47 days in advance”, he said. “Why was Operation Sindoor stopped suddenly after four days? Why did President Trump repeat 12 times in 20 days that the ceasefire happened because of him? These are the questions the prime minister does not want to answer.”
Union Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju had announced that the monsoon session will commence on July 21 and continue till August 12. It will be the first session since Operation Sindoor.
The demand for a special session was also amplified by Samajwadi Party MP Rajeev Rai, who was part of an all-party delegation sent by India that recently visited five countries -- Russia, Slovenia, Greece, Latvia and Spain. “PM should have called the special session by himself”, Rai told ANI. “In 1962, when the war against China was at its climax, first-time MP Atal Bihari Vajpayee had demanded a special session mid-war. Nehru ji had called the special session then... We followed the ‘rashtra dharma’, but the government should follow ‘raj dharma’.” Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday reiterated the opposition’s call for a special session to address key national concerns, including the Pahalgam attack.Adding fuel to the fire, Congress leader Pawan Khera alleged that India was isolated diplomatically following the operation. “In the Modi government, all policies within the country are being run by trolls, and the foreign policy abroad is being managed by a person who has surrendered”, he posted on social media. He claimed that India’s diplomatic standing had weakened, citing Kuwait’s move to lift visa restrictions on Pakistan and its subsequent agreement with Pakistan on labour issues. “That’s why they say -- ‘Name Narendra, work surrender’”, Khera wrote.

Pak delegation earns praise for diplomacy at UN,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318658-pak-delegation-earns-praise-for-diplomacy-at-un,"NEW YORK: The nine-member Pakistani delegation, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, has been praised for presenting a united and coherent stance on Pakistan’s foreign policy at the United Nations, with commendable cooperation among members, affiliated with various political parties including the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN), MQM, and others.
Former Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani and former Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua, known for their extensive diplomatic experience, provided valuable insights behind the scenes, quietly supporting the delegation’s strategy without making public statements.
Other prominent members of the delegation — Dr Musadik Malik, Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Sabzwari, and Hina Rabbani Khar — actively contributed to the delegation’s engagements at the UN and related meetings, displaying professionalism and unity. Hina Rabbani Khar was noted for her composed demeanour and attentiveness during proceedings.
While one female member’s more expressive style drew media attention, the overall seriousness and focus of the delegation remained intact. Senator Sherry Rehman stood out as an effective organiser, supporting Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in consultations and logistical planning. Diplomat Irfan Soomro, brother of the late Senator Ayaz Soomro, played a discreet but vital role in behind-the-scenes diplomacy.
Bilawal’s leadership was central in maintaining cohesion within the delegation, allowing each member to function as part of a coordinated, silent, and strong team.
The delegation’s engagements included high-level meetings with the UN Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly, diplomats from China, Russia, France, the United States, and members of the OIC Contact Group. These were arranged through the efforts of the Pakistan Mission to the UN, under the guidance of Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, who also earned praise for his diplomatic groundwork and logistical coordination.
Before concluding the visit, the delegation held an interaction with select members of the Pakistani community and addressed a press conference, where Bilawal briefed the media on the outcomes of the visit.A quiet and closed-door meeting between Bilawal and Pakistan’s outgoing UN Ambassador Munir Akram also took place, the details of which were not disclosed. When asked by reporters, Ambassador Akram smiled but remained tight-lipped on any sensitive discussions, particularly concerning ongoing conflicts.Despite recent criticism of the UN’s effectiveness, especially following its handling of the Gaza crisis, the visit by the Pakistani delegation was viewed as more successful and effective than expected, reaffirming the country’s continued commitment to multilateral diplomacy.

PM invites PTI’s Omar Ayub for consultation for appointing new ECP chief,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318659-pm-invites-pti-s-omar-ayub-for-consultation-for-appointing-new-ecp-chief,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited National Assembly’s Opposition Leader Omar Ayub for a meeting on consultations over the appointment of a new chief election commissioner (CEC).
In a letter addressed to the opposition leader, the PM pointed out that the term of CEC as well as two other members of the ECP ended on January 26 but they have been continuing their duties under Article 215 of the Constitution. Under Article 218, proposals for the CEC and members have to be sent to the parliamentary committee, the premier wrote.
It is pertinent to know that the five-year term of CEC Sikandar Sultan Raja ended on January 26, along with two other members of the Election Commission i.e., Nisar Ahmad Durrani (Sindh) and Shah Muhammad Jatoi (Balochistan).
The procedure for appointing the CEC and members of the Election Commission is explained in Article 213 of the Constitution, wherein the PM and the leader of the opposition send three names to the president by consensus.
The two other members of the electoral body have over two years to continue, as the term of the Election Commission Member (ECM) from Punjab Babar Hassan Bharwana will end on May 29, 2027, whereas the term of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa member Justice (retd) Ikramullah Khan will expire on May 31, 2027.
However, due to the deep political polarisation there had been no previous hint of contact between the prime minister and the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly to deliberate on new names.
The PTI has already moved the Islamabad High Court over the matter with Ayub and Senate Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz challenging the delay in appointing a new CEC in March earlier this year. The petition names the federal government, Senate chairman, National Assembly speaker, and ECP as respondents.

"Govt eyes 7,000 MW power sale to industry, agri at 7 cents amid IMF talks",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318660-govt-eyes-7-000-mw-power-sale-to-industry-agri-at-7-cents-amid-imf-talks,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will retain net metering for solar energy users but plans to introduce a more transparent net billing system, as part of sweeping energy reforms that include offering 7,000 megawatts of surplus electricity to agriculture and industry at competitive rates — a move currently under consultation with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “We are not discouraging solar adoption. This is about creating a balanced, transparent and sustainable framework that ensures fair returns for consumers while protecting grid stability and long-term energy planning,” Federal Minister for Energy Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari said on Wednesday dismissing speculation about scrapping solar net metering.
The government is currently sitting on a 7,000MW power surplus, which it intends to sell to the agriculture and industrial sectors at a flat rate of 7 to 7.5 cents per unit — without subsidies. Leghari confirmed that negotiations with the IMF have been underway for six months to secure approval for the plan. He said this while speaking at a consultation hosted by the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) here.
Leghari outlined sweeping reforms underway in the energy sector, noting the cancellation of 9,000MW worth of costly and redundant projects and the imposition of levies on captive power users, pushing them back onto the national grid and increasing demand.
“Our aim is to balance supply and demand and provide reliable power without distortionary subsidies,” Leghari said.
He also highlighted that cross-subsidies amounting to Rs174 billion have reduced electricity tariffs for industries by up to 31 percent since June 2024, spurring a rise in industrial energy consumption. Prices for various consumer categories have dropped between 14 percent and 18 percent.
Leghari defended the economics of rooftop solar, noting that most consumers break even within three years. “If a consumer is using 40 percent of the electricity themselves, the return on investment in three years is a robust business proposition,” he said.
The government is evaluating dynamic pricing mechanisms for energy buybacks to reflect real-time market conditions. While net metering will remain in place, Leghari said net billing offers a “more efficient and sustainable” approach to integrating distributed solar.
He reaffirmed that all reforms — including grid modernisation and incentives for off-grid solutions — are part of a broader strategic shift to build a smarter, more resilient power system.
“This is the time to transition Pakistan’s power sector to a smarter, more resilient model,” Leghari concluded.

BUDGET FY26: Nothing escapes the taxman — except the privileged,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318661-budget-fy26-nothing-escapes-the-taxman-except-the-privileged,"As we await another budget, we are dreading having to pay more in taxes next year and are trying to divine what new areas and activities the government will tax.
Budget figures, as they are in billions of rupees, can sometimes be hard for us to understand. To make them a little more tractable, we can think of the FBR tax revenues this year not as Rs12,000 billion but as Rs50,000 paid by every Pakistani. This includes infants, kids, the elderly, those below the poverty line, overseas Pakistanis, etc. In short, everyone -- and for those who cannot or will not pay, the rest of us will pick up the tab.
We pay taxes whenever we buy a bar of soap, a box of juice, a ballpoint pen, or eat at a restaurant. We pay taxes every time we fly or take a bus. We pay taxes every time we go to work on a motorcycle or withdraw cash from a bank. In short, our governments tax almost every activity of life.
Of the Rs50,000 you paid to the federal government this year, Rs30,000 (60 per cent) was given to the provinces. The federal government retained Rs20,000. Next year, your tax bill will  increase to Rs57,500 (including on the 50 lakh newborn babies who became Pakistanis this year). We start taxing them early, including on infant formula and diapers.
In addition, the federal government also charged a petroleum levy of Rs4000 from every Pakistani, which is likely to increase to Rs5000 per person in the coming year. Plus, the federal government got non-tax revenues (passport fees, OGDC dividends, SBP profits etc) of Rs10,000 per person. So the federal government had about Rs34,000 per person at its disposal, but it still ran a deficit of Rs27,000 per person or Rs6500 billion (5.55 per cent of GDP). This made each Pakistani indebted by an additional Rs27,000 for a total of Rs300,000.
You would think that if the federal government runs such high deficits, it would cut its own expenditures or give less money to the provinces. You would be wrong. The government neither reduces its own expenditures nor cuts provincial payouts.
The method of choice for the federal government is to borrow the money (both rupees and dollars) to finance the deficits (both fiscal and current account). This is where the IMF comes into the picture. When everyone refuses to lend us more dollars, we go to the IMF to borrow as a lender-of-last resort. The IMF insists that we cannot borrow without limit, and we should tax the people to meet more than our current needs, and just borrow to repay interest on the debt.
This then brings into focus the government’s choice to either cut unnecessary expenses or raise taxes. However, the government refuses to cut expenditures, especially those that politically or otherwise benefit its MNAs and MPAs. It’s preferred option is to increase taxes. Here too, the government has a choice: expand the net and tax the privileged elite not in the tax net, or tax middle-class Pakistanis already in the net. Our governments typically choose the latter and I think they will do so again.
But as a country we need not go that route. With a belligerent and defeated India threatening to attack us, we need to increase our defence expenditures, perhaps by Rs600 billion. Similarly, I think we need to work on alleviating poverty and illiteracy, and therefore, an additional Rs500 billion should be earmarked for BISP payments to the poor.
The salaried class, which pays Rs500 billion in taxes, should be given a 40% relief on their taxes. All of this is possible if the federal and provincial governments agree to reduce their ‘development’ expenditures by Rs1300 billion. This is easy enough to do if public interest is the goal. But is it? Like most years, the FBR will again not meet its revenue target. This means that next year, the Shehbaz Sharif government will again raise your taxes. I hear they have decided to come up with fancy names for new taxes. For instance, the petroleum levy which is now Rs78 per litre will be increased to Rs100 per litre during the year. And an additional levy of Rs5 will henceforth be called ‘carbon levy’ to make us feel good about the environment.
So, given the levy and carbon levy and customs duty, a motorcyclist will pay Rs120 in government taxes per litre. Given that he typically consumes a litre a day, the owner of a Rs75,000 bike will pay our government Rs3600 in taxes per month. But interestingly, our government hasn’t been able to collect this much tax from retail shops worth crores. It’s just that taxing the unorganised, salaried, middle-class, and middle classes is easier than taxing your vote bank or financier.
For instance, on top of 18 per cent sales tax, 4.0 per cent additional sales tax and 2.5 per cent income tax on the sales of juices or ice cream, etc, the government is now thinking of imposing a ‘health tax’ on products containing sugar. This is supposed to make us feel healthy. Of course, only the politically naive will ask that if sugar is bad for us and needs to be taxed in various products, why not just tax sugar mills directly? Wouldn’t directly taxing be easier? It will ensure that products containing more sugar pay more and those containing less pay less.
The thing is: all Pakistanis are equal, but shop owners, sugar mill owners and large property owners seem to be more equal than the salaried classes and motorcycle owners.
But if Pakistan is to develop and leave poverty and illiteracy behind, it will have to treat all Pakistanis equally.

Total national uplift outlay of Rs4.224tr approved,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318662-total-national-uplift-outlay-of-rs4-224tr-approved,"ISLAMABAD: The National Economic Council (NEC) under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Wednesday approved the national development outlay of Rs4.224 trillion (Rs4,224 billion), including federal Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) of Rs1,000 billion for the next budget.
The real GDP growth has been envisaged at 4.2 per cent of GDP and CPI-based inflation at 7.5 per cent for FY2025-26.
PM Shehbaz Sharif chaired the NEC meeting, where he declared Pakistan’s victory in the recent ‘Battle of Truth’ on May 10, attributing the historic victory to professional competence and bravery of Pakistan’s armed forces.
“India’s threats to deprive Pakistan of its water resources are unacceptable. Following our victory in the ‘Battle of Truth’, we will also, God willing, defeat India in the struggle to safeguard our waters,” said PM Shehbaz. He announced a special consultative meeting with all provincial chief ministers to formulate a robust strategy for protecting Pakistan’s water resources.
The premier further asserted that economic stability in the country had become possible due to joint efforts of the Federation and provinces, noting that Pakistan was now on the path to economic growth.
In line with this economic trajectory, the NEC unanimously approved its six-point agenda, including the Annual Development Plan (ADP) for fiscal year 2025-26, with a total outlay of Rs4,224 billion. Of this, Rs1,000 billion will be allocated to federal development programmes and Rs2,869 billion to provincial development projects.
The meeting was briefed that the national development programme for 2024-25 was being executed with a total spending of Rs3,483 billion, comprising Rs1,100 billion from the federal government and Rs2,383 billion from the provinces.
The revised economic estimates were also shared, including approval of GDP growth targets: 2.7pc for the current fiscal year and 4.2pc for the next fiscal year. It was reported that from July 2024 to April 2025, remittances increased by 30.9pc, and for the first time, the current account balance turned positive.
The fiscal deficit for FY2024-25 was curtailed to 2.6pc of GDP, while the primary balance stood at a surplus of 3pc. Policy interest rates had dropped to 11pc, and credit to the private sector rose to Rs681 billion during July 2024 to May 2025.
The size of Pakistan’s GDP for 2024-25 was projected to reach Rs114 trillion, equivalent to $411 billion.
The NEC also approved the 13th Five-Year Plan (2024-2029) and the Uraan Pakistan Framework, declaring both to be mutually aligned. Third-party monitoring reports on ongoing development projects were also presented, with the council deciding to incorporate their recommendations in future planning.
The prime minister emphasized prioritising health, education, infrastructure, water sector and housing in upcoming development initiatives. He appreciated the consensus shown in the meeting, stating that such unity on national matters was vital for Pakistan’s bright future.

Bilawal hails US leadership’s efforts for peace building,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318663-bilawal-hails-us-leadership-s-efforts-for-peace-building,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples (PPP) Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, in an interview to AFP, has praised the US leadership efforts in contributing to ceasefire initiatives and peace-building in conflict zones. He acknowledged the positive role Washington continues to play in supporting diplomatic efforts globally.
A high-level parliamentary delegation from Pakistan, led by the former foreign minister, has commenced an official visit to Washington, D.C. The delegation held several important meetings with key American stakeholders.
Bilawal also gave interviews to prominent US media outlets, including CBS and Bloomberg, where he articulated Pakistan’s perspective on sustainable peace and regional stability.
In his conversation with CBS, he shed light on the objectives of the visit and elaborated on Pakistan’s stance regarding long-term peace in South Asia and beyond. He emphasized the need for greater international cooperation in conflict resolution and regional development.
As part of the delegation’s scheduled engagements, the PPP chairman is expected to meet with co-chairs and members of the Pakistan Caucus in the US Congress. He will also hold discussions with several American senators and congressional representatives.
In addition, Bilawal is set to present Pakistan’s viewpoint at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), one of Washington’s leading think tanks.
The delegation will also engage with prominent leaders from the Pakistani-American community during the visit.
PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman, in a statement on social medial platform “X”, stated: “Kicking off today’s engagements in Washington DC by meeting with Senator Slotkin along with Senator Musaddiq, Tehmina Janjua.
“Excellent conversation about Pakistan’s search for stability and sustainable peace in South Asia, about the Indus Waters Treaty, Kashmir and the need to build mechanisms to combat terrorism where unprovoked and entirely unproven allegations pass for war triggers. We thanked the US for mediating a ceasefire in one of the most dangerous conflicts of the world.” She stated that India now seeks to impose an irresponsible new abnormal on the area and wants no dialogue to ramp down the heat. Sherry said Pakistan does not want war but will obviously respond if provoked. “The world should worry as one state wants perpetual war while the other wants permanent peace. Important to unfog the smoke and mirrors generated by India.”

Disqualification reference: ECP gives Omar Ayub time till July 1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318665-disqualification-reference-ecp-gives-omar-ayub-time-till-july-1,"ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Wednesday began hearing the disqualification reference against Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan and granted him time on his request for preparation and hiring a lawyer.
The full ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, heard the matter while Omar Ayub went to the rostrum and citing his official engagements, sought time and urged for taking up the reference late in June or in July.
His opponent in the 2024 elections, Babar Nawaz, had filed a reference against Omar Ayub and on the basis of the material he submitted to the NA speaker, a reference was forwarded to the ECP a few days back.
“I have yet to appoint a lawyer. The budget session is starting and I am a member of the finance committee, where the budget meeting takes two weeks. Give me time to hold the budget session and appoint a lawyer. The hearing be held now in the month of July,” he requested the forum.
Member of the Election Commission from Sindh Nisar Ahmad Durrani said there was a 90-day time limit on the speaker reference. Later, the ECP accepted Omar Ayub’s request and adjourned the hearing until July 1.
During the hearing of another case, filed by Babar Nawaz under Sections 8, 9 and 95 of the Elections Act, 2017, Omar Ayub’s lawyer also sought time to submit the reply and arguments, on which the Election Commission adjourned the hearing till June 24. Talking to the media after the hearing, Omar Ayub said the National Assembly speaker did not consult him regarding the reference prior to forwarding it to the ECP. He recalled that in the 2018 election, he had defeated his opponent by 40,000 votes while there was no local body election held in 2023.
“My opponent also went to the Abbottabad High Court and his position was rejected. The speaker sent this reference to the Election Commission on the basis of some pressure or ill will,” he charged. He claimed that the basis of the case against him was weak and that there was nothing in the case, whereas there are countless cases against him in the anti-terrorism court at the moment. “All these cases are a pre-planned programme. We stand firmly with the founder PTI and his ideology,” he added.
Meanwhile, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan has written to Speaker Ayaz Sadiq seeking “clarity, transparency and legal justification” regarding a disqualification reference against him forwarded by the speaker to the Election Commission of Pakistan. According to the letter to the Speaker, Omar Ayub has requested for “provision of legal basis, attested copy and record of proceedings pertaining to the reference forwarded to the ECP”. Omar Ayub claimed that the Speaker Ayaz Sadiq has not applied his mind as required by law before sending the reference to the ECP. Sending a reference based on issues that have been repeatedly rejected by ROs and the high court since the last seven years proves the mala fide intent of the speaker and the government. He vowed as a worker of the PTI and Imran Khan, he would continue to speak the truth and face all cases initiated against him.

"Pakistan, US discuss bitcoin integration into financial frameworks",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318666-pakistan-us-discuss-bitcoin-integration-into-financial-frameworks,"WASHINGTON: Pakistan and the US have discussed strategies on digital assets and explored the integration of Bitcoin into broader financial frameworks.
Pakistan’s Minister of State for Crypto and Blockchain Bilal Bin Saqib met with Robert ‘Bo’ Hines, the executive director of US President Donald Trump’s Council on Digital Assets at the White House. Hines, appointed by Trump in January 2025, is pivotal in shaping national policies on digital asset innovation and regulation, collaborating with Council Chair David Sacks to position the US as a leader in cryptocurrency initiatives.
During the meeting, both Saqib and Hines expressed a mutual interest in fostering collaboration between the US and Pakistan on digital asset innovation, regulatory coherence and emerging financial technologies. They also explored avenues to support innovation ecosystems aimed at empowering youth and accelerating economic inclusion through blockchain technology. Fur thermore, Saqib also held a separate meeting with the White House Counsel’s Office.
This high-profile discussion comes on the heels of Pakistan’s announcement of its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve (SBR) at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas. The meeting also marks a significant step for the country as it becomes one of the first Asian nations to adopt Bitcoin within its sovereign asset strategy, signaling a new era for digital finance in the region. “I envision Pakistan to be a leader in the Global South for Digital Assets,” stated Saqib. “From launching our Strategic Bitcoin Reserve to unlocking national infrastructure for crypto mining and AI data zones, Pakistan is building a real framework for digital asset adoption and economic modernisation.”
Pakistan’s ambitious digital asset strategy includes a plan to allocate 2,000MW to power Bitcoin mining and AI-driven data zones. This initiative aims to convert surplus energy into economic growth, create new jobs and bolster digital infrastructure within the country.

TI Pak report suggests key structural reforms,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318668-ti-pak-report-suggests-key-structural-reforms,"ISLAMABAD: Transparency International (TI) Pakistan has submitted a comprehensive 67-page Civil Society Governance Diagnostic Assessment (GDA) Report 2025 to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Government of Pakistan, evaluating the country’s governance and anti-corruption landscape while proposing reforms crucial for economic growth. The report presents wide-ranging recommendations to address structural weaknesses in fiscal governance, public sector accountability and economic regulation. Key proposals include the removal of ‘tax shelters’ for agriculture sector and introducing same tax bars for all taxpayers, empowering parliamentary standing committees in the budget vetting process, empowering Senate to scrutinise and vote on money bills, introduction of “right to first purchase” rule to address grey areas in real estate sector, decentralisation of all federal agencies affected by 18th Amendment, restructuring BISP, introducing oversight mechanism for NAB and other anti-corruption agencies, optimising the governance of state-owned enterprises, breaking the cycle of undocumented economy, adopting Whistleblower Protection Legislation, enacting comprehensive Conflict of Interest (COI) Regulations for Public Officials and promoting transparency through Right to Information.
The report is prepared by Dr Kaiser Bengali, Kashif Ali, Shamail Adnan Khan and Ms Raima Mehmood.
According to the report, Pakistan is currently engaged with the IMF through a 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth $7 billion. This programme is designed to support structural reforms aimed at restoring macroeconomic stability, addressing fiscal and external imbalances, and ensuring long-term economic sustainability. Core priorities under the EFF include fiscal adjustment, improving debt dynamics, achieving exchange rate flexibility, expanding the tax base and reforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs). These reforms are essential for avoiding a cycle of repeated bailouts and placing the economy on a more resilient footing.
The report, it is said, provides an independent, evidence-based contribution grounded in the realities of Pakistan’s governance challenges to the federal and provincial governments, as well as contributes to the ongoing governance and anti-corruption diagnostic assessment being undertaken by the IMF at the request of the Government of Pakistan.
“This report is the result of extensive national consultations, key informant interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders from civil society, academia, the private sector, and legal and financial experts. It explores structural impediments to reform, exposes institutional gaps and offers practical recommendations to improve fiscal governance, financial transparency, public sector efficiency and rule of law.”
The recommendations of the report include:
- Strengthen the role of parliament in budget process by empowering parliamentary standing committees in the budget vetting process.
- Extend the power of Senate to scrutinise and vote on money bills to enhance provincial say in the allocation of national resources.
- Remove the undue advantage of ‘tax shelters’ from agriculture sector and ensure that all sectors face the same tax bars.

- Upload summaries of all Letters of Credit (L/C), specifying the product(s) and f.o.b. price, on dedicated Customs Department website to enable a 3rd party to bid for the same at a higher price to address under-invoicing in imports.
- The divisions, and associated departments, autonomous and semi-autonomous agencies, related to subjects that have been devolved to the provinces vide 18th Constitutional Amendment must be decentralised.

"Gas sector circular debt soars to Rs2,800bn, worries govt functionaries",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318669-gas-sector-circular-debt-soars-to-rs2-800bn-worries-govt-functionaries,"ISLAMABAD: The monster of circular debt in the gas sector that soared to Rs2,800 billion has attracted the attention of the top decision-makers to resolve this chronic issue.
The government to this effect has hired KPMG -- a well-known reputed audit firm with the mandate to make a doable, and acceptable to IMF, circular debt management plan (CDMP) to get rid of this menace once and for all.
The overall energy sector circular debt stands at Rs5 trillion (Rs2.8 trillion in the gas sector and Rs2.3 trillion in the power sector).
Officials privy to the development said that out of Rs2,800 billion gas sector circular debt, Rs800 billion has been added in the head of Late Payment Surcharge (LPS). “We have hired KPMG to make the CDPM upon which the government would act and erase this problem.” The Sui gas companies -- Sui Northern and Sui Southern are also facing a shortfall of Rs1,300 billion mainly because of no hike in gas tariff during the 2013-2020 period. The LNG diversion cost to the domestic sector is now also causing an increase in circular debt.
After the imposition of off-the-grid levy on Rs3,500 per MMBtu gas rate for the export sector, the actual gas price for the export-oriented industry has increased to Rs4,291 per MMBtu which is equal to $15.38 per MMBtu. So the export sector has reduced the use of the gas by 50 percent in the north and 25 percent in the south of the country, resulting in more diversion of this costly gas to the domestic sector owing to which the gas sector circular debt will increase manifold.
As far as circular debt in the power sector is concerned, the government has managed to make a deal with 18 commercial banks for a loan of Rs1,275 billion. Under the deal struck with Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA), the state-owned entity, banks would provide fresh loan of Rs617 billion at 10.50-11 percent mark-up rate based on KIBOR-0.2, which will be paid in 6 years’ time by electricity consumers through Debt Service Surgery (DSS). The consumers will pay Rs3.23 per unit in the bills as DSS.
The commercial banks would deduct the DSS amount at source at the time of paying the electricity bills by consumers. “At source deduction on paying bills will improve the risk profile of the banks.”

"Pakistan sees exodus of 200,000 Afghans since crackdown began",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318670-pakistan-sees-exodus-of-200-000-afghans-since-crackdown-began,"ISLAMABAD: More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since the government renewed a deportation drive in April, with Iran also stepping up expulsions of Afghans.
Generations of Afghans have fled to neighbouring Pakistan and Iran during decades of successive wars, seeking safety and better economic opportunities.
Both governments have grown weary of large migrant populations and ordered millions to leave under the threat of arrest.
Pakistan has launched a strict campaign to evict more than 800,000 Afghans who have had their residence permits cancelled, including some who were born in the country or lived there for decades.
According to the interior ministry, more than 135,000 Afghans left Pakistan in April, while around 67,000 departed in May and more than 3,000 were sent back in the first two days of June.
The UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) on Tuesday voiced concern over a surge in Afghan families being deported from Iran, recording 15,675 crossing in May, a more than two-fold increase from the previous month. Iranian officials have ordered Afghans without documentation to leave by July 6.
Nader Yarahmadi, from the Iranian interior ministry, said on state television that it would affect around four million of the more than six million Afghans who Iran says are in the country.
The IOM said the influx across both borders threatens to strain Afghanistan’s already “fragile reception and reintegration systems”.
It again called for “all countries to immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans, regardless of their immigration status, until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place”.
Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Taliban government in 2021.
A campaign to evict them began in 2023, prompting hundreds of thousands to cross the border in a matter of weeks, fearing harassment or arrest. In total, more than one million Afghans have left Pakistan.

Sindh utilises only 4.47% of federal development grant,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318640-sindh-utilises-only-4-47pc-of-federal-development-grant,"KARACHI: Only 4.47 percent of the federal grant could be utilized out of total allocated fund for development projects in the province during the current fiscal year.
According to a detailed report released by the provincial Finance Department, out of the Rs384 billion earmarked by the federal government for 22 development projects across the province, only Rs18.23 billion could be spent in Sindh so far.
Under the Annual Development Programme (ADP), Rs49.62 billion were allocated during the fiscal year 2024-25. The federal government had transferred Rs334 billion at the beginning of the fiscal year on July 1, 2024, for 22 development projects of the province.
Initially, Rs76.97 billion were allocated for Sindh’s share, which was later revised upwards to Rs81.33 billion following a mid-year review. The federal government released Rs34.24 billion, of which Rs33.24 billion were disbursed to the province.
Despite the substantial funding, the provincial departments have managed to spend only Rs18.23 billion to date, raising serious questions about administrative capacity and project execution. Sources of he Sindh Government told that the Chief Minister Sindh is reported to have expressed strong displeasure over the dismal utilisation rate, directing concerned departments to expedite work on federally funded projects and avoid further delays before the close of the fiscal year.

"Tanweer Ahmed donor of NAMAL, SKMCH, NUST, but not linked to any party",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318641-tanweer-ahmed-donor-of-namal-skmch-nust-but-not-linked-to-any-party,"LONDON: American-Pakistani businessman tycoon Tanweer Ahmed has been in headlines this week after GEO News revealed that he held multiple secret meetings with former premier Imran Khan in Adiala Jail in October last year to find grounds for a breakthrough.
This correspondent had revealed in a report for The News and Geo on 14 April 2025, without naming anyone, that an American-Pakistan tycoon held several rounds of talks with Khan in jail till the talks broke down. On Monday, Tanweer Ahmed confirmed to Geo News in an interview that it was him who had met Khan multiple times.
Since his interview was aired on GEO News, the businessman has been in the eye of a storm on social media and Pakistani TV talk shows. Several allegations have been made against him, including that he has been a supporter of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf ( PTI). Sources have confirmed that Tanweer Ahmed has taken part in several high-profile lobbying efforts related to Pakistan and America but he has not supported any Pakistani political party in any kind; he has not supported PTI, PPP, PMLN or another party and has worked with the various Pakistani administrations to improve Pakistan relations with the United States.
Imran Khan’s sister made the air clear on Wednesday when she confirmed that Tanweer Ahmed had actually met Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. Speaking to GEO reporter Shabir Dar outside Adiala Jail after meeting Imran Khan, Aleema Khan revealed that Tanweer Ahmed was a major donor to NAMAL University. He has also given large donations to Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital (SKMCH) but not to the PTI. Aleema Khan also mentioned that Tanweer Ahmed has given nearly $10 million donation to Islamabad’s National University of Science & Technology (NUST).
Aleema Khan was referring to the donation for which Field Marshal Asim Munir last year thanked Tanweer Ahmed saying: “Pakistan is proud of heroes like you.”
This happened after NUST confirmed that Tanweer Ahmed has entered into a partnership with the university through an Endowment Fund for unprivileged students which will benefit nearly 200 students who would be able to get scholarships every year. The $9 million donation is one of the single largest donations by any overseas Pakistani to any Pakistani university.
The army chief told Mr Ahmed: “Your support to NUST in establishing the Science and Technology Park, expansion of campuses and partnership for assisting financially challenged students are praiseworthy initiatives, meeting due recognition. Indeed, through this venture not only will NUST gain further strength but will also enable many students to bear their expenditures. Your efforts in the domains of humanitarian assistance and interest in academia of Pakistan is a true reflection and favour for the people of Pakistan.” Tanweer Ahmed is an American-Pakistani businessman, investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist who works with major companies, not-for-profit organizations and hospitals. He is the owner of the largest cricket complex in Houston, the Prairie View Cricket Complex and the owner of the Houston Hurricanes cricket franchise. The multi-millionaire businessman is the founder of a brand of food chains and also owns many food chain franchises like Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC. He owns California’s largest transport company and has business interests in the energy sector and medicine industry. Tanweer Ahmed is credited for taking over 50 million dollars in aid to Pakistan during the 2022 devastating floods in Pakistan.
Tanweer Ahmed started on a humble note in the US when he migrated from Sialkot as a student and settled in San Francisco. He started his food business which grew from one store to 153 stores in Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, and Texas with over 5,000 employees – making him one of the largest fast-food franchise owners in America. Simultaneously, Ahmed set up insurance companies and also invested in energy production businesses in Texas, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Illinois. It was in 2018 when he announced plans to construct the largest cricket complex in the U.S. He acquired 86 acres of land, not very far from the main Houston city area.

Punjab Police tighten sexual crime probes with new procedure,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318642-punjab-police-tighten-sexual-crime-probes-with-new-procedure,"LAHORE: The Punjab Police in its efforts of strengthening the investigation of sexual offences, has formulated a formal procedure for accessing the “National Sex Offenders Register” (SOR) maintained by the National Police Bureau (NPB) in Islamabad.
According to documents, a directive issued by the Punjab additional inspector general (investigation) has outlined specific steps to retrieve the criminal history of suspects involved in sexual crimes. The directive has been dispatched to all capital city police officers (CCPOs), regional police officers (RPOs), city police officers (CPOs) and district police officers (DPOs) across the province.
The SOR has been operational at the NPB since January 2024 and holds nationwide data on convicted sex offenders, including their criminal histories, biometric forensic records, and last known addresses.
This centralised database is expected to significantly enhance the investigation and prosecution of sexual harassment and assault cases by helping law enforcement officials identify repeat offenders and gather background intelligence swiftly.
Under the guidelines set forth in compliance with the National Sex Offenders Register Rules, 2023, and the SOPs issued on August 22, 2024, investigating officers (IOs) are now required to formally request the prior records of named suspects in sexual crime FIRs—those falling under the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021. The request must include a copy of the FIR and a completed application form (Annexure A), which will be submitted to the District Public Prosecutor (DPP). A copy must also be sent to the DPO concerned.
The protocol strictly prohibits the seeking of criminal records for individuals unrelated to the case under investigation. Upon receipt, the DPP is tasked with verifying the documents and ensuring the relevance of the request.
If the application is deemed satisfactory, the DPP must forward it to the NPB within 48 hours.
If documentation is incomplete or the rationale is unsubstantiated, the DPP is directed to return the request and seek clarification from the investigating officer.
Once approved, the NPB will transmit the requested information back to the DPP, who will then forward it to the investigating officer, accompanied by a clear advisory stating that the data is to be used exclusively for investigative purposes. Unauthorised use or disclosure of the information will lead to disciplinary action under the relevant departmental rules.
The applicable legal provisions under which data can be requested include Sections 375, 375A, 376, 377, 377A, 377B, 371A, 371B, 292A, 292B, 292C of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), along with Sections 21 and 22 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016.
Legal experts have welcomed the initiative. Advocate Syed Hasan Raza Shah, a criminal law specialist at the Lahore High Court, termed the digitisation of sex offenders’ data a crucial development in combating crime.
“Creating a computerised archive of mentally unstable individuals and serial offenders involved in violent sexual assaults, particularly against women, has become imperative in light of the alarming increase in such cases,” he said.
Raza further noted that Punjab Police had already taken progressive steps by assigning female officers to handle cases of sexual violence, acknowledging the discomfort and hesitancy many victims experience when required to recount traumatic details to male investigators.
This measure, he argued, has helped build a more empathetic and responsive policing environment for victims.
Sources within the police department also indicated that in cases involving serial sex offenders, psychological evaluations will be conducted using the services of mental health professionals to assess the mental condition of the accused.
These steps aim to reinforce the investigative capacity of the police while ensuring due process and adherence to ethical standards.
The establishment of this procedure reflects a broader institutional shift toward evidence-based policing and the use of digital databases to combat recurring criminal threats, with particular emphasis on crimes that leave lasting psychological trauma on victims and communities.

India can’t disown Indus Waters Treaty: Mushahid,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318643-india-can-t-disown-indus-waters-treaty-mushahid,"ISLAMABAD: Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed said on Wednesday that India “cannot abrogate or disown” the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), asserting that “law is on our side, justice is on our side, and geography is on our side.”
Speaking at a seminar held at COMSTECH Auditorium in Islamabad, the veteran lawmaker warned that India’s attempt to unilaterally suspend the treaty was both legally untenable and diplomatically dangerous.
Citing recent global reactions, Mushahid said Pakistan’s military response to Indian aggression had earned recognition in both Russia and China, reflecting growing global disdain for bullying behaviour. “Might is not right. In fact, right is might,” he said, adding that the weaponisation of water was “a crime against humanity” and a reckless blow to regional diplomacy.
The seminar, titled “Water Crisis and the Indus Waters Treaty”, was jointly organised by OIC-COMSTECH, the Karachi Council on Foreign Relations (KCFR), Hisaar Foundation, and the Panjwani-Hisaar Water Institute (PHWI). It brought together prominent voices from diplomacy, law, environment, and national security to explore the implications of India’s decision to walk away from the 65-year-old water-sharing accord.
In her opening remarks, KCFR Chairperson Nadira Panjwani traced the treaty’s historical relevance, warning that its suspension could destabilise the region. “It’s not just a bilateral issue—it’s a global precedent,” she cautioned.
Zohair Ashir, a member of both the Hisaar Foundation’s Board and the Executive Board of PHWI, said the seminar was crucial at a time of heightened tensions between two nuclear-armed states. “Pakistan must prepare a calculated, strategic response,” he said.
Simi Kamal, water policy expert and co-founder of PHWI, provided a technical analysis of the treaty and the river systems, emphasising the need for an integrated and evidence-based water management framework. She pointed to increasing upstream interventions and climate variability as urgent factors Pakistan must confront.
Environmental lawyer Rafay Alam examined the legal landscape, stressing that Pakistan’s rights under the Indus Waters Treaty remain protected under international law. He suggested that Pakistan could pursue action through the International Court of Justice and other legal forums if India proceeds unilaterally.
Climate expert Ali Tauqeer Sheikh said that the risks of climate change, when combined with treaty violations, posed an existential threat to Pakistan’s water security. He called for a “comprehensive national water strategy” that aligns with climate resilience planning.
Defence analyst Ikram Sehgal warned that India’s posture on water was part of a broader pattern of regional hostility. “If diplomacy fails, water may very well become the next battlefield,” he cautioned.
In his concluding address, Dr Iqbal Choudhry, Coordinator General of OIC-COMSTECH, emphasized the need for Pakistan to exhaust all diplomatic, legal, and multilateral avenues to defend its water interests. “This is a matter of survival, sovereignty, and strategic foresight,” he said.
The seminar ended with a unanimous call for Pakistan to maintain its legal and moral high ground, strengthen institutional coordination, and prepare for an intensified global campaign to safeguard its water rights.

IHC gives deadline for comments in Peca case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318644-ihc-gives-deadline-for-comments-in-peca-case,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday has given a deadline to the respondents for comments against the petitions challenging amendments to the Peca Act.
The court served notices on the Ministry of Law and Justice to file their responses.
Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas heard the petitions of Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), anchors association and Islamabad High Court Journalists Association (IHCJA) together.
Advocate Imran Shafiq and other lawyers appeared in the court on behalf of the petitioners.
Justice Inaam remarked that even if the response is not filed, the hearing will still be continued. “I think this case will take a long time. It will be scheduled after Eid.”
Advocate Imran Shafiq said that the federal government has filed its response only through the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Information. “The Ministry of Law and Justice, Parliamentary Affairs and PTA have not submitted any response.”
The federal government has raised a question on the jurisdiction of this court.
The lawyer argued that the federation has stated that after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, only the Constitutional Bench of the High Court can hear this case.
Until the Constitutional Bench of the High Court is formed, only this court can hear the case.
The second objection was raised while giving a reference of a Quranic verse that before spreading the words, do research.
The lawyer said that FIRs are being registered against people, adding that the court should hear this case soon.
The court asked whether there is no news going on? “Is someone preventing news from being given or published,” it questioned.
Advocate Riasat Ali Azad prayed the court issue a stay order that there will be no FIR or arrest against the journalist for reporting the news.
“The parties are not submitting a response and are taking time from the court,” he said.
Journalist Mazhar Abbas said that an atmosphere of harassment has been created in the media industry, adding that journalists are being summoned and harassed by the FIA.
Justice Inaam asked the lawyer if he was not able to report any news at all? The lawyer said that the parties should be directed to file their replies and provide a copy of the replies to the petitioners in advance before the next hearing.
The court adjourned the hearing till the second week of July, giving the parties a deadline to submit their replies.

Assistant commissioner abducted in Kech,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318646-assistant-commissioner-abducted-in-kech,"QUETTA: Unidentified armed men abducted Tump Assistant Commissioner Mohammad Hanif Noorzai from Balochistan’s Kech district on Wednesday morning, officials confirmed.
Kech Deputy Commissioner Major (retd) Bashir Ahmed told the media that AC Noorzai was kidnapped while traveling from Tump to Quetta during the Eid holidays. Noorzai was posted in Tump, a tehsil bordering Iran, and had been serving there for the past one and a half years.
According to the Kech DC, the assistant commissioner was traveling with his wife, a security guard and his driver when some armed men intercepted their vehicle in the Tigranabad area. The attackers forcibly removed the passengers except Noorzai, whom they dragged away in front of his wife. The assailants also searched her handbag before fleeing the scene.
“This act of dragging the assistant commissioner away in front of his wife and treating him disrespectfully is a violation of Baloch cultural and social values,” said the DC during a press conference in Turbat, the district headquarters.
He emphasised that Noorzai was not involved in any security operation and had merely been fulfilling his administrative duties in Tump. “All efforts are underway to ensure his safe recovery. We are also reaching out to tribal elders for assistance in the matter,” he added.
According to the Levies, the site of the abduction is located approximately 40 kilometers from Turbat. Following the incident, the district administration, police, Levies, Frontier Corps (FC) and other security agencies rushed to the scene with heavy contingents and cordoned off the area to begin a search operation.

"Aleema says Imran being pressured to accept govt, stay silent",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318647-aleema-says-imran-being-pressured-to-accept-govt-stay-silent,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan is being pressured to stop speaking up for the people, accept the current government, and apologise for the events of May 9, his sister Aleema Khan claimed on Wednesday.
Speaking to the media outside the Anti-Terrorism Court in Rawalpindi, she said negotiations are only meaningful when based on “give and take,” asserting that Imran Khan stands for the rule of law, the supremacy of the Constitution, and democratic freedoms.
“To be clear, the establishment is saying: ‘Do not raise your voice for the people. Forget your demands and stay silent. Accept this government with a stolen mandate,’” she alleged.
She also criticised the recent 26th Constitutional Amendment, saying it was introduced by a government lacking legitimate public support.
Aleema stated that she had appeared in court to seek bail. “My crime is conveying a message Imran Khan gave me in jail to the media. An FIR was filed against me for ‘spreading chaos’. But what chaos did I spread? I only shared what he had already said in open court,” she argued.
Responding to a question about ongoing political developments, she said that whenever Imran Khan calls for a protest, “good news” about his possible release begins to circulate. “Everyone now understands that as soon as a protest is announced, reports of his release start spreading,” she said.
On the proposed protest movement, Aleema said the real question is not how Imran Khan will lead it from jail. “He has said Omar Ayub will be his voice and Salman Akram Raja will implement his directives within the party,” she noted.
“Imran Khan keeps changing the fielding — that is his success,” she added.
Separately, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram Wednesday rejected the results of recent by-poll in Sambrial, alleging the electoral process was rigged. “We do not believe in the elections held in Sambrial. The candidate who was there before, had taken 58,000 votes on Form 47 and at that time, the turnout in the election was also very high. Despite the low turnout in the by-election, the votes received by their candidate were 78,000; we reject the results of this election, the turnout was very low, the PMLN supporters did not turn out at all,” he noted.
He said, “The PMLN camps were empty; it was all fraud; we do not believe in it.” He told a news conference here along with PTI Punjab leader Aliya Hamza that the police took out the polling agents of his party, whereas the police are not allowed to obstruct the elections.
Waqas charged that the fascism and ‘hooliganism’ that the Punjab government committed was unprecedented while during the by-election, the PTI protested peacefully against rigging in the constituency of Punjab.
This, he emphasised, was not an election because elections are a transparent process, but here voting was rigged and ballot boxes were stuffed; no laid down procedure was followed in the election. He claimed that where there were 1300 registered votes, 1400 votes were cast and hence this was not an election but a made-up drama.

Rabbani terms Musharraf’s indictment of Dr AQ Khan a shame,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318650-rabbani-terms-musharraf-s-indictment-of-dr-aq-khan-a-shame,"ISLAMABAD: Former Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani said that the indictment of Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan by the Musharraf government is a shame and demanded that the government should withdraw its previous position and the status of Dr Abdul Qadeer should be restored.
“It is strange how the architect of the nuclear programme was murdered through the judiciary under an international conspiracy and how the person who originally created it was shamed by a dictator at the behest of the international community,” he said on Wednesday.
Rabbani emphasised that history should not be distorted, as it plays a crucial role in building a nation. He stated that it is a fact that Pakistan’s nuclear programme was conceived and executed under the vision of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, who viewed it as a means of deterrence. He said it was through his clandestine diplomacy and work that the framework of the nuclear program came into being. The former Chairman Senate said that it was Bhutto’s efforts that put together the team headed by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan.
Raza Rabbani stated that Pakistan’s missile program was established and developed during Shaheed Benazir Bhutto’s tenure. “This is recorded history,” he affirmed.

Balochistan Assembly passes ATA amended draft,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318651-balochistan-assembly-passes-ata-amended-draft,"QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly has passed the amended draft of the Anti-Terrorism Act Balochistan and Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has said the issue of missing persons will be resolved through legal means.
Opposition member Kulsoom Niaz walked out of the Assembly after being denied the opportunity to speak. The Balochistan Assembly session on Wednesday began with a 30-minute delay under the chairmanship of Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai. Sadiq Sanjrani, a member of the Standing Committee on Home Affairs, presented the committee’s report on the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act Balochistan 2025. When the draft law was presented for approval, opposition member Maulana Hidayatur Rehman commented that the issue of missing persons must be resolved. He said the anti-terrorism bill might be correct, but it needed to be clear whom it actually benefited. “Who will be held accountable for those being killed?” he asked, adding that Counterterrorism Department actions were visible to everyone and the House should be taken into confidence on this bill.
JUI member Shahida Rauf said the bill should not be rushed and must be reviewed once more.
Responding, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said: “There is decorum in the Assembly. For a long time now, this issue has been ongoing. Who has made these people ‘missing’? Later, it turns out that they had links with banned outfits.” He added that the issue of missing persons has been used as propaganda, aiming to discredit state institutions, and the solution lies in legislation. “We must prevent this issue from being misused. Anyone arrested will be presented before a magistrate.”
He explained: “If any institution picks someone up, they will be allowed to keep the individual for up to three months. After three months, the person must be presented before a court and informed of the charges against him. The detained individual will be kept in a centre where they can meet their family. Their lawyer will also be informed. This way, the issue of missing persons will be resolved permanently. If anyone disappears beyond this system, he will be considered truly missing.” He added that the law would be valid for six years, emphasizing that there was a systematic effort to disillusion Balochistan’s youths. “It is easy to blame the state,” he said.
Later, the Assembly passed the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act Balochistan 2025. At this point, Kulsoom Niaz of the National Party attempted to speak but was not granted permission, prompting her to walk out.

Naegleria claims second life in Karachi in 2025,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318595-naegleria-claims-second-life-in-karachi-in-2025,"A 23-year-old man from the Orangi Town area of Karachi has fallen victim to Naegleria fowleri — commonly known as the brain-eating amoeba — becoming the second confirmed fatality from the deadly pathogen in Karachi this year, a spokesperson for the Sindh health department confirmed on Wednesday.
According to the official, the young man began experiencing symptoms on May 28 and was admitted to a private hospital on May 30. Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Naegleria fowleri in his system on June 1. Despite intensive medical intervention, he succumbed to the infection on June 3, 2025.
What makes this case particularly concerning, health officials said, is that the victim had no recent history of swimming or exposure to recreational water sources, which were common risk factors for Naegleria infection.
“The only reported water exposure was his routine use of domestic water and ablution (wuzu) at a local mosque,” the health department spokesperson said. Naegleria fowleri is a free-living amoeba found in warm freshwater environments such as lakes, rivers and poorly chlorinated or non-chlorinated water supplies. It enters the human body through the nose and travels to the brain, causing a rare but nearly always fatal brain infection called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).
“This is the second death in Sindh due to Naegleria this year, both of them reported from Karachi,” the spokesperson added, expressing concern over the persistent presence of the pathogen in the city’s water systems.
In 2024, Sindh reported six confirmed fatalities from Naegleria, all occurring during the summer months when temperatures rise and water usage increases. Public health experts warn that Karachi’s aging water infrastructure, low chlorine levels in municipal supplies, and poor monitoring of water storage tanks significantly contribute to the recurring threat. According to official standards, municipal water should maintain a minimum chlorine concentration of 0.5 ppm (parts per million) at consumer end points, but various independent assessments have shown that many areas in Karachi receive non-chlorinated or under-chlorinated water.
The health department has reiterated calls for residents to take preventive measures, including ensuring that domestic and mosque water tanks are regularly cleaned and properly chlorinated. “People should avoid letting water enter their noses while bathing or performing ablution, especially during summer,” the spokesperson advised.
Health officials also urge the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) to enhance chlorine monitoring and ensure compliance with safety levels across the distribution network. “Our teams are already working to inspect water samples from high-risk localities, including Orangi and nearby areas,” the department official added.
Naegleria fowleri infections remain rare but are almost always fatal. Globally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports a survival rate of less than 5 per cent, with only a handful of survivors recorded worldwide. In Pakistan, the first documented case of Naegleria was reported in 2008, and since then, dozens of deaths have been recorded—most of them in Karachi.
Health authorities have urged the citizens to remain cautious and report symptoms like headache, fever, nausea, and stiff neck without delay, as early diagnosis is crucial, though even with rapid treatment, survival chances are slim.

Three cops injured as they attempt to stop fleeing water tanker,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318597-three-cops-injured-as-they-attempt-to-stop-fleeing-water-tanker,"A tanker driver attempted to abduct a traffic policeman near Malik Chandio Chowk in the Manghopir area of District West, Karachi, on Wednesday.
The suspect tried to flee with the abducted traffic policeman, Tilak Raj, after refusing to stop at a police checkpoint. A police mobile nearby, however, responded promptly to officers’ call for help and pursued the fleeing tanker. During the chase, a group of individuals accompanying the tanker driver attacked the police team using sticks and stones, resulting in injuries to three constables. The injured cops have been identified as Razzaq, Yaqoob and Owais.
They were immediately taken to a hospital for medical treatment. A heavy contingent of police reached the area after getting information about the incident and took the situation into control. Further investigations are under way.

Home minister to personally supervise anti-narcotics task force,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318599-home-minister-to-personally-supervise-anti-narcotics-task-force,"Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar on Wednesday visited the Karachi Police Office. Sindh Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ghulam Nabi Memon accompanied him on the occasion.
Upon arrival, Karachi Additional IGP Javed Alam Odho and other senior police officials welcomed the home minister, and a well-prepared contingent of the Karachi Police presented a guard of honour.
Officials said Lanjar held a meeting to review police action against drug mafias and anti-narcotics efforts. All the DIGs attending the meeting provided separate briefings on organised and successful police actions in their respective divisions against the drug mafias.
The home minister said the task force would take action across the province against drug mafias without any pressure and would ensure the arrest of those dealing with narcotics. “No one is above the law. Regardless of the influence or status of the accused, they must face justice,” he emphasised.
He stated that the SSPs who failed to act against the drug mafias would not only be held accountable but also be removed from their positions and asked to explain their inaction. He said that the anti-narcotics task force was active, but from now on, he himself would request reports and directly supervise it.
He urged all the stakeholders to provide effective and practical suggestions for the eradication of drug mafias. Lanjar ordered that the existing lists of drug mafias be updated and efforts to prevent drug trafficking and distribution be made robust.
He added that the investigation and prosecution of cases filed against agents, groups, and patrons of drug mafias should be strengthened to ensure exemplary punishments. He remarked that drugs were a curse that contributed to deterioration in law and order, and destruction of our youth, making effective prevention the need of the hour.

JI city chief challenges ‘unjust’ multi-year tariff for K-Electric,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318600-ji-city-chief-challenges-unjust-multi-year-tariff-for-k-electric,"Jamaat-e-Islami Karachi Emir Monem Zafar Khan has challenged the multi-year tariff (MYT) granted to K-Electric by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), describing the seven-year tariff as “the most expensive and anti-consumer decision in recent history”.
Khan has filed a review petition under Nepra Review Regulations, 2009, saying that the controversial tariff is “illegal, non-transparent and contrary to public interest”. On May 23 Nepra had approved KE’s transmission & distribution MYT for the period from 2023-24 to 2029-30. JI accused Nepra of granting KE unjustified financial concessions, similar to those given to independent power producers (IPPs), despite KE not being classified as one.
Khan’s petition highlighted that KE has been unjustly allowed dollar-indexed return on equity (RoE), even though the company is not covered under the 2002 power policy or any IPP framework, and KE’s original agreements from 2005 and 2009 do not entitle it to such benefits.
“It’s not just a matter of tariff; it’s a matter of injustice to millions. Karachiites are being punished for KE’s inefficiency, theft and profiteering. The burden of KE’s losses, inflated costs, and poor performance has been placed entirely on bill-paying consumers.”
He claimed that KE presented exaggerated investment projections and inflated costs, which were approved by Nepra without proper scrutiny. These include assumptions of over Rs400 billion in capital expenditures, high depreciation charges, interest costs, and RoE in foreign currency — all of which disproportionately benefit KE at the cost of consumers, he pointed out.
He also objected to Nepra allowing KE to claim losses based on a 92.76 per cent recovery rate, while the company had already achieved a 96.7 per cent recovery in 2022. “This gives KE the perverse incentive to underperform, and still recover losses from consumers. No such benefit is given to other distribution companies, particularly in Punjab.”
The review motion argues that this amounts to rewarding inefficiency, and allowing cross-subsidisation by honest consumers in paying arrears for the non-paying or theft-prone localities. Khan also expressed concern over the lack of any meaningful penalties for electricity theft. “KE’s business model is now based on unchecked profiteering: no accountability, no performance, only profits.”
He pointed out that the expensive power being delivered by KE has crippled residential, industrial and commercial consumers across the city. He demanded that Nepra immediately withdraw the unjust benefits given to KE, and issue a revised, transparent and lawful tariff structure that aligns with sections 31 and 32 of the Nepra Act. “This is not just about numbers; it’s about justice for Karachi. Consumers deserve protection, not punishment.”

"Man attempts suicide after killing wife, son in Surjani",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318601-man-attempts-suicide-after-killing-wife-son-in-surjani,"In a tragic incident in Surjani Town's Kareemi Chowrangi area, a man allegedly killed his wife and a young son before attempting to take his own life. He was found in a critical condition and has been taken to hospital for medical care. Following the incident, police reached the property and inquired about the incident.
According to police, the bodies of a woman and her son were discovered inside the house, and that the woman’s throat had been slit, while the boy was found dead in unclear circumstances. The woman’s husband was discovered at the scene with a severe throat injury, presumed to be self-inflicted. He was initially taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital and later moved to the Civil Hospital Karachi due to the severity of his condition. The deceased woman, identified as 35-year-old Sana, was a mother of three. Her two daughters, who were present at home at the time, were safely taken into protective custody by neighbours and later handed over to their uncle.
Police recovered a sharp-edged knife from the scene and took the bodies to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities. A large number of residents gathered outside the house upon hearing of the incident. According to a spokesperson for the Karachi Police, the injured suspect has been identified as 42-year-old Faisal, son of Sagheeruddin, who is the husband of the deceased woman and father of the child, identified as 10-year-old Ali. Further investigations are underway to determine the motive behind the double murder.

‘Shift in consumer attitudes essential for reducing plastic pollution in Pakistan’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318602-shift-in-consumer-attitudes-essential-for-reducing-plastic-pollution-in-pakistan,"The provincial governments in Pakistan should launch mass awareness campaigns to encourage the public to adopt environment-friendly alternatives to plastic shopping bags and PET bottles and promote the reuse and recycling of waste to reduce the carbon footprint associated with daily consumption habits in society.
This was the key consensus among environmentalists, climate activists, media professionals and industrialists at an event held to commemorate World Environment Day. The United Nations has designated this year’s theme as ‘Beat Plastic Pollution’. The event was jointly organised by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Common & Industry’s (FPCCI) central standing committees on environment and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Speakers at the event, held at the FPCCI head office, stressed that government-imposed bans on plastic bags could only be effectively implemented if incentives were provided to manufacturers to transition towards environmentally friendly alternatives, such as biodegradable carrier bags. They noted that producers in the plastic industry would naturally cease manufacturing single-use plastic bags if consumers stopped demanding them.
Participants recalled the earlier failure of Islamabad’s administration to enforce a plastic bag ban, despite the capital’s smaller size compared to Karachi, due to the lack of engagement with both retailers and consumers in the environmental campaign.
Imran Sabir, director of natural resources at the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa), informed the audience that a province-wide ban on plastic shopping and carrier bags would come into effect in Sindh from June 15, following a decision by the provincial cabinet. He clarified that plastic bags used for wrapping industrial goods, food items, agricultural produce and merchandise would remain exempt from the forthcoming ban. This exemption, he said, was intended to ensure continued functionality in essential sectors while discouraging non-essential single-use plastics.
He added that earlier campaigns led by the Sindh government had successfully phased out the use of more harmful black-coloured plastic shopping bags and promoted the adoption of biodegradable alternatives at major retail outlets and grocery stores in Karachi. He emphasised that the government had already initiated an awareness drive to inform consumers, producers and shopkeepers about the impending ban.
Afia Salam, environmental journalist and climate activist, expressed concern over the public’s insufficient support for plastic waste recycling. She noted that inadequate waste collection and recycling infrastructure had led to the widespread littering of plastic bags and bottles in urban areas. Improper disposal of plastic bags, she said, was a leading cause of storm water drain blockages, which resulted in urban flooding during the monsoon season.
She urged the consumers to adopt more responsible habits by rejecting plastic bags. Zainab Naeem, research fellow at the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), called on the government to support start-ups, and small and medium enterprises offering eco-friendly alternatives to plastic products. She encouraged the consumers to actively choose items made from recycled materials to reduce the environmental impact of their consumption.
She highlighted that Pakistan generated over two million tonnes of plastic waste annually, making its collection, safe disposal and recycling a formidable challenge. Salman Javed, former managing director of the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, emphasised the need for educating the tourists visiting the northern hill resorts on the hazards of plastic pollution. Reducing the environmental footprint of the travel and tourism sector, he said, was essential for preserving Pakistan’s natural heritage.
Haleema Khan, deputy convener of the FPCCI Central Standing Committee on SDGs, called for robust enforcement of environmental protection and waste management laws by provincial authorities to effectively address plastic pollution.
Environmental consultant Saqib Ejaz Hussain urged the industries across Pakistan to comply with environmental regulations and integrate sustainability into their core operations in order to reduce their carbon footprint.
He argued that an outright ban on the plastic industry would be counterproductive, but suggested that producers should be incentivised to gradually phase out the manufacture of the most environmentally damaging products.
Naeem Qureshi, convener of the FPCCI Standing Committee on Environment, remarked that Pakistan’s plastic industry, with a turnover in billions of rupees, remained a vital contributor to the national economy. He said the government should assist manufacturers in making their operations more sustainable.
Noting that only three per cent of plastic waste generated in Pakistan was currently recycled, he called for urgent support for the recycling sector as a critical measure to combat urban pollution.
He also urged the provincial governments to strengthen their environmental governance mechanisms as per the responsibilities devolved under the 18th Constitutional Amendment. FPCCI Vice President Aman Paracha reaffirmed the FPCCI’s commitment to supporting initiatives by the federal, provincial and local governments, as well as NGOs, to address environmental degradation. He stressed the importance of educating schoolchildren on good practices such as reducing plastic waste and proper rubbish disposal, so they could grow into responsible citizens who actively contributed to environmental protection.

Sindh growers demand solution to water distribution mismanagement,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318603-sindh-growers-demand-solution-to-water-distribution-mismanagement,"HYDERABAD: The Sindh Abadgar Ittehad (SAI) held its monthly meeting in Hyderabad on Wednesday under the chairmanship of President Nawab Zubair Ahmed Talpur, raising serious concerns over the ongoing artificial water shortage in the province.
During the meeting, participants alleged that despite water being available in the system, the incompetence and negligence of the irrigation department had created a persistent crisis. They claimed that water channels and distributaries were being sold illegally, exorbitant rates were being charged, and water was being sold by the hour.
The situation at the tail ends of all water branches in Sindh had reportedly worsened to the point where not even birds or animals had access to water. The growers warned that the government’s cotton cultivation target was unlikely to be met due to the severe shortage of water. Concerns were also raised about the widespread sale of fake seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides across Sindh.
The meeting demanded that the federal government publicly disclose the names of the companies banned for selling such products. Despite a government ban on rice cultivation in certain areas due to water constraints, participants noted that large-scale cultivation continues in violation of regulations.
Expressing disappointment over the performance of the agriculture department, the growers called for an impartial inquiry into corruption within the department and strict punishment for those found guilty. They urged both the federal and Sindh governments to provide special relief for farmers in the upcoming budget. Specific demands included the prioritisation of agricultural loans for Sindh, to be issued on merit, without interest, and repayable in easy installments.
The growers also called for the government to fix the cotton support price at Rs 12,000 per 40 kg, citing the high input costs involved in cultivation. The meeting highlighted that Punjab had already cultivated 3 million acres of its 3.5 million-acre cotton target, while Sindh had cultivated only 0.6 million acres of its 1.6 million-acre target.
Participants demanded the withdrawal of the proposed agricultural income tax, arguing that Sindh’s farmers were already severely affected by inflation. They also called for government-backed loans to help establish dairy farms, emphasising that farmers were vital stakeholders in the economy. Excluding them from budget consultations, they argued, was unjust and a critical mistake, especially given agriculture's major contribution to the national economy.
The meeting was attended by Abdul Haq Zaur, Muhammad Anwar Kamboh, Khan Muhammad Kamboh, Saifullah Gul, Haji Abdul Rahim Dars, Haji Sajjad Memon, Javed Riyario, Sharif Nizamani, Jahan Khan Laghari, Raja Haider, and others.

‘Sindh’s healthcare sector to undergo int’l standard-based grading’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318604-sindh-s-healthcare-sector-to-undergo-int-l-standard-based-grading,"A plan to introduce an international standard-based grading system for modernizing the healthcare sector in the province of Sindh is currently in its initial stages. Once implemented, hospitals will be graded based on their performance and available facilities. Quacks pose a serious threat to society, and a comprehensive campaign against them is already underway.
These views were expressed by Dr. Ahsan Qavi Siddiqui, chief executive officer of the Sindh Healthcare Commission, during a special ceremony held at the Bait-ul-Hikmah Auditorium, Madinat al-Hikmah, Karachi, to award regular licence certificates to the Hamdard University Hospital (Taj Complex) and Naimat Begum Hamdard University Hospital.
The ceremony was presided over by Ms. Sadia Rashid, president of the Hamdard Foundation Pakistan and recipient of the Hilal-e-Imtiaz. Siddiqui further stated that quality healthcare means providing patients with modern medical facilities that are easily accessible and affordable.
He praised Hamdard Pakistan hospitals for maintaining high standards and fully complying with the regulations set by the Sindh Healthcare Commission. He added that Hamdard, founded by the great Pakistani Shaheed Hakim Mohammed Said, holds a special place in the nation’s service landscape and, therefore, carries greater expectations.
“Maintaining high standards is a continuous process,” he emphasized. “Self-accountability must be part of our daily routine. Healthcare is not just about doctors and nurses—it also includes hospital administrators, who are key stakeholders in the delivery of quality services.”
Brigadier (retd) Dr Riaz-ul-Haq, Chief Executive of Hamdard Hospital, expressed his satisfaction on the occasion, stating, “Today is a moment of pride. The medical efforts of our hospitals have been formally recognized at the official level. This achievement is the result of our dedication, hard work, and tireless efforts.”
The ceremony was also attended by Professor Dr Syed Shabib ul Hasan, Vice Chancellor of Hamdard University, and other distinguished guests. At the conclusion, Ms. Sadia Rashid received the regular licence certificates on behalf of the hospitals and presented commemorative shields to the honoured guests in appreciation of their contributions.

"Hours-long power cuts, water shortage making citizens’ lives miserable: Shahzad Qureshi",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318605-hours-long-power-cuts-water-shortage-making-citizens-lives-miserable-shahzad-qureshi,"Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader and former Sindh Assembly member Shahzad Qureshi has strongly reacted to the worsening civic crisis in Karachi, stating that the people are suffering under the burden of relentless power outages, an artificial water shortage, and a dangerous surge in street crime ahead of Eid.
In a statement issued on Tuesday, he said prolonged and unannounced loadshedding — ranging from 12 to 16 hours daily — has paralysed daily life in Karachi. “Children, the elderly, students, and workers alike are suffering in the extreme heat while the Sindh government remains silent and indifferent,” he added.
Qureshi further stated that an artificial water crisis has been created in the city, where the water tanker mafia is openly selling water at exorbitant prices. “Even quenching one’s thirst has become unaffordable for the poor,” he lamented.
He also expressed serious concern over the rise in incidents of mugging and theft across the city, warning that the deteriorating law and order situation could spiral further out of control as the Eid approaches.
Qureshi demanded that the Sindh government take immediate and practical steps to address these crises. “If the provincial government fails to act, it will have to face the people’s court,” he warned.
He also called upon the judiciary and the federal government to take notice of Karachi’s deteriorating conditions and ensure long-term solutions to the city’s ongoing problems.

Dismissal from service: SC takes exception to lack of proper forums to deal with cases of private companies’ employees,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318606-dismissal-from-service-sc-takes-exception-to-lack-of-proper-forums-to-deal-with-cases-of-private-companies-employees,"The Supreme Court took exception to a lack of forums for the government and private institutions’ employees against the termination of their services.
Hearing a petition of a Pakistan International Airlines employee against the termination of his service, a three-member Supreme Court bench headed by Justice Mohammad Ali Mazhar observed that there should be a forum established by the federal government which decides cases of private and other semi-government entities’ employees with regard to their termination from service without any delay.
The court observed that employees who were terminated from service have no other forum except the master of servant. It said private banks and semi-government entities removed employees from service abruptly, resulting employees’ challenge to the decisions as they file civil lawsuits in courts due to the non-availability of forums.
The apex court further observed that the civil suits last till twenty years or above and most of the employees die during the pendency of the civil suits. It said there was no mechanism for the regulation of those institutions which do not make service rules for its employees.
The SC also issued notices to Pakistan International Airlines and others and called their comments. The petitioner had challenged his dismissal from service by the PIA in 2015. The Sindh High Court had dismissed his appeal.
Missing person
The SC directed the DIG Sukkur and others to file comments on a petition against the disappearance of a 15-year-old boy from the Sukkur area. Petitioner Zahid Mangrio submitted that his son Ali Asghar had been missing since 2015 and his whereabouts were still unknown.
He said that police had traced persons involved in the disappearance of his son and no substantial progress had been made by the police to trace the whereabouts of the missing person.

Find out where your area stands: KE launches microsite for customers to know their power status,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318607-find-out-where-your-area-stands-ke-launches-microsite-for-customers-to-know-their-power-status,"In another step towards enhancing transparency and empowerment, K-Electric (KE) has launched a dedicated microsite that would enable customers in its serviced territory to check the power status, including the area loss profile.
This portal will help customers understand and stay updated with their area profile on the energy network through real-time insights. With just their KE Account Number, customers can now check where their area stands, empowering them to take informed steps toward improvement.
“This is part of KE’s continued effort to build greater awareness and collective accountability,” said K-Electric spokesperson.  “Our goal is to make information accessible and highlight how timely bill payment and reduction in electricity theft can improve power supply for communities. It’s about giving information back to the people.”
The spokesperson added, “Seventy percent of KE’s feeder network is already exempt from load-shed, a testament to the positive impact of responsible consumption and timely bill payments. This is up from 6.6% at the time of privatisation. The remaining areas face challenges that we continue to address through active engagement and on-ground intervention.”
Illegal connections and power theft continue to be a major issue affecting the stability of energy provision. In collaboration with law enforcement agencies, KE actively conducts crackdowns against power theft and defaulters. KE has conducted 13,416 kunda removal drives and 171,298 kgs of kundas have been discovered since January 2025 alone. KE teams are actively working on ground to bring neighborhoods out of this menace.
The platform also educates users on the legal implications of power theft and encourages anonymous reporting through speakup@ke.com.pk. Additionally, it provides practical guidance on how residents can support efforts to improve feeder performance by promoting bill payment culture in their neighborhoods.
KE urges all customers to visit the portal and take an active role in safeguarding their area’s stability. As more areas move toward responsible consumption, they become eligible for reliable and sustainable power supply.

Police checkpost attacked with cracker bomb in Hyderabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318608-police-checkpost-attacked-with-cracker-bomb-in-hyderabad,"HYDERABAD: A cracker bomb was hurled at the Naseem Nagar police checkpost in Hyderabad during the night between Tuesday and Wednesday, causing panic and minor damage but no reported injuries.
According to the FIR, government officials, including the Station House Officer (SHO), were present in the office on official duty when a loud explosion shook the premises. Following the blast, a crater was found in the SHO’s office, and a bottle containing traces of petrol was recovered from the scene.
The FIR further stated that, shortly after the explosion, an officer looked outside and saw two unidentified individuals fleeing the scene on a 125cc motorcycle, riding against traffic on Wadhu Wah Road. The Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) was called in to sweep the checkpost and surrounding area. The squad collected forensic evidence from the site and secured the materials for analysis.
An FIR had been lodged against two unknown suspects under the Explosives Act and the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Adeel Chandio visited the site to assess the situation firsthand. He later told The News that no arrests had been made yet, but a comprehensive investigation was underway from all angles.

Minister urges stakeholders to collaborate for achieving 6m cotton bales’ target,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318564-minister-urges-stakeholders-to-collaborate-for-achieving-6m-cotton-bales-target,"LAHORE:Provincial Minister for Agriculture and Livestock Sayed Ashaq Hussain Karmani has called on cotton sector stakeholders to work collaboratively to achieve the target of 06 million bales.
While underlining the need to enhance cotton production In a meeting with representatives of the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association here at Agriculture House, Minister discussed the Cotton Campaign 2025–26, early sowing and early operation of ginning factories, local cotton taxation, the Cotton Control Act, and cotton pricing issues.
The Cotton Ginners Association informed the Minister about the challenges and problems being faced by the industry.On this occasion, MPA Rana Saleem and Secretary Agriculture Punjab, Iftikhar Ali Sahoo, were also present.
Ashaq Hussain Karmani, stated that cotton is our cash crop. According to the vision of CM Punjab, the Agriculture Department has taken several effective measures over the past year and a quarter not only in South Punjab but throughout the province for the revival and stabilisation of cotton. As a result, the cotton cultivation situation has significantly improved, and the cultivated area has increased. He endorsed that this year is being regarded as the year of cotton revival.
To encourage farmers towards cotton cultivation, the Agriculture Department launched a strong awareness campaign. From February 15 to March 31, a challenging target of early sowing on 1 million acres was set and successfully achieved. Such a target had not been met in the past 10 years. So far, cotton has been cultivated on 3.3 million out of 3.5 million acres, and efforts are being made to reach 4 million acres. It is the Department’s practice to conduct third-party verification of achieved targets.
This year, one million acres of rice area has been shifted to cotton. Under the supervision of the Chief Minister, the Punjab Government has developed a strategy to eliminate income and sales tax on the cotton industry, and negotiations are ongoing with the Federal Govt and the Prime Minister. It is highly expected that these taxes will be abolished in the 2025–26 budget. The core purpose of all these reforms is to make cotton a profitable crop for farmers. The minister urged the Ginners Association to adopt new and improved technologies for ginning, highlighting that most factory owners are using traditional methods which result in reduced demand for our cotton in the international market. He emphasised the need to modernize ginning processes, assuring that the government will provide all possible support to introduce new technologies in this sector. The government is ensuring the availability of high-quality and approved cotton seed varieties. Karmani emphasised that enforcement of the Cotton Control Act is the need of time. The revival of cotton is vital for economic stability, and all stakeholders must work together for this cause. The current government is making every effort to ensure the prosperity of farmers and to increase agricultural productivity. Secretary Agriculture Punjab, Iftikhar Ali Sahoo, stated that this year, several demonstration plots were set up in South Punjab where Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices were fully implemented.

Parliamentary Secretary for Environmental Protection, Climate Change, Forestry, Wildlife and Fisheries Kanwal Pervaiz said this while addressing a seminar organised by the Punjab University College of Earth and Environmental Sciences on the theme of ‘Ending Plastic Pollution’ at Al-Razi Hall on World Environment Day on Wednesday.
In her address, Kanwal Pervaiz said that PU CEES is more active than the Punjab government to avoid the effects of climate change. She said that Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had said in her first speech that eliminating environmental pollution is among her priorities and practical steps are being seen today.
She said that mankind has the biggest hand in destroying the environment. She said that the smoke emitted from 80% of vehicles and motorcycles is a major cause of pollution. She said that in the past, Lahore was called the city of gardens, which is now called the city of pollution. She said that an individual must play a role in giving up the use of plastic. She said that plastic is causing a lot of damage to sewage, drinking water, water and air, for which awareness is very important to prevent it.
Prof Dr M Ali said that human beings are more threatened by environmental pollution than science, technology and artificial intelligence. He said that if we are able to make the students understand that the land their elders left for them is still the same? He said that the process of making water would have been very difficult, but if we examine our lifestyle, we can see how much water we are wasting on daily basis.

‘Children vulnerable to climate-aggravated illnesses’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318571-children-vulnerable-to-climate-aggravated-illnesses,"LAHORE:As air pollution worsens, heatwave intensify, and floods become more frequent, children across the country are increasingly vulnerable to climate-aggravated illnesses such as respiratory infections, typhoid, gastroenteritis, and heat-related conditions, this was said by Dr Ahson Rabbani, CEO of ChildLife Foundation on Wednesday.
On World Environment Day, ChildLife Foundation is spotlighting the growing threat of climate change to children’s health in Pakistan, while offering a sustainable solution through its pioneering telemedicine model.
“By offering expert pediatric consultations through our Telemedicine Satellite Centers (TSCs) across Pakistan, we ensure timely, life-saving care while reducing unnecessary referrals to major cities, ultimately minimising the carbon footprint of healthcare delivery.” ChildLife operates more than 300 Telemedicine Satellite Centers (TSCs) within government hospitals nationwide, enabling doctor-to-doctor video consultations that connect frontline medical officers with senior pediatricians in real time.
This innovative approach ensures expert guidance for accurate diagnosis and treatment of children at the point of care. With over one million teleconsultations delivered to date, this system has significantly reduced the need for long-distance patient transfers, lowering travel-related emissions, saving time and cost. By avoiding thousands of referrals to urban hospitals, the model not only ensures timely treatment for children but also reduces fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. “Each teleconsultation spares families hours of travel and prevents repeat visits,” said Dr. Irfan Habib, Medical Director at ChildLife Foundation. “This not only lessens the environmental burden but ensures that children receive immediate expert care when every minute matters.”
Many of the conditions treated through ChildLife’s telemedicine network are linked to environmental risk factors, including respiratory infections exacerbated by smog and indoor pollution, waterborne diseases like typhoid and diarrhea triggered by floods and poor sanitation, as well as heatstroke and dehydration during extreme heatwave.

"‘Tariff rationalisation to increase exports, jobs’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318575-tariff-rationalisation-to-increase-exports-jobs,"Islamabad:As tariff debates take center stage globally following a change in the US administration, experts called for sector-specific interventions to make Pakistan’s new tariff policy a success.
They were speaking at a seminar on “Winners and losers: making sense of Pakistan’s new tariff policy” organised by Sustainable Development Policy Institute here Monday. Muhammad Ashfaq, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Commerce, unveiling details of the upcoming National Tariff Policy 2025–30, said that tariff rationalisation is now essential to stimulate exports, enhance manufacturing and generate employment.
He said that Pakistani imports are twice its exports and unless we align our tariff structure with trade realities, circular debt and revenue shortfalls will continue to undermine our growth, he said, adding that new tariff policy originally shelved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and 2022 floods, aims to gradually reduce import duties across the board. The responsibility for customs tariffs now also officially shifted from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to the Ministry of Commerce, which now oversees the National Tariff Board, a structural change designed to bring policy coherence, he added.
Mr Ashfaq projected that by 2029-30, federal tax revenue could reach Rs2.1 trillion driven by increased sales tax collections and a rise in indirect taxation. He noted that while the import bill may rise initially, exports are expected to surge, along with job creation, ie, one million new jobs during the policy’s implementation phase.
He said that Pakistan also opened negotiations with the US Administration to review tariffs on its exports. Though the US is not pressing hard on trade barriers, its concern over trade surpluses makes tariff rationalisation a mutual interest. No changes to Pakistan’s tariff policy are anticipated after the conclusion of bilateral talks, he said.
SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri in his opening remarks opined that the topic, once a technical concern, became a household name, which reflects its growing importance both globally and domestically.
For Pakistan, he said, the debate is particularly pressing as the country prepares its federal budget under the supervision of not one, but two International Monetary Fund (IMF) programmes.

Environment Day marked with call to end plastic pollution,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318576-environment-day-marked-with-call-to-end-plastic-pollution,"Islamabad:In observance of World Environment Day 2025, the Dr. Akhtar Hameed Khan Memorial Association (AHKMA), in collaboration with SZABIST University Islamabad and the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA), organized a high-impact event at SZABIST to raise awareness about the dangers of plastic waste and to honor grassroots efforts that are reshaping waste management practices through sustainable and community-centered solutions, says a press release.
In her welcome address, Sumaira Gul, CEO of AHKMA, underscored the urgency of environmental action and reaffirmed the organization’s long-standing commitment to sustainability through its pioneering work in door-to-door waste collection and the development of Integrated Resource Recovery Centres (IRRCs).
“Our work at the community level is focused on reducing the waste footprint by targeting households—where the problem begins—before it spills into our streets, drains, rivers, and eventually, the oceans,” she said.
Reflecting on this year’s World Environment Day theme—“Ending Plastic Pollution”—Sumaira Gul drew a powerful link between global environmental challenges and local solutions, noting:
“Plastic waste may be a global crisis, but our response starts right at our doorstep. Through citizen engagement in segregated waste disposal and recovery, our IRRCs have successfully diverted tonnes of plastic and organic waste from landfills and open dumps, converting them into recyclable materials and compost.”
The event gathered students, faculty, environmentalists, and policymakers, Pak-EPA Director Dr Mohsina, Dr Sofia Khalid from Allama Iqbal Open University, e-Guard CEO Hamid Ullah, NCA Wash Coordinator Mazhar Ali, Dr Basharat from Consultant5, PPP leader Malik Najeeb and others and featured robust discussions on circular economy principles, waste reduction innovations, and Pakistan’s role in global negotiations under the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) toward a treaty to end plastic pollution.
Representatives from Pak-EPA echoed the urgent need for stronger enforcement, policy alignment, and public participation. They emphasized UNEP’s Beat Plastic Pollution campaign and the importance of the 5Rs—Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Rethink plastic use.

NCSW campaign for law on minimum marriage age,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318584-ncsw-campaign-for-law-on-minimum-marriage-age,"Islamabad:In view of the increasing trend of child marriage and its serious consequences, NCSW along women's right organisations has launched a comprehensive campaign across the country. Addressing a press conference, National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) Chairperson Ume Laila Azhar applauded the ICT Child Marriage Restraint Bill 2025, she said that after Sindh, it is welcomed that the minimum age for marriage of girls in Islamabad is 18 years.
We demand that the minimum age for marriage be set at 18 years across the country. ""We have to think about the future of our girls and boys and take steps for their education, health and a bright future. We have to stop the exploitation of our children, especially girls. It is not just a matter of marriage, it is a matter of raising future generations. We will launch a nationwide campaign for this bill so that there is a standard uniformity in law across Pakistan,"" she said.
Fehmida Iqbal, a renowned gender expert, presented statistics and said that 18 percent of girls in Pakistan are married before the age of 18, while 54 percent of young girls become pregnant before the age of 18, which proves to be a significant reason for the threat to their lives and the lives of the newborn.
Women's affairs expert Saman Ahsan said that in many Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, the minimum age for marriage is 18 years, so why are obstacles being placed in Pakistan to prevent this from happening? ""If those under the age of eighteen are not given the right to drive, vote, etc., then how can they be entrusted with the heavy responsibility of passing on the family and the generation to the next generation? We need to create a social awareness movement, not a change in the law, through this campaign.

FAPUASA seeks PM intervention as govt condemns HEC to default,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318585-fapuasa-seeks-pm-intervention-as-govt-condemns-hec-to-default,"Islamabad:Despite repeated appeals and a rapidly changing educational landscape, the government once again allocated only Rs65 billion as the recurring grant for higher education, the same amount that remained unchanged since 2018 despite increases in salaries and pension covered by recurring grant.
Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) has strongly condemned the government’s continued neglect of the higher education sector as evident in the proposed Federal Budget for the upcoming fiscal year.
If this crisis continues, it will inevitably lead to the financial collapse of Pakistan’s public university system, said a FAPUASA statement. It called upon Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene urgently to rescue the higher education sector, just as he acted to steer the country away from sovereign default. A similar commitment is now needed to avert the collapse of our academic institutions, it said.
“This stagnant allocation is wholly inadequate given the substantial expansion of the public higher education sector.”

PM likely to inaugurate Hazesco in July,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318616-pm-likely-to-inaugurate-hazesco-in-july,"MANSEHRA: Wapda Hydroelectric Union chairman Jamil Tanoli on Wednesday said that the newly licensed Hazara Electric Supply Company (Hazesco) is set to begin operations at the start of the next fiscal year.
“This is a dream come true as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is likely to formally inaugurate Hazesco in July this year,” Jamil Tanoli told reporters.He said that Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Mohammad Yousuf and former MNA Captain (retd) Mohammad Safdar played a pivotal role in the establishment of Hazesco and had confirmed the prime minister’s upcoming visit.
Jamil Tanoli said the government has approved Rs30 million for the renovation of the Wapda building on College Road, Abbottabad, where Hazesco’s offices would be relocated from a rented facility in Mandian.
“Evacuating Wapda’s offices from College Road and shifting them to rented premises would be a waste of time and public funds,” he said and urged the government to reconsider the plan.He proposed instead that the government acquire a suitable rented facility for Hazesco operations and preserve the existing Wapda setup at its current location.
“Moreover, the government should construct the Hazesco office complex on 10 kanals of land near the grid station on Murree Road, Abbottabad. The prime minister should also perform his groundbreaking during his visit, which would save Rs30 million and provide long-term benefits,” he added.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority licensed Hazesco last month to purchase, transmit and distribute electricity to consumers.The Ministry of Energy (Power Division) had officially notified the creation of Hazesco on January 18, 2023, following approval from Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) issued a certificate of incorporation under the Companies Act, 2017.

"After Pakistan downed Indian jets, Indonesia weighs purchase of China’s J-10s",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318510-after-pakistan-downed-indian-jets-indonesia-weighs-purchase-of-china-s-j-10s,"JAKARTA: Indonesia is weighing buying China’s J-10 fighter jets, given their relatively cheaper price and advanced capability, as it also considers finalising a purchase of US-made F-15EX jets, a senior official said on Wednesday.
Southeast Asia’s most populous country has in recent years embarked on efforts to modernise its ageing military hardware. In 2022 it bought 42 French Rafale jets worth $8.1 billion, six of which will be delivered next year.
“We have had talks with China and they offered us a lot, not just J-10, but also ships, arms frigates,” said Deputy Defence Minister and retired Air Marshal Donny Ermawan Taufanto. “We’re evaluating J-10,” Taufanto said, adding that Jakarta was reviewing system compatibility and after-sales support as well as pricing.
A potential purchase has been considered for over a year, before the recent conflict between India and Pakistan, but Taufanto said Indonesia would factor in reports that a Pakistani J-10 plane shot down multiple Indian jets last month.
Jakarta also continues to consider whether to proceed with the next step for its purchase of F-15EX fighters, he said, following the defence ministry’s deal with planemaker Boeing for the sale in 2023. Taufanto said the US jets’ capabilities were well recorded, but suggested the offered price of $8 billion for 24 planes remained in question.
French President Emmanuel Macron said after meeting Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto in Jakarta last week that they had signed a preliminary defence pact that could lead to new orders of French hardware including Rafale jets.“We’re considering (France’s) offer. We’re considering our own budget, we’re evaluating, especially given we have other options like J-10, F-15,” Taufanto said.

Expanding missile threats and airspace closures are straining airlines,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318511-expanding-missile-threats-and-airspace-closures-are-straining-airlines,"NEW DELHI: Proliferating conflict zones are an increasing burden on airline operations and profitability, executives say, as carriers grapple with missiles and drones, airspace closures, location spoofing and the shoot-down of another passenger flight.
Airlines are racking up costs and losing market share from cancelled flights and expensive re-routings, often at short notice. The aviation industry, which prides itself on its safety performance, is investing more in data and security planning.
“Flight planning in this kind of environment is extremely difficult … The airline industry thrives on predictability, and the absence of this will always drive greater cost,” said Guy Murray, who leads aviation security at European carrier TUI Airline.
With increasing airspace closures around Russia and Ukraine, throughout the Middle East, between India and Pakistan and in parts of Africa, airlines are left with fewer route options.“Compared to five years ago, more than half of the countries being overflown on a typical Europe-Asia flight would now need to be carefully reviewed before each flight,” said Mark Zee, founder of OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the Middle East since October 2023 led to commercial aviation sharing the skies with short-notice barrages of drones and missiles across major flight paths -- some of which were reportedly close enough to be seen by pilots and passengers.
Russian airports, including in Moscow, are now regularly shut down for brief periods due to drone activity, while interference with navigation systems, known as GPS spoofing or jamming, is surging around political fault lines worldwide.When hostilities broke out between India and Pakistan last month, the neighbours blocked each other's aircraft from their respective airspace.
“Airspace should not be used as a retaliatory tool, but it is,” Nick Careen, International Air Transport Association (IATA) senior vice president for operations, safety and security, told reporters at the airline body's annual meeting in New Delhi on Tuesday.Isidre Porqueras, chief operating officer at Indian carrier IndiGo said the recent diversions were undoing efforts to reduce emissions and increase airline efficiencies.
WORST-CASE SCENARIO
Finances aside, civil aviation’s worst-case scenario is a plane being hit, accidentally or intentionally, by weaponry.
In December, an Azerbaijan Airlines flight crashed in Kazakhstan, killing 38 people. The plane was accidentally shot down by Russian air defences, according to Azerbaijan’s president and Reuters sources.
In October, a cargo plane was shot down in Sudan, killing five people. Six commercial aircraft have been shot down, with three near-misses since 2001, according to aviation risk consultancy Osprey Flight Solutions. Governments need to share information more effectively to keep civil aviation secure as conflict zones proliferate, IATA Director General Willie Walsh said this week.
Safety statistics used by the commercial aviation industry show a steady decline in accidents over the past two decades, but these do not include security-related incidents such as being hit by weaponry.
IATA said in February that accidents and incidents related to conflict zones were a top concern for aviation safety requiring urgent global coordination.
TOUGH CHOICES
Each airline decides where to travel based on a patchwork of government notices, security advisers, and information-sharing between carriers and states, leading to divergent policies.
The closure of Russian airspace to most Western carriers since the outbreak of war in Ukraine in 2022 put them at a cost disadvantage compared to airlines from places like China, India and the Middle East that continue to take shorter northern routes that need less fuel and fewer crew. Shifting risk calculations mean Singapore Airlines’ flight SQ326 from Singapore to Amsterdam has used three different routes into Europe in just over a year, Flightradar24 tracking data shows.
When reciprocal missile and drone attacks broke out between Iran and Israel in April 2024, it started crossing previously avoided Afghanistan instead of Iran.
Last month, its route shifted again to avoid Pakistan's airspace as conflict escalated between India and Pakistan. Flight SQ326 now reaches Europe via the Persian Gulf and Iraq. Singapore Airlines did not respond immediately to a request for comment.

Public debt rises to Rs74.9tr ahead of FY26 budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318512-public-debt-rises-to-rs74-9tr-ahead-of-fy26-budget,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s public debt rose to Rs74.936 trillion by the end of April, central bank data showed on Wednesday, as the government eyes continued fiscal consolidation in line with International Monetary Fund (IMF) commitments ahead of next week’s FY26 budget.
From July 1, 2024 to April 30, 2025, the central government’s debt increased by 8.73 per cent, or Rs6.022 trillion. The central government debt had reached Rs68.914 trillion at the end of June.
The debt increased by 13.4 per cent year-on-year (YoY) and 1.7 per cent month-on-month (MoM) in April.“The central government’s debt is rising primarily to cover interest payments on existing debt,” said Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities Limited.
“On a positive note, the government is expected to generate a primary surplus of approximately Rs2.3 trillion this year, indicating the government has Rs2.3 trillion more funds than its expenditure other than interest expense,” Ashraf said.
“In terms of debt composition, the government is shifting reliance on Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) while simultaneously reducing its dependence on Treasury bills (T-bills), which are short-term in nature,” he added.
Ashraf expects the debt-to-GDP ratio to maintain its previous year’s level of 65.5 per cent this year. However, debt-to-GDP is significantly lower than 71.7 per cent in FY22 due to prudent spending and a three-times increase in government revenue.
The amount of public debt has been increasing recently, and the rising cost of debt servicing puts a strain on the finances of the nation. But since June, the SBP has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 1,100 basis points, reflecting a reduction in inflationary pressures. The decline in interest rates will likely help the government reduce its markup payments on domestic borrowings.
In April, Pakistan’s domestic debt surged by 18.1 per cent YoY, reaching Rs52.523 trillion, and increased by 2.0 per cent MoM. Overall, the domestic debt rose by 11.37 per cent by the end of April.
The external debt saw a modest rise, reaching Rs22.413 trillion by the end of April. This represents a 3.8 per cent increase year-on-year and a 1.1 per cent increase month-on-month. External debt grew by 8.0 per cent over a period of 10 months.
Pakistan’s fiscal performance has shown improvement, with a budget deficit of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), totalling Rs2.97 trillion for the July-March period of FY25. This is an improvement compared to the 3.7 per cent deficit recorded during the same period the previous year. However, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) missed its revenue collection target by nearly Rs1.008 trillion in the first 11 months of FY25, primarily due to slowing economic growth and a drop in imports.

"Value-added textile sector urges PM to restore EFS, rejects tariff pressure from spinners",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318513-value-added-textile-sector-urges-pm-to-restore-efs-rejects-tariff-pressure-from-spinners,"LAHORE: The value-added textile sector has once again raised a unified voice to defend the backbone of Pakistan’s export economy -- the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of the apparel industry.
In a joint press conference held at the Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMA) Lahore office on Tuesday, PHMA and the Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA) called for urgent action to restore the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) in its original spirit.
The leadership appealed directly to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to intervene and halt policy changes that threaten to dismantle the EFS. They warned that persistent bureaucratic hurdles -- compounded by lobbying from the spinning sector for new tariffs -- are pushing the SME-led apparel export industry towards crisis.
PHMA Zonal Chairman Abdul Hameed and PRGMEA Zonal Chairman Dr Ayyaz Uddin said that the EFS was introduced to enable duty-free import of raw materials for exporters, giving Pakistan’s apparel industry a competitive advantage. “Rather than simplifying exports, EFS has become bogged down by manual procedures and is now under threat from proposed tariff changes,” said Abdul Hameed.
Dr Ayyaz Uddin emphasised that SMEs, which comprise the bulk of the value-added sector, cannot survive under these conditions. “We operate on thin margins and short timelines. EFS was a breakthrough for us -- but it is now being reshaped to serve upstream interests. These tariffs, reportedly pushed by the spinners’ lobby, protect a narrow segment at the expense of Pakistan’s largest job-creating export base.”

"PBF calls for GST exemption on local cotton, yarn to avert textile industry collapse",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318514-pbf-calls-for-gst-exemption-on-local-cotton-yarn-to-avert-textile-industry-collapse,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) has urged the federal government to exempt locally produced cotton, cottonseed, yarn and fabric from the 18 per cent general sales tax (GST) in the upcoming Budget 2025-26, warning that failure to do so could push the country’s textile industry towards complete collapse.
PBF South Punjab Chairperson Malik Talat Suhail, emphasised that the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) -- introduced to phase out subsidies and promote exports -- has instead proved detrimental to the textile sector. Under EFS, imported raw materials are exempt from both sales tax and customs duty, while local inputs remain taxed at 18 per cent.
Although this tax is technically refundable, in practice only 60-70 per cent of refunds are disbursed. The refund process is marred by delays, manual processing and high compliance costs -- issues that disproportionately affect small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
This imbalance has led many exporters to favour imported inputs, causing significant damage to local suppliers. Consequently, Pakistan’s import of cotton, yarn and greige fabric rose by $1.5 billion in FY2025, increasing from $2.19 billion to $3.64 billion. In contrast, textile exports grew by only $1.4 billion, with net textile exports projected to decline from $14 billion to $13.6 billion. Over 120 spinning mills and more than 800 ginning factories have closed down, while loom workers in Faisalabad continue to stage protests. SMEs are especially vulnerable, as they are subject to multiple taxes at each production stage and have limited access to the cheaper imported alternatives available to larger firms.
This situation has severely strained the country’s foreign exchange reserves, especially as the number of commercial import licences has tripled -- from 800 to 2,400. Meanwhile, domestic cotton production has plummeted to a historic low of just five million bales, with further declines expected. With little government support and falling demand, many farmers are abandoning cotton cultivation in favour of more water-intensive crops, exacerbating pressure on national water resources.
The PBF also warned that the collapse of the cotton economy is depriving rural communities of $2-3 billion in income, with female cotton-pickers among the hardest hit. “Pakistan is currently the only country imposing an 18 per cent sales tax on cottonseed and cotton feed, pushing farmer income below the cost of production and hitting the poorest segments of society the hardest.” Rising unemployment and falling rural earnings are further worsening the economic crisis.The forum stressed that if current policies are not revised, Pakistan could lose $4-6 billion in potential foreign exchange earnings.

"Stocks up 1,348 points to another all-time high amid pre-budget rally",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318515-stocks-up-1-348-points-to-another-all-time-high-amid-pre-budget-rally,"KARACHI: Bullish momentum continued at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by 1,348 points to another all-time high amid the pre-budget rally, as investors weigh government efforts to abolish further sales tax.
The benchmark KSE 100 Index surged by 1,347.99 points, or 1.12 per cent, to 121,798.87 points, up from 120,450.87 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 121,798.87 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 120,896.13 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said, “Stocks closed at a new all-time high led by scrips across the board in the pre-budget rally at the PSX as investors weigh government efforts to abolish further sales tax; provincial power tariff relief; and PM hints over success in government-IMF budget talks.”
He said that a surge in POL sales by 10 per cent YoY in May; surging cement exports; and the ADB’s approval of the $800 million financing package supporting rupee stability played a catalytic role in the record bullish close. The KSE-30 index increased by 399.91 points or 1.09 per cent to 36,983.92 points from 36,584.01 points.
Traded shares rose by 132 million shares to 710.591 million shares from 578.163 million shares. The trading value increased to Rs35.216 billion from Rs26.827 billion. Market capital expanded to Rs14.749 trillion against Rs14.593 trillion. Of the 475 companies active in the session, 264 closed in green, 170 in red and 41 remained unchanged.
Analyst Naveed Nadeem at Topline Securities said the bullish momentum from the previous session carried forward, fuelled by robust buying from local and corporate institutions, as indicated by NCCPL data.
The key drivers of the rally included heavyweight stocks such as NBP, BAHL, SYS, LUCK, and MCB, which collectively contributed 586 points to the KSE-100 index’s upward trajectory.
The highest increase was recorded in Supernet Technologies Limited, which rose by Rs79.11 to Rs870.21 per share, followed by Pakistan Engineering Company Limited, which increased by Rs74.48 to Rs819.30 per share. A significant decline was noted in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which fell by Rs3,554.32 to Rs31,988.87 per share; Khyber Textile Mills Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs337.68 to Rs3,039.08 per share.
Mubashir Anis Naviwala, an analyst at JS Global, said the KSE-100 surged at open and maintained strong momentum, hitting a new intraday high and settling at a record closing. “With this powerful breakout above previous highs, the index is poised for continued upward momentum, potentially attracting increased institutional flows,” he said. “We advise investors to take advantage of intraday dips and accumulate fundamentally strong stocks in the fertiliser, cement, and banking sectors to benefit from the ongoing bullish sentiment.”
Sui South Gas remained the volume leader with 51.634 million shares, which closed higher by Rs2.11 to Rs38.42 per share. Fauji Foods Ltd, with 51.388 million shares, followed it, which closed higher by 56 paisas to Rs16.75 per share.
Other significant turnover stocks included K-Electric Ltd, Invest Bank, Faysal Bank, BO Punjab, National Bank XD, Treet Corp, WorldCall Telecom, and Big Bird Foods Ltd.     In the futures market, 314 companies recorded trading, 201 of which increased, 107 decreased and 6 remained unchanged.

Dealers said that the local currency continued to weaken in the interbank market due to importer demand for dollars exceeding dollar sales from exporters and remittances. “The rupee, rather than gaining with only two days remaining before Eidul Azha, when remittances from expatriate Pakistanis typically increase, is experiencing downward pressure caused by payment obligations,” a currency dealer said.
Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics shows the trade deficit shrank to $2.6 billion in May, representing a 23 per cent reduction from the previous month. While exports rose 17 per cent month-on-month to $2.6 billion, imports decreased 8.0 per cent MoM to $5.2 billion. The trade gap increased by 11 per cent year over year to $24 billion in the first 11 months of fiscal year 2025 from $21.7 billion in the same period last year.
In a positive development, the Asian Development Bank approved an $800 million programme on Tuesday to strengthen public financial management and boost fiscal sustainability in Pakistan.

"Illicit cigarette market overtakes formal sector, surges to 58%",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318517-illicit-cigarette-market-overtakes-formal-sector-surges-to-58pc,"ISLAMABAD: The share of duty-paid cigarettes in Pakistan has dropped sharply over the past 13 years -- from 67 billion sticks in 2013 to just 34 billion in 2025 -- while untaxed and smuggled cigarettes see a dramatic surge.
On average, 15 illicit cigarettes are sold per day in Pakistan, compared to only 11 that are tax-paid. This discrepancy has caused a staggering loss of Rs325 billion ($1.1 billion) to the national exchequer in the outgoing fiscal year alone. The mounting revenue shortfall persists even as the government struggles to meet IMF conditions for maintaining a primary surplus under the Fund’s stringent oversight.
Citing official data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), executives of Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) told a press briefing on Wednesday that multinational corporations are expected to promote economic activity, generate profits and provide employment. However, if profitability is undermined, such companies may exit the market -- as seen in Malaysia, where British American Tobacco (BAT) shut down operations after the illicit cigarette market grew to 80 per cent. PTC warned that Pakistan could be heading in the same direction.
The company also strongly opposed the Punjab cabinet’s proposed ban on electronic cigarettes, arguing that their import is legally permitted under designated HS codes. “How can they be abruptly banned?” a PTC official asked.
Director Legal and Corporate and Regulatory Affairs at PTC Asad Shah said that the illicit cigarette trade has now overtaken the legitimate sector, comprising 58 per cent of the total market. He warned that this trend threatens the viability of the formal industry and deprives the government of substantial revenue.
Pakistan’s total annual cigarette consumption is estimated at 80 billion sticks. While the sector has the potential to generate Rs570 billion in tax revenue, only Rs292 billion was collected during FY2023-24. For the current fiscal year, only Rs247 billion is projected to be collected, with Rs230 billion recorded in the first 11 months. The PTC warned that if corrective tax reforms and enforcement measures are not implemented, collections could fall further to Rs235 billion in FY2025-26.
In FY2013, the government collected taxes on 67 billion cigarette sticks. This year, that figure is expected to halve to 34 billion, highlighting the growing dominance of illicit products following a 254 per cent increase in the Federal Excise Duty (FED) introduced two and a half years ago.
Despite holding only 42 per cent of the market, the formal sector contributes 98 per cent of the total tax revenue from cigarettes. Shah stressed that full documentation of the industry is critical to tackling tax evasion.
Currently, the government’s minimum retail price is Rs162.25 per pack, but around 18 billion cigarettes are being sold at Rs150 or less -- without any tax being paid. Shah clarified that the issue lies not in low taxes, but in illegal sales below the minimum legal price. Alarmingly, no penalties have been imposed so far for such violations.“Without strict and impartial enforcement, no policy can be effective,” he asserted.
He also noted that the Track and Trace System (TTS) had lost its intended impact, burdening compliant manufacturers while failing to curtail the spread of illicit and smuggled brands. An estimated 10 billion sticks are smuggled and sold annually in Pakistan.
To combat this, he proposed reducing the adjustable excise duty on acetate tow -- a key raw material in cigarette production -- from Rs44,000 per kilogramme to Rs4,000. The current rate, he argued, has incentivised smuggling. Over 450 metric tonnes of illicit acetate tow have already been seized during the ongoing fiscal year, he added.

Minister backs FPCCI’s call for national shipping lines,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318518-minister-backs-fpcci-s-call-for-national-shipping-lines,"KARACHI: Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has endorsed the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI)’s demand for the establishment of strong, indigenous shipping lines, noting that Pakistani traders pay substantial amounts of foreign exchange annually to international carriers.
According to an FPCCI statement issued on Wednesday, the minister visited the FPCCI Head Office at the Federation House, Karachi for a detailed and interactive consultative session with representatives of the business, trade and industrial sectors. Key stakeholders including terminal operators, shipping lines, customs agents and media personnel were also present.
The minister announced plans to launch national shipping lines and procure new vessels to expand the country’s maritime fleet. He also committed to an open-door policy to ensure the prompt resolution of concerns and complaints raised by the trading community.
He informed participants that the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) had successfully reclaimed land worth Rs100 billion from encroachers and invited the business community to partner with KPT in joint ventures to establish business facilities.
FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh offered his full support to the ministry in the consultation process and urged that FPCCI representatives be involved from the outset to ensure alignment with ground realities and commercial needs.
Senior Vice President of FPCCI Saquib Fayyaz Magoon reiterated the federation’s stance that the 1.8 per cent infrastructure cess collected by the Sindh government from importers should be reinvested in the development of infrastructure linked to the ports, industrial zones, commercial centres, and the city of Karachi at large.
He added that the total collection from the cess amounts to approximately Rs300 billion -- sufficient, he said, to redevelop and modernise Karachi and Sindh’s infrastructure to meet international standards. In response, the minister expressed willingness to engage the Sindh government in discussions alongside the business community in the national and economic interest.
Magoon also highlighted that the Netty Jetty interchange is currently the only access route to the Karachi Port. He cautioned that any disruption or emergency affecting this route could bring national trade to a standstill, underlining the urgent need for an alternative route to manage traffic flow to the port.

Karachi’s first scientific emissions inventory report launched,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318519-karachi-s-first-scientific-emissions-inventory-report-launched,"KARACHI: Marking World Environment Day, Bank Alfalah, in collaboration with the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI) and Karachi Urban Lab (KUL), a research facility at the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), unveiled a report titled ‘Karachi Emissions Inventory -- A Scientific Foundation for a Clean Air City’.
The report is based on the results of 13 newly installed air quality monitors funded by Bank Alfalah, and offers the city’s most comprehensive, evidence-based analysis of air pollution sources.
Positioned across various high-density zones like Saddar, Korangi, Gadap, North Nazimabad and Clifton, the monitors measure PM2.5, SO2, NOX, and CO2, critical pollutants that affect urban health and quality of life. Based on international best practices and local data, the inventory sheds light on the root causes of Karachi’s air quality crisis. Key findings reveal that Karachi produced 394.82 kilo tonnes of emissions, with industry contributing 49 per cent and transport 33 per cent. Power generation, largely reliant on high-sulphur fuel, accounted for 30 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions, while residential emissions were negligible due to Karachi’s warmer climate.
Despite the challenge, Karachi’s coastal location provides some respite with natural sea breeze circulation aiding pollutant dispersion, though background levels remain elevated due to marine salt and desert dust.
The report was launched at an event held at IBA on Tuesday, followed by a policy dialogue that urged cross-agency coordination, improved monitoring, public health alerts and green financing to transition towards a cleaner, more sustainable city.
“Karachi’s air quality crisis is local, not inevitable. Our report shows that with targeted, evidence-based interventions, especially in industrial regulation and transport policy, meaningful change is possible within five years,” added Founder of Pakistan Air Quality Initiative (PAQI) Abid Qamar.
“Bank Alfalah is proud to support the scientific foundation needed to tackle urban air pollution and create a healthier environment for all,” said Head of Corporate Communication and CSR at Bank Alfalah Madiha Javed Qureshi. “As a responsible bank, we look forward to supporting causes that require attention. The banking sector also invests in innovative solutions for green financing to help accelerate the transition toward sustainability.”
The Karachi Emissions Inventory provides a crucial starting point for policymakers, urban planners, and civil society to collaborate on transformative solutions.As part of its broader commitment to a sustainable future, Bank Alfalah has pledged USD 10 million to support climate resilience and environmental well-being. Advancing this commitment, the bank also launched the GreenWayForward initiative in collaboration with WWF-Pakistan, through which 35,000 mangroves will be planted along the coastline of Pakistan in 2023 and 2024. This effort contributes to Bank Alfalah’s long-term pledge of planting 100,000 trees by 2030 in partnership with WWF-Pakistan, reinforcing its dedication to environmental stewardship.

Easypaisa digitises cattle market transactions for Eidul Azha,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318520-easypaisa-digitises-cattle-market-transactions-for-eidul-azha,"LAHORE: Prioritising ease and convenience for millions this Eidul Azha, easypaisa digital bank is playing its role in digitising traditionally cash-intensive cattle market transactions. The platform also enables users to fulfil their sacrificial obligations seamlessly via the easypaisa app.
Deploying its Raast-based QR code payment system at select cattle markets across Pakistan, easypaisa is at the forefront of digitisation efforts under the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) ‘Go Cashless’ campaign.

In light of this scale, easypaisa is offering a secure, seamless digital transaction experience aligned with the SBP’s vision of a digitally integrated financial ecosystem.
Jahanzeb Khan, president and CEO of easypaisa digital bank, said, “As Pakistan’s first digital bank, easypaisa is committed to combining technology with convenience, enabling users to transact securely this Eidul Azha.

LCCI asks Punjab CM to intervene as RUDA tax hike threatens industry,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318521-lcci-asks-punjab-cm-to-intervene-as-ruda-tax-hike-threatens-industry,"LAHORE: The Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has voiced serious concerns over the plight of industrial units operating in Saggian and surrounding areas falling under the jurisdiction of the Ravi Urban Development Authority (RUDA).
In an emergency meeting held at the LCCI, industrialists unanimously appealed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to take immediate notice of the crisis. Acting President of the LCCI Engineer Khalid Usman highlighted that the primary issue is the imposition of a District Collector (DC) rate that is reportedly 10 times higher than standard rates in RUDA-administered zones.
He said that over 1,000 industrial units -- ranging from small workshops to large factories -- are under severe threat due to these inflated charges. These SMEs employ more than 10,000 workers directly and support thousands of families indirectly. “If RUDA continues with this unfair taxation, we will witness widespread job losses and potential industrial collapse,” Usman warned.
Painting a bleak picture of the consequences, he added, “Forcing industries to pay unaffordable DC rates will result in shutdowns. When factories close, workers lose their livelihoods, leading to social unrest and law-and-order issues.”
The LCCI called for an immediate reduction in DC rates to reasonable levels, a halt to the sealing or eviction of industrial units, and the initiation of proper consultation with stakeholders before any new rates are finalised.
Participants in the meeting expressed hope that the CM would intervene to avert the crisis. They cautioned that destabilising this industrial hub could trigger ripple effects across Punjab’s economy, as these industries are integral to wider supply chains.

PFF VPs commit to unity and football development,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318543-pff-vps-commit-to-unity-and-football-development,"LAHORE: The newly-elected leadership of the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) has pledged to foster transparency, unity and grassroots development in football across the country.
Vice Presidents Hafiz Zakaullah, Naveed Aslam Lodhi and Dr. Muhammad Ali have reaffirmed their determination to go all out for promotion of football.

World Boxing apologises to Khelif,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318544-world-boxing-apologises-to-khelif,"PARIS: World Boxing on Wednesday apologised to the Algerian federation saying it had been incorrect to name boxer Imane Khelif in a statement announcing mandatory gender testing to determine the eligibility of male and female athletes wanting to take part in its competitions.
The international federation said it was introducing the policy after the furore surrounding boxers including women´s welterweight gold medallist Khelif at last year´s Paris Olympics. World Boxing will organise the boxing competition at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics after being granted provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee.
World Boxing said it had informed the Algerian Boxing Federation Khelif would have to undergo the test if she wanted to compete at the Eindhoven Box Cup in the Netherlands on June 5-10.
But the federation rowed back on having named Khelif in their statement. “The president of World Boxing does not think it was correct to have a named a specific athlete in a statement issued last Friday,” the body said.
World Boxing, it continued, “has written personally to the president of the Algerian Boxing Federation to offer a formal and sincere apology which acknowledges that greater effort should have been made to avoid linking the policy to any individual”.
Under the new policy, all athletes over 18 that want to participate in a World Boxing owned or sanctioned competition will need to undergo a PCR, or polymerase chain reaction genetic test, to determine what sex they were at birth and their eligibility to compete.
The PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex.
The test can be conducted by a nasal or mouth swab, or by taking a sample of saliva or blood. National federations will be responsible for testing and will be required to confirm the sex of their athletes when entering them into World Boxing competitions by producing certification of their chromosomal sex, as determined by a PCR test.

Stead to exit after seven years as Black Caps search for new coach,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318545-stead-to-exit-after-seven-years-as-black-caps-search-for-new-coach,"WELLINGTON: New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said Wednesday he will leave when his contract expires at the end of the month, ending a successful seven-year stint in charge.
The 53-year-old led New Zealand to victory in the 2021 World Test Championship, defeating India in the final. Stead was also in charge when New Zealand came within a whisker of a 50-over World Cup triumph in 2019, only losing the final to England on a boundary countback when the teams remained tied after a super over.
New Zealand´s most successful coach, Stead also guided the Black Caps to the finals of the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2024 Champions Trophy. Stead said the World Test Championship victory and the 3-0 Test sweep in India last year were career highlights, as was the way his team reacted after their 2019 World Cup heartbreak.
“There´s been some amazing memories over the past seven years, based around a group of fantastic and talented people who have gone out to give their best for their country, each other and for the fans,” said Stead.
“Brendon McCullum and Mike Hesson had left the team with strong values and a style of play, and I´ve just tried to build and shape that further to grow our ability to be consistent in everything we do.”
Stead had already said he would step away as coach of the ODI and T20 sides, but had remained interested in coaching the Test team. But New Zealand Cricket decided they want one head coach across all three formats, effectively ruling Stead out of the Test job.
Stead will continue to work with the squad this month as they prepare for July´s tour to Zimbabwe. Former South Africa white-ball coach, Rob Walter, is among the favourites to take over along with Shane Bond, the ex-New Zealand fast bowler and bowling coach.

Pakistan players rise in T20I rankings,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318546-pakistan-players-rise-in-t20i-rankings,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s dominant 3-0 series win over Bangladesh has propelled several of its players up the ICC Men’s T20I Player Rankings, with Mohammad Haris leading the charge.
Pakistan made headlines with a 3-0 whitewash of Bangladesh at home. Leading the charge was Player of the Series Mohammad Haris, who soared a massive 210 places to No.30 in the ICC Men’s T20I Batter Rankings after a blistering century in the final match.
He smashed a fiery unbeaten 107 off just 46 balls in the third T20I, backing up his earlier knocks of 41 and 31 to finish as the series’ top run-scorer with 167 runs at a strike rate of 201.12.
Haris, who played a standout role with the bat, has surged 210 places to a career-best 30th position in the rankings after scoring 179 runs in the series. His explosive unbeaten 107 in the third ODI in Lahore, laced with eight fours and seven sixes, earned him the Player of the Series title.
Hasan Nawaz also made substantial strides, climbing 57 places to joint-45th following his 121-run tally, while Saim Ayub advanced four places to secure the 61st spot. In the bowling department, Abbas Afridi’s 18-place jump sees him at joint-19th, while leg-spinners Shadab Khan and Abrar Ahmed progressed 24 and 45 places, respectively, to share the 59th position.
Bangladesh’s Tanzid Hasan emerged as his team’s top scorer with 106 runs, improving his ranking by 28 places to 53rd. Jakar Ali also made marginal progress, moving from 71st to 68th.
Meanwhile, England’s commanding series win over the West Indies in ODIs has led to ranking gains for Joe Root, Ben Ducket, and Harry Brook, while bowlers Adil Rashid and Saqib Mahmood also climbed significantly. West Indies batter Keacy Carty reached a career-best 12th position after his impressive run in the series, and Alzarri Joseph’s nine-place jump has placed him 18th among bowlers.

Kluivert confident Indonesia will edge China in World Cup qualifier,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318547-kluivert-confident-indonesia-willedge-china-in-world-cup-qualifier,"Jakarta: Patrick Kluivert said he is “very confident” Indonesia will get a positive result against China in front of a sell-out crowd in Jakarta on Thursday to move closer to a historic World Cup spot.
Barcelona and Dutch great Kluivert saw his team thrashed 5-1 by Australia in his first game in March but they recovered to beat Bahrain 1-0 on home soil days later to leave their World Cup hopes in their own hands.
“I´m very confident, and counting on my players that they will execute the things that we trained,” the coach told reporters Wednesday ahead of the clash in Jakarta. Kluivert took his squad to a training camp on the resort island of Bali to prepare for the crucial match.
“The things we want to see tomorrow, I saw very clearly. We know the importance of the game,” he said. Japan top Asian qualifying Group C and have already punched their ticket to North America in 2026, with Australia in a distant second in the other automatic qualifying place on 13 points.
With two rounds of matches to go, Saudi Arabia are third on 10 points, one point ahead of Indonesia in fourth who have won two games and drawn three. Bahrain and China are both on six points.
Teams finishing third and fourth will go into another round of qualifying -- Indonesia´s most likely route to their first World Cup since gaining independence as a country in 1945. Indonesia has embarked on a recruitment drive of Dutch-born players overseen by coaches from the country´s former colonial ruler to bring better results.

Five challenges Ancelotti faces as Brazil reign kicks off,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318549-five-challenges-ancelotti-faces-as-brazil-reign-kicks-off,"Sao Paulo: After a warm welcome to Brazil, Carlo Ancelotti, the Selecao´s first foreign coach in more than 50 years, is on a mission to fix a stuttering team and win back fans which starts on Thursday against Ecuador in a World Cup qualifier.
The 65-year-old Italian led his first training session on Monday in Guayaquil, Ecuador, ahead of what should be his first match, if his move from Real Madrid passes scrutiny by football´s governing body FIFA.
AFP identifies five issues Ancelotti faces: “The only goal is to win the 2026 World Cup,” said Ancelotti when he took the job. First he has to get there. The South American group is a two-year, 18-match marathon. Brazil´s campaign has included a first-ever home World Cup qualifying defeat, 1-0 at the Maracana to old enemy Argentina, part of a run of three straight defeats in 2023 that ended the coaching reign of Fernando Diniz.
Their last match was a 4-1 humiliation in Argentina in March that finished off former coach Dorival Junior. Yet the format is forgiving. The top six in the 10-team group qualify directly for the World Cup. Brazil are fourth, six points clear of Venezuela in seventh with four matches to go.
Ecuador may be second in the group, but are only two points ahead of Brazil, who then host Paraguay, who are fifth. Qualifying ends in September with a visit to last-place Chile and a home game against struggling Bolivia.
Brazil is still churning out dazzling attackers but the production line has stalled on No. 9s. In this century, Romario, Ronaldo and Adriano have all led the attack and banged in the goals. The nearest player to a classic No. 9 in Ancelotti´s first squad is a player he coached at Everton, Richarlison, now of Tottenham.
Yet Ancelotti has won without a central striker before. His 2024 Champions League winning side was led by two Brazilians: Vinicius Jr, who is in Ancelotti´s squad, and Rodrygo, who he did not select. Ancelotti also has Raphinha of Barcelona, who was joint top scorer in this season´s Champions League.
A bigger problem might be supplying the attackers, veteran Brazilian football journalist Juca Kfouri told AFP. With Brazil´s youth academies focusing on defensive midfielders and quick wingers rather than classic creators, the Selecao faces a shortage of ideas in midfield.
In Brazil´s last two outings Dorival Junior tried Bruno Guimaraes, Gerson, Andre and Joelinton in the role. None convinced. At Madrid, Ancelotti “had Toni Kroos as a supply line for Vini. Brazil does not have a Toni Kroos,” said sports writer Tim Vickery on his ´Brazilian Shirt Name´ podcast.
Ancelotti has recalled Kroos´s former Real Madrid midfield partner Casemiro, although the 33-year-old now with Manchester United is primarily a defensive player to add, the coach said, “charisma, personality and talent.” The supply of swashbuckling fullbacks, such as Carlos Alberto, Cafu and Roberto Carlos -- another hallmark of great Brazil teams -- has also dried up.
Ancelotti has recalled Carlos Augusto, part of the Inter Milan team crushed in the Champions League final, and picked Flamengo duo Wesley Franca and Alex Sandro after seeing them play last week in a 1-0 victory over Venezuelan team Deportivo Tachira in the Copa Libertadores.

"Boisson continues dream French Open run, Djokovic, Sinner eye semis",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318550-boisson-continues-dream-french-open-run-djokovic-sinner-eye-semis,"PARIS: An inspired Lois Boisson delighted Roland Garros as the French world number 361 downed Mirra Andreeva on Wednesday to set up a French Open semi-final against Coco Gauff, before Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic both chase men´s last-four berths.
Boisson, making her debut at a Grand Slam event, powered her way to a thrilling 7-6 (8/6), 6-3 victory on a raucous Court Philippe Chatrier to become the first Frenchwoman to reach the semis since Marion Bartoli in 2011.
The 22-year-old, who was due to play at last year´s French Open but suffered a knee injury the week before the tournament, is the lowest-ranked woman to reach a major semi-final in 40 years.
“It was incredible to play in front of this crowd and feel support like that,” said Boisson, after hitting 24 winners past Russian sixth seed Andreeva to follow up her fourth-round win over world number three Jessica Pegula with an even more surprising victory.
A dramatic first set saw Andreeva miss a set point after leading 5-3, before Boisson fought back only to see three chances of her own come and go in a marathon 12th game.  But the wildcard fought off another set point in the tie-break, before taking her next opportunity, cupping her ear towards the adoring crowd in celebration.
Andreeva gathered herself and quickly built a 3-0 lead in the second set, only to be left jumping up and down in anger after a missed backhand gave Boisson a much-needed hold of serve.
The 18-year-old Andreeva started to crumble under the pressure, being given a warning for slamming a ball into the top tier of the stands as the atmosphere heated up under the Chatrier roof.
She was roundly booed when she then argued with the umpire over a line call, and was broken later that game after another double-fault to suddenly trail 4-3. Boisson made it six consecutive games to secure a seismic victory as Andreeva, one of the pre-tournament favourites, completely unravelled.
Second seed Gauff battled back from a set down to defeat fellow American, and Australian Open champion, Madison Keys in an error-strewn opening match 6-7 (6/8), 6-4, 6-1.  The former US Open champion upped her level enough after dropping the first set to get through a quarter-final littered with 14 double-faults and a whopping 101 unforced errors.
“It means a lot, especially getting through this tough match today, it wasn´t an easy match and I´m very happy to get through it,” she said. Gauff, the 2022 losing finalist, will be hoping to go at least one better than when she lost to Iga Swiatek in last year´s semi-final.
Swiatek continues her bid for a fourth consecutive Roland Garros title in a blockbuster clash with world number one Aryna Sabalenka in Thursday´s other semi-final.  Djokovic will compete in a record 19th French Open quarter-final against last year´s runner-up Alexander Zverev in the night-session match.
The German third seed will be well rested after his last-16 opponent Tallon Griekspoor retired on Monday with an abdominal injury while trailing 6-4, 3-0. Zverev, who lost to Carlos Alcaraz in last year´s final, continues his latest bid for a maiden Grand Slam title after three runner-up finishes.
“For me, Carlos is the favourite. Then I would say the next three in line are Jannik, myself, and Novak, right? I still believe that,” said Zverev, who could meet world number one Sinner in the semi-finals.
Zverev has made at least the last four at the past four French Opens and is into his seventh quarter-final. The 28-year-old has won five of his 13 career matches with Djokovic, including in Melbourne in January when the Serb retired injured from their semi-final.
Djokovic, a three-time champion at Roland Garros, is just the second player to record 100 wins at the event after 14-time winner Rafael Nadal (112). “It´s a very pretty number, but 101 victories sounds better,” said 38-year-old Djokovic who has reached the quarter-finals at the clay-court major for a 16th consecutive year.  World number six Djokovic is chasing a record 25th major title. Italian Sinner takes on unseeded Kazakh Alexander Bublik, who hailed his emotional four-set win over fifth seed Jack Draper in the last 16 as the “best moment of his life”.

"Reviving Pak sports glory top priority, says Pirzada",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318552-reviving-pak-sports-glory-top-priority-says-pirzada,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) Director General Yasir Pirzada has unveiled an ambitious roadmap focused on infrastructure development, athlete training, and long-term sports promotion -- underscoring Pakistan’s determination to reclaim its sporting stature on the regional stage.

Marsh back to lead Australia in WI T20s,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318553-marsh-back-to-lead-australia-in-wi-t20s,"SYDNEY: Mitchell Marsh will captain Australia on his return to the Twenty20 squad named Wednesday for a five-match series in the West Indies, while explosive batsman Mitchell Owen earned a first call-up.
Fast bowler Josh Hazlewood is back, having been rested for Australia´s last T20 series against Pakistan in November, and left-arm spinner Matthew Kuhnemann makes the squad for the first time.
Marsh missed the Pakistan series and has recovered from a lower back injury that kept him out of the Champions Trophy earlier this year. Australia´s Test and 50-over captain Pat Cummins, Travis Head and Mitchell Starc were left out of the 16-man squad for the series next month.
They will return to Australia following three Tests against the West Indies beginning on June 25. Young batsman Jake Fraser-McGurk was dropped, but there was a maiden call-up for the 23-year-old Owen after a Big Bash League season where he was the highest run scorer and made a memorable 108 off 42 balls in the final.
Australia have won 12 of their past 14 matches as they build towards next year´s T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka. Chairman of selectors George Bailey said: “We have a busy T20 schedule coming up through this series, followed by three against South Africa and New Zealand and five matches against India at home as we continue to refine and build a squad we think will be the right fit for the World Cup on the subcontinent.”
All-rounder Marsh was in fine form during the Indian Premier League season, scoring 627 runs for Lucknow Super Giants, including a maiden century. Cameron Green and Cooper Connolly also return following injury.
Australia T20 squad:
Mitchell Marsh (capt), Sean Abbott, Cooper Connolly, Tim David, Ben Dwarshuis, Nathan Ellis, Cameron Green, Aaron Hardie, Josh Hazlewood, Josh Inglis, Spencer Johnson, Matt Kuhnemann, Glenn Maxwell, Mitch Owen, Matthew Short, Adam Zampa.

Virat Kohli dedicates Indian Premier League title to fans,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318554-virat-kohli-dedicates-indian-premier-league-title-to-fans,"Ahmedabad : Virat Kohli said it was “as much for the fans” after he finally won the IPL at his 18th attempt, with Bengaluru´s ecstatic supporters preparing to welcome home their heroes.
Royal Challengers Bengaluru beat Punjab Kings by six runs in a roller-coaster IPL final Tuesday in Ahmedabad in front of more than 91,000 fans, who erupted in joy when Kohli lifted the trophy at the world´s biggest cricket stadium.
The 36-year-old Kohli, the only man to have played all 18 years for the same IPL team since its inaugural season in 2008, fittingly top-scored with 43 to anchor Bengaluru to victory.
Kohli, who captained Bengaluru in 143 matches between 2011 and 2023, had been on the losing side in three previous IPL finals. Later Wednesday he will celebrate with his teammates at the main stadium in the southern city of Bengaluru.
Police said that initial plans for an open-top bus parade would not take place in Bengaluru´s notoriously bad traffic. “I said it straight away -- this title is as much for the fans as it is for us,” said Kohli.
“These people have backed us relentlessly for 18 years. “We´ve had horrible seasons and great ones too, but they turned up for every game in Bengaluru. “I´ve never seen loyalty like that. That´s what made me stay.”
India cricket great Sachin Tendulkar led the tributes for Kohli and Bengaluru. “Congratulations on their first-ever IPL title. Fitting that jersey no. 18 lifts the trophy in the 18th edition,” Tendulkar posted on X.
Bengaluru head coach Andy Flower said: “Virat in his 18th year of competing in the IPL, I think that makes it really special for everyone involved. “I am really happy for him and really proud of the way that he´s driven the side forward.”
The tech city of Bengaluru erupted in midnight celebrations after RCB, who scored 190-9, restricted Punjab to 184-7. Thousands of fans wore Kohli´s number 18 shirt and danced in the streets as fireworks lit up the sky.
“It´s not an easy tournament to win,” Punjab head coach Ricky Ponting said. “You have to think long and hard about that, think how many good teams they have had over the years.
“You can see what it meant to (Kohli), his wife and all the RCB fans to finally get the monkey off the back and win an IPL title.” Former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden said on broadcaster JioHotstar: “The IPL 2025 will be forever etched in the annals of cricket -- not just for Virat Kohli, but for the RCB fans who stood by them through thick and thin.
“It shows how consistency and belief can finally lead to a title. Over the past five years they´ve always been close, and now they´ve crossed the line.”Ecstatic Kohli revels in first IPL title, albeit below Test highs
Virat Kohli said on Tuesday he had given his “youth and prime” to land one of the best moments of his career as Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured him a first-ever Indian Premier League T20 title at the 18th time of asking. The 36-year-old Kohli, however, confessed that the six-run win over Punjab Kings in Ahmedabad, sweet as it was, ranked “five levels below Test cricket”.
The former India captain, who announced his retirement from Test cricket last month, top-scored with 43 as Bengaluru posted 190-9 in the final. It was not his most fluent innings, but it was vital for RCB as their bowlers then restricted Punjab to 184-7 with a crowd of more than 91,000 erupting in joy for their superstar.
A teary-eyed Kohli, who has played in all 18 of RCB´s campaigns including the three previous finals that they lost, dropped to the ground before being hugged by his teammates.
“I´ve given this team my youth, my prime, my experience. I gave it everything I have. I never thought this day would come. I was overcome with emotion as soon as the last ball was bowled,” said Kohli before launching into an impassioned defence of the oldest and longest format of the game.
“This moment is right up there with the best moments in my career. But it still ranks five levels below Test cricket. That´s how much I value Test cricket. And that´s how much I love Test cricket. “So I would just urge the youngsters coming through... if you want to earn respect in world cricket all over, take up Test cricket, give your heart and soul to it.”

"Khamenei dismisses US nuclear proposal, vows to keep enriching uranium",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318626-khamenei-dismisses-us-nuclear-proposal-vows-to-keep-enriching-uranium,"DUBAI: Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Wednesday that abandoning uranium enrichment was “100 per cent” against the country’s interests, rejecting a central US demand in talks to resolve a decades-long dispute over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.
The US proposal for a new nuclear deal was presented to Iran on Saturday by Oman, which has mediated talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff.
After five rounds of talks, several hard-to-bridge issues remain, including Iran’s insistence on maintaining uranium enrichment on its soil and Tehran’s refusal to ship abroad its entire existing stockpile of highly enriched uranium - possible raw material for nuclear bombs.
Khamenei, who has the final say on all matters of state, said nothing about halting the talks, but said the US proposal “contradicts our nation’s belief in self-reliance and the principle of ‘We Can’”.
“Uranium enrichment is the key to our nuclear programme and the enemies have focused on the enrichment,” Khamenei said during a televised speech marking the anniversary of the death of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
“The proposal that the Americans have presented is 100 per cent against our interests ... The rude and arrogant leaders of America repeatedly demand that we should not have a nuclear programme. Who are you to decide whether Iran should have enrichment?,” he added.

Modi to visit held Kashmir to unveil strategic railway,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318627-modi-to-visit-held-kashmir-to-unveil-strategic-railway,"HELD SRINAGAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is to make his first visit to Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K) since a conflict between India and Pakistan last month, inaugurating a strategic railway to the mountainous region, his office said on Wednesday.
Modi is set to visit on Friday to open the Chenab Bridge, a 1,315-metre-long steel and concrete span that connects two mountains with an arch 359 metres above the river below.
“The project establishes all-weather, seamless rail connectivity between the Kashmir Valley and the rest of the country,” the Prime Minister´s Office said in a statement.
Modi is expected to flag off a special train.
The 272-kms Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla railway -- with 36 tunnels and 943 bridges -- has been constructed “aiming to transform regional mobility and driving socio-economic integration”, the statement added.
Its dramatic centrepiece is the Chenab Bridge, which India calls the “world´s highest railway arch bridge”.
While several road and pipeline bridges are higher, Guinness World Records confirmed that Chenab trumps the previous highest railway bridge, the Najiehe in China.
Indian Railways calls the $24-million bridge “arguably the biggest civil engineering challenge faced by any railway project in India in recent history”. The bridge will facilitate the movement of people and goods -- as well as troops -- that was previously possible only via treacherous mountain roads and air.
The train line could slash travel time between the town of Katra and held Srinagar, the region´s key city, by half, taking around three hours.

Sweden to rent prison cells in Estonia as inmate numbers soar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318628-sweden-to-rent-prison-cells-in-estonia-as-inmate-numbers-soar,"STOCKHOLM: Sweden said on Wednesday it had reached an agreement with Estonia to rent prison cells for up to 600 prisoners who could serve their sentences abroad, anticipating heavy pressure on its own facilities.
According to a deal struck between the two countries, Sweden would be able to rent 400 cells in the Tartu prison in Estonia´s southeast, with a capacity to house 600 prisoners. Sweden´s Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer said Estonia was “a very important and close partner”, and bound by the same international commitments when it came to prisoners.
“There are therefore very good conditions for a deeper cooperation between Sweden and Estonia,” Strommer told a press conference.
He also noted that the implementation of the deal would require some changes to Swedish legislation and would need to be approved by Sweden´s parliament by a three-fourths majority.
Several other European countries have already experimented with similar solutions, including Norway and Belgium which have rented cells in The Netherlands in the past, while Denmark is currently preparing to send inmates to Kosovo.
Sweden has seen a rise in violent crime in recent years, with shootings and bombings linked to score-settling between rival criminal networks.
Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson´s centre-right government, backed in parliament by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, came to power in 2022 with a vow to get tough on crime. Ingemar Kihlstrom of the Christian Democrats, a junior coalition partner, told reporters the government was instituting harsher sentences and giving police more powers to bring criminals to justice.

Paris seeks personhood status for River Seine,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318629-paris-seeks-personhood-status-for-river-seine,"PARIS: French authorities want to give legal rights to the River Seine to better defend the world-famous waterway in court and protect its fragile ecosystem, part of a global movement to grant legal personhood to nature.
In a resolution adopted on Wednesday, the Paris City Council called on parliament to pass a law granting the Seine legal personhood to enable “an independent guardian authority to defend its rights in court”.
“The Seine must be able to defend itself, as a subject of law and not as an object, because it will always be under attack,” said Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo.
Conservationists have backed granting fragile ecosystems such as rivers and mountains basic legal rights to better protect them.
In a world first, New Zealand in 2017 recognised the Whanganui River revered by Indigenous people as a living entity, with legislation combining Western legal precedent and Maori beliefs.
In 2022, Spain granted personhood status to the Mar Menor, one of Europe´s largest saltwater lagoons, to give its threatened ecosystem better protection. The Paris Council based its decision on the conclusions of a citizens´ convention on the future of the Seine held between March and May.
Fifty citizens chosen at random proposed granting the Seine fundamental rights such as “the right to exist, to flow and to regenerate”.
The Seine must be considered an ecosystem that “no one can claim ownership of”, where the preservation of life must “take precedence over everything”, the convention concluded. It also noted “positive” change, with the Seine now home to around 40 species of fish, compared to only four in 1970.

Bangladesh govt revises definition of freedom fighter,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318631-bangladesh-govt-revises-definition-of-freedom-fighter,"DHAKA: The government last night promulgated an ordinance redefining the term “freedom fighter” (Bir Muktijoddha) and introducing three new categories.
The new categories are Muktijuddher Shohojogi (associate of the Liberation War); Muktijoddha Poribar (family of a freedom fighter); and Muktijuddher Shohojogi Poribar (family of a Liberation War associate).
The definition of “associate of the Liberation War” specifically includes all Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) and Members of the Provincial Assembly (MPAs) who were affiliated with the wartime provisional government of Bangladesh (Mujibnagar Government) and later considered members of the constituent assembly.
Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmad, and more than 400 others were members of the constituent assembly and used to be recognised as freedom fighters.
The ordinance, however, included the Mujibnagar government in the definition of “Bir Muktijoddha”.
According to the ordinance, the new definition of a Bir Muktijoddha reads:
“Bir Muktijoddha is someone who, between March 26 and December 16, 1971, either prepared for war and received training within villages across the country, or crossed the border into India to enroll in various training camps with the aim of participating in the Liberation War. These individuals actively took part in the war against the occupying and invading Pakistani armed forces and their local collaborators -- Razakars, Al-Badr, Al-Shams, the then Muslim League, Jamaat-e-Islami, Nezame Islam, and the Peace Committee -- towards achieving Bangladesh’s independence.
Those recognised as freedom fighters must be civilians who were of the minimum age as determined by the government during the time of war.
Also included as freedom fighters are members of the armed forces, East Pakistan Rifles (EPR), police, the Mujibnagar government and its recognised forces, naval commandos, Kilo Force, and Ansar members.

India sets date of population and caste census,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318632-india-sets-date-of-population-and-caste-census,"NEW DELHI: The world´s most populous nation India will conduct a census in 2027, its first since 2011, the government said on Wednesday, which will also count caste -- a controversial accounting not done since the country´s independence.
“It has been decided to conduct Population Census-2027 in two phases along with enumeration of castes,” the Ministry of Home Affairs said in a statement.
Most of the vast nation will take part in the census on March 1, 2027, but for the high-altitude Himalayan regions, the counting will take place earlier before snow sets in -- on October 1, 2026.
Those areas include the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, as well as in Ladakh, and the contested region of Jammu and Kashmir. Caste remains a crucial determinant of one´s station in life in India, with a rigid societal chasm dividing those of higher castes -- the beneficiaries of ingrained cultural privileges -- from people of lower castes, who suffer entrenched discrimination.
More than two-thirds of India´s 1.4 billion people are estimated to be on the lower rungs of a millennia-old social hierarchy that divides Hindus by function and social standing.
The decision to include detailed caste data as part of the next census -- originally due in 2021 -- was approved by a government meeting headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in May.

100 Democrats urge Trump officials to restore deportation relief for Afghans in US,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318633-100-democrats-urge-trump-officials-to-restore-deportation-relief-for-afghans-in-us,"WASHINGTON: A group of 101 Democratic lawmakers is urging top Trump administration officials to restore deportation protections for thousands of Afghans in the US, warning they would be sent back to “devastating humanitarian and economic conditions” in Afghanistan.
In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the lawmakers called on the administration to restore access to the Temporary Protected Status program for Afghans, saying women and children could face particular harm under the Taliban-led government in place since 2021. “The grave conditions that forced Afghan nationals to flee and seek refuge in the US following the return of the Taliban to power remain,” the lawmakers said.
“Because of this harsh reality, forcing Afghan nationals in the US to return to Afghanistan would be reckless and inhumane, and would threaten the safety and well-being of thousands of individuals and families, especially women and girls.” The effort is being led by US Senator Chris Van Hollen, Representative Glenn Ivey and Senator Amy Klobuchar. TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the US if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event.

Refugee camp schools at risk in Bangladesh in aid crisis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318634-refugee-camp-schools-at-risk-in-bangladesh-in-aid-crisis,"DHAKA: Global aid cuts have forced the UN children´s agency to sack more than 1,000 teachers in Bangladesh camps for Rohingya refugees, with more jobs at risk without funding.
Around a million members of the persecuted and mostly Muslim Rohingya live in squalid relief camps in Bangladesh, most of them after fleeing a 2017 military crackdown in neighbouring Myanmar.
The teacher firings come in the wake of dramatic US funding cuts.
“Due to the global aid funding crisis, Unicef has had to make difficult decisions impacting early education services for Rohingya refugee children,” the agency said in a statement late on Tuesday.
Unicef said that the contracts of 1,179 people -- working on kindergarten and primary schools -- were terminated. Before the cuts, there were an estimated 4,000 teachers in the camps, according to Bangladeshi senior government aid official, Md Shamsud Douza.
Schools have closed for Eidul Azha, but if fresh funding is not secured by the time term resumes at the end of June, more teachers could lose their jobs.
“The return of the rest of the workers...depends on new funding being secured,” Unicef added. “We remain committed and hopeful that increased support will restore what every child deserves: a future.”

Around 100 dead cats found at Japan woman’s home,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1318635-around-100-dead-cats-found-at-japan-woman-s-home,"TOKYO: Around 100 dead cats were discovered at the squalid home of a woman in southwest Japan who belonged to an animal welfare group, a local official said on Wednesday.
The group, Animal Assist Senju, apologised on social media, posting pictures of the trash-strewn house it said “was overflowing with faeces and urine”.
The residence belonged to one of its staffers, who the group said was found to have gone rogue and taken in many cats without consulting the organisation.
One cat was found “unrecognisable” with “its skin partly peeled off and paws covered in faeces and urine”, the group said in an Instagram post at the weekend.
Kumamoto City´s animal protection centre told AFP on Wednesday that the dead felines were initially estimated to total “around 100”.
Media reports however said the number is now thought to be higher.
Animal Assist Senju, based in the region of Kumamoto, says it rescues cats and dogs from animal shelters and transfers them to new homes.
“All the members of our group take what happened very seriously,” it said in another Instagram post.
“We can only imagine what agonising pain the cats went through before dying.”
The woman is no longer allowed to take in cats, it said.
