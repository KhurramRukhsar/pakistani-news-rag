"Salutes, smiles and solidarity: Rare display of Shehbaz Sharif’s vision of institutional harmony",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315398-salutes-smiles-and-solidarity-rare-display-of-shehbaz-sharif-s-vision-of-institutional-harmony,"ISLAMABAD: The political and military elite witnessed a rare display of mutual respect and understanding on Friday night, as the President, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the Field Marshal stood side by side in a show of unity.
The high-profile dinner, hosted by the Field Marshal, celebrated Pakistan’s military victory over India during the recently concluded Operation Bunyanum Marsoos.
In a gesture that drew admiration from all present, the Field Marshal -- although not wearing a cap, as it was not required -- saluted both the President and the Prime Minister upon their arrival and again at their departure.
The salutes were seen as symbolic of the respect and institutional harmony.
The event brought together a distinguished gathering of the country’s top leadership -- with senior political figures, general officers from all three armed services, and heads of constitutional institutions in attendance. Such a broad-based civil-military assembly is rare and underscored the significance of the occasion.
“This was also a rare moment for the premier as his political vision of institutional harmony stood realised and his stance vindicated,” commented one of the participants.
He observed that the Prime Minister enjoyed clear admiration in military circles -- a reflection of his longstanding image as a hardworking administrator, a doer, and a go-getter. At one point during the evening, a round of applause broke out for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, highlighting the strong rapport he shares with the armed forces.
While the President remained seated for most of the event due to health reasons, Prime Minister Sharif was seen informally engaging with senior military officers, exchanging pleasantries and light-hearted conversation in a relaxed and cordial atmosphere.
The evening also featured the presentation of commemorative gifts by the Field Marshal and other senior military commanders to key national leaders, including the President, Prime Minister, Chairman Senate, Speaker National Assembly, and others -- a gesture seen as a token of appreciation and unity.
The dinner was hosted to honour not only the political leadership but also the steadfast commitment of the armed forces and indomitable spirit of the people of Pakistan, as demonstrated during Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, a defining moment in the country’s defence history. According to the source, the evening concluded in a display of renewed resolve, with civil and military leadership united.

Qalandars claim third PSL title with dominant six-wicket win over Gladiators,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315399-qalandars-claim-third-psl-title-with-dominant-six-wicket-win-over-gladiators,"LAHORE: Lahore Qalandars clinched their third Pakistan Super League title after they decimated Quetta Gladiators by six wickets in the tournament’s 10th edition clinical final at the packed Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday night.
The victory, achieved with one ball to spare, marked another chapter in the Qalandars’ recent dominance of Pakistan’s premier T20 competition, adding to their previous triumphs in PSL 7 and 8 (2022, 2023).
In their chase of Quetta’s 201 for nine, Lahore clobbered 204 for four in 19.5 overs. The foundation for this comprehensive victory was laid by a magnificent chase orchestrated by Kusal Perera, who remained unbeaten on 62 runs off 31 balls, striking five boundaries and four towering sixes. His match-winning knock was perfectly complemented by Sikandar Raza’s explosive cameo of 22 not out from just 7 balls, featuring two fours and two sixes, as the pair added an unbroken 59 runs for the fifth wicket to seal the title in an emphatic fashion.
The Qalandars’ pursuit of 202 runs got off to a steady start with an opening partnership of 39 runs between Fakhar Zaman (11) and Mohammad Naeem, before Naeem took center stage with a blistering knock of 46 runs off 26 balls. His innings, which included one four and six maximums, provided the early momentum that would prove crucial in the successful chase. Abdullah Shafique continued the aggressive approach with a well-constructed 41 runs off 28 balls, hitting four boundaries and a six, as he combined with Naeem for a second-wicket partnership of 46 runs that kept the required run rate within manageable limits.
However, the turning point of the match came in the 19th over of Quetta’s bowling effort, when Mohammad Amir’s expensive spell conceded 18 crucial runs, effectively sealing the Gladiators’ fate. The veteran left-arm pacer, who had been expected to deliver in the pressure moments, instead provided the Qalandars with the breathing space they needed to cruise home. Amir finished with figures of 1 for 41, while his bowling colleagues Faheem Ashraf (1-49), Abrar Ahmed (1-27), and Usman Tariq (1-38) also proved expensive as the Gladiators’ bowling attack wilted under pressure.
The drama wasn’t limited to the cricket action, as the match witnessed an unfortunate collision between Mohammad Naeem and Asif Ali during the 12th over, which forced the Qalandars to use a concussion substitute. Mohammad Akhlaq replaced Asif Ali for the remainder of the innings, highlighting the physical intensity of the high-stakes encounter.
Earlier in the day, Hasan Nawaz had played a match-defining knock of 76 runs off 43 balls to guide the 2019 PSL champions Quetta Gladiators to what seemed like a competitive total of 201 for 9 wickets. After winning the toss and electing to bat first, the Gladiators found themselves in early trouble at 21 for 2 within the first four overs, losing both openers Saud Shakeel (4) and Finn Allen (12) cheaply to Shaheen Shah Afridi’s inspired bowling.
Rilee Rossouw provided some respite with a quickfire 22 off 11 balls, striking four boundaries and a six, before departing in the seventh over with the score at 58 for 3. It was then that Hasan Nawaz took charge of the innings, building crucial partnerships and accelerating the scoring rate with his aggressive stroke play. The wicket-keeper batsman’s innings was studded with eight fours and four towering sixes, as he counter-attacked the Qalandars’ bowling attack with remarkable composure under pressure.
Avishka Fernando complemented Nawaz’s efforts with a valuable contribution of 29 runs off 22 balls, hitting six boundaries to maintain the momentum in the middle overs. The partnership between Nawaz and Fernando of 67 runs steadied the ship before Fernando’s dismissal in the 13th over triggered another mini collapse. Dinesh Chandimal provided late fireworks with a quickfire 22 off 13 balls, including two massive sixes, while Faheem Ashraf chipped in with 12 runs off just 4 balls featuring a four and a six.
However, the innings took a dramatic turn in the final three overs as Qalandars’ bowlers, led by Shaheen Shah Afridi, struck back with a flurry of wickets. Afridi finished with impressive figures of 3 for 24, proving why he remains one of the most feared fast bowlers in T20 cricket. Salman Mirza and Haris Rauf claimed two wickets each, though at a higher cost of 51 and 41 runs respectively, while Sikandar Raza and Rishad Hossain also chipped in with a wicket apiece. The Gladiators lost five wickets for just 30 runs between the 171-run mark and the end of their innings, a collapse that ultimately proved costly despite Nawaz’s heroic efforts.
The final was graced by several distinguished guests, with President Asif Ali Zardari serving as the guest of honour for the closing ceremony. He had arrived from Islamabad early Sunday morning specifically to attend the title match. The presence of Pakistan Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf, US Chargé d’Affaires Natalie Baker, Federal Minister for Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb, and various political leaders and high civil and military officials added to the grandeur of the occasion.
In a touching tribute during the day’s proceedings, the Pakistan Navy received special recognition in the presence of Admiral Naveed Ashraf, who keenly witnessed the tribute ceremony. This activity was marked to celebrate the Pakistan armed forces’ valor that humbled India in Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, with the Pakistan Navy being formally honored during the innings break of the final. Similar ceremonies had earlier paid tribute to the Pakistan Army and Air Force, showcasing the nation’s appreciation for its military services.
The PSL-X champions collected a prize of US$500,000 along with the coveted silverware, while the runners-up received US$200,000, marking the end of another successful edition of Pakistan’s premier T20 tournament. For the Qalandars, this victory represents the continuation of their golden era in PSL cricket, while the Gladiators will rue the missed opportunity to add to their solitary title from 2019.
The match concluded with Lahore Qalandars reaching 204 for 4 in 19.5 overs, a comprehensive victory that showcased their depth, skill, and mental fortitude when it mattered most. As the confetti fell and celebrations began at the Gaddafi Stadium, the Qalandars had once again proved why they remain the standard-bearers of PSL cricket.

China will never allow any country to violate Pakistan’s borders or sovereignty: Chinese scholar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315400-china-will-never-allow-any-country-to-violate-pakistan-s-borders-or-sovereignty-chinese-scholar,"ISLAMABAD: In the aftermath of the recent Pakistan-India military skirmish, China has reaffirmed its unshakeable alliance with Pakistan, declaring it an “iron-clad friend” and vowing to fully support its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
Beijing sent a strong message to the global community: “Do not mess with China.” The joint military collaboration between China and Pakistan — particularly evident in the use of Chinese defence technology — has astonished global powers.
Victor Zhikai Gao, a prominent Chinese foreign policy expert and Vice President of the Center for China and Globalization, described the conflict as a powerful demonstration of the depth of China-Pakistan military ties and a clear reflection of China’s rising defence superiority on the global stage. He emphasized that the Pakistan Air Force deployed weaponry largely manufactured by China or co-produced through China-Pakistan cooperation, marking a new height in operational partnership between the two nations.
Highlighting the performance of Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets, Gao asserted that these aircraft outclassed some of the most advanced European and Russian warplanes. He termed this not just a technological triumph but a strategic signal to world powers — especially the United States and its allies —that China’s military capabilities now stand among the best in the world. Gao warned that any provocation or interference would carry grave consequences.
He went on to say that the China-Pakistan relationship is no longer limited to ideological or diplomatic lines but has transformed into a fully operational alliance. “China will never allow any country to violate Pakistan’s borders or sovereignty,” Gao affirmed. This partnership, he stressed, will not only preserve the balance of power in South Asia but will also guarantee regional peace and stability.
On a global level, Victor Gao criticised the US-led “Quad” alliance and President Biden’s Cold War-era strategies, cautioning that such policies promote proxy wars and global instability. He noted that President Trump’s bilateral and comparatively non-interventionist approach was relatively less harmful.
He also condemned the US for its silence and complicity in Israeli attacks on Gaza, which resulted in the deaths of civilians, pregnant women, and children. Gao called this a “shameful stain on humanity” and urged the US to adopt a role grounded in justice, peace, and compassion rather than fueling global conflicts.
This entire episode, Gao concluded, clearly illustrates that China is not only a regional force but an emerging global power. Its alliance with Pakistan is not merely symbolic — it is a strategic doctrine, resistant to all external pressure. “Our technology is battle-tested, our alliances are durable, and our tolerance for provocation is limited,” he declared in a clear warning to adversaries.

Iraq’s water reserves lowest in 80 years: official,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315404-iraq-s-water-reserves-lowest-in-80-years-official,"BAGHDAD: Iraq’s water reserves are at their lowest in 80 years after a dry rainy season, a government official said Sunday, as its share from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers shrinks.
Water is a major issue in the country of 46 million people undergoing a serious environmental crisis because of climate change, drought, rising temperatures and declining rainfall.
Authorities also blame upstream dams built in neighbouring Iran and Turkey for dramatically lowering the flow of the once-mighty Tigris and Euphrates, which have irrigated Iraq for millennia.
“The summer season should begin with at least 18 billion cubic meters... yet we only have about 10 billion cubic meters,” water resources ministry spokesperson Khaled Shamal said.
“Last year our strategic reserves were better. It was double what we have now,” Shamal said. “We haven’t seen such a low reserve in 80 years,” he added, saying this was mostly due to the reduced flow from the two rivers.
Iraq currently receives less than 40 percent of its share from the Tigris and Euphrates, according to Shamal.
He said sparse rainfall this winter and low water levels from melting snow has worsened the situation in Iraq, considered by the United Nations to be one of the five countries most vulnerable to some impacts of climate change. Water shortages have forced many farmers in Iraq to abandon the land, and authorities have drastically reduced farming activity to ensure sufficient supplies of drinking water.
Agricultural planning in Iraq always depends on water, and this year it aims to preserve “green spaces and productive areas” amounting to more than 1.5 million Iraqi dunams (375,000 hectares), said Shamal.
Last year, authorities allowed farmers to cultivate 2.5 million dunams of corn, rice, and orchards, according to the water ministry.
Water has been a source of tension between Iraq and Turkey, which has urged Baghdad to adopt efficient water management plans.
In 2024, Iraq and Turkey signed a 10-year “framework agreement,” mostly to invest in projects to ensure better water resources management.

China possibly ‘obstructing Sutlej flow into India’: Indian expert,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315405-china-possibly-obstructing-sutlej-flow-into-india-indian-expert,"ISLAMABAD: Amid ongoing Pakistan-India tensions, concerns have emerged in India over the water it receives from China, as Indian expert Dr. V. Nityananda suggested that Beijing may be discreetly obstructing the flow of Sutlej River into Indian territory.
In the wake of the Pahalgam incident – blatantly contravening international norms and laws -- India last month announced the suspension of Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and threatened to halt the flow of water into Pakistan. The IWT governs the distribution of rivers between Pakistan and India.
According to a report by Indian journal Business Today, Dr. V. Nityananda, a geospatial researcher and former NASA station manager, conducted research using satellite data on the flow of Sutlej River. The data reportedly indicates a significant decline in the Sutlej River’s water volume within India. This decrease in flow is occurring before the river enters Indian territory from Tibet.
In a statement, Dr. V. Nityananda claimed that in the past years, the volume of water flowing into India from the Sutlej River has dropped by over 75 percent. “The amount of water coming to India through the Sutlej has dipped from 8,000 gigalitres to just 2,000 gigalitres.”
He questioned whether China is deliberately controlling the flow of water into India. There are reportedly two major reasons behind this massive decline in Sutlej’s flow into India – China may have altered the river’s course, or the decrease could be due to natural causes.
However, it stated, the second possibility appears less likely, as climate data indicates that glaciers in the Himalayas are melting rapidly. In such a case, the river’s flow should be increasing, not decreasing.
In the Yarlung Zangbo (Tsangpo) Gorge in Tibet, China has constructed dams and hydroelectric infrastructure. The dams have enhanced China’s technical capacity and enabled its control of the flow of water that reaches India.
China and India do not have any formal water-sharing agreement. The data-sharing agreement between the two countries expired in 2023. As a result, China is not obligated to provide India with information regarding the flow of water in the Sutlej River. There is no public evidence to suggest that China is deliberately reducing the water flow. “However, due to China’s increased control and the absence of agreements, India’s concerns have grown.”
Another independent expert has indicated that India has failed in studying and taking benefit from the satellite imagery for reading the flow of water and changes in Sutlej River.

Bangladesh court begins first trial of Hasina-era officials,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315408-bangladesh-court-begins-first-trial-of-hasina-era-officials,"DHAKA: Bangladesh began the first trial on Sunday at a special court prosecuting former senior figures connected to the ousted government of Sheikh Hasina, the chief prosecutor said.
The court in the capital Dhaka accepted a formal charge against eight police officials in connection to the killing of six protesters on August 5 last year, the day Hasina fled the country as the protesters stormed her palace.
The eight men are charged with crimes against humanity. Four are in custody and four are being tried in absentia.
“The formal trial has begun,” Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of Bangladesh’s domestic International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), told reporters.
“The prosecution believes that this prosecution will be able to prove the crimes done by the accused,” he said.
It is the first formal charge in any case related to the killings during last year’s student-led uprising, which ended Hasina’s iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.
The list of those facing trial includes Dhaka’s former police commissioner, Habibur Rahman, who is among those being tried in absentia.
Hasina also fled by helicopter to India, her old ally.
She remains in self-imposed exile, defying Dhaka’s extradition request to face charges of crimes against humanity.
The launch of the trials of senior figures from Hasina’s government is a key demand of several of the political parties now jostling for power as the South Asian nation awaits elections that the interim government has vowed will take place before June 2026.
Islam said the eight men were accused of “different responsibilities,” including the most senior for “superior command responsibility, some for direct orders.. (and) some for participation”.
He said he was confident of a successful prosecution.
“We have submitted as much evidence as required to prove crimes against humanity, both at a national and an international standard,” he said. Among that evidence, he said, was video footage of the violence, as well as voice recordings of Hasina in “conversations with different people where she ordered the killing of the protesters using force and lethal weapons”.
The ICT was set up by Hasina in 2009 to investigate crimes committed by the Pakistani army during Bangladesh’s war for independence in 1971.
It sentenced numerous prominent political opponents to death over the following years and became widely seen as a means for Hasina to eliminate rivals.

Bangladesh’s Yunus seeks unity with fresh political talks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315409-bangladesh-s-yunus-seeks-unity-with-fresh-political-talks,"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s interim leader held a second day of marathon talks Sunday with multiple parties seeking to build unity and calm intense political power struggles, party leaders and officials said.
Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who is leading the caretaker government as its chief adviser until elections are held, has called for rival parties to give him their full support.
The South Asian nation of around 170 million people has been in political turmoil since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted by a student-led revolt in August 2024, ending her iron-fisted rule of 15 years.
Yunus met around 20 party leaders on Sunday, after talks that stretched late into Saturday evening with the major political parties, including those who have protested against the government this month.
Mamunul Haque, leader of the Islamist Khelafat-e-Majlish party, was among those who spoke to Yunus on Sunday in discussions that he said focused on “the ongoing crisis”.
After a week of escalation during which rival parties protested on the streets of the capital Dhaka, the government led by Yunus warned on Saturday that political power struggles risked jeopardising gains that have been made.
“Broader unity is essential to maintain national stability, organise free and fair elections, justice, and reform, and permanently prevent the return of authoritarianism in the country,” it said in a statement.
Yunus on Saturday met with the key Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), seen as the election front-runners, who are pushing hard for polls to be held by December.
According to Bangladeshi media and military sources, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman also said this week that elections should be held by December, aligning with BNP demands.
Microfinance pioneer Yunus, who returned from exile at the behest of protesters in August 2024, says he has a duty to implement democratic reforms before elections he has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.
The caretaker government has formed multiple reform commissions providing a long list of recommendations -- and is now seeking the backing of political parties.
Yunus has said polls could be held as early as December but that holding them later -- with the deadline of June -- would give the government more time for reform.
But Mujahidul Islam Selim, a veteran leftist politician, said he told Yunus that the interim government was not required to complete all reforms.
“We urged them to leave fundamental reforms to the people,” Selim said Sunday.
“If they delay solving problems, the opposite may happen -- the situation may further deteriorate.”
Yunus last held an all-party meeting -- to discuss efforts to overhaul Bangladesh’s democratic system -- on February 15. Some parties cited frustration at the lack of contact.
“We told him that if only he had engaged with political parties more frequently, nobody would mind delaying the election by a few weeks,” Saiful Haque, of the Biplobi Workers Party, told reporters after his meeting.
Sources in his office and a key political ally said on Thursday that Yunus had threatened to quit, but his cabinet said he would not step down early.
On Saturday, the government warned that it had faced “unreasonable demands, deliberately provocative and jurisdictionally overreaching statements,” which it said had been “continuously obstructing” its work.
Bangladesh’s tax authority workers ended a two-week partial strike on Sunday after they said the interim government would address their demands to stop an overhaul of the body.
Security forces had surrounded the national tax authority headquarters, after government orders to reform the National Board of Revenue (NBR) sparked fury from employees.
Yunus also met with leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami, the Muslim-majority nation’s largest Islamist party, and the National Citizen Party (NCP) made up of many students who spearheaded the uprising that ended Hasina’s rule.
NCP leader Nahid Islam warned on Saturday that rival parties were pushing for swift elections to skip reforms and “assume power,” and that he believed there were “indications” that a “military-backed government could re-emerge”.

172 senior officers waiting for postings for two weeks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315410-172-senior-officers-waiting-for-postings-for-two-weeks,"ISLAMABAD: Grade-19 and 20 officers of three main service groups have been waiting for promotion and posting for two weeks.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had approved promotion of 172 officers of Pakistan Administrative Service, Police Service and Secretariat Group on the recommendation of Central Selection Board (CSB) on May 13.
The Establishment Division sent the posting plan to Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on the same day for approval. The PMO has not yet approved the posting plan. Due to non-approval of the posting plan, notification of promotion of these officers could not be issued.
Due to non-issuance of notification, frustration is growing among these officers. They will join the post only after their posting in the next grade. Interestingly, notification of promotion of all officers of other services that the CSB had approved has been issued.
This is the first time in the history of civil service notifications of most powerful service groups have been delayed. One of the reasons for the delay is that Establishment Division wants to send those officers to Balochistan who have not served in the province till now.
The officers are lobbying to avoid appointment in Balochistan.
According to sources, 13 officers of Pakistan Administrative Service have been promoted to Grade-21 and 60 to Grade-20.
A total of 17 officers of Police Service of Pakistan have been promoted to Grade-21 and 32 to Grade-20. Thirteen officers of Secretariat Group have been elevated to Grade-21 and 30 to Grade-20.

12 killed as Russia pummels Ukraine with biggest ever drone attack,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315412-12-killed-as-russia-pummels-ukraine-with-biggest-ever-drone-attack,"KYIV, Ukraine: Russia launched a record number of drones against Ukraine and killed 12 people across the country, officials said on Sunday, even as Kyiv and Moscow completed their biggest prisoner exchange since the start of the war.
Ukraine’s emergency services described a night of “terror” as Russia launched a second straight night of massive air strikes, including on the capital Kyiv.
The attacks came even as the two countries completed their biggest prisoner swap since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with 1,000 captured soldiers and civilian prisoners exchanged by each side.
The death toll from the latest Russian strikes included two children, aged eight and 12, and a 17-year-old, killed in the northwestern region of Zhytomyr, officials said.
Their school named the dead children as Roman, Tamara and Stanislav in a post on Facebook, saying: “Their memory will always be with us. We will never forgive.”
“Without truly strong pressure on the Russian leadership, this brutality cannot be stopped,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media.
“The silence of America, the silence of others around the world only encourages Putin,” he said, adding: “Sanctions will certainly help.” The European Union’s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, called for “the strongest international pressure on Russia to stop this war”.
“Last night’s attacks again show Russia bent on more suffering and the annihilation of Ukraine. Devastating to see children among innocent victims harmed and killed,” she said on social media.
The renewed strikes came after Russia launched 14 ballistic missiles and 250 drones overnight Friday to Saturday, which wounded 15, according to Ukrainian officials.
Ukraine’s military said on Sunday it had shot down a total of 45 Russian missiles and 266 attack drones overnight. Air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a total of 298 drones were launched, adding that this was “the highest number ever”.
Four people were also reported dead in Ukraine’s western Khmelnytskyi region, four in the Kyiv region, and one in Mykolaiv in the south.
Emergency services said 16 people were also injured in the Kyiv region, including three children, in the “massive night attack”.
“We saw the whole street was on fire,” a 65-year-old retired woman, Tetiana Iankovska, said in Markhalivka village just southwest of Kyiv.
Another retiree who survived the strikes, Oleskandr, 64, said he had no faith in talks around a ceasefire.
“We don’t need talks, but weapons, a lot of weapons to stop them (the Russians). Because Russia understands only force, nothing else,” he said. Russia meanwhile said its strikes were aimed at Ukraine’s “military-industrial complex” and said it had brought down 110 Ukrainian drones.
Russia also said Sunday it had exchanged another 303 Ukrainian prisoners of war for the same number of Russian soldiers held by Kyiv -- the last phase of the prisoner swap agreed during talks between the two sides in Istanbul on May 16.

Maryam abolishes birth and death registration fee in Punjab,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315413-maryam-abolishes-birth-and-death-registration-fee-in-punjab,"LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has abolished birth and death registration fee in the province.
“Identity is a fundamental right of every citizen, we want to create convenience for citizens,” said Maryam Nawaz while abolishing the birth and death registration fee charged from applicants for years.
She said, “Death and Birth Digital Certificate is mandatory to get services. By registering births and deaths on time, we can ensure protection of civil rights of citizens.”
She directed the authorities concerned to effectively implement “Birth & Death Registration Rules 2025” in Punjab, under which birth and death registration fee has been abolished.
The chief minister said, “Birth and Death Registration can be done free of charge throughout Punjab. Citizens can have the registration in Union Councils and Municipal Committees free of charge for 7 years.”
She highlighted, “The condition of court decree for the late registration of birth and death in Punjab has also been abolished. Birth and Death Computerized Certificates will also be issued free of charge.”
Meanwhile, she expressed deep sense of grief and sorrow over the loss of precious human lives in various accidents due to strong winds and rain in the province. She offered condolences and extended her heartfelt sympathies to the bereaved families. She directed the authorities concerned to provide immediate and best medical assistance to the injured.
The chief minister directed the relevant authorities of Rescue 1122, PDMA and district administration to intensify rehabilitation and relief activities, besides submitting a detailed report on the damages done. She said, “Punjab government is with the affected families in this hour of grief. All possible measures are being taken to protect lives and property of people in severe weather conditions.”

Water expert informs António Guterres...: India unveils plans for 10MW hydropower projects in Ladakh,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315414-water-expert-informs-antonio-guterres-india-unveils-plans-for-10mw-hydropower-projects-in-ladakh,"ISLAMABAD: India, under its master plan to block the mighty Indus River’s flow that begins in Ladakh, a disputed territory under UN resolution, has unveiled plans for 10MW hydropower projects in Ladakh, including Achinthang-Sanjak, Parfila, Sunit (Batalik), and Khalsti.
These projects not only violate the storage capacities allowed under the treaty but also raise grave concerns about the diversion and reduction of water flow into Pakistan.
The purpose of these projects, it seems, is to provide heating and energy facilities for troops stationed on the frozen expanse of the Siachen Glacier — while the poor, marginalised people of Ladakh are left in the cold, this has been unearthed in a letter from Arshad H Abbasi, an eminent water expert of Pakistan with headline of ‘A Humanitarian Crisis in the Making: The Indus Waters Treaty and India’s Actions’ to António Guterres, Secretary-General, United Nations.
Abbasi says in his letter: “Under the provisions of the IWT, India is permitted to store up to 0.25 million acre-feet (MAF) of water for general and power storage in Ladakh. But in a shocking disregard for these limits, India has developed plans that far exceed these allowances. Over the years, India has constructed hydropower projects in Ladakh, including Nimoo Bazgo and Chutak, with capacities of 45MW and 44MW, respectively, to serve not the people of Ladakh but the Indian Army’s XIV Corps. Established in 1999, this massive military deployment operates in the Kargil-Leh area, supported by residential colonies, military airports such as the Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport, and the Thoise Airbase near the colossal Siachen Glacier.”
Abbasi drew the attention of Secretary General saying that this cruel and heartless act by India is nothing short of a death sentence for Pakistan. But it is not merely that — it signifies the end of an era, the demise of the Indus Valley Civilization, one of the most ancient and enduring civilizations in all of human history. The sacred Indus River, immortalised by the Greeks in 325BC under Alexander the Great and revered by ancient Iranians as “Sindhu,” meaning “river” in Sanskrit, has been a lifeline for countless generations.
He requested for an investigation into how the UNFCCC, a crucial organ of the UN, awarded carbon credits to India for the controversial Nimoo Bazgo and Chutak hydropower projects. “Both projects are located on the Indus River in Ladakh, and both were undertaken without prior consultation with Pakistan or the required transboundary assessment.”
Even more alarming, he said, is India’s construction of a 45-kilometer inland water transport route on the Indus in Ladakh, stretching from Upshi village to Shey village (NW-46).
“The question is not whether Ladakh needs such projects but why they are being pursued at all. Ladakh is sparsely populated, with a population that suffers from severe energy losses during transmission. In winter, the Indus often freezes, rendering these hydropower projects ineffective. Yet, Ladakh has over 300 sunny days each year and enormous potential for solar energy. Leh, Ladakh’s capital, enjoys an average daily solar output of 5.29 kWh/kWp—far exceeding Delhi’s 4.0 kWh/kWp. But instead of harnessing this renewable wealth, India has chosen hydropower and water transport projects for reasons that serve an agenda of domination, not development.”
Abbasi called upon the United Nations to take swift action to reinstate the Indus Waters Treaty.

‘Stateless overnight’: Kuwait strips tens of thousands of citizenship,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315415-stateless-overnight-kuwait-strips-tens-of-thousands-of-citizenship,"DUBAI: Leaving her weekly workout class, Lama was shocked to discover she was no longer a Kuwaiti -- one of tens of thousands of people, mostly women, suddenly stripped of citizenship.
After her credit card payment for the class in Kuwait City was declined, she learnt her bank account was temporarily frozen because her nationality, acquired through marriage, had been revoked.
“It was a shock,” said the grandmother in her 50s, originally from Jordan, who like others interviewed by AFP asked to use a pseudonym, fearing a backlash from the authorities.
“To be a law-abiding citizen for more than 20 years and then wake up one day to find out you’re no longer a citizen... that’s not okay at all,” she said.
The mass revocations have been cast as part of a reformist agenda spearheaded by Kuwaiti emir Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, who dissolved parliament and suspended parts of the constitution five months after taking power in December 2023.
His latest citizenship policy appears aimed at restricting nationality to those with blood ties to the tiny, oil-rich nation, reshaping Kuwaiti identity and potentially trimming its electorate after years of political crisis, analysts said.
In a televised speech to the country of nearly five million -- only a third of them Kuwaitis -- the emir pledged in March to “deliver Kuwait to its original people clean and free from impurities”.
Lama is among more than 37,000 people including at least 26,000 women who have lost Kuwaiti nationality since August, according to an AFP tally of official figures. Media reports suggest the real number could be much higher.
While large-scale citizenship revocations are not unheard of in Kuwait, “the volume is definitely unprecedented,” said Bader al-Saif, assistant professor of history at Kuwait University.
Kuwait already has a big stateless community: the Bidoon, estimated at around 100,000 people, who were denied citizenship on independence from British protectorship in 1961.
The latest campaign abolishes naturalisation by marriage, which only applied to women, and revokes citizenship granted to wives since 1987. Official data shows 38,505 women were naturalised by marriage from 1993 to 2020.
It also targets people with dual nationality, which Kuwait does not allow, and those who became citizens fraudulently -- by using forged documents, for example.
Others naturalised for their achievements, including pop singer Nawal The Kuwaiti and actor Dawood Hussain, have also lost their citizenship.
“Overnight, I became stateless,” businesswoman Amal, who had been Kuwaiti for nearly two decades, said.
Many have been left in legal limbo while they scramble to restore their previous nationality.
“The right to nationality is a very basic human right, and failure to respect and ensure it can wreak havoc on people’s lives, as... the Bidoon know all too well,” Amnesty International’s Mansoureh Mills said.
Analysts say the latest drive has the question of Kuwaiti nationhood at its core.
“I trace it to the notion of identity: who are we as a nation?” said Saif.
While Kuwait’s parliament is a rarity in the monarchical Gulf, its tiered citizenship system limits political rights to those born to a Kuwaiti father.
After Iraq’s invasion in 1990, naturalised Kuwaitis were granted voting rights after 20 years of citizenship, as were children born after their father’s naturalisation.
It was “a token of appreciation” for standing by Kuwait, Saif said, but also a “push for national unity after liberation”.
But Kuwait’s new leadership have “an exclusionary vision of Kuwaiti nationalism,” keeping out “people who lack deep roots there,” said Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics.
For researcher Melissa Langworthy, who studied citizenship issues in the Gulf, naturalised women are “being told clearly that they are not the ideal reproducers of the nation”.
“They went after mothers, the heart of the family,” lamented Lama, adding: “We are the mothers and grandmothers of the children of this country.”
Initially cast as a crackdown on fraudsters taking advantage of Kuwait’s generous benefits, the move was welcomed in a country where many complain of corruption and mismanagement.
But the mood quickly changed.
A Kuwaiti man whose wife lost her citizenship said the government was equating “innocent women and fraudsters”.
His wife, a retired civil servant, had her pension suspended for more than six months and her bank loan frozen.
“What kind of message are we conveying by inciting racism and treating them unfairly?” he said.
Authorities have promised the women will be treated as Kuwaiti and keep their social benefits, but those hit by the campaign have lost any political rights.
The emir cited constant standoffs between lawmakers and the royal-appointed cabinet when he dissolved the parliament, which had long delayed reforms needed to diversify the oil-reliant economy.
“The Kuwaiti leadership is possibly seeking to reduce the citizen population in order to shape a smaller, more politically manageable electorate,” said Cafiero.

Miss England Maggie quits Miss World contest halfway in India,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315378-miss-england-maggie-quits-miss-world-contest-halfway-in-india,"ISLAMABAD: There has been a ruckus in south Indian city of Hyderabad after the statement of Miss England Mila Maggie, generating a controversy about the Miss World contest.
Miss England Mila Maggie has created a sensation after giving an interview about the event. Since this year the competition is being held in Indian city of Hyderabad, stirring a lot of politics on the issue. Ms Maggie, who left the competition midway and returned to England, has given an interview to British tabloid The Sun, where she said: “They (organisers) made me feel like I am a prostitute”. Miss England returned to Britain leaving the ongoing Miss World pageant in India midway.
“I went there with the aim of bringing about a change, but on the contrary, I had to sit there like a puppet. My moral standards did not allow me to stay there anymore. The organisers thought I was there just to have fun. They forced me to think of myself as a prostitute. After appearing before rich male sponsors, I felt I had to take a decision. The good times for the Miss World pageants are over. It is useless to win these crowns and titles before raising your voice to change the world,” Ms Maggie said.
The Sun magazine wrote in its article that Maggie was being asked to woo some middle-aged men on the pretext of gratitude, which made her angry. “Two girls were seated at each table with six guests.” Maggie said she was asked to sit with those guests all evening and entertain them. “I found it very wrong. I did not go there to entertain people. Miss World should have some moral values.” Maggie called her mother and told her about her “harassment and abuse”.
Meanwhile, the BRS party has reacted strongly to the issue. In a post on X, it wrote: “(Anumula) Revanth, the Chief Minister of the Congress government, has tarnished the reputation of Telangana and Hyderabad internationally by spending Rs250 crore from the state exchequer!”
The Miss World organisers responded to Mila Maggie’s allegations, describing them “false”.
“Miss England 2025 winner, Mila Maggie, requested to leave the competition earlier, citing her mother’s illness. Understanding her situation, Julia Morley, chairman and CEO of the Miss World organisation, arranged for her to return to England. She was later replaced by Charlotte Grant who arrived to participate in the competition,” said a statement issued by the organisers . It added the reports published by British media outlets about the Maggie’s experiences in India were not correct.

Anti-polio drive launched to vaccinate 45m children across country,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315379-anti-polio-drive-launched-to-vaccinate-45m-children-across-country,"ISLAMABAD: In a renewed push toward a polio-free Pakistan, the Pakistan Polio Programme has officially launched its third National Immunisation Days (NIDs) campaign.
The inauguration ceremony was held at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) in Islamabad.
It was led by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication, Ayesha Raza Farooq, along with key partners and officials.
The PM’s focal person personally administered oral polio vaccine and Vitamin A drops to children under five, reaffirming the government’s steadfast commitment to eradicating the disease from every part of the country.
Set to begin on May 26, the week-long campaign aims to immunise over 45 million children under five years of age. This effort is seen as a decisive step in the country’s final push to stop poliovirus transmission and achieve eradication by the end of 2025.
“Polio eradication is more than a public health goal — it’s a national mission,” said Farooq. “This campaign is a pivotal part of our 2-4-6 roadmap. The rounds we’ve held from September 2024 through May 2025 have been designed to strategically close immunity gaps and disrupt virus circulation before high transmission season begins.”
While challenges persist in traditional hotspots such as Karachi, South KP, and the Quetta Block, the PM’s focal person highlighted encouraging progress in reaching underserved communities.
She also extended deep gratitude to the 400,000 frontline workers driving this campaign — including 225,000 female vaccinators — and acknowledged the support of civil and military law enforcement in ensuring secure access to children.
Despite major gains, the threat of wild poliovirus remains. So far in 2025, Pakistan has confirmed 10 polio cases. Moreover, environmental surveillance has detected the virus in 272 sewage samples across 68 districts — a clear indication of continued transmission.
Unicef Representative in Pakistan, Abdullah Fadil, praised the programme’s direction during his remarks at the launch. As he concludes his tenure in the country, he lauded Pakistan’s leadership and Farooq for their unwavering resolve. “Pakistan is closer than ever to ending polio,” said Fadil.
“With sustained political will, community participation, and united action by all partners, I am confident this nation will soon reach a historic milestone — a polio-free future.”

Pakistan’s measured response to India earned global recognition: Gilani,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315381-pakistan-s-measured-response-to-india-earned-global-recognition-gilani,"LAHORE: The recent Indian provocations have united the entire nation, with all the political parties demonstrating exemplary unity, which played a pivotal role in delivering a strong and effective national response to the enemy.
This was stated by Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani while talking to the media after visiting the International Solar Energy Exhibition at the Expo Centre, here on Sunday.
He said that the bravery and professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces were acknowledged globally. He stressed that despite being a nuclear power, Pakistan responded to Indian provocations with restraint and strategic maturity. “Pakistan’s measured and well-thought-out response has earned global recognition for its wisdom and composure,” he said.
Gilani extended heartfelt congratulations to the entire nation for demonstrating unity and playing a vital role in shaping a cohesive national response. “The credit for our firm and peaceful strategy goes to the leadership, armed forces, and the unity of all political stakeholders,” he added.
He said Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to peace and dialogue, consistently prioritising negotiations over confrontation in resolving regional issues. “We have never taken any action that would threaten the stability of the region,” he said.
To a question on Balochistan, he recalled that during his tenure as Prime Minister, he had clearly highlighted India’s involvement in sponsoring terrorism and unrest in the province. “At that time, I presented evidence to international forums and even Bollywood produced a film, The Accidental Prime Minister, which indirectly hinted at Indian policy contradictions. This led India to show willingness to engage in dialogue on core issues such as Siachen, Kashmir, and interference in Balochistan,” he said.
To another query, he said Pakistan had called for a neutral and independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack, but India refused. He noted that India unilaterally suspended the Indus Waters Treaty and blocked river flows, actions that violate international law. “However, Pakistan’s leadership and armed forces responded firmly, demonstrating our full capability to defend our sovereignty. The armed forces acted decisively and solely in self-defence,” he added.
On domestic politics, the senate chairman stressed the need for national unity. He declined to comment on PTI’s narrative, stating that their cases are sub-judice and will be decided by courts. “We must now focus on uniting the nation. Political divisions must not derail our shared goals,” he said.
Responding to a question on the upcoming federal budget, he called for maximum relief for the common man. “I am a public representative, and so are my children. I urge the government to provide substantial relief to the people in the next budget,” he said.
On energy policy, he underscored the importance of affordable energy solutions. “If subsidies are to be reduced in the next budget, there must be alternatives such as affordable solar panels to reduce the burden of electricity bills on the public,” he suggested. He also advocated cutting unnecessary expenditures in other sectors to divert resources towards public relief.
When asked about PPP’s role in current political developments, he responded that the party always put national interest first. “At this stage, it’s not about any party or individual, it’s about Pakistan. Any consultations, whether through Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz or coordination committees, are aimed at the country’s betterment,” he said.
Earlier, Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani toured various stalls and appreciated the quality of Pakistani solar energy products and technologies on display. Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President Mian Abuzar Shad also accompanied him during the visit.

At UNSC: Pakistan warns against India’s malevolent designs to block water flow,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315383-at-unsc-pakistan-warns-against-india-s-malevolent-designs-to-block-water-flow,"UNITED NATIONS: A senior Pakistani diplomat has denounced India’s “malevolent designs” to impede the flow of water guaranteed to Pakistan under the 1960 Indus Water Treaty and called on New Delhi to refrain from stopping, diverting or restricting rivers going downstream.
“We will never accept any such moves,” Deputy Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)’s Arria Formula Meeting on ‘Protecting Water in Armed Conflict’, while highlighting India’s attempt to weaponise water.
Arria Formula meetings are informal that enabling Security Council members to have a frank and private exchange of views on relevant subjects.
The meeting of the 15-member Council on ‘Protecting Water in Armed Conflict’ was convened by Slovenia, in cooperation with Algeria, Panama, Sierra Leone, and the Global Alliance to Spare Water from Armed Conflicts.
Opening the debate, Slovenia’s State Secretary Melita Gabric emphasised the critical role that protecting water and related infrastructure during armed conflicts plays in safeguarding civilian lives, saying: “Protection of civilians and civilian objects under international humanitarian law is non-negotiable.”
The UNSC forum held the discussion on protecting water infrastructure in the wake of New Delhi’s threats of cutting Islamabad’s water flow. Following the deadly April attack on tourists in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir’s (IIOJK) Pahalgam that India blames on Islamabad, New Delhi “put in abeyance” its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960.
Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident, but the accord has not been revived despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing on a ceasefire earlier this month following the worst fighting between them in decades.
In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy pointed out that attacks against water resources, related infrastructure, and denial of access to these resources constitute a flagrant violation of established norms, and widely accepted principles, noting that the UNSC too has also reaffirmed these principles and strongly condemned the unlawful denial of such access and depriving civilians of objects indispensable to their survival.
“India’s decision to illegally and unilaterally suspend the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), aiming to impede the flow of water guaranteed to Pakistan under the Treaty, is a grave violation of international law, including human rights law, the treaty law and customary international law,” Ambassador Jadoon said.
“Troubling pronouncements by Indian leadership to ‘starve the people of Pakistan’ depict a highly dangerous and perverse thinking,” he said.
“We strongly condemn India’s unlawful announcement to hold the Treaty in abeyance and call upon India to strictly abide by its legal obligations and refrain from stopping, diverting or restricting rivers that are a lifeline for 240 million people of Pakistan.”
He urged the UNSC must play a role by identifying situations where violations of international law, including the International Humanitarian Law (IHL) principles, could jeopardise peace and security or lead to a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, and act preventively.
In conclusion, Ambassador Jadoon backed the calls for full compliance with the IHL and international human rights laws, especially for the protection of water resources and related infrastructure.

CM terms eliminating plastic a collective responsibility,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315317-cm-terms-eliminating-plastic-a-collective-responsibility,"Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has emphasised that plastic pollution poses a serious threat to our environment, rivers, marine life and urban infrastructure. In a statement in connection with International Plastic Free Day issued from the CM House on Sunday, Shah called for the elimination of plastic as a collective responsibility, and urged the public to cease using plastic for a better urban environment.
He asserted that a plastic-free environment guarantees a better future. He also highlighted that the provincial government has undertaken several measures to combat plastic pollution. He said that since August 2024 the use of plastic bottles has been banned at all government offices, and glass jugs have been mandated to replace plastic bottles. This April the government imposed a complete ban on the manufacture, sale and use of plastic bags, he added.
He appealed to the public to opt for environmentally friendly alternatives, such as cloth and paper products, instead of plastic to make Sindh a cleaner and greener region. He stressed that these steps are not only essential for protecting the environment but would also ensure a healthier and better life for future generations.

SSWMB to register offal collection vehicles ahead of Eidul Azha,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315318-sswmb-to-register-offal-collection-vehicles-ahead-of-eidul-azha,"The Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) has ordered that all vehicles that would be collecting offal during Eidul Azha be registered with the Central Management System (CMS) to ensure a transparent, efficient and coordinated operation. Technical training for the upgraded digital system has been provided to the relevant officials.
SSWMB Managing Director Tariq Ali Nizamani chaired a briefing during which M&E Director Sabir Shah and other representatives of the software company explained the new system’s features.
The officials noted that just like regular waste collection vehicles, offal collection vehicles would now be tracked in real time using the CMS platform. Additional system features have been added specifically for Eid operations, including vehicle weight monitoring and automated rejection at landfill sites if trucks exceed their assigned weight limits.
Trucks arriving without tarpaulins will be fined, and to avoid confusion, offal and garbage collection vehicles will carry different coloured tarpaulins. Nizamani instructed all private contractors to ensure immediate registration of additional offal collection vehicles, warning that unregistered vehicles would be automatically rejected by the system.
Moreover, residents will be provided with special bags for offal disposal. To address public complaints promptly and to keep the 1128 helpline active round the clock during Eid, a dedicated complaint centre will be inaugurated, and be staffed with trained personnel to receive and relay public complaints to the relevant officials.
“No negligence will be tolerated during the Eidul Azha operation,” said Nizamani, urging all officers to fulfil their duties diligently. He praised the performance of the officers and private contractors working in the jurisdiction of the Keamari Fish Harbour Authority, noting the appreciation received from the authority regarding the SSWMB’s efforts.

‘Voice is as essential a personality aspect as face and attire’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315319-voice-is-as-essential-a-personality-aspect-as-face-and-attire,"It does not require power to ensure that one’s voice is heard till the very end of the hall or room. A newborn baby at a hospital has no power, yet the entire building echoes with the baby’s cries.
Veteran actor Khalid Ahmed, who currently heads the theatre academy of the Arts Council of Pakistan (ACP) Karachi, made these observations while holding a workshop on voice techniques on the concluding day of the Arts Alumni Festival 2025 on Sunday.
Voice, remarked Ahmed, is as essential an aspect of an individual’s personality just like face and attire. He advised the workshop attenders to work on improving their voice and be conscious of it the same way they are always conscious of how they look.
He said that learning voice techniques is essential for theatre artistes, and in any acting school, voice is taught over three years. However, he added, mastery over voice is also useful for other professions such as teaching, news reading, and interviewing and podcasting.
He also said students do not like to attend classes of teachers that do not have voice modulation because they sound boring and fail to inculcate others’ interest in their subject. Learning voice techniques is also beneficial for singers, and in Western countries some singers do learn voice, he added.
The veteran actor said that breathing from the diaphragm, and a relaxed state are the key to effective voice throwing. The more stressed one is, the more their muscles are unable to effectively project their voice, he explained.
On the belly breathing or diaphragm breathing, he said that most people breathe through their chest but the breath coming from the chest is not beneficial for effective human voice. He demonstrated some exercises to show the participants how they can learn breathing through the diaphragm.
To elucidate the difference between chest breathing and diaphragm breathing, he invited a few participants to come forward. Some of the participants were trained in voice techniques and others were not.
When Ahmed asked them to breathe, the chests of those who were not breathing through the diaphragm could be seen rising and returning. However, the trained ones who were breathing through the diaphragm had no visible effect on their torso as they took in the air and released it out.
The actor said that newborn babies produce far-reaching voice because they are not in stress, and they breathe through the diaphragm. He then spoke on the importance of resonators in the human body. He said that several parts of the respiratory system act as resonators and using them to throw one’s voice imparts a unique feel and emotion to it. He explained that in reciting Azaan, normally the resonators in the mouth are used that give a loud feel to it.
He also touched upon the importance of articulation, which means producing the sound from the right place and in the right manner. He said that what made Zia Mohyeddin special was his impeccable articulation.
He also said that often people lisp, which means they do not accurately produce the sound of the ‘s’ as they articulate it by placing their tongue between their teeth, which makes the sound resemble that of ‘th’.
The three-day Arts Alumni Festival began on Friday. It was a first-of-its-kind event held by the ACP to showcase the talents of the graduates of its various academies. The last day of the festival also featured a discussion on textile design, music and dance performances, and a stage production of Iqbal Nazar’s translation of Tennessee Williams’ ‘The Glass Menagerie’ directed by Adil Shakir and enacted by Hassan Malik, Sheryl John, Fatima Adil and Syed Usman Hikmat.
The last-minute change of timings and venues of different programmes of the festival caused a lot of confusion. The ACP administration must ensure that such events take place as per the schedule. If there are delays of 15 to 20 minutes, they might be condoned, but shifting a play from the 7pm slot to 9:30pm mars the experience of many visitors who arrive at such events with a predetermined mindset regarding what they would do.

Another education board chairman resigns,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315321-another-education-board-chairman-resigns,"Another education board chairman recommended by the search committee has resigned from his post. Mansoor Rajput, who belonged to the Mirpurkhas education board, is the fourth chairman selected by the search committee to resign from his post. After his resignation, three education boards in Sindh lack a permanent chairman.
Earlier, Brigadier Wasim Ahmed and Misbah Tunio, who were selected to head the Karachi intermediate education board, had resigned, while Dr Rafiq Chandio took charge of the Hyderabad education board for a day, then resigned the next day.
Rajput told The News that his health is not good. He said he had taken over the Mirpurkhas education board chairman post for two months but now he cannot bear much pressure. He added that doctors have also advised him to stay away from mental stress.
The universities & boards department has forwarded a summary of Rajput’s resignation to the chief minister for approval, suggesting that either the next candidate selected by the search committee be appointed or a vacancy advertisement be published.

‘Govt to provide funds to NGO-run schools only if they show judicious use of public money’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315322-govt-to-provide-funds-to-ngo-run-schools-only-if-they-show,"The Sindh Education Foundation (SEF) has warned that it will not release subsidies to over 2,600 schools assisted by it across the province until compliance reports are received from each of these educational facilities showing adequate investment in academic infrastructure and judicious use of public funds regularly provided to educate children from deprived communities.
The newly appointed SEF managing director (MD), Gahanwer Ali Laghari, spelt out this warning while speaking as the chief guest at the launch of a new state-of-the-art building of the Mohammad Shafi Trust campus school of the non-profit Green Crescent Trust (GCT) at an underdeveloped village of District Malir near the Education City project.
The GCT has been partnering with the SEF and two other non-governmental organisations, Mohammad Shafi Trust and Khuddam Education Trust, to utilise the new school building to educate up to matriculation 660 students from 22 underserved villages situated nearby.
Laghari said that he had assumed the position of the SEF chief merely 15 days back and so far his main focus had been that regular funding provided by the foundation to the NGOs-run schools across the province was utilised most effectively for providing quality school education to children from neglected and remote localities.
He told the audience that the SEF paid a subsidy of Rs800 to Rs2,000 every month to every student from pre-school to grade 10 in its beneficiary schools, and this monthly assistance increased to Rs2,500 for students enrolled in higher secondary classes.
In case of some special SEF-funded academic initiatives, up to Rs5,000 monthly subsidy was paid, he explained. The SEF MD said that these were public funds funded by the Sindh government to provide quality education to children from underprivileged families from Karachi to Kashmore, and he would make sure that this assistance was spent most judiciously to fulfil the prime objective of the subsidy programme.
Laghari informed the audience that he had so far visited remote areas in five districts in Sindh to see whether the SEF's assistance was available to educate children from underserved communities under public-private partnership arrangements.
He said the SEF was willing to fully cooperate with committed and sincere NGOs in the education sector that strived to educate people from neglected areas in Sindh under formal and non-formal schooling initiatives. ""You should keep in mind that the Sindh Education Foundation isn't an NGO; it is a government-run organisation that doesn't take money but always extends financial assistance to fund quality schooling initiatives in Sindh,"" he remarked.
He appreciated that several philanthropists and donors from Karachi had come to attend the inauguration of the new school building on the city's outskirts, despite sultry weather, showing their solemn commitment to the cause of education. Laghari offered fullest assistance to the GCT and its partner organisations in their drive to provide quality schooling facilities to children from deprived areas of Sindh.
Trustee of the Mohammad Shafi Trust Mian Amjad Hafeez expressed the hope that the new school building would transform the destiny of thousands of underprivileged rural families by providing quality school education to their children who would meaningfully contribute to the national economy in the future.
He highlighted that three concerned NGOs forming an alliance with the SEF would emerge as a shining example of public-private partnership in the education sector to brighten the future of underserved children in Sindh.
Khuddam Education Trust Chairman Shabbir Latif also praised the cooperation that enabled the schooling facility for rural areas of District Malir. GCT CEO Zahid Saeed said the GCT, partnering with the SEF and like-minded NGOs, had been striving uninterruptedly for the past 31 years to enrol out-of-school children in Sindh.
He expressed gratitude to the SEF and other partner organisations for enabling the GCT to establish a network of 170 charitable schools in remote and underprivileged parts of Sindh having a total enrolment of 32,800 students from deprived communities. He said the GCT got immense support from its donors and partner NGOs, and it would continue its struggle for providing high-quality school education to every neglected child in Sindh.

Female cotton workers launch climate literacy campaign in Matiari,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315323-female-cotton-workers-launch-climate-literacy-campaign-in-matiari,"HYDERABAD: In a significant move for achieving climate justice and labour rights, women agricultural workers and leaders from women-led cotton trade unions in Matiari district have launched a district-wide climate literacy campaign.
The initiative seeks to raise awareness among women workers and growers about the intensifying risks of climate change and the pressing need for safer, more dignified working conditions.
The campaign stemmed from the two-day Training of Trainers (ToT) workshop on climate change and health literacy in Matiari organised by the Sindh Community Foundation (SCF) in partnership with the Commonwealth Foundation.
The workshop brought together 42 women from 21 villages, equipping them with vital knowledge and practical tools to act as community-based climate campaigners. “Climate change is not only an environmental crisis but also a gender and justice issue,” said Javed Hussain, the SCF executive director, at the inauguration ceremony of the workshop.
He said that women agricultural workers were on the frontlines of this crisis, and they must be at the centre of its solutions. The technical sessions covered a range of topics including climate impacts on agriculture, health and rural livelihoods. Experts such as Dr Hira Arain, Zubaida Turk and Dr Bakhtwar discussed how rising temperatures had been affecting livestock, worsening working conditions and leading to serious health risks among women workers such as heatstroke, dehydration and even reproductive and mental health issues.
Afroz, a cotton worker leader from Long Khan Jiskanai village, said she now understood how climate change was harming both their health and our livelihoods. “If we don’t act now, the situation will only worsen,” she added.
She urged the landowners and growers to plant more trees and create shaded areas to protect workers during cotton picking. The participants also demanded fixing of minimum wage for cotton pickers and stronger occupational health safeguards, especially when climate extremes were making their labour work more hazardous.
As a follow-up, the trained women said they will launch a climate literacy week aiming to reach over 1,000 women cotton workers across Matiari.  They will advocate for eco-friendly shade structures in fields and mobilise for long-term climate resilience in the region, marking the start of a bold, women-led climate movement in rural Sindh.

SHC dismisses bail plea in narcotics case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315325-shc-dismisses-bail-plea-in-narcotics-case,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has dismissed the bail application of a man in a drugs smuggling case. The applicant, Mohammad Asif, was arrested by the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) in the Sohrab Goth. The ANF claimed to have recovered 20 kilogrammes of Ketamine from his possession, which he was allegedly delivering to co-accused Syed Tariq Hussain.
A counsel for the applicant submitted that his client was falsely implicated in the case as contraband was allegedly recovered behind the seat of the vehicle, not from the applicant’s personal custody.
He said the applicant was sitting in the driver's seat without any narcotics in hand, making it doubtful whether he was in exclusive control of the contraband. He argued that no photographs or videos were taken at the time of recovery or arrest, and the available photographs showed a bright daytime scene inconsistent with the night-time raid stated in the FIR, which created doubt about the authenticity of the recovery.
He argued that the chemical examiner’s report did not certify compliance with the Rule 6 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Rules, 2001 (FORM-II), rendering the report inadmissible. He submitted that the raiding party did not secure two independent witnesses during the search and recovery as required under the Act, thus making the recovery illegal and liable to be discarded.
He next contended that the prosecution failed to produce mobile phone location data or Call Detail Record (CDR) for the vehicle on the date of the alleged incident, thereby failing to establish the applicant’s presence at the crime scene.
He further argued that more than six months had elapsed since the alleged incident but no prosecution witness had been examined against the applicant. He further contended that the case had reached the trial stage with a challan filed, and the accused was in custody without further requirement for investigation.
A special prosecutor opposed the bail application submitting that the offence under the sections 9(2), 9, 14 and 15 the Act was serious and non-bailable, attracting punishment of imprisonment for life or more. He said the recovery of 20 kilogrammes of Ketamine, a controlled substance, was substantial and prima facie proof of guilt.
The prosecutor argued that the presence of the applicant at the scene along with the recovered contraband and corroborative statements of ANF officials established the case against the applicant beyond mere suspicion.
A single bench of the high court comprising Justice Khalid Hussain Shahani after hearing the arguments of the counsel observed that the offence with which the applicant stood charged was one against the society at large and the applicant was apprehended red-handed in possession of ketamine.
The SHC observed that it did not find the applicant entitled to bail at this stage and dismissed the bail application. The high court however directed the trial court to conclude the trial within three months and at the very least ensure that the complainant and mashir were examined.

Career counselling: questions and answers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315284-career-counselling-questions-and-answers,"Q1: Dear Mr Abidi, I have recently completed my bachelors with distinction in Political Science with major in Governance and Public Policy. I wish to pursue my masters abroad in the same field. Can you Please suggest some top programmes and universities in this field in the UK? (Asfand Yar, Okara)
Ans: Dear Asfand, first of all, congratulations on scoring the distinction. Governance and Public Policy is a highly competitive field of study, which requires deep on field research. Considering your high CGPA, I think you should consider the top-tier UK universities’ programmes such as University of Oxford’s Master of Public Policy, University of Manchester’s MSc Governance and Public Policy programme and King’s College London’s MA Public Policy programme. These programmes are well-regarded and aligned with your background.
Q2: Dear sir, I am a final-year student of Bachelor’s in English Language and Literature and I am keenly interested in debating and public speaking. What are some of the possible future academic and professional avenues that I should consider?
(Sidra Bokhari, Sargodha)
Ans: Dear Sidra, I must say, your educational path and debating is a perfect amalgamation of academic passion and interpersonal skills; highly in-demand skills, especially in Pakistani context. For your further education, you can pick between doing Masters in English Literature or Master’s in Mass Communication, for which Government College University and The University of Punjab and Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, are the best options. As for the professional fields, you can be an invaluable asset both in the fields such as Civil Services and Journalism, provided you give your best.
Q3: Dear sir, I am currently doing A Levels and my subjects are Business Studies, Mathematics and Economics. What are some of the best universities in Pakistan that I should target and what kind of areas would that open for me if I am interested in doing business in future?
(Ali Murtaza, Peshawar)
Ans: Dear Ali, I am deeply impressed by your subject selection in A Levels; it says a lot about your plan of becoming an entrepreneur. As far as top universities in Pakistan in business are concerned, Institute of Business Administration (IBA, Lahore), Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) and Lahore School of Economics (LSE) are my top picks, not just because of their top rankings, but also because these institutes have strong alumni networks which can be instrumental in seeking guidance and further refining your future entrepreneurial ideas.
Q4: Dear Mr Abidi, I am an early-career professional Architect and I want to hear your thoughts on how important is it to take post graduate courses/diplomas to further one’s knowledge in the field. How do you recommend these courses?
(Zeeshan Awan, Lahore)
Ans: Dear Zeeshan, post-grad diplomas are an excellent source of updating one’s toolkit and I highly recommend taking these courses to early-career professionals, like yourself, as these are especially instrumental if you are not immediately considering a masters or PhD in this field. However, if you are already gaining equivalent experience in practice, you can skip these.

Citizen complains against Jalalpur Pirwala admin,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315290-citizen-complains-against-jalalpur-pirwala-admin,"LAHORE:A citizen of Jalalpur Pirwala has filed a formal application to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and senior officials in Lahore and Multan, alleging widespread corruption, illegal land grabbing, and power abuse by top administrative officials of Jalalpur Pirwala tehsil.
The complaint names Assistant Commissioner, Tehsildar, Municipal Committee Chief Officer, Registry Clerk, AC Reader and Office Clerk. The petitioner cited more than 24 incidents implicating these officials in serious irregularities, including the misuse of state resources and bribery.
According to application available with The News, the AC was accused of accepting bribes to enable the illegal occupation of one kanal of government land in Chak No 184/M.The petitioner accused the officials of facilitating the illegal construction of a shop-worth an estimated Rs10 million-on public land near Permit Road, allegedly for the benefit of a private party with official backing.
He claimed that the AC’s office has become inaccessible to ordinary citizens, entertaining only those with monetary interests. He alleged that the Clerk, along with the AC and Tehsildar, accepted Rs4 million in bribes to alter official reports and help a land registrar secure bail.
Additionally, in a raid on an illegal cigarette factory, only low-wage labourers were arrested, while the alleged mastermind-reportedly involved in a Rs3.5 million deal with the AC and other staff-was not prosecuted.
The citizen called for an impartial inquiry and the immediate suspension of the accused officials. The petition has been forwarded to the Board of Revenue, Anti-Corruption Establishment, and Local Government Department.
Responding to the allegations, Assistant Commissioner Zulfiqar Ali Khan denied all charges. Speaking to The News, he stated, ‘The applicant is a fraudulent individual, stationed here for 33 years and was sent on Leave Preparatory to Retirement (LPR) due to misconduct.’ The AC claimed that the petitioner M Khan owns significant property and has a history of accepting bribes.
‘These accusations surfaced after disciplinary action was taken against him,’ the AC said, adding he has not received any official notice from the offices of the PM, CM, or senior bureaucrats.‘I’ve been posted here for just six months. I have never taken a bribe. If summoned for an inquiry, I am ready to face it as I have nothing to hide,’ the Assistant Commissioner concluded.

Pindi’s water management agencies struggling to address shortages,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315300-pindi-s-water-management-agencies-struggling-to-address-shortages,"Rawalpindi:Water, the essence of life, is recognised as a universal right, a crucial component of people’s lives, and a country’s security and sustainability.
Water has profoundly impacted human history in the tapestry of civilization across diverse landscapes, geography, and periods, becoming the linchpin of prosperity and progress.Water management refers to planning, implementing and regulating various activities related to the successful sourcing and extraction, sustainable use, distribution, conservation, and treatment of its resources.
It involves a comprehensive approach to ensuring the availability of clean water for various purposes, including drinking, agriculture, industry, sanitation and environmental preservation.
Addressing the water availability challenges of the Garrison City of Rawalpindi requires a multi-faceted approach, including expanding water storage capacity through dams and reservoirs, improving water distribution networks, promoting water conservation measures, and addressing issues like tanker mafia and infrastructure maintenance.
Recognising these challenges, the city’s civic agencies have been taking measures for the construction of new dams like Chahan and Dadhocha dams, and side by side steps for maintaining the storage capacity of existing Rawal and Khanpur dams.
Managing Director (MD) of Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) Muhammad Saleem Ashraf informed APP that the Garrison City needed a total water supply of around 51 Million Gallons Daily (MGD) in winter, 30.5 MGD of which through 480 tube-wells, 10 MGD from the Rawal Dam and 6 MGD from the Khanpur Dam.
The city had to face a shortfall of around 7 MGD in winter, which rose to around 19 MGD during summer, with the daily water demand reaching over 70 MGD, he added.Both the cantonments (Rawalpindi and Chaklala) also received some 12 MGD water from the Rawal Dam, the Wasa MD said.
For overcoming the water shortage, Saleem said work was already underway on the Developing Resilient Environment and Advancing Municipal Services (DREAMS-I) project, funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
The project’s overall scope involved the treatment and transportation of 14.5 MGD water from Chahan Dam to Rawalpindi city, besides the improvement and replacement of the city?s existing water supply system, he added.
Moreover, he said, the rehabilitation and upgradation of Rawal Lake filtration plants were also in process to supply an additional 5 MGD water to the Garrison City.Similarly, he said, two new heavy pumps were being installed at the Khanpur Dam to increase water supply to 8 MGD.
The project to provide a 24/7 water supply to three union councils of Khayaban-e-Sir Syed was also underway.?This project (DREAMS) of public importance will be completed in two years instead of the stipulated period of three years,? he added.
The MD further said that work on the Chahan Dam treatment plant had been kicked off, which was expected to provide 10 MGD of water to Rawalpindi city.
He said the feasibility of setting up the Dadhocha Dam had been included in the Punjab Annual Development Plan, which would hopefully provide 30.5 MGD water to meet the future needs of the city.
As regards water losses, he said that water leakage and theft from the distribution network were major sources of water loss and needed to be addressed.He said the Punjab Government had banned the establishment of new car washing stations across the province.
In compliance with the orders of the Lahore High Court, the Punjab Environmental Agency (EPA) had imposed a ban on non-essential use of underground water and violators, including car wash/service stations, would have to face heavy fines, he warned.
Chief Executive Officer of Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) Syed Ali Rizvi apprised APP that the RCB provided some 1.50 MGD water to its residents from 55 tubewells, 11.28 MGD from the Khanpur Dam and 0.03 MGD from the Rawal Dam.

The gathering brought together distinguished guests, including Asif Iqbal, Secretary of the Pakistan Nursing and Midwifery Council (PNMC); the Deputy Head of Mission from the Iraq Embassy; and the Spouses of the Ambassadors of Azerbaijan and Syria, reflecting the global importance and recognition of the nursing profession.
This year’s global theme, “Our Nurses, Our Future: Caring for nurses strengthens economies,” echoed throughout the program. It underscored the critical role nurses play not only in healthcare delivery but also in building resilient, high-performing economies. Maroof International Hospital reaffirmed its commitment to this vision by investing in the professional growth, well-being, and leadership of its nursing workforce.
In his speech, Asif Iqbal remarked, “Today, as we celebrate our nurses, we also acknowledge a global call to action for investment in nursing education, leadership, and recognition. Pakistan is proud of its resilient and skilled nurses who serve communities at every level.” A video message from Madam Farzana Zulfiqar, President of the PNMC, praised the Maroof nursing team as “ambassadors of compassion and clinical excellence.”
Expanding on the global context, Haroon Naseer, CEO of Maroof International Hospital, stated, “Nursing constitutes nearly 60% of the global health workforce, yet we face an alarming shortage of almost 6 million nurses worldwide. At Maroof, we recognise that bridging this gap requires more than numbers-it demands strategic investment in education, retention, and advanced clinical training. Our hospital is committed to driving innovation in nursing practices through continuous professional development and leveraging data-driven care models that improve patient outcomes by up to 30%. This is not just about staffing-it’s about building a resilient healthcare ecosystem where nurses lead transformative change.”
Dr. Mir Waheed, Medical Director, emphasised the direct impact of nursing on clinical quality: “Clinical excellence hinges on the seamless integration of nursing expertise within multidisciplinary teams. Enhanced nurse staffing ratios have been shown to reduce patient mortality by 7% and hospital readmissions by 10%. Our nursing workforce is the backbone of our quality assurance protocols, influencing measurable improvements in recovery times and patient satisfaction. At Maroof, we are deeply invested in equipping nurses with the tools and training to deliver high-precision care.”

FGEHA officials informed APP that, to meet the nation’s rising housing demands especially to ensure affordable housing for federal government employees the authority has approved the “JV and PPP Rules 2025,” to make joint ventures with the private sector more attractive and successful.
As a result, FGEHA has received a promising number of expressions of interest (EOIs) from investors.Officials further informed that the authority has invited expressions of interest for launching new housing projects on a joint venture basis in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Multan, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Hyderabad, Abbottabad, Gujranwala, and Karachi.
Officials stated that firms, landowners, developers, investors, corporate housing bodies, and qualified individuals meeting the applicable regulations may submit their expressions of interest by June 30, 2025.The new housing projects will be developed through joint ventures, catering to both federal government employees and the general public.
It is important to note that previous attempts to launch housing projects under joint ventures faced challenges due to the lack of investor and firm protection clauses in the “JV and PPP Rules 2020,” preventing their execution.Authorities now claim that the “JV and PPP Rules 2025” have been significantly refined to better attract investors and developers, ensuring comprehensive protection of their rights.

We’ve come a long way, but the danger still lingers,” he said. Dr Ilyas stressed the urgent need to counter the myths and fears surrounding polio vaccination. “At PCP, we see the human cost of paralysis every day. We owe it to every child to spread awareness and protect them before it’s too late,” he went on to add.
He also announced that PCP staff would actively promote polio awareness among patients, families and community-based focal persons. “This message must travel beyond our walls to the communities, the schools, and the homes,” he added.
The participants appreciated PCP’s continued role as a responsible healthcare institution not only in rehabilitation but also in raising awareness on critical public health issues. The event highlighted the power of partnership and education in ensuring a polio-free future for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan in general.

Pesco agrees to reduce loadshedding after threat of polio boycott,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315342-pesco-agrees-to-reduce-loadshedding-after-threat-of-polio-boycott,"TAKHTBHAI: The threat of polio anti-vaccination boycott by local residents forced the authorities of power supply company to reduce the hours of electricity loadshedding conditionally.
During the grand jirga held on Sunday, the representatives were informed about the terms of the negotiations with the power supply company and a decision about whether to maintain or withdraw the polio boycott would be made in consultation with the jirga members.Earlier, negotiations had been held at the office of Assistant Commissioner Junaid Khalid between Pesco officials and the members of the grand jirga.
Participants included Additional Assistant Commissioner Fazlur Rehman, SDO Pesco Takhtbhai-I Muhammad Zaib, SDO-II Afrasiab Khan, grand jirga convener and Jamaat-e-Islami PK-60 president Nauman Yousaf, general secretary Islamuddin, president of Takhtbhai Press Club Muslim Khan Sabir, former chairman Javed Alam Mohmand and journalists Izzat Muhammad Khpalwak, Ibrahim Syed Yousafzai among others.
Pesco officials said that most feeders in Takhtbhai were heavily burdened with outstanding dues and illegal connections, which forced them to carry out loadshedding. However, grand jirga representatives said that some urban feeders had been deliberately linked with defaulting rural feeders. They pointed out that urban consumers had a 90 percent recovery rate, yet they were unfairly punished due to others’ default and termed it a serious injustice.
After extensive discussions, the Pesco officials conditionally agreed to reduce loadshedding.AC Junaid urged Pesco officials to provide maximum relief to the people and end unnecessary loadshedding to prevent unrest and possible law and order issues.He also appealed for the successful execution of the upcoming polio campaign starting today.

Verona bags sixth win for Lidl as Giro hits mountains,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315268-verona-bags-sixth-win-for-lidl-as-giro-hits-mountains,"Asiago, Italy: Spain´s Carlos Verona of Lidl-Trek won stage 15 of the Giro d´Italia on Sunday while Team UAE´s Isaac Del Toro remains in the overall lead after a mountainous 219km stage from Fiume Veneto to Asiago.
Verona´s solo triumph was the 32-year-old´s first-ever win on a grand tour and Lidl-Trek´s sixth stage win on the 2025 Giro -- Mads Pedersen, with four, and Dan Hoole taking the other five.
The victory came, however, on a day that started badly for Lidl-Trek with the retirement of team leader Giulio Ciccone who pulled out injured after a difficult day in the saddle on Saturday.
Verona peeled away on the final climb and held a slender advantage over the peloton all the way to the line. The 21-year-old Del Toro did enough to hold on to the lead, the Mexican remaining 1min 20sec ahead of Simon Yates with Spaniard Juan Ayuso third, six seconds further adrift -- small change given the mountains ahead.
“The whole country is behind me. It´s incredible, like a dream,” said Del Toro, who took the lead a week ago, and is now being followed by an increasing number of Mexicans arriving in Italy to support him.
Egan Bernal´s Ineos team were a chief protagonist during an eventful stage, with attacks on both big climbs. “We have nothing to lose on this Giro, and everything to ride for,” Bernal said. Second-placed Yates of Visma kept his powder dry the first time Bernal accelerated on the Monte Grappa 21km climb but Del Toro skipped after him with ease.

New Zealand´s Conway hit 52 and South African Brevis made 57 off 23 balls to fire Chennai to 230-5 after they elected to bat first at the world´s biggest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. The bowlers then combined to dismiss Gujarat, who have already qualified for the playoffs, for 147 in 18.3 overs.
Chennai ended with four wins in 14 matches with debate raging once again over the future of their veteran M.S. Dhoni, who took over as leader midway after injury to regular captain Ruturaj Gaikwad.
The 43-year-old Dhoni has been linked with retirement but chose to keep his cards close to his chest after the game. “I have four-five months to decide, there´s no hurry,” said Dhoni.
The former India captain, who turns 44 in July, has had an underwhelling IPL season scoring just 196 runs down the order. However, he has again shone with his wicketkeeping, pulling off several fine stumpings.
“Need to keep the body fit,” said Dhoni. “You have to be at your best. If cricketers start retiring for their performance, some of them will retire at 22. I will go back to Ranchi, enjoy a few bike rides.
“I am not saying I am done, not saying I am coming back. I have the luxury of timing.” Gujarat, Punjab Kings, Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Mumbai Indians are certain of filling the top four places, but are fighting to finish in the top two spots which offer two shots at reaching the final on June 3. Gujarat end the group stage with 18 points. Punjab (17), Bengaluru (17) and five-time winners Mumbai (16) have one match left.

Shoaib scoops singles title in Federal Cup tennis,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315271-shoaib-scoops-singles-title-in-federal-cup-tennis,"ISLAMABAD: Muhammad Shoaib prevailed over Muzammil Murtaza in three sets to win the men’s singles in the 37th OGDCL Federal Cup National Ranking Tennis Championships that concluded here at the PTF Complex Courts
Shoaib won with the scores of 7-6(6), 2-6, 6-4. Due to a thunderstorm and rain in the capital city, the men’s singles started late in the evening.
In a thrilling showdown, 23-year-old top seed Shoaib of PAF successfully defended his title against Muzammil in an exhilarating three-set battle that lasted over 2 hours and 58 minutes. Muzammil started strong, breaking Shoaib early and taking a 3-0 lead. However, Shoaib quickly adjusted his strategy, breaking back in the fifth game and forcing a tiebreak after both the players held serve. In the tiebreak, Shoaib’s early mini-break and consistent pressure earned him a hard-fought 8-6 win in the first set.
The second set saw Muzammil bounce back with renewed focus, breaking Shoaib’s serve in the 4th and 6th games to level the match with a 6-2 win. In the deciding set, both the players showcased exceptional baseline rallies and strategic cross-court shots, reaching 4-4. Shoaib then delivered a clinical performance, breaking Muzammil’s serve in the ninth game with powerful down-the-line winners.
He maintained his composure while serving for the match, forcing unforced errors from his opponent and sealing the final set 6-4. The enthralling final was officiated by ITF White Badge Umpire Husnain Mehmood, ensuring a high standard of officiating.
Earlier in the day, in the Junior 18 & Under singles, Muhammad Salar emerged as the champion, defeating promising Islamabad youngster Hazik Aasim in a competitive straight-sets match.
Air Blue Director (Commercial) Muhammad Shafik, Majid Bashir, President of the Islamabad Tennis Association, and Mr. Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi, President of the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF), attended as the guests of honour and distributed trophies and prizes amongst the winners and runners-up.

Roland Garros pays tribute to retired ‘King of Clay’ Nadal,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315272-roland-garros-pays-tribute-to-retired-king-of-clay-nadal,"PARIS: Rafael Nadal was given a rousing reception as the ´King of Clay´ stepped onto Court Philippe Chatrier for the final time on Sunday in a ceremony to celebrate his career at the French Open.
The 38-year-old, who retired from tennis last November, was serenaded by the Roland Garros crowd, with spectators wearing different coloured t-shirts to create the message “14 RG, Rafa”.
Nadal dominated the French Open after winning on debut as a teenager in 2005, lifting the trophy a record-breaking 14 times. The Spaniard finished with a remarkable 112-4 win-loss record at the clay-court Grand Slam.
He last won the title in 2022 and played his final match on the Paris clay last year when he was defeated by Alexander Zverev in the first round. “I don´t know how to start... I´ve been playing on this court for 20 years. I suffered, I won, I lost. I have lived many emotions here on this court,” an emotional Nadal told the crowd after watching a video of his career highlights at Roland Garros.
Nadal´s family and friends watched from the player´s box, along with many of his former coaching staff, including his uncle Toni. “Without doubt, the most important tennis court of my career,” Nadal added to cheers.
“It´s been an incredible story that began back in 2004 when I came to Roland Garros for the very first time. I could barely walk on crutches due to a foot injury. I climbed to the top of the court and looked out and couldn´t wait to play here.”
Nadal won the title the very next year after that injury setback, downing Mariano Puerta in the final. Nadal´s long-time rivals Novak Djokovic, fresh from winning his 100th ATP title on Saturday, Roger Federer and Andy Murray all joined him on the main Chatrier court.
The trio walked out after Nadal´s speech to greet their fellow former world number one, to a deafening roar from the fans. “After all these years fighting for everything, it´s unbelievable how time changes the perspective of things,” Nadal said to the other members of the ´Big Four´.
“All the nerves, pressure, strange feelings when you see each other when you´re rivals, it´s completely different when you finish your career. “We built amazing rivalries but I think in a good way, we fought hard for titles but were good colleagues and respected one another...
“It means a lot that you´re all here. I really enjoyed a lot pushing myself to the limit every single day to compete with all of you.” Nadal hung up his racquet following the 2024 Davis Cup Finals in Malaga, initially denying him an opportunity to wave goodbye to his adoring fans in Paris.
His tally of 14 victories at a single Grand Slam appears unlikely to be beaten, with Margaret Court´s 11 Australian Open titles second on the all-time list. Nadal was presented with a special trophy commemorating his French Open record, with a mark of his footprint carved into the clay.
The 22-time Grand Slam champion received a send-off after his final match at the Davis Cup, but French tennis federation chief Gilles Moretton said earlier this year that “the tribute was not, in my opinion, what it should have been”. He said he had gone to visit Nadal at his home in December along with Roland Garros tournament director Amelie Mauresmo to discuss plans for Sunday´s ceremony.

Norris wins ‘dream’ maiden Monaco Grand Prix,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315273-norris-wins-dream-maiden-monaco-grand-prix,"Monaco: Lando Norris resisted intense pressure to claim a well-deserved victory for McLaren ahead of Ferrari´s local hero Charles Leclerc in Sunday´s strangely chaotic and tactical Monaco Grand Prix.
The Briton came home 3.131 seconds clear of last year´s winner with championship leading McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri taking third. Four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull came next ahead of seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton in the second Ferrari.
Norris became the first McLaren winner in Monaco since Hamilton, in his first title-winning season of 2008. It was his first Monaco triumph, his second this year and the sixth of his career. French rookie Isack Hadjar finished sixth for the RB team ahead of Esteban Ocon of Haas, Liam Lawson in the second RB and the Williams pair Alex Albon and Carlos Sainz.
“Monaco baby, yeah baby!” screamed Norris from his car during his slowdown lap after closing to within three points of Piastri in the title race. “It feels amazing. It´s a long and gruelling race. I was nervous into the last corner and we pushed, but we won in Monaco so it doesn´t matter how you do it.
“I´ve realised a dream today.” The race began on a clear, dry and sunlit afternoon with the teams choosing a wide range of tyres ahead of the first mandatory two-stop race. Norris made a solid start from pole, but went close to sliding off at Ste Devote. He held on to resist Leclerc before a quartet of tail-enders - including Yuki Tsunoda and Pierre Gasly made early stops.
A skirmish involving Kimi Antonelli and Gabriel Bortoleto was followed by early use of a virtual safety car (VSC) which prompted the first stops, but most stayed out with Norris hanging on in front.
Yellow flags waved again on lap eight when Gasly lost control of his Alpine at the Nouvelle Chicane and ran into Tsunoda´s Red Bull, damaging his front left wheel. He limped back to the pits and retired.
The disrupted order was affected by off-set strategies as teams sought to control one car´s pace to create space for a pit-stop for the other. This ploy required Hamilton, Lawson and Sainz, among others, to sacrifice their races, in the process slowing the field and creating traffic jams.
Hamilton pitted on lap 18 and Norris on 20, the race leader resuming in fourth as Hadjar, making the most of RB´s tactics, pitted for a second time and returned in eighth. By lap 30, despite the pit-lane chaos, it was ´as you were´ at the front with Norris leading Leclerc, Piastri and Verstappen - and Hamilton fifth, despite his three-place penalty.
Obeying team orders, Hamilton built a deficit of 14 seconds behind Verstappen, to create a gap for Leclerc´s second stop before Alonso retired at the Rascasse. After more pit stops and with 25 laps to go, Verstappen led Norris from Leclerc and Piastri fourth, but the champion had a stop to make as attention switched to incidents that saw George Russell and Antonelli cut the chicane to pass a deliberately slow Alex Albon.
Russell refused to hand back the place and was given a drive-through penalty. “I prefer not to speak,” he said, clearly furious. For Mercedes, it was a day to forget.
“It´s not way we want to race,” admitted Williams´ chief James Vowles, having schemed his men to ninth and 10th. Verstappen hung on in front on his old tyres, hoping for a red flag stoppage to gift him a cheap stop as he backed off and compressed the front group into the closing laps. He knew, too, that he faced a 30-second penalty if he did not stop again and would finish fourth anyway before he came in ahead of the final lap to rejoin behind the top trio.

Real Madrid ‘legend’ Alonso returns as new coach,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315274-real-madrid-legend-alonso-returns-as-new-coach,"MADRID: Real Madrid appointed Xabi Alonso to replace Carlo Ancelotti as coach on Sunday, with the Spaniard to take over from June 1 and lead the team at the Club World Cup.
“Xabi Alonso will be the Real Madrid coach for the next three seasons, from June 1, 2025 until June 30, 2028,” said Real Madrid in a statement. With veteran Italian coach Ancelotti taking the reins of the Brazilian national team, Madrid secured a deal with former midfielder Alonso, whom they have been linked with for months.
Alonso, 43, leaves German side Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the Bundesliga season after finishing second. “Alonso is one of the biggest legends at Real Madrid and in world football,” continued Los Blancos’ statement.
“He wore our shirt in 236 games between 2009 and 2014. During that time he won six trophies.” Alonso will be officially presented on Monday at 1030 GMT. The Spaniard coached Leverkusen to a league and German Cup double in the 2023-2024 campaign, with his team unbeaten in the top flight, making him a target for Europe’s top clubs.
Basque coach Alonso had an agreement with Leverkusen to allow him to depart if one of his former sides, including Madrid, Liverpool and Bayern Munich, wanted to hire him. Ancelotti’s Madrid endured a disappointing campaign, winning the European Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup but suffering Champions League quarter-final elimination by Arsenal.
Barcelona beat Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup and Copa del Rey finals and then reclaimed the Liga throne from their arch-rivals, meaning they failed to win a major trophy. Madrid added French superstar Kylian Mbappe last summer but Ancelotti found it hard to include him in the team alongside Vinicius Junior without destabilising it.
Mbappe netted 31 La Liga goals which should earn him the European Golden Shoe, but Alonso´s main job will be to restore the team’s solidity without compromising the attack. After losing two matches in the whole of the previous campaign, this season Madrid slumped to 14 defeats.
Alonso will replace one of the most successful managers in Madrid’s history, despite their struggles this season. Ancelotti, 65, took Los Blancos to 15 trophies during two spells at the club, spanning six years. The Italian won three Champions League trophies in Madrid, including La Decima -- Madrid’s 10th -- in 2014, with Alonso as part of his squad, although he was suspended for the final.

Sadom qualifies for British Open with Korea win,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315275-sadom-qualifies-for-british-open-with-korea-win,"SEOUL: Thailand’s Sadom Kaewkanjana claimed a spot at this year’s British Open at Royal Portrush after reeling in countryman Poom Saksansin to win the Korea Open by two strokes on Sunday.
Sadom won his third title on the Asian Tour after holding his nerve on the final day at La Vie Est Belle golf club to overturn Poom’s one-stroke overnight lead. Sadom made two crucial birdies on the back nine after an up-and-down opening to lift his first trophy on the Asian Tour in three years.
The 26-year-old said he was “very excited” to win the competition and secure his place at the Open in Northern Ireland in July. “It is a big honour to win this event, it’s one of the biggest in the region,” he said.
Sadom bogied three holes on the front nine, including the first, but evened it out with four birdies to finish seven-under par overall. He was locked in a close tussle with playing partner Poom but kept his composure to hang on for the victory.
“I’m happy when I play with my Thai friends,” said Sadom. “It helps, and Poom is a great player.” Poom was chasing his fifth win on the Asian Tour but he made a nightmare start with a double-bogey on the second hole.
He then bogied two consecutive holes on the back nine to hand Sadom the initiative, and was given the news after he finished his round that his grandmother had passed away. “It was a tough day, not too bad actually to finish in second place and keep my card,” he said.
“But I got some bad news from my house, so the result is not important now.” South Korea’s Yoo Song-gyu finished third. Zimbabwe’s Scott Vincent, who plays on the LIV Golf circuit, ended the
competition in a tie for fourth. Former Australian motorcycle gang member-turned-golfer Ryan Peake, who also qualified for the British Open after winning the New Zealand Open earlier this year, finished 57th.

Russo says Champions League triumph just the start for Arsenal women,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315276-russo-says-champions-league-triumph-just-the-start-for-arsenal-women,"LONDON: Arsenal forward Alessia Russo wants the Gunners´ stunning women´s Champions League final triumph to be the springboard for further success.
The London club upset the odds with a 1-0 win over Barcelona in Lisbon on Saturday as they dethroned the Spanish side, who had won the trophy three times in the previous four seasons. Arsenal are still the only English club to win the women´s edition, having previously lifted the trophy as part of an historic quadruple in 2007.
Their latest continental triumph, sealed by Stina Blackstenius´ 74th-minute goal, guarantees Arsenal a direct place in next season´s Champions League league phase -- along with Women´s Super League champions Chelsea, who for all their domestic success have still to be crowned queens of European football -- after they became the first team in history to reach the final from qualifying round one.
“I´m absolutely buzzing,” said Russo. “I can´t really put it into words, it just feels bloody amazing. It feels surreal right now, but I just had so much belief going into this game. We all did.
“We didn´t really want to say it too much, but we all kind of had this feeling. We knew we could and we just had to go and deliver.” Victory means Arsenal will also represent Europe in the inaugural FIFA Women´s Champions Cup next year, entering as automatic semi-finalists.
But Russo is adamant lifting the Champions League trophy should only be a first step on the road to further glory for manager Renee Slegers´ team. “I feel like that massively,” said Russo. “When you win things, you want to win things even more, and also you know you´re good enough to do it.
“It was important to win for many reasons, but now we want to win more. We want to go back and start next year strong. We want to compete domestically more so than we did this year, and we want to be back winning this trophy again.” Arsenal will celebrate their European title on Monday alongside 10,000 fans outside their Emirates Stadium headquarters in north London.

Pakistan’s Bano wins gold medal at Asian Ju-Jitsu,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315279-pakistan-s-bano-wins-gold-medal-at-asian-ju-jitsu,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s Bano Kausar made history by clinching gold in the 48kg Ju-Jitsu Contact event, defeating India’s Richa Sharma in the final of the 9th Asian Ju-Jitsu Championship 2025, held in Amman, Jordan.
Bano’s victory came after an impressive semifinal win against Thailand’s Sugun Nutchayafrom, solidifying her position as one of Pakistan’s top martial artists. Despite financial constraints that saw Pakistan competed with a small contingent of six players (three men and three women) on a self-sponsored basis. The team delivered commendable performances, securing four medals.
Winners: Gold: Bano Kausar (48kg Ju-Jitsu Contact event); Bronze: Kainat Arif & Isra Waseem (Duo Women & Show Women categories); Bronze: M. Ali Rashid & M. Yousaf Ali (Duo Men event).
Notably, Bano Kausar participated in this event for the first time, though she is no stranger to competitive combat sports—having been an Asian MMA champion. The National Federation of Ju-Jitsu (PJJF) has continued its training efforts despite limited resources, with coaches like M. Altaf playing a pivotal role in developing top-tier athletes like Kausar from the ground up.

India’s new Test captain Gill relishes ‘exciting’ challenge,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315280-india-s-new-test-captain-gill-relishes-exciting-challenge,"NEW DELHI: India’s new Test captain Shubman Gill said Sunday that his mantra is “leading by example” and that he relishes the challenge of starting the new role in an all-important tour of England.
The 25-year-old Gill was named Rohit Sharma’s successor on Saturday, when the selectors announced the team for the five-Test series in England beginning June 20. “To be able to get this opportunity is a great honour... it’s a big responsibility,” Gill said in a video released by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).
“I’m looking forward to this exciting opportunity and I think the upcoming series in England is going to be a very exciting one,” he added. “I believe in leading by example -- not just by performance, but, I think, off the field by discipline and hard work.”
Gill will take charge of a team in transition after the shock retirements of stalwarts Rohit and Virat Kohli -- who resigned within days of each other this month. “As a captain, a leader should be able to know when to step in, but also when to give space to the players,” he said.
“Because everyone has... had a different life and grown up differently, everyone has a different personality. “A good leader should always be able to know what makes his players to be able to have the best performance.”
Gill has led Gujarat Titans into the playoffs of the ongoing Indian Premier League T20 tournament. A top-order batter with a wide range of shots, Gill was identified as a batting successor to Kohli after impressing on his Test debut in Melbourne, where he opened and made 45 and an unbeaten 35 as India beat Australia by eight wickets.
He has watched Kohli as batter and captain from close quarters before he became deputy to Rohit in the ODI format. Kohli was “always very aggressive, always wanting to lead from the front with hunger and passion”, Gill said.
Rohit was “also someone who was always very attacking on the field”, but was also “very calm and tactically always very present”, and was good at being “communicative to the players” telling them what he wants.
Those are the “qualities that I learned from them”, he said. Gill has played 32 Tests, scoring 1,893 runs at an average of 35.05 with five hundreds. Some have raised question marks over his record outside India, but former captain Sunil Gavaskar said a young Gill could serve as a long-term choice.
“It’s a good selection, because we´re looking to the future,” Gavaskar told TV channel India Today. “Yes, you might argue that he has only played 30-odd Tests,” he added. “But several Indian captains had even fewer matches under their belts before being handed the reins -- and many went on to enjoy long tenures.”

N Korea detains officials over warship accident,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315354-n-korea-detains-officials-over-warship-accident,"SEOUL: North Korea has detained shipyard officials responsible for a recent major accident during the launch of a new warship, state media said on Sunday.
The failed launch that crippled the 5,000-tonne warship was witnessed by leader Kim Jong Un who said the accident damaged the country’s dignity and vowed to punish those found responsible. The mishap likely occurred in front of a large crowd at the northeastern port of Chongjin, increasing the public humiliation for Kim who tried to show off military might, experts say.
As the investigation into the case intensified, law enforcement authorities arrested the chief engineer of the Chongjin Shipyard among others, state KCNA news agency reported on Sunday.

George Floyd’s uncertain legacy marked in US five years on,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315355-george-floyd-s-uncertain-legacy-marked-in-us-five-years-on,"MINNEAPOLIS: Americans on Sunday marked five years since George Floyd was killed by a US police officer, as President Donald Trump backtracks on reforms designed to tackle racism.
Floyd´s deadly arrest on May 25, 2020 helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement into a powerful force that sought to resolve America´s deeply rooted racial issues, from police violence to systemic inequality.
But since Trump´s return to power in January -- he was serving his first term when Floyd died -- his administration has axed civil rights investigations and cracked down on diversity hiring initiatives.
BLM, meanwhile, finds itself lacking the support it enjoyed when protesters sprawled across US cities and abroad during the Covid pandemic -- with many now agreeing the movement achieved little of substance.
Some Democratic politicians, as well as UN rights chief Volker Turk, commemorated the anniversary on Sunday. “As anti-racism, inclusion efforts & law enforcement reforms face serious setbacks, we must continue advocating for racial justice & equality globally -- with greater determination & strength,” Turk wrote on X.
A memorial event was held this weekend at what has been named George Floyd Square, the area of Minneapolis where the 46-year-old took his final breath as police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck during an arrest.
Dozens of people on Sunday visited the small junction set in a residential part of the northern US city, which is covered with protest art, including a purple mural that reads “You Changed the World, George.”
That optimistic message painted in 2020 is now, however, at odds with a president whose more extreme allies have suggested he pardon Chauvin, who was convicted of murdering Floyd and sentenced to more than 22 years in prison.
Some experts believe Trump´s re-election was partly a backlash to BLM activism, which included protests that turned to riots in some cities and calls to defund the police. Floyd´s family members told AFP on Friday that they wanted people to continue pushing for reform despite the hostile political climate.
“We don´t need an executive order to tell us that Black lives matter,” said his aunt Angela Harrelson, who wore a dark T-shirt depicting Floyd´s face. “We cannot let a setback be a holdback for the great comeback. Donald Trump just didn´t get the memo,” she added to nods from other relatives standing beside her.

German ruling party figure urges Nord Stream talks with Russia,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315357-german-ruling-party-figure-urges-nord-stream-talks-with-russia,"BERLIN: A senior member of German Chancellor Friedrich Merz´s party called on Sunday for talks with Russia over a possible relaunch of the controversial Nord Stream gas pipeline.
Michael Kretschmer, state premier of the eastern region of Saxony, described the pipeline as “a possible opening for a conversation with Russia”. Earlier this month Merz spoke out against reported US-Russian plans to relaunch Nord Stream 2, saying the project “currently has no operating licence, and this is not expected to change”.
There have been reports that US and Russian envoys are discussing a relaunch of the pipeline, this time with the involvement of American investors. Nord Stream 2 was completed in 2021 but never went into operation as Germany scrapped the project after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.
Kretschmer has previously advocated a softer line towards Moscow. He argued on Sunday that talking to Russia over Nord Stream could be “a positive approach” as opposed to “attempting to force Russia, as has been the case so far.
“It´s not for nothing that something similar was being discussed among diplomats in Brussels a few months ago,” he told the Zeit newspaper. “As long as we keep saying: ´We don´t want anything, we don´t want any gas imports, we´re only applying sanctions´, there´s no reason to talk to us,” said Kretschmer. The pipeline could also be a way of combatting the high energy costs which have hit the German economy, particularly since the start of Russia´s invasion. However, he admitted that for the moment there was “no readiness for a change of strategy” among most other German politicians.

Macron arrives in Vietnam for Southeast Asia tour,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315358-macron-arrives-in-vietnam-for-southeast-asia-tour,"HANOI: French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in Vietnam on Sunday for the first leg of a tour of Southeast Asia, where he will pitch his country as a reliable alternative partner to the United States and China.
During his six-day trip -- which includes stops in Indonesia and Singapore -- Macron will underscore his respect for the sovereignty of Asian countries “caught between the United States and China”, a presidential aide said during a pre-tour briefing.
The French president is due to meet Vietnam´s top leadership on Monday in the capital Hanoi and key energy sector players on Tuesday. Macron is hoping to showcase France´s expertise in civil nuclear power in Vietnam and Indonesia, which are keen to embrace this form of energy, although other countries including Russia are also in the running for deals.
“The major challenges of the century... can only be met in cooperation with our partners,” Macron wrote on social media after landing in Hanoi. “I´ve come here to strengthen our ties in key areas: defence, innovation, energy transition and cultural exchanges. Everywhere I go, I´ll be saying one simple thing: France is a power of peace and balance,” he said. “It is a reliable partner that believes in dialogue and cooperation. When some choose to withdraw, France chooses to build bridges.”

Thousands rally in Warsaw for Polish presidency rivals,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315359-thousands-rally-in-warsaw-for-polish-presidency-rivals,"WARSAW: Tens of thousands of people rallied in central Warsaw on Sunday in rival demonstrations for the two candidates in Poland´s presidential election on June 1.
Warsaw´s pro-EU mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who is backed by Poland´s centrist government, will square off against nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. As they marched, Nawrocki´s supporters sang patriotic and religious songs and held up signs calling for an end to immigration.
“Change is coming. We will win!”, Nawrocki told the crowd. “I am Polish and so I am voting for a candidate who will guarantee our future and act as a counterbalance to the current government,” said Piotr Slaby, a financial sector worker from the city of Przemysl in southeastern Poland.
Piotr Nowak, a technician from Warsaw, 41, said: “We have a cosmopolitan government. They want to introduce the euro and we will lose our sovereignty.” Organisers estimated there were around 200,000 people at the Nawrocki rally while Prime Minister Donald Tusk said 500,000 people had attended the pro-Trzaskowski rally. But an analysis by the Onet media outlet estimated the size of the Nawrocki rally at 70,000 and the Trzaskowski one at up to 160,000.
Opinion polls are predicting a dead heat next Sunday, with both candidates on 46.3 percent. Trzaskowski, 53, won the first round of the election on May 18 by a razor-thin margin, getting 31 percent against 30 percent for 42-year-old Nawrocki.
The job of Polish president comes with the power to veto laws, which has often held back Tusk´s government under the current nationalist president Andrzej Duda. Victory for Trzaskowski would be a major boost for Tusk, a former European Council chief who returned to power in 2023 parliamentary elections. A win for Nawrocki -- a fan of US President Donald Trump -- would probably extend the political deadlock in the Central European country of 38 million people.
Experts predict this could lead to fresh parliamentary elections. A Nawrocki win could also undermine Poland´s steadfast support for Kyiv, as he opposes NATO membership for Ukraine and has denounced the benefits given to the one million Ukrainian refugees living in Poland.
At the Trzaskowski rally, many supporters could be seen waving European Union and LGBTQ flags. “These elections are about being able to build, create and not destroy,” the candidate told supporters.
“Everyone can fit under the white-and-red flag” of Poland, he said, giving examples of heterosexual and same-sex couples. Irek Kurnik, a 52-year-old businessman, said a vote for Trzaskowski was “the only way to go towards Europe” instead of Russia.
“Choosing between the two candidates is like choosing between night and day, and we choose day,” he told AFP. Romanian president-elect Nicusor Dan, a pro-EU centrist who is due to be sworn in on Monday in his country, also attended the Trzaskowski march.
Dan won a tense election this month against nationalist rival George Simion, who had campaigned against the EU´s “absurd policies” and wanted to cut aid to Ukraine. Olivia, 20, a student who declined to give her last name, said she supported Trzaskowski “above all because he wants to protect LGBTQ people and women´s rights on the issue of abortion”. Trzaskowski has vowed to campaign for women´s rights and legalise abortion in the predominantly Catholic country, which has a near-total ban on the procedure.

"Turkiye, PKK must both change for peace: former militant",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315360-turkiye-pkk-must-both-change-for-peace-former-militant,"DIYARBAKIR, Turkiye: “When you try and explain peace to people, there is a very serious lack of trust,” said Yuksel Genc, a former fighter with the PKK, which recently ended its decades-long armed struggle against the Turkish state.
Talking over a glass of tea in a square in Diyarbakir, the biggest city in Turkiye´s Kurdish-dominated southeast, this 50-year-old former fighter with long auburn curls is worried about how the nascent rapprochement between Ankara and the Kurdistan Workers´ Party (PKK) will play out.
“The guerillas are sincere, but they don´t think the state is,” said Genc, her words briefly interrupted by the roar of a fighter jet flying overhead. “They think the government does not trust them.” For years, she was a fighter with the Kurdish rebel group, which on May 12 said it would disarm and disband, ending a four-decade armed struggle against the Turkish state that cost more than 40,000 lives.
The historic move came in response to an appeal by its jailed founder Abdullah Ocalan, arrested in 1999 and serving life in solitary ever since on a prison island near Istanbul.
Genc herself joined the militants in 1995 when she was a 20-year-old university student in Istanbul. “At that time, many Kurdish villages were being burnt down, and we were constantly hearing about villages being evacuated, people being displaced and unsolved murders,” she said. She described it as “a time of terrible repression”.

"Malaysia calls for Myanmar truce extension, pushes for peace deal",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315361-malaysia-calls-for-myanmar-truce-extension-pushes-for-peace-deal,"KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia called on Sunday for the extension and expansion of a post-earthquake ceasefire in Myanmar, as it ramped up calls for the long-awaited implementation of a five-point peace plan.
The ruling military junta initially declared a truce in the many-sided civil war after a huge quake in late March killed nearly 3,800 and left tens of thousands homeless. That agreement, which has been extended before, is due to expire at the end of May -- though conflict monitors say fighting and junta airstrikes have continued throughout.
At a meeting of regional foreign ministers on Sunday, Malaysia´s Mohamad Hasan “proposed the extension and expansion of ceasefires beyond the currently affected zones”, a statement said.
“We call on the stakeholders in Myanmar to cease hostilities, and to extend and expand the ceasefire, to facilitate the long and difficult path towards recovery, and ease the suffering of the people of Myanmar,” Mohamad said in his opening remarks.
The United Nations and independent conflict monitors say the junta has continued its campaign of aerial bombardment despite the ceasefire. Numerous anti-coup and ethnic armed groups have made their own pledges to pause hostilities.
However some residents in eastern Myanmar said they have been displaced as anti-coup forces besieged junta-held towns. More than 6,600 people have been killed since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, and millions displaced.

"In India’s congested cities, delivery apps cash in",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315362-in-india-s-congested-cities-delivery-apps-cash-in,"MUMBAI: In India´s sprawling financial hub of Mumbai armies of “dabbawalas” have for decades crisscrossed the city by foot and bicycle, delivering home-cooked food to office workers who are keen to avoid the searing heat and traffic-snarled streets.
Now, across the country, young entrepreneurs are taking that tradition to the next level with the explosion of shopping apps that allow customers to get hold of not only food and drink but anything else from clothes to iPhones -- within minutes.
The so-called quick commerce apps are redefining the retail game, not only disrupting e-commerce titans such as Amazon with their speed and efficiency but also long-established “mom and pop” stores which are no longer convenient enough.
At a warehouse managed by online grocer BigBasket in central Mumbai, employees work with military-like precision to pull off deliveries in just 10 minutes. These warehouses are known within the industry as “dark stores”, a reference to being closed off to customers. When a new order is received, a worker leaps into action, darting through aisles filled with everything from fizzy drinks to vegetables, packing a bag of groceries handed to a motorbike rider -- the modern-day “dabbawala”, Hindi for “lunchbox man”.
Local tech companies have poured in billions to set up these nifty logistical networks across big cities, fuelling India´s rapid shopping industry. For millions of customers, it´s an easy way to avoid shopping in the sweltering heat -- visiting multiple food stalls -- and spending hours navigating the country´s notorious traffic jams. Growth has been “very strong”, BigBasket co-founder Vipul Parekh told AFP, pointing to forecasts that indicate a compounded annual growth rate of more than 60 percent over the next two to three years.

French authorities blame sabotage for second power blackout,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315363-french-authorities-blame-sabotage-for-second-power-blackout,"NICE, France: French authorities on Sunday blamed sabotage and ordered heightened security after a fire at an electricity sub-station in Nice caused the second major power blackout in two days along the Riviera.
The latest fire cut power to about 45,000 homes in western Nice for several hours, authorities said. Nice airport was briefly without electricity, the city´s deputy mayor Gael Nofri told AFP. A similar arson attack on a power substation on Saturday partially disrupted the final day of the Cannes film festival, forcing organisers to use backup generators to keep the event going.
Prosecutors said they had opened an investigation and were looking into a claim on Sunday by two anarchist groups of “responsibility for the attack on electrical installations on the Cote d´Azur”. The claim was posted on an alternative website.
“I vigorously condemn these criminal acts hitting our country,” Nice mayor Christian Estrosi said on X. “We are making images from our monitoring centre available to investigators and will strengthen the city´s network at strategic electrical sites in coming days,” he added.
“Until the perpetrators of these acts have been arrested, we will not ease up our attention anywhere,” Estrosi told reporters. Nice´s chief prosecutor Damien Martinelli said studies had been carried out “to clarify the damage and the methods used to carry out the act” and that police were investigating “arson by an organised group”.

Australia airdrops supplies to farmers stranded by floods,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315364-australia-airdrops-supplies-to-farmers-stranded-by-floods,"GHINNI GHINNI, Australia: Helicopters were airdropping animal feed on Sunday to farmers in Australia stranded by floods that have killed five and isolated tens of thousands in the country’s southeast.
Recovery was under way in the mid-north coast region of New South Wales state after days of flooding cut off towns, swept away livestock and destroyed homes. At least 10,000 properties may have been damaged in the floods, which were sparked by days of incessant rain, authorities estimate.
The floodwaters “trashed” Dan Patch’s house in rural Ghinni Ghinni near hard-hit Taree, and some cattle on the property have gone without food for days, he said. About 32,000 residents of Australia’s most populous state remained isolated due to floodwaters that were slowly starting to recede, the state’s Emergency Services posted on the X platform.
“The New South Wales government is providing emergency fodder, veterinary care, management advice and aerial support for isolated stock,” state Agriculture Minister Tara Moriarty said in a statement. It said 43 helicopter drops and around 130 drops by other means had provided “isolated farmers with emergency fodder for their stranded livestock”.
At their peak, the floods isolated around 50,000 people, submerging intersections and street signs in mid-north coast towns and covering cars up to their windshields, after fast-rising waters burst river banks. Five deaths have been linked to the floods, the latest a man in his 80s whose body was found at a flooded property about 50 km (30 miles) from Taree, police said. Taree sits along the Manning River more than 300-kms north of the state capital, Sydney.

Uganda suspends military cooperation with Germany,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315365-uganda-suspends-military-cooperation-with-germany,"NAIROBI: Uganda has “suspended” all military cooperation with Germany, its army said on Sunday, claiming the German ambassador “engaged in subversive activities” in the east African country.
The army earlier accused some European embassies of supporting “negative and traitorous groups”, singling out German ambassador Matthias Schauer. It followed reports that diplomats had criticised the behaviour of President Yoweri Museveni´s son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is head of the army.
Kainerugaba, who is considered most likely to succeed his 80-year-old father as president, is known for his colourful social media posts. He has frequently threatened members of the opposition online and recently boasted of kidnapping and torturing the bodyguard of the country´s main opposition leader in his basement.
“The Uganda People´s Defence Forces (UPDF) has with immediate effect suspended all ongoing defence and military cooperation activities with the Federal Republic of Germany,” said army spokesman Chris Magezi on X. “It has to do with him as a person. He is wholly unqualified to be in Uganda. It has nothing to do with the great German people. Whom I admire a lot,” Kainerugaba wrote.

Over 500 migrants rescued off Greek island in recent days,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315366-over-500-migrants-rescued-off-greek-island-in-recent-days,"ATHENS: Greek authorities have rescued more than 500 migrants off the southern island of Crete in recent days, the coastguard said in a statement on Sunday.
Greece is one of the main gateways to Europe for people fleeing war and poverty, mainly from Asia, Africa and the Middle East. In recent years, an increasing number of people have embarked on the migratory route south of the island of Crete, opposite Libya and Egypt.
On Saturday alone, some 280 people were rescued from five separate shipwrecks, including 13 minors, said the coastguard statement. Most were men and many reported having set sail for Greece from Libya, paying “between 150,000 and 200,000 Egyptian pounds (3,000-4,000 dollars)”.
Among them, authorities arrested a 24-year-old Sudanese and suspected smuggler who was later prosecuted. The country´s deadliest shipwreck occurred two years ago, when a rusty, overloaded trawler sank off the south-western Peloponnese peninsula, claiming more than 600 lives, according to the UN.

Italian man kidnapped in bizarre NY crypto plot,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315368-italian-man-kidnapped-in-bizarre-ny-crypto-plot,"NEW YORK: A cryptocurrency investor has been charged with kidnapping an Italian man for weeks, threatening and torturing him with a gun and a chainsaw in a grisly bid to extort his Bitcoin password, court documents and US media said.
In a plot like a bad Hollywood thriller, New York police told AFP on Sunday that they arrested 37-year-old John Woeltz, a Kentucky man, on Friday in the posh Manhattan apartment he was renting.
Woeltz was charged on Saturday with kidnapping, assault and criminal possession of a gun and pleaded not guilty, according to documents seen by AFP. A second person, 24-year-old Beatrice Folchi, is also being held.
The police said the victim, a 28-year-old Italian whose name has not been released, managed to escape and ran up to a traffic agent with a horrific tale of having been held, bound and tortured for weeks before managing to escape from Woeltz´s townhouse.

Vietnam police detain man over damage to ancient throne,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1315369-vietnam-police-detain-man-over-damage-to-ancient-throne,"HANOI: Vietnamese police have detained a man who broke into a history exhibit and damaged an antique throne considered to be one of the nation´s most precious artefacts, conservation officials said on Sunday.
The ornate red-and-gold Nguyen dynasty throne was the royal seat of the last feudal family to rule Vietnam between 1802 and 1945 and has been preserved for posterity in Hue city´s Thai Hoa Palace.
A 42-year-old man “snuck into the Nguyen dynasty display area, screamed and then broke the front left armrest” around midday on Saturday, a statement from the Hue Monuments Conservation Centre (HMCC) said.
In footage circulating on social media and Vietnam news sites purporting to show the incident, the man can be seen sitting cross-legged on the two-century-old throne that is adorned with dragon motifs. He was quickly arrested but showed “signs of psychosis, screaming, talking nonsense and could not answer the investigator´s questions”, the HMCC said.
