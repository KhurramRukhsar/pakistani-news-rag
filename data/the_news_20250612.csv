"Trump says China deal done, Beijing to supply rare earths",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320405-trump-says-china-deal-done-beijing-to-supply-rare-earths,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump touted ties with China as “excellent” on Wednesday, saying the superpowers reached a deal after two days of talks aimed at preserving a truce in their damaging trade war.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that China would supply rare earth minerals and magnets — vital elements for US industries — while Washington would allow Chinese students to remain in US universities. His post came hours after top US and Chinese negotiators announced a “framework” agreement late Tuesday following two days of marathon talks in London.
“Our deal with China is done,” Trump wrote, adding that the agreement was still “subject to final approval with President Xi (Jinping) and me.”
“President XI and I are going to work closely together to open up China to American Trade,” he said in a second post. “This would be a great WIN for both countries!!!”
US stock markets showed little enthusiasm despite Trump’s latest statements, with the broad-based S&P 500 and the Dow flat while the tech-heavy Nasdaq edged higher in morning deals.
The two sides had agreed to reduce their tit-for-tat, triple-digit tariffs during talks in Geneva last month, but cracks appeared in the detente after Trump accused China of violating the deal.
Washington was concerned at slower supplies of rare earths after Beijing in early April began requiring domestic exporters to apply for a license — widely seen as a response to US tariffs.
Rare earths are used in everything from electric vehicles to hard drives, wind turbines and missiles.
US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in London on Tuesday that US measures imposed when rare earths “were not coming” would likely be relaxed once Beijing moved forward with more license approvals. In his Truth Social post, Trump said China will supply “full magnets, and any necessary rare earths... up front.”
Washington has infuriated Beijing by vowing to revoke the visas of Chinese students — a major source of revenue for US universities. On Wednesday, Trump said: “We will provide to China what was agreed to, including Chinese students using our colleges and universities.”
The US president also said that under the deal, the United States would apply 55% tariffs on Chinese goods — a combination of his 30% additional levies and the rough average of pre-existing duties, a White House official said. He said Beijing would charge 10% duties on US goods. The rates are the same as those that were previously agreed in the truce, which brought US tariffs down from 145% and those imposed by China from 125 percent.

KE seeks Rs4.69 per unit refund to consumers in July bills,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320407-ke-seeks-rs4-69-unit-refund-to-consumers-in-july-bills,"ISLAMABAD: K-Electric, the Karachi-based power utility, has filed a petition with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) willing to refund Rs4.69 per unit to consumers in July bills as part of monthly fuel charge adjustments (FCA) for April 2025, totaling approximately Rs7.173 billion.
Nepra has scheduled a public hearing on Thursday, June 19, to review K-Electric’s petition. The hearing will address primary concerns that whether the requested FCA is justified and if the utility adhered to the established merit order when generating electricity from its own power plants and purchasing it from external sources.  If this adjustment was approved, it will apply to all consumer categories except lifeline, protected domestic users, EV charging stations and pre-paid customers.
The FCA for April 2025 has been calculated using the interim tariff established in March 2023 as the reference point. K-Electric’s submission included detailed calculations and supporting documentation for Nepra’s evaluation and approval. As per the K-Electric petition, following the determination of generation tariffs for its power plants for the period after June 2023, the company has provided the required partial load, open cycle and degradation curves, along with startup costs, for regulatory approval. An amount of Rs16 billion for the period from July 2023 to April 2025 is pending adjustment. Additionally, heat rate adjustments for the Bin Qasim Power Station III and Korangi Combined Cycle Power Plant under the previous multi-year tariff — amounting to Rs0.6 billion and Rs0.2 billion, respectively — are also pending. Of the total, Nepra has set aside Rs15.2 billion in K-Electric’s fuel cost adjustment decisions for the months of November 2024 through March 2025. Earlier, on account of March FCA, Nepra also approved a negative FCA of Rs2.98/kWh—amounting to Rs4.045 billion in relief—to be reflected in June electricity bills.

"Minimizing compliance gap will help govt lower tax rates, says FBR chief",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320408-minimizing-compliance-gap-will-help-govt-lower-tax-rates-says-fbr-chief,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial on Wednesday stated that efforts are under way to minimise the tax compliance gap, which could help reduce tax rates further.
In an exclusive interview with theGeo Newsprogramme “Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath”, he said that the enforcement measures would fetch Rs389 billion, and it requires the help of the legislature to approve certain measures proposed in the Finance Bill 2025-26. If not agreed and convinced about enforcement, it might result in increased taxation measures in the budget. The FBR chief admitted that salaried class was bearing more tax burden in country. He said that the enforcement measures would be extended to other sectors after the country witnessed a positive outcome of similar actions in the sugar sector.
His statement came a day after the federal government unveiled the Rs17.57 trillion ($62.24 billion) budget. The budget targets higher revenues and a significant reduction in the fiscal deficit under IMF-backed reforms.
The top FBR officer said that the revenue board saw a roughly 39 percent increase in taxes from the sugar sector via enforcement measures, without any changes to the tax rate or any difference in sugarcane production. “It was a test case for us [to make sugar mills comply with tax measures] in which we have succeeded,” said Langrial. The 39 percent increase in tax proved that there was a compliance gap, he added.
The FBR chief said some sugar mills shut down production after 100 percent monitoring.
He detailed that the FBR used digital means and intelligence sources to monitor the sugar mills, besides strict monitoring of the revenue board’s team.
He went on to say that enforcement measures would be taken against the poultry and beverages sectors in the upcoming fiscal year. He added that the FBR will hold foolproof monitoring of production.
The FBR prepared a priority list to improve enforcement in different sectors, he said. “The way the government is working this year, I am confident the mafia will not be able to succeed,” claimed Langrial. He also hoped that the country would not face a revenue shortfall in the upcoming fiscal year.

"Pakistan, India on brink of nuclear water war: Bilawal",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320409-pakistan-india-on-brink-of-nuclear-water-war-bilawal,"LONDON/BRUSSELS: Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, head of a parliamentary delegation that is touring world capitals to rally support for Pakistan following a recent confrontation with India, has warned that Pakistan and India stand at the edge of a nuclear water war after the Indian government suspended the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) to block the water flow into Pakistan.
Addressing a press conference at the Pakistan High Commission at the conclusion of his two-day tour of the UK capital, Bilawal Bhutto said that the Pakistan military had made the whole nation proud.
He said: “We are proud that the Pakistan army won the war against India under the leadership of Field Marshal General Asim Munir. Pakistan won the war under General Asim Munir’s leadership. His promotion as the Field Marshal is his recognition. The Pakistan Army proved that it can beat India, both at the military and the diplomatic front. We have shown and established our military strength. India’s war was based on lies and its whole narrative was based on falsehood. Now the whole world recognises this fact.”
Bilawal said that India and Pakistan are bound by the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). “Pakistan has said that this will be an act of war if Pakistan’s water is stopped. India is involved in water terrorism against Pakistan. To threaten to stop water coming into Pakistan, this is an act of war. India will have to take back and withdraw its threat. The prospect of a nuclear war over water is a reality.” He said Pakistan may take more aggressive steps if India constructs new canals or dams on the three rivers within its territory.
“India’s threat to shut off the water supply to 240 million people in Pakistan is a violation of the UN Charter. Were they to act on it, Pakistan has been very clear: we’d consider that an act of war,” he said.
He was referring to India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty after the April 22 militant attack in the Pahalgam area of the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said India was involved in transnational repression. He said the Canadian and Western intelligence services, including the US government, had evidence that India was involved in terrorism on Western soil. He mentioned the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada and the assassination attempt on Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, the Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) leader, on the US soil. Bilawal said that after the Pahalgaam attack, the Western world didn’t side with India because it knows that India is involved in terrorism beyond its borders, its neighbourhood and the region and is striking inside Western countries too.
Bilawal condemned Indian external affairs minister Jaishankar for threatening to “strike deep inside Pakistan”. He said: “Jaishankar speaks like a warmonger and not a diplomat. The real problem is extremism in the Indian government. It’s ironic that Modi is running a government whose reputation speaks for itself. Indian role in targeting Sikhs stands exposed before the world. India is a terrorist state, threatening missile strikes on Pakistan without any proof. It’s not a display of strength but a dangerous sign of regional instability, the word must ask who is warmongering here. To this day, India has been unable to share any identity of the so-called terrorists involved in the Pahalgam attack. The truth is India knows Pakistan has nothing to do with this attack, this is what they are hiding from its people. The Pahalgam attack was India’s intelligence failure. India has gone mad and is pursuing its strategy of warmongering but it will fail.”
Bilawal welcomed President Donald Trump’s offer to media between India and Pakistan. He said Pakistan was thankful to the US government’s pragmatic approach and its offer to mediate. “India wants to sabotage Trump’s peace efforts,” he said.
Bilawal thanked President Trump for internationalising the issue of occupied Kashmir. “Kashmir is not a bilateral issue but an international issue and India is forced to address it. India accepts the issue has gone global.” Bilawal said Pakistan had previously presented a full dossier of Indian involvement in terrorism to the world and a new dossier for the international community will be presented soon to show the true face of Indian terrorism before the world.
Talking to The New York Post in a recent interview, Bilawal warned US lawmakers and diplomats last week that the “threshold” for war between his nation and India is lower than ever following clashes in the disputed region of Kashmir last month.
“We’re incredibly grateful for the role that the US government — President Trump, Secretary [of State] Marco Rubio — created throughout this crisis in helping us all achieve this cease-fire,” Bilawal  told The Post.
“But our message has been that the cease-fire is a start, but it is only a start, and what we seek is assistance in our pursuit of peace through dialogue and diplomacy.”
Bilawal warned US lawmakers and diplomats last week that the “threshold” of war between his nation and India is closer than ever following skirmishes in the disputed region of Kashmir last month.
“We’re all a lot less safe as a result of this conflict than we were before,” he added. “The threshold of full-out military conflict between India and Pakistan has been drastically lowered — the lowest it has ever been in our history, as a result of this conflict.” The US-brokered truce between the nuclear-armed nations took effect May 10 after weeks of fighting. The Pakistani delegation that came to Washington expressed a desire to coordinate with India on counter-terrorism — but rejected that Islamabad was involved in any way with the attack.
“The Prime Minister of Pakistan offered an impartial international inquiry because we were confident that Pakistan is not involved in this terrorist incident,” Bilawal said. “The international intelligence community endorses this view.”
“As things stand now, if there’s a terrorist attack anywhere in India,” he went on, “it immediately means war, and the law of reciprocation means, therefore, if there’s a terrorist attack in Pakistan, we are to also treat it as an act of war.” Bilawal also said that India’s threat to cut off Pakistan’s water was “an existential matter” that would be considered “an act of war.”
“If we are to engage in a new dialogue with India, make new promises with one another that could potentially lead to new treaties, then it’s very important that they abide by the old treaties like the Indus Water Treaty,” he said.
“I’m optimistic that the president is passionate about peace and that he will be successful in pushing that message here in the United States,” he said of Trump. “Pakistan is obviously ready.”
“We had a military upper hand when we agreed to the cease-fire. We did so on the stipulation that the cease-fire would be the first step,” he said. “I’m optimistic that the president is passionate about peace and that he will be successful in pushing that message here in the United States.” Later, led by the former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal BhuttoZardari, the parliamentary delegation arrived in Brussels after successful visits to Washington, New York and London.
Ambassador of Pakistan to the European Union, Belgium and Luxembourg Rahim Hayat Qureshi received the delegation.
One the directive by the prime minister, the delegation will present Pakistan’s position on recent tensions with India and advocate for a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute in line with UN resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
The Bilawal-led delegation includes Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Minister Musadik Malik, Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Chairperson Sherry Rehman, National Assembly Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Chairperson Hina Rabbani Khar, former minister for commerce, defence and foreign affairs Khurram Dastgir Khan and Mutahidda Qaumi Movement Parliamentary Leader in the Senate Faisal Ali Subzwari.
The delegation also comprises two former foreign secretaries —  Jalil Abbas Jilani, who also served as caretaker foreign minister, and Tehmina Janjua.
In Brussels, the delegation will engage with EU leadership, European Parliament members, EU Commission, European External Action Service, think tanks and media.
They will emphasize Pakistan’s commitment to peace and responsible diplomacy in contrast to India’s provocative actions, calling for dialogue over confrontation, and urging global support for lasting peace in South Asia, including the resumption of the Indus Waters Treaty.

ATC rejects police plea for Imran’s forensic tests,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320411-atc-rejects-police-plea-for-imran-s-forensic-tests,"LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore has dismissed the police request to conduct polygraph and photogrammetric tests of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in 12 cases related to the May 9 riots.
Rejecting the fresh plea of the prosecution, the ATC judge remarked that the court granted permission to the police twice but it failed to conduct polygraph and photogrammetric tests of the accused. The court questioned how the investigation would proceed after the accused’s repeated refusal.
It remarked that the accused was given two opportunities to prove his innocence, but he wasted them due to his obstinacy. The ATC ruled that it would be a mere waste of time to give the accused a third opportunity. It further remarked that this is a unique case where the accused is unwilling to prove his own innocence, and therefore, no additional chances for the tests are required. Later, the ATC ordered the investigation officer to use all legal procedures for completing the probe.

Govt backtracks on electricity bill surcharge,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320412-govt-backtracks-on-electricity-bill-surcharge,"ISLAMABAD: In a dramatic reversal, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday disowned the very proposal he announced a day earlier in his budget speech—imposing a 10 percent surcharge on electricity bills—despite Pakistan having already assured the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it would implement the levy to manage circular debt repayments.
There is no such plan, the minister declared during his post-budget press briefing when asked if the surcharge would be enforced. The comment contradicts his budget speech on Tuesday, where he announced a proposed amendment to the Nepra Act empowering the federal government to impose and extend a 10 percent Debt Servicing Surcharge (DSS) “for a specific period and purpose.”
“In order to manage the repayment of current circular debt through refinancing, any debt servicing surcharge (DSS) will not be used for paying mark-up or profit but strictly for principal debt repayment,” he had said in parliament.
Aurangzeb during the briefing also confirmed the government has finalised Rs1.3 trillion in bank borrowing to retire power sector debt. “That surcharge was of the Power Division and a DSS was levied. The government wants to convert the costly credit into cheap credit to finance the circular debt and its retirement,” he told reporters.
He said recoveries in the power sector had improved, although “transmission losses are still to move in the right direction”. Due to these gains, power sector subsidies will be trimmed to Rs1.036 trillion in FY26, down from Rs1.19 trillion—saving Rs154 billion.
Yet, the IMF’s staff report, issued May 17, states that Pakistan committed to adopt legislation by June 2025 to remove the DSS cap and finance Rs1.252 trillion in new loans through DSS revenues over six years. This would repay Rs683 billion in PHL loans and Rs569 billion in arrears to producers. If DSS revenue falls short, it will be increased to meet payment targets.

£190 million case: IHC adjourns case over judge’s leave,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320413-190-million-case-ihc-adjourns-case-over-judge-s-leave,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday adjourned the hearing on an application for suspension of the sentence of PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, convicted in the £190 million case, and their release on bail.
The cause list of the case was cancelled due to the absence of Justice Muhammad Asif, a member of the division bench that heard the case in the Islamabad High Court, being on leave.
The next hearing will be held on June 26.
A two-member division bench of the IHC, consisting of acting Chief Justice Sardar Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif, was to hear the applications for suspension of sentence of PTI founder Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi in the £190 million case, but due to the absence of Justice Muhammad Asif the petitions could not be heard.
PTI founder’s sister Aleema Khan, along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and the PTI leadership, met acting Chief Justice’s secretary on scheduling the next date.

Pakistan rejects Jaishankar’s remarks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320414-pakistan-rejects-jaishankar-s-remarks,"KARACHI: Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday issued a sharp rebuke to recent comments made by Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar during his visit to Brussels, calling the Indian foreign minister’s statements “irresponsible” and accusing India of promoting hostility instead of regional peace.
In an official statement, the ministry said: “Pakistan categorically rejects the irresponsible remarks made by the external affairs minister of India during different media engagements in Brussels. The discourse of top diplomats should aim to promote peace and harmony, rather than producing bellicose punchlines. The tone and tenor of a foreign minister should be commensurate with his dignified status”.
The statement further said that India has been waging a “malicious campaign” against Pakistan based on a “fictitious narrative of victimhood”, while simultaneously engaging in “state-sanctioned oppression” in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and sponsoring terrorism beyond its borders.
“Instead of pointing fingers at others, India should introspect on its own involvement in terrorism, subversion and targeted assassinations. India must also desist from concocting misleading narratives to justify its recent aggressive actions”, said the ministry. Reaffirming its commitment to diplomacy, Islamabad added: “Pakistan believes in peaceful coexistence, dialogue and diplomacy. However, it stands resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its sovereignty against any aggression, as exemplified by its robust response to India’s reckless strikes, last month”.
The ministry has also advised the Indian leadership to shift focus inward and “discard their obsession with Pakistan”, warning that history will judge leaders not by “who shouted the loudest — but by who acted the wisest”.
Pakistan was responding to Jaishankar’s comments, during a press conference in Brussels on Tuesday alongside EU High Representative Kaja Kallas, in which he characterised the India-Pakistan conflict as a fight against terrorism.
“This is not a conflict between two states per se. This is actually a response to the threat and to the practice of terrorism. So, I would urge you not to think of it as India-Pakistan, but ‘India-Terroristan’, you will then appreciate it”, he said.
In an interview with POLITICO, Jaishankar also claimed that Pakistan was using terrorism as an instrument of state policy and said that India’s recent military actions had significantly damaged Pakistani military infrastructure.
“As far I’m concerned, how effective the Rafale was or frankly, how effective other systems were — to me the proof of the pudding are the destroyed and disabled airfields on the Pakistani side”, he claimed, in reference to last month’s hostilities.
Jaishankar also alleged that Pakistan was openly training “thousands” of terrorists and warned of further retaliatory strikes if cross-border attacks continued.
“We are not going to live with it.... retribution will be against the terrorist organisations and the terrorist leadership....And we don’t care where they are. If they are deep in Pakistan, we will go deep into Pakistan”, he added.
On Thursday, PPP head and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari also condemned Jaishankar’s remarks, saying that “Jaishankar speaks like a warmonger and not a diplomat”. Speaking at a press conference at the Pakistan High Commission in London, Bilawal added that “the real problem is extremism in the Indian government”.

Remittances surge shows expats’ trust in govt: PM,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320415-remittances-surge-shows-expats-trust-in-govt-pm,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that Pakistan received $34.9 billion in remittances during the current fiscal year, reflecting a 28.8 percent increase compared to the previous fiscal year.
In a statement, he emphasized that the surge in remittances is a testament to the growing confidence of overseas Pakistanis in the country’s economic policies.
He further said that in May 2025 alone, remittances amounted to $3.7 billion, marking a 13.7 percent increase from the same month in the previous year.
He expressed satisfaction over the stock market reaching a historic high of 124,000 points and the rise in remittances last month.
In a statement, the prime minister said the bullish trend in the stock market reflects the confidence of investors and the business community in the people-friendly budget.
He mentioned that no additional tax burden has been imposed on the common man in the budget and increase in salaries and reduction in taxes will provide relief to salaried class.
The prime minister said the journey of economic development has begun, adding that all must work together to improve the lives of the common people. He said reduction in inflation, increase in foreign exchange reserves, remittances and exports have been made possible due to the tireless efforts of the economic team.
He said Pakistan’s return from the brink of default and the beginning of economic stability and growth is nothing short of a miracle. “This exemplary economic turnaround, achieved through the hard work of the economic team and by prioritising Pakistan’s national interests, will be remembered in history in golden words,” he observed. The prime minister also highlighted that the government’s economic initiatives, along with a public-friendly budget for the upcoming fiscal year, signal a promising future for Pakistan.

"Gandapur threatens armed march on Capital, to respond to bullets with bullets",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320416-gandapur-threatens-armed-march-on-capital-to-respond-to-bullets-with-bullets,"ISLAMABAD: Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur Wednesday announced they would come to Islamabad with arms and respond to bullets with bullets, though Imran Khan’s sister clarified immediately that her brother had already declared they would go to the federal capital for protest. During a chat with the media here, Gandapur said this time the movement would be decisive “either this way or that way”, as their patience was exhausting now and the only option left was to launch a protest.
“This time, I shall not disclose my plan to come here. I may come via mountains or through a tunnel or whatever,” he remarked and Imran’s sister Aleema immediately clarified that her brother had already made it clear that they would protest across Pakistan and would not come to the federal capital. The KP CM also announced supporting those protesting in the US for Imran Khan and said the overseas could protest as much as they wanted to as they did not face bullets. “It is not possible that someone beats us and we will keep getting beaten.We will support wherever there is a protest.”
Gandapur said that the 26th Constitutional Amendment was a martial law on the judiciary, alleging drama was happening in courts. “Judges go on leave; how long will we watch as spectators? We have never brought weapons with us in protests, but now we will bring them and we will respond to bullets with bullets. If bullets are fired in protests, this time our bullets will also be fired,” he warned. He rejected the federal budget and called it completely disappointing. He said the government had presented a strange budget that neither had a “head nor a foot”. He claimed that there was a situation of hopelessness everywhere and in such a situation it had become necessary to launch a movement and take to the streets.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that getting justice in the country had become the most difficult thing, as Pakistan had come to the 129th spot in the Rule of Law Index. “We were hoping that there would be progress in the case today, but we were told that the judge is on leave,” he said. He explained that senior party leader Omar Ayub would be responsible for this movement; political differences should not be turned into personal enmity. Separately, Aleema Khan does not see any possibility of release of her brother from Adiala jail yet. However, she said Imran is satisfied with his preparations regarding the movement. She said that they could not stop the movement now, all the doors have been closed on them.

COAS Asim Munir to attend US Army’s 250th anniversary in DC,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320417-coas-asim-munir-to-attend-us-army-s-250th-anniversary-in-dc,"KARACHI: Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir is reportedly set to arrive in Washington, DC, following an invitation from his American counterpart to participate in the US Army’s 250th anniversary celebrations, say media reports. The main festivities for the US Army parade will be held on Saturday, June 14, coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s birthday.
Per reports, COAS Asim Munir has been invited to the commemorative event. This visit comes weeks after a serious military flare-up between India and Pakistan, which ended in a US-brokered ceasefire.
The US Army’s 250th anniversary will be marked with a large-scale festival and parade in Washington on Saturday, June 14. The event is expected to feature approximately 6,600 soldiers, 150 military vehicles, and over 50 aircraft.
The date, June 14, was chosen to commemorate the decision by the Second Continental Congress in 1775 to establish a unified Continental Army following early battles at Lexington and Concord during the American Revolutionary War. A day later, on June 15, George Washington was appointed as commander-in-chief.
According to American military officials, planning for the 250th anniversary festival began nearly two years ago, with the idea of a full-scale parade added only earlier this year.

Khawaja Asif criticises salary hike for top lawmakers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320418-khawaja-asif-criticises-salary-hike-for-top-lawmakers,"KARACHI: PML-N leader and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Wednesday publicly criticised the sharp increase in salaries and perks for parliamentary officeholders, calling it “financial obscenity”.
In his post published on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday, Asif said, “The massive increase in the salaries and financial perks of the speaker, deputy speaker, Senate chairperson and deputy chairperson falls under the category of financial obscenity. Please keep the life of the common man in mind -- our honour and dignity are all owed to him.”
The government has approved a more than fivefold increase in the salaries of the Senate chairperson and the National Assembly speaker taking it to Rs1.3 million a month. According to news reports, the officials will also receive 50 per cent of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance. Asif’s post on X sparked both praise and irony-laced reactions. While some lauded the PML-N leader’s bold stance against the government’s move, others dismissed it as symbolic, coming from a senior figure within the ruling coalition.
Social media users were also quick to point out that the budget presented under the PML-N government announced no increase in the minimum wage, criticising the government’s lack of willingness to provide substantial relief to ordinary people.

"Govt to resist boom-bust cycle for sustainable growth, says PM’s aide",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320419-govt-to-resist-boom-bust-cycle-for-sustainable-growth-says-pm-s-aide,"KARACHI: Salman Ahmad, a member  of the Economic Advisory Council, has stated that the incumbent government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to resist the boom-and-bust cycle to ensure sustainable economic growth.
Speaking onGeo Newsprogramme ‘Capital Talk’, he noted that the government was actively undertaking a comprehensive rightsizing exercise aimed at eliminating redundancy, duplication, and inefficiency across federal ministries and departments to reduce the burden on taxpayers and support economic reforms.
He explained that recommendations are being compiled for necessary action wherever public funds are being spent without delivering benefits, especially in ministries devolved to provinces after the 18th Amendment or departments with outdated, redundant mandates.
Out of 39 federal ministries comprising around 450 departments, the government is currently reviewing 32 ministries with nearly 350 departments. “A line-by-line review is underway and recommendations are being sent to the federal cabinet for approval,” he added.
Clarifying that no ministries are being shut down yet, Ahmed said, “We are not closing ministries for now, but we are analysing their functions and sending recommendations — this could involve merging departments, shutting them down, transferring them, or even moving them off the books.”
When asked whether employees would be laid off, he stressed that while rightsizing may lead to tough decisions, it is necessary. “The people of Pakistan are already bearing a heavy tax burden. It is our responsibility to reduce this load through rightsizing, especially in institutions that are unproductive or where no work is being done,” he said.
He also pointed out a broader economic plan — Sustainable Economic Growth, saying: “The journey to sustainable economic growth begins by shedding the perception of default, undertaking structural reforms, ensuring economic stability, attracting investment — and only then can we reach the stage of true, sustainable economic growth.”
Furthermore, he said that when the country travels on the path toward economic stability, political pressure emerges over “lack” of visible economic growth. This pressure, he warned, threatens to derail the reform agenda and push Pakistan back into a boom-bust cycle.
“It is the decision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the current government to resist this cycle and instead pursue long-term structural reforms,” Ahmed stated.
Ahmad further revealed that the rightsizing process has been ongoing for the past year. Recommendations concerning 10 federal ministries have already been submitted to the cabinet, with further reviews continuing steadily. “Every four to five weeks, we forward recommendations for four to five ministries,” he added.
Responding to questions about the nature of these recommendations, Ahmad clarified that the government is not planning to shut down entire ministries. However, depending on their relevance and performance, individual departments within those ministries may be closed, merged, downsized or transferred.

"HIV cases double in a decade, only 16% getting treatment: economic survey",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320380-hiv-cases-double-in-a-decade-only-16pc-getting-treatment-economic-survey,"ISLAMABAD: The prevalence of HIV in the country has doubled over the past decade, increasing from 0.1 per cent in 2015 to 0.2 per cent in 2025, according to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024–25, implying that an estimated 350,000 to 480,000 people are now living with the disease, a troubling surge from under 100,000 cases recorded in 2015.
The growing number highlights a persistent failure to contain the virus, despite multiple donor-funded initiatives and national programmes aimed at prevention and treatment.
The Economic Survey reveals that only 76,167 people living with HIV are currently registered for treatment in Pakistan, while only 53,635 are receiving treatment for the infectious disease. This suggests that over 400,000 individuals remain undiagnosed or are not receiving life-saving antiretroviral therapy (ART).
Experts warn that this wide gap in treatment coverage not only risks the lives of those infected but also increases the chances of continued transmission, especially among high-risk populations.
While the general prevalence remains relatively low, the proportional doubling of cases over a decade is significant. The virus remains concentrated among vulnerable and marginalised groups.
According to recent estimates from the Common Management Unit (CMU) and National AIDS Control Programme (NACP), HIV prevalence among injecting drug users exceeds 21 per cent in several urban centres.
Among men who have sex with men, the prevalence is estimated at around 5.4 per cent, while transgender individuals face rates close to 7.5 per cent. Female sex workers in various regions also exhibit prevalence rates between 2 and 4 per cent.
In fiscal year 2025, HIV prevention services have been expanded to 51 fixed and mobile service delivery sites nationwide. The CMU also launched regional language awareness campaigns through electronic and digital platforms to counter stigma and promote early testing and diagnosis.
However, despite these measures, Pakistan still lags behind international HIV control targets. ART coverage remains below 16 per cent, far short of the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets, which call for 95 per cent of HIV-positive individuals to know their status, 95 per cent of those diagnosed to be on treatment, and 95 per cent of those treated to have suppressed viral loads.
The Economic Survey calls for more integrated and robust action. Although support from the Global Fund has ensured availability of many diagnostic kits, antiretroviral drugs, salaries for health staff, and service delivery gaps persist, particularly in rural and hard-to-reach areas.
A key challenge remains the lack of consistent viral load testing facilities, which are critical for monitoring treatment success. Additionally, medicine stockouts and procurement delays—at times exacerbated by tense trade relations with India—have disrupted access to essential HIV drugs in the past.
The government has been urged to integrate HIV response efforts within broader healthcare systems, including maternal and child health services, prison health programmes, and harm reduction schemes.
Activists and health experts are also pressing for increased domestic financing, policy reforms, and decriminalisation of vulnerable communities to create an enabling environment for effective HIV response. Without such systemic changes, the country risks falling further behind in its efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3, which aims to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030.
With an estimated 480,000 people now living with HIV, Pakistan stands at a crossroads. The choice is between stepping up its public health commitment or facing a deepening epidemic that threatens not only individual lives but the broader goal of national health security.

Why Pakistan must establish a drone army,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320382-why-pakistan-must-establish-a-drone-army,"Pakistan must establish a ‘national drone army’. The Pakistan National Drone Army (PNDA) should aim to build and deploy at least 15,000 military-grade drones over the next three years.
Simultaneously, a minimum of 10,000 certified drone operators must be trained, including personnel from the Frontier Corps, Rangers, and Police. Yes, each army corps should establish dedicated drone regiments to ensure integrated, theatre-level operations. Yes, the PNDA must prioritise the development of AI-enabled and swarming drones to offset Indian advantages in artillery, airpower, and armoured formations. The PNDA should also pursue the export of dual-use drone technologies to generate revenue and cultivate strategic partnerships.
The National Defence University (NDU) should establish a dedicated Drone Warfare School (DWS) comprising three specialised operator tracks: Army Tactical, Air Force ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, Reconnaissance), and Navy Maritime Operations. The DWS must focus on three critical competencies: AI-enabled target recognition, first-person view (FPV) precision strike capability, and resilience against electronic warfare (EW) alongside secure communications protocols.
The federal government must allocate a budget of $500 million for R&D, operator training and at least 3,000 drones. Imagine: $500 million = 1.25 Rafale jets.
The PNDA must form partnerships with NESCOM, Suparco, NUST and Air University. The PNDA must also form joint development programmes with Turkey (STM/Kargu) and China (CASC, CETC).
The PNDA fleet should comprise a balanced mix of platforms: tactical reconnaissance drones (Shahpar); first-person view (FPV) kamikaze drones (Lioutyi-class); loitering munitions (Burraq); AI-enabled swarm drones (Brave1); vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) logistics drones; and naval UAVs comparable to the Bayraktar TB2 for maritime operations.
The PNDA will be our next-generation asymmetric deterrent tied to Pakistan’s nuclear doctrine. We must replace vulnerable Main Battle Tanks (MBTs) and frigates with low-cost autonomous strike assets. We must reduce our long-term defence costs by replacing manned sorties and risking fewer lives.
The PNDA must position Pakistan as the Islamic world’s leader in drone warfare capabilities. To this end, Pakistan must pursue targeted drone exports to key partners, including Sudan and Nigeria in Africa, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Qatar in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), and Malaysia and Indonesia in Southeast Asia.
On July 1, 2022, Ukraine became the first country to openly declare the creation of a ‘drone army’ -- mobilising civilian production and military coordination. In 2023, two Ukrainian drones targeted the Kremlin dome, the heart of Russian political power. In 2024, Ukrainian drones brought down a Russian A-50 strategic airborne aircraft. In 2025, Ukrainian drones destroyed 41 Russian strategic bombers, including models like the Tu-95 and Tu-22M.
Iran has established a semi-autonomous drone force under the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). China’s drone programme is among the most advanced globally, with a highly structured national force integrated into the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The Turkish Armed Forces have integrated UAV units into their air and ground operations, with dedicated command structures for drone warfare. Israel, a pioneer in drone technology, maintains a highly advanced and structured UAV force integrated into its multi-layered defence strategy.
Drones are revolutionising modern warfare tactics. Drones are shaping the future of military operations. The PNDA will redefine Pakistan’s national security. It will be a transformative shift -- autonomous precision warfare and budget-efficient force projection. Partnering with Turkey, China, and local institutions, and establishing a Drone Warfare School, the PNDA will bolster strategic alliances and cement Pakistan’s role as a regional drone power.

IHC to hear Farhatullah Babar’s plea today,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320385-ihc-to-hear-farhatullah-babar-s-plea-today,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday fixed for urgent hearing a petition filed by ex-senator Farhatullah Babar against alleged harassment by the FIA.
The petition was filed under Article 199 of the Constitution by advocates Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha against the ministry of interior, the FIA and others as respondents, seeking court intervention against “the unlawful, illegal, arbitrary and mala fide conduct in continuously harassing the petitioner through repeated issuance of ambiguous and illegal notices and summons, in what is an illegal fishing expedition/roving enquiry by the FIA in violation of laws and principles of natural justice”. The petition said the FIA enquiry was initiated on March 25 on the complaint of a citizen living in Morgah Rawalpindi, alleging “suspected corruption, tax evasion and illicit asset accumulation”. The petitioner appeared before the FIA on March 28 a day before Eid holidays. No copy of the complaint was provided to him. Referring to his legislative initiatives attempting to bring intelligence agencies under the ambit of the law, the petitioner said as a result of his principled public participation, he faced threats, intimidation and harassment. It is also documented in a United Nations Special Rapporteur communication in March 2023 addressed to the government of Pakistan, calling for investigations into the alleged existence of a “Kill List” pertaining to death threats to several individuals including Farhatullah Babar.
The petition prayed to the court to set aside FIA notices, declaring them illegal and quash the enquiry and direct the respondents not to harass the petitioner. It also prayed that the FIA be directed to provide a list of allegations on the basis of which the enquiry has been initiated. The petition is set to be heard today (Thursday) by Justice Inam Amin Minhas.

Malir jailbreak exposes systemic flaws,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320386-malir-jailbreak-exposes-systemic-flaws,"KARACHI: A recent jailbreak at District Jail Malir on June 3, 2025, has revealed alarming deficiencies in security measures, raising serious concerns about the negligence of the Sindh Prison and the Sindh Home Department.
Despite the facility’s official upgrade designation from the ‘Borstal Institute Landhi’ as a ‘Juvenile Correctional Centre’ dating back to 1993, no significant upgrades or improvements have been made in the past three decades, leaving the jail vulnerable to such incidents. Official record indicates that the security infrastructure at Malir Jail is critically lacking. There is no wireless communication system in place to facilitate direct connections between the jail administration, the Jail Superintendent and local district police in case of any emergency, besides there was no CCTV cameras installed in the prison.
Moreover, the absence of emergency sirens means that the jail remains unprotected against sudden threats. Over 30 years, the facility has failed to receive vital equipment such as walkie-talkies or enhancements to its physical structure, including much-needed upgrades to the height of prison walls, which does not align with the increasing juvenile inmate population. Additionally, there are no barbed wires atop the walls, nor have jammers been installed to prevent escapes. The failure to procure heavy-duty iron doors for secure confinement presents a continuous risk of jailbreaks. The lack of emergency alert systems, robust physical barriers, and proper locking mechanisms has made it alarmingly easy for inmates to exploit the outdated and ineffective facilities.
Sources at the Sindh Prison Department added that the recent jailbreak was particularly dramatic. Malir Jail, which can hold only 2,200 inmates, was housing over 6,000 at the time of the incident. Prison Department records indicate that of the sanctioned staff of 250, at least 150 should have been present at the jail, yet only 22 staff members were on duty at the time of incident. The incident was triggered by an earthquake that struck at 11:56 AM, leading to the breach of Barrack Number 3A. Following this, prisoners overwhelmed security and escaped through the main gate without facing significant resistance.
Although a guard stationed at the jail’s main office attempted to resist, the rest of the staff chose to prioritize their safety over confronting the escaping inmates. The Frontier Corps (FC) personnel stationed outside the jail responded with force, firing over 700 rounds.
Disturbingly, the Malir Jail administration failed to inform any law enforcement agencies, including the district police and Rangers, nor did they contact emergency number 15. The Malir Police  initiated operation soon afterwards when the SHO observed some unusual situation around the jail and alerted the police. Rangers subsequently joined the scene. According to prison records, 225 inmates escaped in the chaos, with 149 recaptured out of them 82 apprehended by Malir Police from district areas of city and 76 still at large.
The scribe tried to contact the Home Department for their version but they remained unresponsive. However, Abdul Rasheed Channa spokesman of the Sindh Chief minister told The News that the Sindh government has taken this incident of the jail break seriously. An investigation into the matter is ongoing at a high level. A review of the security situation in all jails in the province, including Malir Jail, will be conducted, and a comprehensive plan will be formulated, and special measures will be taken on emergency basis to prevent such incidents in the future.
Mr. Channa added that strong action has been taken by changing in the Jail Laws to appoint any Police officer as IG Jail. Former IGP Jail, DIG Karachi Jail and Jail Superintendent of the Malir Jail have been suspended in connection if the same incident.

PPP rejects 18% tax on solar panels,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320387-ppp-rejects-18pc-tax-on-solar-panels,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians spokesperson Shazia Marri has criticised the imposition of 18 per cent tax on solar panels and called it a regressive move that would further burden the already-struggling public.
She said solar energy has become the only viable alternative for citizens grappling with high electricity costs, but even that option is now being taken away.“We reject 18% tax on solar panels. It was the only way for the public to escape expensive electricity, and now that too is being made unaffordable,” she said in a statement, reacting to the federal budget 2025-26. She also dismissed proposed increases in salaries and pensions as insufficient, saying that they failed to match the ongoing rise in the cost of living. She particularly criticised the meager allocation for the Hyderabad-Karachi Motorway, noting that only Rs15 billion were earmarked for a project estimated to cost Rs400 billion. “It is nothing less than a joke,” she remarked.
Highlighting the impact of rising prices and unemployment, she said inflation and unemployment have made life extremely difficult for ordinary Pakistanis, and the new budget has offered no meaningful relief. She warned that additional taxes on petroleum products would likely lead to even higher inflation, pushing more essential items beyond the reach of the common man.

New taxes on digital transactions spark backlash,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320395-new-taxes-on-digital-transactions-spark-backlash,"ISLAMABAD: With the unveiling of new taxes on digital transactions and e-commerce in the budget, the government has moved towards protecting domestic retailers but compromising its vision to incentivise the cashless economy.
Aamir Ibrahim, Chairman Telecom Operators Association of Pakistan, voiced both hope and concern in a tweet, warning that the measures could slow down Pakistan’s journey toward a cashless economy.
On the other hand, the telecom and IT industry leaders expressed concerns that the PM Office was preparing vision for cashless economy but the budget made them disappointed.
They pointed out that many major retailers still refuse to accept digital payments in order to hide real income and evade taxes, indicating that enforcement against such practices remains insufficient. This gap, they argued, allows tax evasion to persist and undermines efforts to bring more transactions into the formal, documented economy.
The Pakistan Software Houses Association (P@SHA) also expressed disappointment, warning that neglecting key demands from the IT sector and introducing inconsistent tax policies could stall export growth, threaten jobs, and send a negative signal to global investors about Pakistan’s digital ambitions.
Similarly, the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) also criticised the government for missing a crucial opportunity to broaden the tax base and document the country’s vast Rs9 trillion cash-based informal economy.
In a statement, the OICCI noted that while measures like the nationwide rollout of e-invoicing and expansion of POS systems are positive steps, the absence of a concrete strategy to address the informal sector and rationalise tax structures undermines efforts to create a more investment-friendly environment and advance economic formalisation.
“The budget aims to formalise online trade through digital integration and tax measures, which is a plus,” said Aamir. “However, complexity in tax collection, the 5pc levy on digital transactions with foreign vendors, and additional taxes charged by payment intermediaries risk increasing costs and discouraging digital adoption. Making digital payments more prevalent, easier, and affordable is essential for Pakistan’s growth and for documenting the economy. Let’s ensure policies support a truly digital Pakistan, driving transparency and compliance without undue burdens.”
The new finance bill introduces taxes on both local and foreign e-commerce marketplaces, making online shopping costlier for Pakistani consumers. Notably, a 5pc tax will be imposed on goods purchased from foreign online marketplaces such as AliExpress and Amazon, collected by banks and payment gateways at the point of transaction.
Meanwhile, local digital payments will face a tiered tax structure, ranging from 1pc to 2pc depending on the transaction amount, and courier companies will collect taxes on cash-on-delivery payments.
Banks and courier services have been designated as withholding agents, required to collect and remit these taxes, and file detailed statements on all digital transactions. Online marketplaces must also ensure that all vendors are registered for sales tax, tightening compliance across the sector.
Aamir acknowledged the government’s intent to bring more online activity into the formal economy but cautioned that the added complexity and cost could push some businesses and consumers back toward cash and informal channels. “We need to strike a balance between expanding the tax net and fostering digital inclusion. If digital transactions become more expensive or cumbersome, we risk undermining the very progress we’ve made in financial inclusion and digital transformation.”

"Rabbani rejects ‘IMF-sponsored’ budget, terms finance minister ‘mere reader’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320396-rabbani-rejects-imf-sponsored-budget-terms-finance-minister-mere-reader,"ISLAMABAD: Former Chairman Senate Mian Raza Rabbani rejected the Federal Budget, stating that the “IMF-sponsored” budget had been announced by the finance minister, who was merely a “reader” of the document. “In terms of relief for the common man, the budget provides only lip service and peanuts in terms of practical relief,” he said in a statement on Wednesday while rejecting the federal budget for the next fiscal year, 2025-26.
Raza Rabbani pointed out 13 shortcomings the budget suffers from, among other shortcomings. First, Raza Rabbani said that this budget has been passed on the basis of the last NFC, which was announced in 2010. Second, he said that no minimum wage has been fixed, and it remains static at Rs. 37,000; the minimum wage should be at least Rs. 50,000 per month. Third, he said that the income tax relief given to the salaried class amounts to naught. Fourth, he said that the 10% pay increase given to government servants is insufficient, particularly when in the recent past the ruling elite has increased their own salaries manifold. Fifth, Rabbani pointed out that the 7% increase in pensions, keeping in mind the rising cost of living, is insufficient. Sixth, he stated that at the behest of the IMF, the car manufacturing industry has been unduly brought under a heavy tax regime. Seventh, Raza Rabbani pointed out that relief has been provided to the compardo capitalists in terms of construction and real estate. Eighth, he said that no provision has been made to improve unemployment. The former chairman said that the common man will be hit with the new tax on online shopping. He said that the health allocation has been cut by 16%.
He pointed out that there is no noticeable increase in education. He said that a 10% power bill surcharge is to be added and pointed out that the government looks to collect Rs 1.468 trillion in the next year through the petroleum levy.

SC moved against BHC verdict on arrest of Dr Mahrang Baloch,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320398-sc-moved-against-bhc-verdict-on-arrest-of-dr-mahrang-baloch,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court was requested on Wednesday to suspend the operation of the judgement delivered by the Balochistan High Court (BHC), which dismissed the plea of human rights activist Dr Mahrang Baloch against her arrest order under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) by the Quetta deputy commissioner.
Ms Nadia, sister of Dr Mahrang Baloch, filed an appeal in the Supreme Court under Article 185(3) of the Constitution, challenging the BHC judgement of April 15, in the petition contesting the detention order issued by the deputy commissioner on March 22, under the MPO. She pleaded with the apex court to suspend the operation of the BHC judgement.
She argued that the Division Bench erred in its judgement by failing to ensure the production of all relevant material on which the MPO order was based, which would have allowed the court to assess the reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the detention order.

"PTI calls govt anti-farmer, sees nothing for farm sector in budget",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320399-pti-calls-govt-anti-farmer-sees-nothing-for-farm-sector-in-budget,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf spokesman Sheikh Waqas Akram Wednesday said the agriculture sector had been totally ignored in the budget and noting has been envisaged in it for the farmer community.
During news conference here, he claimed that nothing had been earmarked in the budget for the farmer community, already on the receiving end while all the agriculture exports had decreased significantly. And, he regretted that the farmer, who was already faced with difficulties, had been charged with GST on solar.
“Every sector of agriculture is being destroyed one by one; all our agricultural exports have decreased significantly. There is nothing for farmers in this budget who are already devastated, cotton production has decreased by 31 per cent and wheat production by 13pc,” he lamented.
The PTI spokesman said that the government is anti-farmer, as its policies are against farmers, whose share in the labour force is 37pc while farmers voted for PTI in the February 8 elections.
Waqas Akram also raised the question of where the foreign exchange will come from to meet the shortage of food grains; farmers have suffered a loss of Rs2200 billion. He contended that this attitude towards farmers is, in fact, enmity not only with them but with Pakistan.
The PTI spokesman said that cotton production has come down from 30 million to 10 million bales, farmers’ children are starving, who will compensate farmers’ losses?
He wondered that have the prices of tractors and tube-wells decreased or increased; the farmer, who is getting a tractor at three times the price, has also been imposed a solar duty as well.
Separately, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said Pakistan’s budget is a robbery on the hard-earned money of the poor.
Talking to the media outside the Islamabad High Court, he complained that they were not given any budget document; the whole process was illegal and that the government employees were protesting in Islamabad on the day of presentation of the budget.
He pointed out that while the budget of the Prime Minister’s House increased by 17pc, the salaries of government employees were increased by just 10pc.
Omar Ayub noted that the trials, which were to be held in Adiala Jail and the Islamabad High Court, were cancelled and a case was scheduled for June 5, but then the hearing was rescheduled for June 11.
Omar Ayub questioned, “If judges are not allowed to hear us, what constitution and what rule of law remains?” He said the manner in which things are being conducted is unbecoming of a republic. “No high-handed actions can diminish the stature of the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi,” he added.
He said that Bushra Bibi is being provided with dirty water and bad food in the summer and that she is not being allowed to meet her relatives and friends, whereas the political leadership is not allowed to meet the party founder.

Climate change mitigation gets Rs2.78bn out of PSDP outlay,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320400-climate-change-mitigation-gets-rs2-78bn-out-of-psdp-outlay,"ISLAMABAD: Despite recurring climate-related disasters, the federal government has allocated just 0.22 percent of its total Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) outlay—Rs2.78 billion out of Rs1,287 billion—for the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination in fiscal year 2025–26, reflecting a Rs640 million cut compared to the revised allocation of Rs3.42 billion in the outgoing year.
According to official budget documents, the proposed climate development budget includes Rs2.73 billion in domestic funding and Rs50 million in foreign aid.
The reduced allocation comes at a time when Pakistan is experiencing more frequent urban flooding, extreme heatwaves, glacial lake outbursts, and rising pollution—phenomena that demand increased investment in climate resilience and preparedness.
The largest share of the funding, Rs2.25 billion, has been earmarked for the Green Pakistan Programme (Phase-I), down significantly from Rs3.29 billion in the outgoing year. This project, part of a broader afforestation and ecosystem restoration drive, remains a flagship initiative despite budgetary downsizing.
Another Rs325.26 million has been allocated for strengthening the technical capacity of the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, reflecting an emphasis on improving climate governance, planning, and institutional efficiency.
Other allocations include Rs83.39 million for the Pakistan Biosafety Clearing House for GMOs Regulation (Pak-BCH), and Rs25 million for capacity building on water quality monitoring and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.6.1 reporting.
Two new initiatives have also been introduced: Rs50 million for Green Skills and Green Entrepreneurship, and another Rs50 million for the formulation of a National Urban Strategy to address urban flooding, droughts, and climate-induced risks.
Notably, the Climate Resilient Urban Human Settlement Unit, which received Rs21.4 million in the current year, has not been allocated any funds for 2025–26. The omission raises concerns about the continuity of sustainable urban development programmes, especially in cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar, which are increasingly vulnerable to climate shocks.
With the total PSDP spending for 2025–26 set at Rs1,287 billion, the climate change portfolio remains underfunded relative to its critical importance.
Experts warn that reduced domestic climate investment could also undermine Pakistan’s ability to access international climate finance through mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environment Facility.
Pakistan is globally recognised as one of the top 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change. Yet, the budget reduction signals a disconnect between policy declarations and fiscal priorities. Environmental advocates stress that climate adaptation is not a long-term concern but a present and urgent necessity.
As climate events continue to intensify—particularly across Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa—the effectiveness of this limited budget will depend on how efficiently it is implemented, and whether the federal and provincial governments can coordinate efforts to protect lives, infrastructure, and ecosystems.

‘No proposal in budget for poverty alleviation’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320401-no-proposal-in-budget-for-poverty-alleviation,"ISLAMABAD: Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Defence Production, Senator Abdul Qadar has slammed the government for budgetary proposals alleging that no significant relief was proposed for the common man and poor segment of the society.
In a statement, the senator said that 44.7 percent population was living below the poverty level and as such poverty-alleviation should have been government’s top priority. “The government should follow China’s formula to achieve results for poverty elimination”, he said.
Saying that the budgetary proposals give no formula to control poverty, Abdul Qadar observed that finding solution to problems of the common and poor man was never priority of the government.
He demanded that the government should fix Rs50,000 as minimum monthly wages while big landlords be taxed while giving exemptions to small farmer particularly possessing agriculture land upto two acres.
He said the government should also focus on promotion of the agriculture sector, saying that provision of quality seed, fertilizers and pesticides was key to achieving desired results from cultivation of valuable crops.
Moreover, the senator alleged that the government also failed to achieve tax collection target of Rs14200 billion due to FBR’s poor performance. “This is a fact that the FBR never achieves targets of revenue collections”, he said.

CTD arrests ‘two militants linked to banned outfit’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320334-ctd-arrests-two-militants-linked-to-banned-outfit,"Hyderabad: The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) Hyderabad has claimed to have arrested two suspected militants associated with banned separatist organisation Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz/SLA, allegedly involved in multiple sabotage and terrorism-related incidents across Sindh and Punjab.
According to a CTD spokesperson, the arrests were made during an intelligence-based operation in Latifabad Unit No. 7 on the evening of June 10. The suspects were identified as Irfan Ahmed, son of Riaz Hussain, and Abdul Razaq, alias Jan Pathan alias Doctor.
The spokesperson said the suspects were wanted in a terrorism case registered on April 16, 2025, under the Explosives Act and Anti-Terrorism Act at the CTD Police Station Hyderabad. The two are accused of planting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in areas near the borders of Hyderabad and Matiari districts.
The CTD also linked the suspects to previous attacks on railway infrastructure and government vehicles in Punjab, which resulted in damage to public property and disruption of services. During interrogation, both men confessed to their involvement in over 30 subversive activities, including the placement of explosive materials on railway tracks.
The CTD said the terrorists admitted that their actions were carried out under the directives of the banned outfit’s leadership, aiming to create chaos and fear. The CTD revealed that the suspects were part of a broader network and participated in coordinated attacks along with militants from the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army (SRA) on the nights of April 16 and 17, 2025. One such operation targeted railway infrastructure near the 4th Padhiyun railway station.
Following their arrest, a new FIR has been registered under Section 11-EE of the Anti-Terrorism Act for being active members of a proscribed organisation and for inciting others to engage in terrorism.
CTD officials stated that Abdul Razaq alias Doctor later became disillusioned with the group and voluntarily distanced himself. He has also recorded a video message urging other militants to lay down arms and reintegrate into society.
Further investigations are underway, and the CTD says more arrests may follow based on the information gathered from the detained suspects.
On the other hand, Advocate Inderjeet Lohana claimed that Faraz Chandio and Abdul Rehman Chandio, who were allegedly abducted from Qasimabad, Hyderabad, about a month ago and had petitions filed for their recovery in the Sindh High Court Hyderabad Bench, have now been formally shown as arrested by the CTD.
The CTD has registered an FIR against both under anti-terrorism charges and presented them before the Anti-Terrorism Court No. 1 in Hyderabad and the court has sent both individuals to the Central Jail on judicial remand.

JI rejects proposed budgetary allocations for Karachi,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320335-ji-rejects-proposed-budgetary-allocations-for-karachi,"Karachi Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) Emir Munem Zafar Khan has said the proposed federal budget for 2025-26 shows that Karachi, which is the economic powerhouse of the country, has been ignored in the priorities list of the ruling lawmakers.
To react to the federal budget that was presented in the National Assembly on Tuesday, the JI leader held a press conference at the Idara Noor-e-Haq on Wednesday. He stated that the federal budget was a jigsaw puzzle of statistics and core issues had been neglected in that.
He demanded that Rs500 million be allocated for the development of Karachi. He pointed out that an information technology park initiated in 2022 was supposed to be completed in 2026 but only Rs6 billion were allocated in the budget for that IT Park, which was nothing but peanuts and showed that the federal government was not interested in the completion of the project.
Further criticising the approach of the federal government, he said the budget for the higher education was reduced from Rs65 billion to Rs39.5 billion. Talking about the energy sector, he said the government slapped the solar energy sector with 18 per cent taxation in a serious blow to the newly developing sector.
Khan said the federal government had neglected the needs of Karachi. He highlighted the case of the incomplete Green Line and other projects. Karachi had always been deprived of its due share in resources and rights despite the fact that it provided lifeline and contributed significantly to the national exchequer, the JI leader said. He recalled that in 2007-08, before the passage of the 18th Amendment, the federal government used to grant Rs178 billion to Sindh, but now that grant had increased to Rs1, 853 billion rupees. Against this backdrop, he said, the Sindh government needed to devolve administrative and monetary powers.
He expressed concern over the government neglecting proposals by traders and taxpayer, and following dictation by the International Monetary Fund.  The JI leader said the K-IV water supply was the most important project for the city’s future but it seemed that the federal government had shelved it. He said Rs40 billion had been demanded for the project but only Rs3.2bn was allocated for it despite the fact that it was supposed to be completed by June 2026 before the next budget.
He said a total of Rs133 billion was allocated for the water resources division, but the allocation for the K-IV project was Rs3.2bn — almost 2.5 per cent of the division’s budget. It simply showed that those in the corridors of powers did not want to grant more than Zakat or alums to Karachi and its residents, he ramarked. Criticising the Sindh government, he said the Pakistan Peoples Party had practically handed over the mega projects of Karachi to contractors.

Pakistan yet to take concrete steps to bring indigenous people into biodiversity plans,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320336-pakistan-yet-to-take-concrete-steps-to-bring-indigenous-people-into-biodiversity-plans,"The UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) Conference of Parties (COP16), held in November 2024, concluded with a landmark decision to establish a permanent subsidiary body dedicated to Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities (IPLCs). However, Pakistan seems unlikely to benefit from this historic move as it neither represents itself effectively at global biodiversity forums nor adequately recognises or protects IPLCs at home.
At the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, 150 countries, including Pakistan, had signed the CBD, which aims to conserve biodiversity and ensure the equitable use of living resources. Among its 42 articles, the Article 8(j) is significant: it calls on countries to respect and safeguard the traditional knowledge of IPLCs, especially when such knowledge aids in conservation and sustainable resource use. Where this knowledge is used, the community’s consent is required, along with fair benefit-sharing.
To support the Article 8(j), it was proposed that the CBD create a subsidiary body to provide guidance and develop a working programme. This was adopted at the COP5 in 2000 and has since served as the primary mechanism for implementing the Article 8(j). It helps countries respect, preserve, and maintain IPLC knowledge, innovations and practices.
The Article 8(j) working group issues voluntary guidelines to help countries incorporate traditional knowledge respectfully. Additionally, the International Indigenous Forum on Biodiversity (IIFB), a caucus recognised by the CBD, plays a key role in representing IPLC voices in negotiations and decisions.
At the COP16 that took place last year in Cali, Colombia, 196 parties adopted the establishment of a permanent Subsidiary Body on Article 8(j). After years of advocacy, this move gives the IPLCs a formal platform in the CBD — making it the only UN environmental convention with such representation. Previously, delegates of indigenous people had to seek out national representatives informally, often waiting outside meeting rooms to be heard on issues directly affecting them.
This new body is expected to be co-chaired by government and IPLC representatives. Its operational model will be finalised and adopted at the COP17 in Armenia in 2026. Despite this progress at the international level, the IPLCs in Pakistan continue to be overlooked. The constitution does not explicitly recognise indigenous people, instead grouping them with ethnic, linguistic and religious minorities.
According to Dr Kashif Imran Zaidi, director of the School of Law and Policy at the University of Management and Technology, this broad classification erases indigenous identity. In his paper ‘Indigenous Peoples in Pakistan: In Consideration of the Right to Cultural Property and Identity’, he notes the absence of legal recognition for indigenous communities in Pakistan.
Nonetheless, Pakistan is a signatory to many international human rights instruments relevant to the IPLCs. Zaidi outlines these in his research, including the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). While the UNDRIP is not legally binding, it reflects global consensus on the rights of indigenous peoples — such as self-determination and protection from discrimination — and reinforces standards found in binding treaties. Some of these principles are also part of customary international law: widely accepted norms followed even in the absence of formal treaties.
Pakistan has also signed the Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989 (ILO Convention No. 169), which differentiates between indigenous and tribal people. Furthermore, the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) also addresses Indigenous intellectual property issues, such as traditional cultural expressions and genetic resources.
In terms of biodiversity-specific commitments, Pakistan has signed two key CBD protocols: The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (2000), which governs the safe handling, transport, and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) from biotechnology to minimise harm to biodiversity and human health.
The Nagoya Protocol (2014), which ensures fair and equitable sharing of benefits from the use of genetic resources — including plants, animals and microbes — with the countries or communities providing them.
Additionally, Pakistan is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which regulates global trade in endangered species to prevent overexploitation.
Despite these global commitments, implementation at home remains weak. Without recognising indigenous people in the domestic law or establishing mechanisms for benefit-sharing and cultural protection, Pakistan risks failure to meet its obligations under international frameworks. As global platforms such as the CBD increasingly elevate IPLC voices, countries like Pakistan must bridge the gap between international commitments and local realities. Recognising the IPLCs formally, legally and administratively is the first step toward enabling their meaningful participation in biodiversity governance.

Water tanker kills two citizens in North Nazimabad,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320337-water-tanker-kills-two-citizens-in-north-nazimabad,"The lives of two young men were cut short in a road crash near the Board Office in North Nazimabad late on Tuesday night.
The tragic incident occurred near Abdullah College, where a water tanker hit a motorcycle, killing two friends instantly. Eyewitnesses reported that the tanker was being driven recklessly at the time of the crash.
Police and rescue teams arrived at the scene and transported the bodies to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. The victims were identified as 20-year-old Zubair and 18-year-old Ayaan, both originally from Data Nagar, Orangi Town. Ayaan had recently moved to Altaf Nagar but remained a close childhood friend of Zubair.
According to grieving family members, the two friends had gone to Hussainabad for ice cream and were on their way home when the out-of-control tanker struck their motorcycle. Both died on the spot due to the severity of the impact.
The police have registered a case and initiated an investigation into the incident. Residents of the area have voiced concern over the unchecked movement of water tankers in residential neighbourhoods, calling for strict regulations and enforcement to prevent further tragedies.
Separately, a police constable was killed in a road tragedy in the Saeedabad area. Police Constable Asif was killed when a speeding unknown vehicle struck his motorcycle near the Baldia Training Centre. Police said that the cop had been dispatched to inspect a checkpoint when the accident occurred. The body was later sent to his hometown in Dadu for burial. A case has been registered while an investigation is underway.

Court confirms bail of actor Nadia Hussain in fraud case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320338-court-confirms-bail-of-actor-nadia-hussain-in-fraud-case,"A sessions court on Wednesday confirmed interim pre-arrest bail granted to actor and model Nadia Hussain in a multi-million embezzlement case.
Her husband Atif Mohammad Khan, former chief executive officer of Bank Alfalah Securities, and others have been booked by the Federal Investigation Agency for alleged large-scale corporate financial fraud, criminal misconduct, and misappropriation of company funds during his tenure from July 2015 to December 2023.
However, the court dismissed the bail application of former chief financial officers of the company, Faisal Mahmood Sheikh and Imtiaz Ahmed Channa, and revoked the interim bail granted to them earlier.
Additional Sessions Judge (South) Ihsan Ali Malik announced his order reserved on the bail pleas of the model and two others after hearing arguments from both sides. Recording the reason for accepting the model's bail plea, the judge observed that the entire thrust of the allegations appeared to be centered on the conduct of her husband Atif and others working in the company. The evidence available so far did not show her role in the management, control, or manipulation of the company's affairs, he said. There is no document to show her authorisation consent, or participation in the alleged fraudulent transactions, he added.
The judge noted that mere association by virtue of marriage or receipt of funds into her account without a clear nexus demonstrating her active participation in the commission of the alleged offences would not be sufficient to deny bail at this stage, particularly when no direct evidence had yet surfaced suggesting that she was complicit in the alleged fraudulent transactions, or had knowledge of the criminal intent behind the transfer of such funds.
He said that Ms Hussain had already joined the investigation and recorded her statement, adding that there was no allegation of non-cooperation with the investigating agency.
About two other suspects, the judge said they failed to make out a case for pre-arrest interim bail and dismissed their bail applications. Following the pronouncement of the order, they managed to flee the courtroom to evade their arrest.
Hussain's lawyer Muhammad Farooq contended that his client, the wife of suspect Atif Muhammad Khan, was innocent and falsely implicated in the present case with malafide intention and ulterior motives for the sole purpose of harassment, criminal intimidation and maltreatment. She was issued a call-up notice, which appeared to ostensibly coerce her husband into confessing to an alleged offence which he had not committed.
According to the FIR, the FIA Corporate Crime Circle Karachi initiated an inquiry on the complaint of Aasim Wajid Jawad, the chairman of Board of Directors of Al Falah Securities Pvt Ltd, against Atif and others on allegations of ""corporate financial fraud by way of criminal misconduct, criminal breach of trust, abuse of fiduciary authority, falsification of accounts and dishonest misappropriation and utilization of company funds for wrongful gains"".
It claimed that as per a report of the SECP Domain Expert, Additional Joint Director Adnan Ahmed, the former CEO engaged in his personal trading at the expense of the company's funds.
The FIA said that the analysis of Atif's trading ledger during his tenure as CEO from July 2015 to December 2023 and statement of his bank accounts revealed that he received Rs1.404 billion from the bank accounts of Al-Falah CLSA Securities Pvt Ltd and returned only Rs1.324 billion.
""Hence, he not only utilized these company's funds for financing personal trades but also routed the same systematically to conceal his debit balance by way of manipulating the company's ledger thereby falsifying company's account.
At each withdrawal date, his trading account was in negative balance, meaning he owed money to the company, yet he continued his spree of withdrawing company funds and embezzled Rs80 million (approx.) as per company accounts. While his debit balance stands at Rs539 million indicating that this amount is payable to the Company by Atif Mohammad Khan,"" it alleged.

Ustad Abu Bakr honoured for winning second prize in prestigious IRCICA Calligraphy Competition,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320339-ustad-abu-bakr-honoured-for-winning-second-prize-in-prestigious-ircica-calligraphy-competition,"Danish-o-Ramish, an organisation committed to promoting classical arts, spirituality and mental well-being, organised an event on Wednesday to pay tribute to a leading Pakistani calligrapher, Ustad Abu Bakr, and congratulate him on his winning the second prize in the Sulus Jali category in the 13th International Calligraphy Competition recently held by the Research Centre For Islamic History, Art and Culture (abbreviated as IRCICA).
The IRCICA is a cultural wing of the Organisation of Islamic Conference headquartered in Istanbul. Its calligraphy competition is one of the most prestigious global competitions celebrating Islamic calligraphy.
Ustad Abu Bakr sent his artwork in the Sulus Jali script to the IRCICA and was awarded the second prize in the script at an event in Turkiye.
Dr Noman Baig of the Habib University introduced the calligrapher at the event hosted by the Danish-o-Ramish. He said Ustad Abu Bakr has represented Pakistan in various international calligraphy competitions. He won the second prize in a competition held by the Islamic University of Madinah in 2014. Later, he was awarded a special prize in an IRCICA competition and another special prize at a competition hosted in Qatar.
Calligraphy was a spiritual art as it required spiritual cleansing to perfect it, Dr Baig remarked.  Later, Ustad Abu Bakr spoke about his journey in calligraphy. He said he started learning the art in 1989 on the wish of his father, who himself wanted to become a calligrapher but could not do so. He said he started learning the art from Ustad Anjum Mehmood in Faisalabad.
He said his teacher started to train him in the Naskh script, which is the script in which the Holy Quran is normally written. The teacher initially told him that it would take five years for him to learn the script. However, just after one year, Ustad Anjum was satisfied with his progress in Naskh and began to train him in the Nastaliq script.
Ustad Abu Bakr recalled that there was little technology available when he started to learn the art. He said people did not know about Muqahhar paper, which is a special paper for calligraphic art, and there was only one ink brand in just one colour.
He said people who had learnt the calligraphy at that time usually composed books or newspapers, etc. to earn their livelihoods, but when the computers arrived, the hand-composing was shifted to typing and many calligraphers switched their jobs. Ustad Abu Bakr said that even he was told to do something else as practising the art of calligraphy would lead him nowhere.
The calligrapher recalled opening an office to compose wedding invitation cards and soon shutting it down as he found that merely knowing how to write a script was not enough for the job and one needed to learn designing the card and making beautiful styles. He then worked with Ustad Anjum to learn designing.
Ustad Abu Bakr said after Ustad Anjum, Ustad Shafiq-Uz-Zaman Khan, who is the calligrapher of Masjid-e-Nabawi in the holy city of Madinah, was his second teacher in the calligraphic art. He learnt the Sulus script from him in Karachi where he lived for around three decades before shifting to Lahore in recent years.
Responding to questions of the audience, the calligrapher remarked that the art of calligraphy was surely not going to die as it was directly linked with the Holy Quran. He stated that new scripts were being created and some old styles were no longer practised.
To a question regarding various forms of the Nastaliq script, he said all the styles of Nastaliq being practised today were good and none of them should be disparaged. He lamented that the Lakhnavi Nastaliq, a style of Nastaliq developed in Lucknow, was a very beautiful script but it was now dead because there was no one who could carry that legacy forward.
Commenting on why some Pakistani calligraphers had started to denounce the Lahore or other Indo-Pakistani styles of Nastaliq in favour of the Iranian style, he said it was because the international competitions that were held in Turkiye and other countries only recognised the Iranian Nastaliq. He, however, added that we should not belittle our Nastaliq styles just because international competitions did not recognise them.

SHC dismisses bail plea of exporter in drug smuggling case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320340-shc-dismisses-bail-plea-of-exporter-in-drug-smuggling-case,"The Sindh High Court dismissed the bail application of an exporter in a drug smuggling case and directed the trial court to conclude the trial proceedings within two months.
Applicant Shahid Khan was arrested by the Anti-Narcotics Force for allegedly smuggling 145 kilograms of Ketamine to Hong Kong and the drug was concealed in a shipment of fabric rolls.
The applicant’s counsel submitted that witnesses have not implicated the applicant during deposition before the trial court while the co-accused who was granted the same role has been granted bail by the trial court in the case.
The ANF special prosecutor opposed the bail application and submitted that all the prosecution witnesses had been examined and prima facie they had implicated the applicant in the case except one witness whose evidence was to be recorded by the trial court. He requested the court to dismiss the bail application with a direction to the trial court to decide the bail application within the shortest possible time.
A single high court bench headed by Justice Mohammad Iqbal Kalhoro, after hearing the arguments of the counsel, observed that the reference of the applicant’s counsel with regard to insufficient evidence is hardly relevant as it is settled that for deciding a bail application only tentative assessment of the material is to be made.
The court observed that if he revelation of the witness’ cross examination and its impact are taken into account to decide the bail application it will amount to deeper appreciation of the evidence and forming a final opinion after which nothing will be left for the trial court to decide in the final judgment. The high court further stated that the bail application of the co-accused has been dismissed with the direction to the trial court to decide the case within two months.

Stagnant sewage on Jinnah Avenue disrupting traffic flow,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320341-stagnant-sewage-on-jinnah-avenue-disrupting-traffic-flow,"Sewage water has been accumulating continuously on Jinnah Avenue, near the Security Printing Press, causing major difficulties for the general public. This critical route has also seen severe disruption to ambulance and VIP movement due to the stagnant sewage.
This road is one of the city’s main arteries, used daily by emergency services. Any obstruction here poses a serious threat to human lives. Despite repeated public complaints, no effective action has been taken so far.
In view of this situation, a strong appeal is made to the managing director (MD) of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation, the executive engineer, and all other concerned officials to immediately take notice and ensure the drainage of sewage water from the road. Restoring smooth traffic flow and access for emergency services is essential. Urgent action is now imperative in the interest of public welfare and safety.

HEC postpones interviews for DG post,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320342-hec-postpones-interviews-for-dg-post,"The Higher Education Commission has postponed the interviews for the posts of DG after Federal Education Minister Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui expressed his displeasure.
Despite the clear instructions of the federal government and ongoing legal challenges, the process of recruitment to fill senior positions in the Higher Education Commission (HEC) is still ongoing, which has raised serious questions about regulatory compliance and transparency, while an acting director general and eight directors of the HEC have filed petitions in the Islamabad High Court, challenging the current selection process.
Interestingly, the Establishment Division had issued a clear office memorandum on June 4, 2024, directing all federal ministries, divisions, departments, and autonomous bodies, including the HEC, to complete the recruitment process within 120 days of the publication of the recruitment advertisement.
The directive stated: “The extension of the period of 120 days for recruitment to BPS-20 and above or equivalent posts will be possible only with the approval of the Prime Minister.” In the case of the HEC, the last date for the submission of applications for these posts was fixed as July 29, 2024. However, after the lapse of almost 11 months, the recruitment process was started without any approval from the Prime Minister’s Office. Later, when the news was published in Daily Jang and The News, the education minister and some members of the Selection Board took strict notice of it, after which the interviews for the posts of DG were postponed.
It should be remembered that the recruitment activities in the HEC are intensifying at a time when the tenure of the current HEC chairman is about to end on July 30, 2025. Moreover, the appointment of the executive director, the head of the HEC Secretariat, has not yet been made, and this post is being run on an acting basis. Although this vacancy has also been advertised, the appointment has not been made yet.
It may be recalled that Daily Jang and The News had reported on June 10 that out of the 13 vacancies advertised for the appointment of director general, no seat has been reserved for Karachi and Hyderabad, which are important centers of higher education in the country, and the recruitment process is being started after 11 months.

"PTI demands release of Imran, Bushra in protest outside City Courts",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320343-pti-demands-release-of-imran-bushra-in-protest-outside-city-courts,"The Sindh Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Wednesday staged a protest demonstration outside the City Courts calling for immediate release of PTI founder and patron-in-chief Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi.
A large number of PTI leaders, lawyers and party workers and supporters, including women, participated in the demonstration. Many protesters carried banners and chanted slogans in support of the detained leaders of the PTI, demanding immediate release of Khan and others.
Addressing the participants, Sindh PTI President Haleem Adil Sheikh said the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law had been dismantled in the country. He lamented that a government formed through the Form 47 was imposed through the rigged elections.
The PTI founder and his wife had been incarcerated in false cases, and denied justice, he said, adding that the presiding officer of a court went on leave when it was time to deliver the justice. He alleged that a conspiracy had been hatched to deny Khan and his wife justice and due process of the law.
Sheikh said that after the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the judiciary had been weakened, and the future of young lawyers was at risk. He said the PTI founder was fighting for the real freedom of our children’s future. Khan could have walked free through a deal, but he chose imprisonment for the sake of the nation, Sheikh remarked.
He said the country could not move forward without the PTI founder’s release and the movement for his release would continue. Commenting on the economic conditions, he said there was a complete chaos across the country, and the poor had been deprived of even two meals a day. He declared the federal budget to be anti-people.
Sindh PTI General Secretary Dr Masroor Siyal said the protest was also for the independence of the judiciary. Karachi PTI President Raja Azhar emphasised that the PTI’s struggle was for Khan’s release and the supremacy of the Constitution and law.  He said the party had a constitutional right to conduct a peaceful protest, but police were trying to portray them as terrorists.
He also criticised the Punjab chief minister for keeping an elderly woman leader of the PTI, Yasmeen Rashid, in prison. Other leaders of the PTI also addressed the protest.

"Clean up Karachi’s garbage, Azma tells Sharjeel",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320277-clean-up-karachi-s-garbage-azma-tells-sharjeel,"LAHORE:Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari, issued a strong response to recent remarks made by Sindh Minister Sharjeel Memon, stating that Maryam Nawaz has made history as the first-ever woman Chief Minister of Punjab—an achievement that is a matter of national pride.
Azma Bokhari emphasised, ‘Maryam Nawaz has adopted humility and public service as her core principles, which is exactly why she enjoys such widespread popularity. Her leadership and governance style have left an impact not just in Punjab but also among the people of Sindh.’
Azma Bokhari added, ‘Your real problem is that even Sindh’s people are now inspired by Maryam Nawaz’s vision.’
She continued, ‘Those who have enjoyed power for two or three terms but still failed to deliver anything meaningful are the ones filled with arrogance and pride. Their performance has been zero.’
‘Instead of wasting time on bitter statements, compete with Maryam Nawaz through actual results. If you claim to have built a great system in Sindh, then at the very least, start by cleaning up Karachi’s garbage,’ she said. Bokhari stressed that Punjab has its own leadership and custodians who will look after the province’s interests. ‘Those arrogant leaders sitting in Sindh should first have some mercy on their own people,’ she remarked. She further stated that the PMLN has previously established a strong local government system in Punjab and, God willing, will do so again.
In a final pointed comment, Azma Bokhari said, ‘Those political parties that managed to secure only 400 votes from provincial constituencies and barely 50 from union councils—well, their real test is yet to come.’
Azma Bokhari has announced that the provincial government will present a budget for the upcoming fiscal year on June 13. She promised that the budget would be progressive, people-friendly, and tax-free.

Islamabad celebrates a low-crime Eid,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320296-islamabad-celebrates-a-low-crime-eid,"Islamabad:An unbelievable news which never occurred in previous epoch. This report of a successful, low-crime Eid vacation period is a testament to the potential of well-executed security plans and offers valuable insights for future strategies. The success in preventing both residential and vehicle thefts demonstrates a significant achievement by the police authorities.
The planners espoused two-pronged policy, the anti-crime strategists said.  The record indicates a highly effective, two-pronged approach was implemented: The absence of theft incidents in homes while residents were away points to the success of proactive measures. This could include the intelligence-led deployment and community partnership strategies discussed previously. When neighbours are vigilant and police patrols are targeted based on intelligence, a powerful deterrent is created, preventing burglars from taking advantage of empty houses.
The strategy to curb vehicle theft by managing public parks and entertainment centres is particularly noteworthy. By designating these areas as ""family places"" and restricting the entry of ""single youths,"" the authorities effectively addressed a major hotspot for crime and public disorder.
The decision to make parks family-oriented was clearly impactful in preventing vehicle thefts and enhancing public safety. This approach works on several levels:  Large, unsupervised gatherings can sometimes provide cover for criminal activities, including the trade of stolen goods or the planning of thefts. A ""family-only"" environment changes the social dynamic of a space, making it unattractive and inhospitable to those with criminal intent.
The measure likely reduced incidents of public nuisance, harassment, and reckless behaviour (like dangerous motorcycle stunts), which often contribute to a general atmosphere of lawlessness that emboldens thieves.
When public spaces feel safe and orderly, they attract more families and responsible citizens, creating a ""natural surveillance"" effect where law-abiding individuals outnumber and discourage potential offenders.
While this strategy has proven highly effective, a forward-looking approach would be to build upon this success by refining the method to be both effective and inclusive. The commendable goal is to ensure public spaces are safe for everyone.
The long-term goal should be to regulate disruptive behaviour rather than entire groups. While the ban was a successful short-term tool, it could be supplemented with stricter, on-the-spot enforcement against specific offenses like reckless driving, harassment, or public intoxication, regardless of who commits them.

FAPUASA condemns freezing of HEC budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320298-fapuasa-condemns-freezing-of-hec-budget,"Islamabad:Prof Mazhar Iqbal (President), Prof Akhtiar Ali Ghumro (Vice President) and Prof Fareed Achakzai (General Secretary) of Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) has rejected the Federal Budget 2025-26.
In a joint statement, they expressed serious concerns over the continued freezing of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) recurring grant at Rs65 billion, an amount that remained unchanged since 2018. They also lamented ongoing neglect of Tenure Track System (TTS) faculty salaries, not revised since 2021.
The FAPUASA leadership highlighted that the stagnant allocation is highly insufficient to meet the rapidly increasing financial needs of the higher education sector. Since 2018, the number of universities and student enrollments increased significantly, while inflation, utility charges and operational expenditures continued to rise sharply. Despite these realities, the government failed to provide the additional funding required to sustain universities, placing severe financial strain on institutions across the country.
FAPUASA repeatedly demanded that the HEC budget be increased to at least Rs200 billion in order to maintain academic standards, promote quality education and support critical research activities essential for national progress. In addition, the teachers’ federation strongly criticised the government's persistently ignoring TTS faculty members, whose salaries remained frozen since 2021.
The FAPUASA leadership noted that while the government announced salary increases of up to 40% for government employees in the latest budget, universities were not provided with additional funds to meet these salary obligations thereby further escalating the financial crisis in the higher education sector.
FAPUASA strongly urged the government to reconsider and revise the Federal Budget 2025-26 and adequately address these critical issues in the Finance Bill. Failure to act will severely undermine Pakistan’s higher education system and negatively impact the country’s long-term socio-economic development, it concluded.

Severe heatwave triggers fire on Margalla Hills,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320301-severe-heatwave-triggers-fire-on-margalla-hills,"Islamabad: Amid severe heat wave, fire erupted at five different locations on Margalla Hills on Wednesday.

PIMA expresses concern over health budget cuts,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320302-pima-expresses-concern-over-health-budget-cuts,"Islamabad: Pakistan Islamic Medical Association (PIMA) has expressed deep concern over the 16 per cent slash in the federal health budget for 2025–26 as compared to the last year’s allocation, noting that it represents one of the lowest health budget allocations in the region. Pakistan spends less than 0.9 per cent of its GDP on health far below regional and global standards.
Central President of PIMA, Professor Atif Hafeez Siddiqui emphasized that this significant reduction comes at a time of growing health challenges and will directly impact hospitals and BHUs construction and equipment upgrades, medical education, disease surveillance systems and the training of medical professionals. While operational spending on salaries and administration has increased, long-term development of healthcare infrastructure and services is being overlooked.
He highlighted that Pakistan continues to face a dual burden of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and heart disease, alongside ongoing threats from infectious diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis, and HIV/AIDS. In this context, reducing development allocations compromises the country’s capacity to respond effectively and weakens overall health system resilience.
PIMA President urged the government to take urgent corrective steps in the light of the current health challenges.

Toru says federal budget to exacerbate inflation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320307-toru-says-federal-budget-to-exacerbate-inflation,"PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Minister for Food Zahir Shah Toru on Tuesday rejected the federal budget 2025-26, saying that it would further exacerbate inflation across the country.
Talking to the reporters here, the provincial minister lamented that a major chunk of the federal government’s budget would be consumed by debt servicing, which he termed a reflection of the federal government “serious economic mismanagement.”
The economic stability cannot be expected in a country where a Form-47-made government is imposed and there is no political stability,” he addedToru criticised the federal government’s allocation of approximately Rs1,000 billion for development projects, calling it a “significant decline” from the Rs1,500 billion development budget of the previous year. He termed it a “blow to the government’s own claims of economic revival.”
Calling the allocation of only Rs550 million for development in a terrorism-affected province like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa “shameful,” the minister said it was an insult to the sacrifices of the people of KP who laid down their lives for peace. “This is nothing short of an attempt to alienate them from the federation,” he added.
In contrast, Zahir Shah said that the KP government had set a target of repaying Rs150 billion in debt through this year’s annual budget, which, he described, as a “positive and responsible initiative” that indicates the province is avoiding further borrowing.
The KP food minister also criticised the federal government’s energy policies, particularly the imposition of an 18% tax on solar panels. “This is not only unjust towards the poor and middle-income people, but it also discourages alternative energy adoption,” he stated.
He warned that taxes on petrol and electricity would add further pressure on inflation. “The flawed policies of the federal government and Punjab have already driven farmers to the brink of starvation. The lack of relief in the budget will worsen their plight, directly affecting the production of essential commodities like wheat, rice, and sugar which will lead to a surge in prices,” he added.
Toru alleged that the centre continued to treat KP unfairly. “Even the electricity that KP generates is not being supplied back to the province this is blatant injustice,” he went on to claim.
Toru said that following the directives of PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, the current provincial government is actively pursuing an anti-corruption agenda. He revealed that an accountability committee has been established to monitor irregularities in provincial departments, and officials against whom complaints were received have been removed from their posts.

Saif terms budget nightmare for poor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320310-saif-terms-budget-nightmare-for-poor,"PESHAWAR: Advisor to Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations Barrister Dr Muhammad Ali Saif on Wednesday said the federal government had deceived the salaried class under the guise of providing relief.
“The salary increase is far too little compared to the rate of inflation,” he said in a statement, adding this budget was a nightmare for the poor segments of society. He expressed serious concern over the hike in taxes on petrol and electricity, warning that such measures would trigger a new wave of inflation. “When petrol prices rise, the cost of all essential commodities follows,” he noted. He also criticised the imposition of taxes on alternative energy sources such as solar panels. “These too have now become unaffordable for the common man,” he added. Dr Saif said this budget does not represent the interests of the common people, but instead reflects the priorities of the Sharif family’s business empire.

KPEF to launch ‘Adopt a Scholar’ programme,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320311-kpef-to-launch-adopt-a-scholar-programme,"PESHAWAR: In a bid to expand access to higher education for deserving students, especially orphans, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Education Foundation (KPEF) is set to launch a new initiative to provide a transparent platform for philanthropists, individuals and organisations to sponsor higher education of talented students in market-oriented disciplines across the province.
According to KPEF Managing Director Zariful Maani, more than 14,000 deserving students applied for scholarships, titled “Adopt a Scholar - Contribute to Support a Scholar”  this year, but due to limited resources only 204 could be supported.“Higher education is expensive and support from the government and the institution, he heads, is minimal,” he said.
Most of the deserving students are orphans. Some very interesting stories were recorded during the scholarships’ interviews. Many families have had to sell cattle or land to continue their children’s education. This program is about giving these students a fair chance, Zariful Maani said.
Launched under the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s broader education development agenda, the initiative invites national and international donors to adopt a scholar by funding their university education through a recently developed transparent and digitized scholarship portal. The program specifically targets students from vulnerable backgrounds, particularly orphans and those from low-income families, who are enrolled in public and private universities across the country.
Currently, KPEF offers scholarships through its merit-cum-affordability program, supported by a rigorous online selection process and a gender-balanced disbursement model aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG-4). Despite this, thousands of eligible students remain without aid each year. Of the 3,700 eligible applications received in 2025, only 204 scholarships were awarded, leaving over 3,000 deserving students - many of them orphans - at risk of discontinuing their studies due to financial constraints.
The new initiative seeks to bridge this gap by encouraging individuals, non-governmental organisations, corporate bodies, banks and government institutions to “adopt” scholars. Donors will receive comprehensive academic profiles of the students they support, including regular updates on attendance, performance and achievements.
An effective monitoring system, comprising a dedicated scrutiny and oversight committee, will ensure transparency and effective utilization of funds.“This is not just a scholarship program. It is a lifeline for talented youth of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who are eager to study but lack resources,” Zariful Maani said.  The goal behind the initiative is to make higher education accessible to all, he said.
According to official statistics, over 416,000 students are currently enrolled in higher education institutions across the province. KPEF’s own data shows that at least 482 orphan students are actively seeking financial support at the Bachelor’s and Master’s levels. These students come from nearly every district in KP with the highest concentrations in Mardan, Mansehra, Swat and Lower Dir.
The initiative also plans to attract donations from Zakat, corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, Pakistan Baitul Mal and other social welfare agencies. A dedicated bank account will be established with KPEF’s finance wing independently maintaining balance sheets in compliance with government regulations. A high-level oversight committee will be formed to verify donor credibility and manage the transparent distribution of funds, Zarif said.
He maintained that many potential donors have expressed willingness to contribute to the cause. “We are developing a transparent system to ensure that support is directed straight to orphans and deserving students. This will offer a credible forum for banks, philanthropists and institutions to properly utilize their charitable contributions. Supporting students in this way serves a far greater purpose than handing out alms that may promote dependency and ‘beggary’.
He added that the program will provide opportunities for students to pursue higher education in market-oriented disciplines to make them self-reliant and professionally competitive. “This initiative will be formally launched once approved by the competent forum,” he confirmed.
KPEF will soon announce a dedicated donation account number and official communication channels for interested donors. Sponsors will have the option to support one or multiple students and will be updated quarterly on the academic progress of those they adopt.
With this initiative, the KP Education Foundation is setting a precedent for public-private collaboration in education and demonstrating how community-driven philanthropy can help bridge the higher education gap in the underdeveloped areas of the country, he concluded.

APC in Swat opposes decision to convert hospital into MTI,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320314-apc-in-swat-opposes-decision-to-convert-hospital-into-mti,"MINGORA: An All Parties Conference (APC) here on Tuesday rejected the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s decision to convert the Saidu Group of Teaching Hospitals into a Medical Teaching Institution (MTI).
The conference, held at the Saidu Medical College, termed the move a bid to privatize the facility.The APC was organized by the Young Doctors Association (YDA) Saidu Group of Teaching Hospitals and the Health Employees Coordination Council. It witnessed widespread participation from political leaders, legal and business communities, civil society members, and social organizations.
The participants included Irshad Ali Khan (PMLN), Shamsher Ali Khan Advocate and Irfan Chattan (PPP), Akhtar Ali Khan Khanji (Jamaat-e-Islami), Sherzada Bahadur Khan (QWP), Shershah Khan (ANP), Mushtaq Khan Advocate (president, Swat Bar Association), Abdul Rahim (president, Malakand Division Traders Federation, Dr Khalid Mehmood, spokesperson, Swat Traders Federation, Dr Shehzad Khan (President, YDA Saidu Teaching Hospital, Dr Asif Khan (General Secretary, YDA KP, Dr Shehzad Abdullah, Dr Murad Ali, and Dr Imran of Provincial Doctors Association.
The speakers unanimously condemned the provincial government’s alleged failure to provide basic health and education services. They demanded the immediate restoration and upgradation of the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Swat and announced a series of protests across the province if the demands were not met.
They argued that declaring Saidu Teaching Hospital as an MTI was an attempt to cover up the government’s incompetence, calling it a step toward privatisation and contract-based healthcare - a system they firmly rejected.
“The decision to implement the MTI system reflects the incompetence and lack of seriousness of Swat’s elected representatives, including eight MPAs and three MNAs,” said one of the speakers. “They have utterly failed to provide any meaningful relief to the people,” he added.
Participants demanded that the DHQ Hospital’s status be maintained and upgraded to a Category A facility. They also called for Saidu Medical College to be granted university status to improve opportunities for education and research for local students.
The conference concluded with a unanimous resolution demanding immediate and serious action from the government. It warned that failure to meet these demands would lead to a phased strike campaign across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including street protests and province-wide demonstrations.

Court restrains ACE from arresting ex-DG Health Services,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320315-court-restrains-ace-from-arresting-ex-dg-health-services,"PESHAWAR: Additional District and Sessions Judge Liaqat Ali on Wednesday restrained Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) from arresting former director general Health Services Shaukat Ali and sought a response from the department.
Shaukat Ali’s lawyer Babar Khan Yousafzai informed the court that his client was a former DG against whom cases and inquiries were being initiated on political grounds.
He argued that ACE personnel conducted raids at his client’s residences in Timergara and Peshawar in connection with a 13-year old case, even though Shaukat Ali had not personally gained any benefit from the case.
The case allegedly involved two former doctors accused of receiving dual salaries.The lawyer said that Dr Shaukat was being politically victimised for not supporting the drug mafia and that local lawmakers were also involved in this campaign.
He argued that in the current case, two other doctors were named, and the allegation concerns salary payments, which had nothing to do with his client.He told the court that his client was one of the finest officers in the management cadre, and the only reason he was facing these cases was due to his straightforwardness, upholding merit and refusing to bow to the drug mafia.
He said that the Peshawar High Court had already issued stay orders in two separate petitions prohibiting his arrest and harassment. These cases, he added, had been registered solely to undermine those court orders and to malign his client’s character on social media, which is unfair.
He said that since his client was willing to appear in court and face the cases, there was no justification for his arrest.After initial arguments, the court accepted the pre-arrest bail petition and sought a response from the ACE.

Poor maintenance: Portion of Gor Khatri Archaeological Complex collapses,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320316-poor-maintenance-portion-of-gor-khatri-archaeological-complex-collapses,"PESHAWAR: A portion of the southern section of the historical and tourist landmark in Peshawar, the Gor Khatri Archaeological Complex, collapsed at night due to a lack of proper maintenance.
The part that came down is located opposite Koocha Bibi Zakri and has long been neglected by the Department of Archaeology.Residents of the neighbourhood said the site was under the care of the Department of Archaeology and Museums and the District Government (Town I), but both, along with other relevant government institutions, had shown little interest in preserving the historic site.
They expressed grave concern over the continued neglect and feared that the remaining portions of this historical structure may soon be confined to the pages of history books if the relevant government departments continued to shirk their responsibility toward cultural heritage.
“A master plan for the establishment of the Peshawar Walled City Authority was prepared to ensure the preservation of Peshawar’s historical and tourist sites. However, due to bureaucratic apathy, the plan was shelved indefinitely,” said a cultural activist and journalist, Shabbir Hussain Imam, while highlighting the issue on his Facebook pages.
“From the Gorakhnath and Shiv temples located opposite the grand mosque to other living remnants of diverse religions, cultures, and civilizations, many historical footprints remain and deserve urgent attention,” he added.
Another citizen said the historical Gor Khatri monument held great significance for Peshawar, one of the oldest living cities in South Asia.“It was the excavation carried out in phases next to the eastern gate of Gor Khatri that determined the historical profile of Peshawar. The excavation proved that Peshawar is 2,600 years old,” said Muhammad Ziauddin, a documentation expert and general secretary of the Gandhara Hindko Board, while calling for urgent action to save this structure and several others in Peshawar.
Citizens urged all members of the national and provincial assemblies, the Senate, local government representatives, and other decision-makers to take practical steps for the protection and preservation of the Gor Khatri heritage site.

‘Several projects launched in Peshawar’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320318-several-projects-launched-in-peshawar,"PESHAWAR: Commissioner of Peshawar Division Riaz Mahsud on Wednesday resented the campaign launched on social media against development projects in Peshawar and termed the drive factually incorrect, misleading in figures, and aimed at undermining efforts.
Responding to the allegations, the commissioner clarified that the claim about a fence being built for Rs7 billion under the uplift programme was baseless.He stated that the actual project — a 6-kilometre jogging and cycling track in Hayatabad— was approved at Rs370 million.
The facility, nearing completion, includes separate lanes for jogging and cycling, open gyms, rest points, gazebos, washrooms, and other modern urban amenities.Similarly, he refuted the accusations of financial bungling in the Drug Free Peshawar initiative as unsubstantiated and unsupported by any evidence.
Riaz Mahsud noted that over 3,800 drug-dependent individuals were successfully treated and reunited with their families during the first three phases of the programme, which earned national and international recognition.
He said the fourth phase, set to begin this week, will bring an estimated 300-400 remaining individuals off the streets and into rehabilitation centres. The commissioner said, notably, no funds had yet been spent from the allocated budget for this phase, which remains secure with the Social Welfare Department.The social media campaign said that nearly one million illegal immigrants reside in Peshawar, placing responsibility on the commissioner and the PDA.

MNA demands reopening of roads in Kurram,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320319-mna-demands-reopening-of-roads-in-kurram,"PARACHINAR:  Member of National Assembly (MNA) from Kurram and leader of Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen (MWM), Hamid Hussain, has condemned the ongoing closure of the Parachinar-Peshawar main highway, which has now extended to over nine months.
In a statement to the media, MNA Hamid Hussain expressed deep concern over the worsening humanitarian crisis in the region, where residents of Parachinar and other parts of Kurram remain effectively trapped due to blocked roads and deteriorating security conditions. He described the situation as “unbearable” and called on federal authorities to take urgent steps for reopening of the roads.
“The main highway and all other access routes, including those along the Afghan border, have been closed by armed groups for the past nine months,” said Hamid Hussain. “As a result, thousands of students have been unable to attend schools and universities across the country, leading to the loss of an academic year,” he added

Two alleged extortionists killed in Balakot,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320320-two-alleged-extortionists-killed-in-balakot,"MANSEHRA: The police Wednesday killed two alleged extortionists belonging to Afghanistan and rescued a three-year-old boy along with his paternal aunt who were kidnapped for ransom in Balakot earlier this week.
“We traced the locations and movement routes of the extortionists with technical support from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The extortionists opened indiscriminate fire upon seeing the police and were killed in the subsequent exchange of fire,” District Police Officer (DPO) Shafiullah Khan Gandapur told reporters here.
He said the police also seized Afghan national identity cards, three cell phones, weapons and ammunition from the kidnappers.“Our investigation, assisted by law-enforcement agencies, including the ISI, is underway. We want to ascertain whether or not the deceased were involved in subversive activities elsewhere in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or the country,” Gandapur added.
The bodies of kidnappers identified as Arman Jan and Faheem Khan were moved to the mortuary of King Abdullah Teaching Hospital. The deceased were stated to be Afghan nationals and were residing in  Badaber area of Peshawar,
Explaining the events that led to the shootout, the DPO said the wife of Mohammad Waqas, a resident of Kohistan Colony, had filed an FIR with the police in Balakot. She said that her sister-in-law had taken her two-and-a-half-year-old son, Mohammad Saeed, to a faith-healer in Balakot on June 5. However, she didn’t return.The DPO stated that the extortionists later contacted the boy’s father, who works in Dubai, via phone and demanded ransom.

Pakistan Solar Association demands govt reconsider proposed GST on solar panels,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320231-pakistan-solar-association-demands-govt-reconsider-proposed-gst-on-solar-panels,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Solar Association (PSA) has urged the government to reconsider the proposed imposition of the 18 per cent general sales tax (GST) on imported solar panels in Budget 2025-26.
The association fears that this move could reverse the significant progress Pakistan has made in solar energy deployment over the years. The growth of the solar sector has not only provided affordable and sustainable energy options for citizens but has also played a critical role in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and minimising environmental harm.
According to a PSA official, the rationale provided for the tax -- to protect local manufacturing -- is fundamentally flawed. Currently, there is no large-scale or high-efficiency solar panel manufacturing facility in the country. The few existing units, he said, only produce low-wattage panels, which do not compete directly with imported technology. Hence, he added, the claim of protecting the local industry lacks merit and should not come at the cost of sabotaging a growing, green energy sector.
“At a time when the world is accelerating towards clean and renewable energy, this tax will discourage solar adoption and harm our climate goals,” said Waqas Moosa, chairperson of the Pakistan Solar Association. “The imposition of 18 per cent GST will make solar energy less affordable for consumers and damage the confidence of investors and stakeholders in this vital industry.”
Currently, the high cost of solar installations is already a barrier for many. Increasing prices further through taxation will make solar less competitive compared to fossil fuels such as oil and petrol -- which are not only environmentally damaging but also contribute to the country’s rising import bill and balance of payments issues.
This move risks long-term damage to Pakistan’s environmental objectives, energy independence, and economic stability, the association remarked, adding that it calls upon the government to take a holistic and forward-thinking approach, considering our climate commitments, current account challenges, and the urgent need for energy transition.
“We respectfully urge policymakers to withdraw this proposed GST in the final budget and instead support policies that encourage solar adoption, attract investment and promote clean energy growth in Pakistan,” the PSA said.

PBF slams budget for ignoring agriculture,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320232-pbf-slams-budget-for-ignoring-agriculture,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) criticised the federal budget for FY2025-26, warning it offers no meaningful relief for the agriculture sector or business community, and risks fuelling inflation through aggressive revenue targets.
“The agriculture sector has once again been ignored,” said PBF Chief Organiser Ahmad Jawad in a post-budget statement. “How does the government plan to achieve 4.5 per cent growth when farmers, who already delivered 0.56 per cent growth this year, are left unsupported?”
Jawad said the budget lacks a roadmap for export-led growth. He called the minimal reduction in super tax “disappointing”, and criticised the Finance Bill for retaining controversial provisions such as Sections 14AC, 14AD, and 37AA. He warned that Rs14.1 trillion tax collection target -- up nearly 9.0 per cent from the previous year -- could stoke inflation and hinder business activity. “The FBR has been given unchecked powers while there is no visible plan to broaden the tax net,” he added.
The PBF also opposed an increase in the petroleum levy and rejected the introduction of a carbon tax. Jawad said the business community had hoped for lower power tariffs of 9 cents/unit, but instead, the government plans to take a Rs1.25 trillion loan to resolve circular debt -- interest on which would be passed on to consumers via power bills.
He further questioned the allocation of over Rs8 trillion to provinces, suggesting that provincial governments -- particularly Punjab, which holds a cash surplus -- should contribute to national development and defence. “This budget disappoints those expecting structural reforms after 18 months of macroeconomic stabilisation,” said Jawad. “There is not much here to signal a shift towards sustainable growth.”Still, the PBF welcomed the reduction in federal excise duty and withholding tax in the property sector, and acknowledged improvements in the regulatory duty regime.

OCAC raises concerns over continued GST exemption on petroleum products,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320233-ocac-raises-concerns-over-continued-gst-exemption-on-petroleum-products,"KARACHI: The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) has expressed serious concern and strongly protested the continuation of the General Sales Tax (GST) exemption on petroleum products in the recently announced Finance Bill.
“While we acknowledge the government’s interim relief by allowing recovery of the GST impact through the inland freight equalisation margin (IFEM) effective May 16, 2025, this remains a temporary measure with inherent implications,” the OCAC said in a letter to the petroleum minister.
The council noted that the continued GST exemption on petrol, high-speed diesel (HSD), kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) -- despite repeated representations from the industry and the minister’s personal commitment during a recent visit to Karachi to have the exemption withdrawn -- demonstrates a lack of recognition of the financial and operational strain this issue places on the downstream oil sector.
“It threatens the viability of businesses, undermines investor confidence and runs counter to the broader objectives of the Pakistan Brownfield Oil Refining Policy, 2023,” the OCAC said.It strongly urged the immediate withdrawal of the GST exemption on petroleum products and recommended replacing it with a sales tax mechanism that allows for full input tax adjustments. “This is the only durable and equitable solution that will restore financial stability, tax neutrality and regulatory clarity to the sector -- failing which, a $6 billion investment under the Brownfield Refining Policy is at serious risk,” the letter warned.

This month, the SBP lowered its benchmark interest rate by 100bps to 11 per cent, marking the continuation of a series of rate cuts that reduced the rate from a record high of 22 per cent after a brief hold in March.
The policy rate has fallen by 11 percentage points since June 2024.Markets and analysts are waiting to see what the SBP will decide on interest rates at its June 16 meeting.

"SECP registers record 3,609 new firms in May",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320235-secp-registers-record-3-609-new-firms-in-may,"KARACHI: The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan registered 3,609 new companies in May, the highest monthly total in its history, as digitalisation efforts continue to streamline business formation and attract investor interest.
The figure surpasses the previous record of 3,442 set in January, bringing the total number of registered companies nationwide to over 255,000. Around 99.9 per cent of May’s incorporations were processed online, reflecting the success of the SECP’s digital reforms aimed at simplifying registration and promoting entrepreneurship.

"Pakistan’s plan to sharply increase growth faces headwinds, analysts say",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320236-pakistan-s-plan-to-sharply-increase-growth-faces-headwinds-analysts-say,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is aiming to sharply increase economic growth under its annual federal budget unveiled on Tuesday, but analysts are sceptical about the country’s ability to meet its ambitious goals.
The budget targets higher revenues and a steep fiscal deficit cut under International Monetary Fund (IMF) backed reforms. Yet, defence spending was hiked 20 per cent, excluding military pensions, after last month’s conflict with India.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said in a post-budget press conference on Wednesday that customs duties have been cut or removed on thousands of raw materials and intermediate goods.
“Industry here has to be competitive, competitive enough to export,” he said.But growth drivers remain unclear. The government is targeting 4.2 per cent GDP growth in fiscal 2026, up from 2.7 per cent this year, which was revised down from an initial 3.6 per cent as agriculture and large-scale manufacturing underperformed.
“Pakistan’s GDP growth projection of 4.2 per cent appears ambitious given recent performance, and overly optimistic assumptions may place tax targets out of reach,” said Callee Davis, senior economist at Oxford Economics.
Pakistan’s past growth spurts were consumption-led, triggering balance-of-payments crises and IMF bailouts. The government says it now wants higher-quality, investment-driven growth.
Aurangzeb said structural reforms are underway, pointing to East Asia-style pro-market transitions. “This is an East Asia moment for Pakistan,” he said.The Rs17.57 trillion ($62.24 billion) budget comes as Pakistan remains under a $7 billion IMF programme. Revenues are projected to rise over 14 per cent, driven by new taxes and broadening the tax base. The fiscal deficit is targeted at 3.9 per cent of GDP, down from this year’s 5.9 per cent.
Key reforms include taxing agriculture, real estate, and retail, and reviving stalled privatisations. But revenue shortfalls this year have raised doubts, with both agriculture income tax and retail collections missing targets. Only 1.3 per cent of the population paid income tax in 2024, government data shows.
“Pakistan’s budget keeps the IMF and investors happy, even if it comes at a near-term cost to growth,” said Hasnain Malik, head of equity strategy at Tellimer. “The political setup, with the military firmly in charge, also lowers the risk of protests.”
While overall spending will fall 7.0 per cent, defence will rise after the worst fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours in decades. Including pensions, defence spending will total $12 billion, 19 per cent of the federal budget or 2.5 per cent of GDP, matching India’s share, per World Bank data.
The hike was enabled by a sharp drop in interest payments, as the central bank cut policy rates from 22 per cent to 11 per cent over the past year, easing domestic debt servicing costs. Aurangzeb said cuts in subsidies also helped create fiscal space.

Rupee falls against dollar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320237-rupee-falls-against-dollar,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee declined against the US dollar in the interbank market on Wednesday.The rupee closed at 282.47 per dollar, compared with the previous close of 282.21. The local unit fell by 0.09 per cent during the session.
Dealers said the rupee maintained its downward trend due to increased dollar demand from importers.Pakistan unveiled its annual budget for the next fiscal year, starting in July, on Tuesday.
Pakistan’s GDP has recorded a growth of 2.68 per cent in FY25, compared with 2.51 per cent in FY24. Going forward, the government has set an ambitious GDP growth target of 4.2 per cent for FY26.
As Pakistan enters FY26, the macroeconomic environment reflects early signs of stabilisation, supported by declining inflation, a low interest rate environment, and an improved external account position, wrote Arif Habib Limited in a note.
Another encouraging sign is the current account balance, which is expected to reach a surplus of $1.5 billion in FY25, compared with $1.3 billion last year, it said.“The SBP adopted a monetary easing stance, reducing the policy rate to 11 per cent in May. In FY26, the monetary policy will remain calibrated to support economic recovery while anchoring inflation expectations,” it added. “Despite these positive developments, several challenges remain. The pressure on the current account is anticipated as import-driven consumption increases.”

"IT industry calls for policy continuity, tax relief to meet $25bn export goal",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320238-it-industry-calls-for-policy-continuity-tax-relief-to-meet-25bn-export-goal,"LAHORE: Stakeholders from the IT industry have called for the continuation of existing taxation policies to sustain domestic expansion and boost foreign exchange earnings, aiming to meet the ambitious export target of $25 billion by 2029 set in the federal budget.
They urged the government to provide clarity regarding tax exemptions for IT companies and withdraw unnecessary or newly imposed taxes. However, they welcomed the government’s allocation of funds for human resource development and skills training.
Senior Vice Chairman of P@SHA Muhammad Umair Nizam said the government should have extended the final tax regime (FTR) for IT companies and freelancers for the next 10 years, as previously requested, to attract foreign investment and accelerate export growth.
He also called for the abolition of the 5 per cent tax (10 per cent for non-filers) currently levied on debit card transactions linked to foreign currency accounts, saying that it significantly eats into IT companies’ earnings and profitability.
“The government should refrain from imposing taxes on e-commerce and online advertising, as such measures indirectly affect IT businesses and negatively impact their margins,” he added.
P@SHA also highlighted the urgent need to curb the ongoing brain drain by aligning local income tax policies with those applicable to remote workers. However, Nizam noted that no meaningful measures have yet been taken to support local companies and exporters.
Convener of the IT Committee at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Khushnood Aftab urged the government to allocate funding for the local production of IT devices and accessories as part of the broader digital transformation initiative.
He pointed out that a significant portion of the government’s IT budget is spent on importing laptops, computers and components -- exacerbating foreign exchange outflows. Aftab recommended reducing taxes on desktop components to promote local assembly and attract investment in the technology sector.
Noman Ahmed Said, technopreneur and CEO of SI Global Solutions, noted that while the budget made bold claims about supporting the digital economy -- with Rs29.9 billion earmarked for ICT development and Rs13.5 billion allocated for tech parks, cybersecurity and semiconductor training -- the policy framework remains weak.
He described the budget as “a digital push without a policy backbone”, warning that critical gaps in regulation may erode the gains from these investments.On a positive note, Said acknowledged the continuation of training programmes like e-Rozgaar, DigiSkills, and the National Freelance Training Program (NFTP), which have already helped freelancers earn over $1.6 billion. He also welcomed initiatives such as special technology zones (STZs) and the establishment of the Pakistan Crypto Council as signs of progress.
Still, he cautioned that Pakistan’s “infrastructure-first” approach is inadequate without supportive policies. “Globally, countries like India, Vietnam and Bangladesh are simplifying remote work and tech exports. Pakistan, meanwhile, is investing in digital highways that no one can afford to drive on,” he said.
“Our policymakers must align infrastructure with empowerment and vision with viable policy -- or risk losing our best talent,” he warned.The IT sector has maintained double-digit export growth and is expected to hit $4 billion by the end of the current financial year. Stakeholders believe consistent government support is essential to sustain this trajectory and positively impact key economic indicators, including the balance of payments.

"PCDMA lauds tax relief for salaried class, flags concerns over enforcement powers",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320239-pcdma-lauds-tax-relief-for-salaried-class-flags-concerns-over-enforcement-powers,"KARACHI: Salim Valimuhammad, chairperson of the Pakistan Chemicals & Dyes Merchants Association (PCDMA), has welcomed the reduction in tax rates for the salaried class, though he noted that the cuts are not substantial for higher income brackets.
Also, the duty on dyes has been reduced from 16 per cent to 15 per cent, while a 5.0 per cent duty has been imposed on items that were previously zero-rated.However, Valimuhammad expressed concern over the extensive powers granted to tax authorities under the new budget, warning that such measures could negatively affect the business community.
He acknowledged that while the budget includes some positive steps, it remains flawed in certain areas.Commenting on the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS), the PCDMA chief was critical and argued that it should have been entirely withdrawn, citing widespread misuse.
He explained that the scheme had primarily benefited major cotton and related sectors, and that with the imposition of duties and an 18 per cent tax, curbing its abuse would remain difficult.
Valimuhammad described the budget as a modest improvement over previous ones but called for greater clarity on pending regulations. He also cautioned against the potential consequences of enhanced enforcement powers for tax authorities on the broader business environment.

APTMA commends govt for imposing 18% sales tax on imported cotton yarn to ensure level playing field,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320240-aptma-commends-govt-for-imposing-18pc-sales-tax-on-imported-cotton-yarn-to-ensure-level-playing-field,"ISLAMABAD: Chairperson of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) Kamran Arshad has lauded the government for announcing 18 per cent sales tax on imported cotton yarn.
“This has addressed a major distortion in the market and is a significant step towards resolving the sales tax anomaly in the export facilitation scheme (EFS). It demonstrates the government’s commitment to restoring fairness and balance in the domestic textile value chain, and we commend this decisive action.”
However, this correction being welcomed is insufficient in scope. After having dealt a severe blow to the spinning sector, the sales tax disparity is now eroding the viability of downstream sectors like weaving. The EFS, under which imported inputs for export enjoy a zero per cent sales tax rate while local materials for export are taxed at 18 per cent, continues to place upstream domestic sectors at a gross disadvantage. In his statement, Arshad called for ensuring true competitiveness and sustainability of Pakistan’s textile value chain.
The APTMA urges the government to extend the 18 per cent sales tax to all yarns and fabrics, whether cotton or polyester, imported under the EFS. Moreover, these imports must be placed on the EFS Negative List, imposing a 5.0 per cent customs duty on yarn and 11 per cent on fabric to establish a level playing field and incentivize local manufacturing. Without this, the gains made in one segment will be undone by distortions in another.
The situation with polycotton and polyester yarns is particularly concerning, as they are already approximately 35 per cent more expensive to produce domestically. Subjecting local manufacturers to 18 per cent sales tax while exempting imported polyester inputs undermines industrial policy objectives and discourages investment in local capacity.
The APTMA also reiterates its demand for the removal of sales tax on cottonseed and cottonseed cake -- byproducts of cotton lint, used primarily in livestock feed. These items are not subject to sales tax in any major cotton-producing economy. Imposing 18 per cent GST on these products pushes farmers below their cost of production, especially given the price inelasticity of demand, and drives a damaging shift toward more water-intensive crops. This not only imperils water security but also fuels underreporting of cotton production, thereby reducing revenue collection on cotton lint itself.
We are grateful for the government’s attention and responsiveness to industry concerns thus far. However, without extending similar GST treatment to all EFS imports of yarns and fabrics, the crisis faced by spinning will soon replicate in weaving. Yarn feeds into fabric production, and if locally produced fabric is taxed while imported fabric is not, exporters will inevitably choose the cheaper, untaxed import -- undermining both the fabric and yarn sectors.
In its statement, the APTMA appreciated the government’s broader economic reform agenda, which has yielded substantial relief and renewed confidence across the industrial landscape. The reduction in power tariffs from an unsustainable 16-17 cents per kWh to approximately 11 cents per kWh, the successful curbing of back-breaking inflation, and the lowering of interest rates from 22 per cent to 11 per cent are commendable achievements.

"PCJCCI welcomes Budget 2025-26, cites progress on CPEC",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320241-pcjcci-welcomes-budget-2025-26-cites-progress-on-cpec,"LAHORE: The Pakistan China Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCJCCI) has welcomed the launch of the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 and Budget 2025-26, describing them as strong indicators of the country’s commitment to economic stability, investment promotion and regional connectivity through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).
The chamber noted encouraging signs of macroeconomic stabilisation, with inflation recorded at 4.6 per cent and GDP growth at 2.7 per cent during the outgoing fiscal year -- developments expected to bolster investor confidence. Chinese enterprises are already showing renewed interest, the PCJCCI said, as CPEC’s next phase shifts focus towards job creation, industrial growth and local empowerment.
The chamber reiterated its commitment to promoting bilateral trade, facilitating business partnerships, and supporting the government’s development objectives under CPEC and the budget. “CPEC is not just an economic corridor -- it is a symbol of long-term cooperation and shared prosperity. The foundation has been laid; now it is time to build on it, together,” the statement added.
PCJCCI President Nazir Hussain underscored CPEC’s transformative role in developing infrastructure, enhancing trade and generating employment -- particularly through projects in road, port, energy and urban development.
He highlighted the completion of major infrastructure projects including the Multan-Sukkur and Hakla-DI Khan motorways, as well as the operationalisation of the New Gwadar International Airport, which are collectively improving logistics, reducing travel times and unlocking new trade routes.
Senior Vice President (r) Mansoor Saeed Sheikh specifically praised progress in Gwadar, noting that the Gwadar Port and Free Zone have attracted over $250 million in investment from China Overseas Ports Holding Company Limited (COPHCL). He cited the presence of operations in logistics, manufacturing, fisheries, and finance, supported by incentives such as a 23-year tax holiday, full foreign ownership, and one-window facilitation. “Gwadar is rapidly emerging as a strategic commercial hub for the region,” he added.
Vice President Zafar Iqbal said the budget  has earmarked significant allocations under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for ongoing and new CPEC projects. These include infrastructure development in Gwadar, land acquisition and the second phase of the East Bay Expressway.
He also highlighted progress in social infrastructure, pointing to the completion of a 1.2 million-gallon-per-day desalination plant to address water scarcity in Gwadar, and advancements in digital connectivity, including the completion of a cross-border optical fibre cable.

"SAI chief calls for faster refunds, digital reforms to support industry growth",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320242-sai-chief-calls-for-faster-refunds-digital-reforms-to-support-industry-growth,"KARACHI: President of the Site Association of Industry (SAI) Ahmed Azeem Alvi, while acknowledging some positive aspects of the federal budget, emphasised the need for clearer policies, timely tax refunds, and digital reforms to better support exporters and industrial growth.
Alvi noted that the government had recognised the necessity for relief in the customs sector and planned to implement reforms. However, he cautioned that the full impact of these measures would only become apparent once the detailed budget documents were released.
“The government has addressed our concerns regarding the performance of the freight station and made commitments in this regard,” he said. He also reiterated SAI’s demand for the immediate repeal of the Income Tax Ordinance issued on May 4, expressing hope that the budget papers would clarify the government’s position.
One of Alvi’s primary concerns was the delayed issuance of income tax refunds to exporters. He urged the government to ensure that refunds are processed within 15 working days through the banking system. “Delays force exporters to bear additional costs and face liquidity issues,” he said. “A transparent and corruption-free system is essential for timely disbursements.”
The SAI president underscored the importance of digitalisation, transparency, and a one-window operation to reduce bureaucratic hurdles. He pointed out that 69 federal and provincial agencies currently conduct factory inspections, creating significant inefficiencies. “Reducing the number of inspections will allow industries to concentrate on growth rather than compliance,” he noted.
However, Alvi expressed disappointment that the budget had not adequately addressed digitalisation and one-window reforms -- critical steps for improving the ease of doing business.
He also criticised the government for failing to broaden the tax base while setting ambitious revenue targets. “Instead of supporting Karachi, the focus remains on regions with poor recovery rates,” he said, calling for policies that further strengthen Karachi’s tax contributions.
Alvi condemned the inclusion of circular debt charges in Karachi’s electricity bills, calling it unjust. “Despite expectations, the government has not removed these charges, making Karachi one of the most expensive cities in terms of electricity costs,” he said, holding both the federal and Sindh governments accountable for their inaction.

"Pakistan, US discuss boosting cotton trade, textile cooperation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320243-pakistan-us-discuss-boosting-cotton-trade-textile-cooperation,"LAHORE: US Consul General in Lahore Kristin K Hawkins met with office bearers of the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA) to explore avenues for enhancing bilateral trade and economic cooperation between Pakistan and the US.
The discussions focused on the significant potential for collaboration in the cotton and textile sectors, while also exploring opportunities to expand trade and investment in other key areas. Both sides emphasised the importance of reducing the trade deficit and diversifying major traded commodities in light of the US reciprocal tariffs.
Participants agreed that Pakistan holds strong potential for growth not only in textiles but also across various industrial sectors. APTMA leadership reiterated its commitment to continued engagement and dialogue with American counterparts to increase trade volumes and maximise the benefits of the economic partnership.
Speaking on the occasion, APTMA Chairperson Kamran Arshad highlighted that the US is the primary supplier of cotton to Pakistan. He noted that Pakistan is the world’s largest importer of US cotton, and these imports are crucial in compensating for domestic shortfalls in cotton production.
Chairman North Zone Asad Shafi added that the US remained Pakistan’s largest trading partner in 2024, with total bilateral trade reaching $9.85 billion. He added that the country’s exports to the US stood at $5.12 billion, of which $3.93 billion -- or 77 per cent -- comprised textile and apparel products. In contrast, Pakistan imported goods worth $2.14 billion from the US during the same period, including more than $700 million in cotton imports.
Shafi stressed the need for technology transfer to Pakistan, particularly for high-yield cotton seeds, and called for increased collaboration with US cotton research institutions to improve cotton quality and productivity.

Australia reach World Cup as Palestinian dreams ended,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320259-australia-reach-world-cup-as-palestinian-dreams-ended,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: Australia qualified for next year’s World Cup in North America while Oman ended Palestine’s hopes of a first appearance at the finals with a last-gasp draw on Tuesday.
Tony Popovic’s Socceroos, who went into the third round’s final match day heavy favourites to progress, defeated direct rivals Saudi Arabia 2-1 in Jeddah to seal the second automatic qualification spot in Group C.
Saudi Arabia must instead make do with a place in the fourth round, alongside Indonesia. Japan had already secured top place in the group.
“We’ve built a good foundation now and we want to really get better, kick on and try and do something special at the World Cup,” said Popovic. Herve Renard’s Saudi side went into the decider at King Abdullah Sports City Stadium knowing only a win by a five-goal margin would be enough to usurp Australia in second.
The hosts were given the perfect start when Abdulrahman Al-Aboud opened the scoring 19 minutes in. The visitors pulled level just before half-time through Connor Metcalfe’s left-footed strike.
Australia were soon ahead, when three minutes into the second half Mitch Duke met Martin Boyle’s cross to head home from close range. Goalkeeper Mathew Ryan then saved Salem Al-Dawsari’s late penalty to earn Australia a memorable victory and secure the country’s sixth successive appearance at a World Cup in style.
“To show that character, resilience and then quality to come back and actually take the lead and win the game, I’m delighted,” said Popovic. In Group B, Palestinian hearts were broken when they conceded a penalty deep into injury time to draw 1-1 with Oman in Amman.
Palestine, playing their home fixtures at a neutral venue, took the lead on 49 minutes when Oday Kharoub headed Adam Kaied’s corner into the top corner. Oman were reduced to 10 men in the 73rd minute after Harib Al-Saadi was shown a second yellow card.
Yet the visitors rallied to snatch a precious point in the 97th minute, Issam Al-Sabhi converting a spot-kick following a foul on Muhsen Al-Ghassani. The result means Oman finish fourth in the group at Palestine’s expense and therefore advance to the next phase of qualification.
The top two teams in each of the three groups go straight to the World Cup in the United States, Mexico and Canada, while those in third and fourth move on to the fourth round. Taking place in October, and comprising two groups of three, there are two places at next summer’s tournament up for grabs with Oman, UAE, Qatar, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia all in the running.
Crystal Palace forward Daichi Kamada scored twice for Japan and Paris Saint Germain’s Lee Kang-in netted for South Korea as the Asian giants rounded off successful World Cup qualifying campaigns in style.

Olympic champ O’Callaghan in tears after 200m freestyle win at Australian trials,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320260-olympic-champ-o-callaghan-in-tears-after-200m-freestyle-win-at-australian-trials,"ADELAIDE: Olympic champion Mollie O’Callaghan choked back tears after clocking the year’s fastest 200m freestyle at the Australian trials Wednesday, with the young star admitting it had been hard coping since the Paris Games.
The 21-year-old surged to the wall in Adelaide in 1min 54.43secs to easily qualify for next month’s Singapore world championships, where she will be the red-hot favourite. She became emotional during her poolside interview about the “rough couple of months” coming down from the high of the Olympics, where she won three gold, a silver and a bronze.
“You know, it was really stressful for me. And I think even though it’s not the time I exactly wanted, it’s just hard to, like, come back,” she said as the tears flowed. “I’d say this lead-up has been the hardest thing I’ve experienced so far.
“I don’t think there’s been anything as hard as this, coming here and trying to race and trying to, you know, defend my Olympic status in a way. “But just happy that I stood up and just raced my main event.”
O’Callaghan arrived in Paris with her 200m freestyle world record just broken by fellow Australian Ariarne Titmus and under enormous pressure. She rose to the occasion, edging Titmus to win gold. She was also a key part of Australia’s freestyle and freestyle gold-medal winning teams.
O’Callaghan and Titmus, who is on a season-long break, share the 10 fastest times in history. “It’s a really tough thing to take on. You feel once you become an Olympic champion, you’re expected to perform every single meet,” said Titmus, who was commentating on the race.
“And athletes, of course, we’re incredible at what we do, but we’re also humans first, and I think it’s really important to let people in on that. I know exactly how Mollie feels.” O’Callaghan has also qualified for the 50m and 100m backstroke but is yet to decide whether she will race them in Singapore, with the 50 and 100m free, along with the relays, also on her radar.

Scheffler set for ‘hardest’ test at Oakmont for US Open,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320261-scheffler-set-for-hardest-test-at-oakmont-for-us-open,"Oakmont, United States: World number one Scottie Scheffler said Wednesday the formidable Oakmont course could provide “the hardest” challenge of his career at the 125th US Open this week.
Lightning-fast sloped greens combined with deep, dense rough and bunkers designed to leave balls along the edges had many players calling it the toughest layout they have faced as Oakmont hosts a record 10th US Open.
“This is probably the hardest golf course that we’ll play, maybe ever,” said Scheffler, who won last month’s PGA Championship for his third major title, ahead of Thursday’s opening round. Second-ranked Rory McIlroy, who won the Masters in April to complete a career Grand Slam, called Oakmont a “big brute” and added: “You’re going to have to have your wits about you this week all the way.”
Not since American Jordan Spieth captured the 2015 Masters and US Open has anyone won consecutive majors, but two-time Masters winner Scheffler is on a hot streak. Scheffler has won three of his past four starts, matching a PGA Tour record for low 72-hole total to take the Byron Nelson and defending his Memorial title 10 days ago in addition to his major triumph.
“He’s in the middle of every fairway,” third-ranked Xander Schauffele said of Scheffler. “It takes a serious amount of discipline to play away from pins and hit really good shots to safe targets, and that’s what it takes to play well at US Opens.”
Three-time major winner Spieth said most players will pitch onto fairways from the thick rough rather than try to blast out short of the green. “It magnifies once you make a mistake if you don’t play the right shot,” Spieth said. “It may cost you half a shot to get back in the fairway a little further up.
“They give you more green here to entice you into doing more than you should. There’s some risk-reward on this place. You’ve got to avoid compounding mistakes for sure.” Finding the fairway is crucial, McIlroy said. “Decent lies in the rough are few and far between,” McIlroy said. “You don’t want to ride your luck on this golf course.
“You hit the ball in the rough and you’re not going to have any control of your ball going into the green, especially these greens that are pitched away from you. “You have to be able to spin the ball going into these greens if you want it to finish anywhere close to where you want.”
And sometimes the rough just wins. “I had some lies that were not playable,” fourth-ranked Collin Morikawa said of his time in the rough during practice rounds. “There was no loft.”
Scheffler, who turns 29 the Saturday after the tournament, made his major debut at Oakmont at the 2016 US Open, missing the cut as a 19-year-old amateur with his older sister Callie serving as his caddie.
One year later, Scheffler was low amateur at the US Open and five years after that, he was a Masters champion. “I remember coming here and thinking it was really fun, really cool to be able to play in the US Open,” Scheffler said. “But what I really remembered was coming back the next year and ... finishing low am.”
Scheffler also recalled rushing off the course to watch game six of the 2016 NBA Finals, when LeBron James led Cleveland to victory on the way to taking the title over Stephen Curry and Golden State.

A step too far? New Club World Cup set to have far-reaching impact on football,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320263-a-step-too-far-new-club-world-cup-set-to-have-far-reaching-impact-on-football,"PARIS: FIFA’s expanded Club World Cup which gets underway in the United States this weekend is a controversial addition to the global football calendar and one that could have a far-reaching impact on the sport in the years to come.
The 32-team tournament, with one billion dollars in prize money on offer, has been crammed into an already overloaded schedule leading to concerns it will push elite players to breaking point.
It also threatens to upset the balance of domestic and continental club competitions, giving competing teams huge financial advantages over rivals. Consider the leading clubs in Europe, which is sending 12 teams including Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea.
The chances are high that some will go deep into the Club World Cup, with a maximum of seven games to be played up to the July 13 final. The riches on offer are extraordinary, up to a possible $125 million for the top-performing European team.
“The Club World Cup model affects the ecosystem of national leagues, especially in Europe,” Javier Tebas, the president of Spain’s La Liga, told radio station Cadena Cope. But while the likes of Liverpool and Barcelona will not be in the United States and so will miss out on the cash prizes, they will be able to give players a much-needed rest.
“I think it will have a huge impact and it will give Liverpool and Arsenal a huge advantage in the next season to not be there,” said England manager Thomas Tuchel when asked about the consequences for the Premier League.
- Lavish sums -
Those clubs are already among the world’s wealthiest without taking into account the sums being lavished by FIFA, but what about teams elsewhere.
It will become harder for clubs in South Africa to challenge Mamelodi Sundowns once they leave with a guaranteed minimum of almost $10 million -- the equivalent of the prize money for winning nine domestic titles.
The amateurs of Auckland City already dominate in Oceania before being handed over $3.5 million just as an appearance fee.
But if taking part here will be perhaps the ultimate career highlight for their players, it just adds to the demands on those at top clubs.
The introduction of the competition was met with opposition in Europe, and global players union FIFPro has warned that the wellbeing of many of its members is being threatened by the huge workload they face.
- Too many games? -
Portugal midfielder Vitinha has played 52 matches for PSG this season, including the Champions League final win over Inter Milan on May 31.
There have also been eight games for Portugal, including the Nations League finals last week. Now he is off to the United States with PSG, with potentially no holiday until mid-July. The next French season is then due to start in mid-August, at the same time as the Premier League and La Liga.
And at the end of next season Vitinha should be back in North America with Portugal at the expanded 48-team World Cup. Such demands on leading stars are why player unions in Europe last year raised the threat of strike action in a bid to cut down on the number of matches.
“The problem is the accumulation of excessively long and intense seasons back to back,” said Maheta Molango, chief executive of England’s Professional Footballers’ Association.
“Players don’t think just about the summer, they think about how they are not going to have a holiday for the foreseeable future.” Meanwhile, domestic leagues do not see why they should change to accommodate FIFA’s new tournament.
“International organisations and especially FIFA have increased the number of matches they organise, so now we have a calendar that is beyond saturation,” said Mathieu Moreuil of the Premier League.
Other competitions are being devalued because the Club World Cup is taking place at the same time, like the CONCACAF Gold Cup, also being played in the United States. USA coach Mauricio Pochettino is unable to call on leading players like Weston McKennie and Timothy Weah because they are at the Club World Cup with Juventus.
“That is the circumstance that we have and we need to adapt,” said Pochettino, the former PSG coach who may disagree with the view of Luis Enrique, currently in charge of the French side.

Australia topple South Africa’s top order in WTC final fight back,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320265-australia-topple-south-africa-s-top-order-in-wtc-final-fight-back,"LONDON: South Africa were reeling on 43-4 at stumps on the first day of the World Test Championship final at Lord’s on Wednesday after earlier dismissing defending champions Australia for 212.
Seamer Kagiso Rabada took 5-51 as South Africa’s bowling unit made a strong start to the contest but their inexperienced batting line-up came under fire immediately when they began their reply.
The Reuters Daily Briefing newsletter provides all the news you need to start your day. Sign up here. Australia’s fast bowling attack proved as fearsome as anything South Africa had to offer and by the end of play they were firmly in command.
South Africa trail Australia by 169 runs after a day on which 14 wickets fell and captain Temba Bavuma (3) and David Bedingham (8) will resume on Thursday with a daunting task ahead.
A see-saw contest started with South Africa’s decision to put Australia in to bat in a calculated gamble on a good pitch but with cloudy conditions that Bavuma sought to capitalise on.
It was vindicated as Rabada and Marco Jansen took two wickets each to leave the defending WTC champions struggling at 67-4 at lunch, with Marnus Labuschagne’s first innings as an opener ending after 17 runs and the returning Cameron Green lasting only three balls.
But when the sun came out at the start of the second session, Steve Smith and Beau Webster put together 79 runs for the fifth wicket before Smith was dismissed by part-time spinner Aiden Markram for 66.
It was the sole wicket to fall in the middle session as Australia advanced to 190-5 at tea, only for fortunes to swing back South Africa’s way at the start of the evening session. They took Australia’s last five wickets for 22 runs in 6.4 overs.
Keshav Maharaj bowled Alex Carey (23) attempting an injudicious switch, followed by a pair of wickets for Rabada who removed Pat Cummins for a single run and induced Webster into a thick edge with some extra bounce. Webster top scored with a test best of 72 in only his fourth appearance for Australia.
Jansen bowled Nathan Lyon to end with figures of 3-49 and then Rabada completed his five-wicket haul by castling Mitchell Starc.
South Africa came in to bat with 90 minutes left in the day’s play and lost Markram in their first over as he chopped the ball onto his boot and then onto the stumps to give Starc a first wicket. He then snagged Ryan Rickelton (16), encouraged into a drive and well caught by Usman Khawaja at first slip, as South Africa fell to 19-2.

PCB confirms no change in selection committee,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320266-pcb-confirms-no-change-in-selection-committee,"ISLAMABAD: In a firm and unequivocal move, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has dispelled all speculation surrounding a potential overhaul of the national selection committee. Putting an end to swirling rumors and lobbying efforts, the Board has confirmed that the current selection panel-intact and unchanged-will continue to steer Pakistan’s cricketing future, having already been in action for over eight months.
The panel, comprising former Test stalwarts Aaqib Javed, Aleem Dar, Asad Shafiq, and Azhar Ali, will maintain their strategic roles. As per the established structure, these selectors will collaborate closely with the head coach and the respective format captain before finalizing squads for upcoming international commitments.
In recent weeks, whispers of a committee reshuffle had gained traction across various cricketing circles, fueled by lobbying from different factions. However, the PCB has firmly rebutted these reports, stating that no changes to the core selection committee were ever under active consideration.
“The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has confirmed that the national selection committee remains intact,” read the official statement issued by the Board’s spokesperson.  The only minor adjustment announced involves the data analytics wing. Hassan Cheema, who previously served as the selection committee’s data analyst, has been replaced by Usman Hashmi. The PCB emphasized that the data analyst’s role is purely advisory, with no voting rights during selection discussions.
According to internal sources, Aaqib Javed-who now also serves as the Director of High Performance—was particularly keen on retaining his seat at the selection table. His dual responsibility, especially in nurturing upcoming talent through the High Performance Centre, makes his continued presence on the committee both logical and impactful.
“Since Aaqib will be closely working with emerging players, he wants to ensure their progress and readiness for the international stage is duly recognized,” a PCB insider revealed. “He believes his advocacy for talented youngsters will remain incomplete unless he has a voice in the selection process. This continuity strengthens the bridge between player development and national representation.”
The committee is now gearing up to finalize Pakistan’s squad for the upcoming three-match away series against Bangladesh, tentatively scheduled for next month. With the selection process continuing uninterrupted and the system now better integrated with performance development, the PCB aims to align talent identification with long-term strategy. In times of frequent administrative upheaval, the Board’s decision to prioritize stability and continuity could prove pivotal as Pakistan prepares for a packed international calendar.

PCB grants NOCs to 13 players for overseas leagues,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320267-pcb-grants-nocs-to-13-players-for-overseas-leagues,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has issued No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to 13 national players, clearing the way for their participation in a host of overseas franchise tournaments until the end of 2025.
The move comes amid a broader realignment of Pakistan’s white-ball setup, with several top stars making their return to the global T20 circuit. The high-profile trio of Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Shah Afridi—all absent from Pakistan’s recent T20I series against Bangladesh—are now confirmed entries for the upcoming Big Bash League (BBL) Draft on June 19, with their NOCs valid from December 14 to 28.
Among others:
Mohammad Amir has received clearance to continue for Essex in the T20 Blast through July 18. Haris Rauf is all set to feature in the Major League Cricket (MLC) 2025 season starting this week.
Shan Masood, Pakistan’s Test captain, has been cleared to play County Championship cricket for Leicestershire until September 1. A host of pacers also received extended County clearances:
Mohammad Abbas (until July 2),
Hasan Ali (until September 30),
Khurram Shahzad (until September 27).
Additionally, Mohammad Nawaz has been granted NOCs for both the Guyana Super League and the Caribbean Premier League (CPL), while youngster Khawaja Nafay will take part in the Global Super League, signaling confidence in his international readiness.

WTA gives ranking protection for players who freeze eggs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320268-wta-gives-ranking-protection-for-players-who-freeze-eggs,"LONDON: Women tennis players who take time out of the game to freeze eggs or embryos will have their ranking protected, the WTA Tour announced on Wednesday.
Players ranked from one to 750 in singles or doubles who spend at least 10 consecutive weeks out of competition for a “fertility protection procedure” are eligible. The ranking can be used to enter up to three tournaments but the policy does not apply to the premier 1000 events.
The special ranking will be based on the 12-week average of a player’s WTA ranking from eight weeks prior to the start of their out-of-competition period. Sloane Stephens, the 2017 US Open champion, told the BBC the rule will reduce the pressure on players to return to the court too quickly.
Stephens said she had twice previously used the off-season to freeze her eggs. The 32-year-old said in the WTA statement that she was “incredibly proud of our sport in recognising the importance of fertility treatments for female athletes”.
“For any woman, the conversation of family life versus a career is nuanced and complex,” she said. “The WTA has now created a safe space for players to explore options and to make the best decisions for themselves.”
The WTA said in a statement that the “Fertility Protection Special Entry Ranking Rule” would enhance the existing package of benefits to help players combine family life with tennis. WTA CEO Portia Archer said: “We understand that professional athletes can face a dilemma between focusing on their career and starting a family, and we are committed to supporting WTA players as they navigate and balance the choices associated with career and family.” .

Misbah-ul-Haq in consideration for Test head coach role,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320269-misbah-ul-haq-in-consideration-for-test-head-coach-role,"LAHORE: Misbah-ul-Haq, former national captain and head coach, is reportedly being considered for a return as Pakistan’s Test head coach, even as questions swirl around the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) recruitment transparency.
Sources confirm that Misbah, who last held dual roles as head coach and chief selector from 2019 to 2021, has expressed serious interest in leading Pakistan’s red-ball squad. However, insiders note that Misbah is troubled by the lack of clarity in the current appointment process.
According to those familiar with the matter, interviews and meetings have taken place, but the PCB has yet to issue official guidance to the selection committee or coaching staff. This silence has led to growing concern within cricketing circles about the decision-making vacuum.

PCB plans Tri-Nation T20 series with Afghanistan and UAE,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320270-pcb-plans-tri-nation-t20-series-with-afghanistan-and-uae,"LAHORE: In a strategic push to enhance T20I readiness ahead of the 2025 Asia Cup and T20 World Cup, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is reportedly working to convert its scheduled bilateral series with Afghanistan into a three-nation series, with UAE likely to join as the third team and host.
Originally slated for three T20Is between Pakistan and Afghanistan in August, the series may now be staged as a tri-nation tournament, offering all participants a broader competitive platform in conditions comparable to those expected at the Asia Cup—widely anticipated to be held in the UAE.
The UAE, which recently defeated Bangladesh 2-1 in a home T20I series, is being seen as a rapidly improving side, and its inclusion would not only diversify the opposition for Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also provide valuable match practice in neutral conditions.
While official confirmation is pending, insiders suggest that the proposed change is on track, with fixtures, venues, and dates likely to be announced in coordination with Afghanistan and UAE boards. If confirmed, the tournament would inject vital momentum and competitive edge into Pakistan’s pre-Asia Cup preparations.

Pakistan pacers rise in ICC T20I Rankings,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320271-pakistan-pacers-rise-in-icc-t20i-rankings,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s bowlers have made notable strides in the latest ICC T20I rankings, riding high on recent strong performances in international matches. Haris Rauf and Abbas Afridi have surged into joint 18th place, each accumulating 605 rating points, highlighting their growing influence in Pakistan’s pace arsenal.
Shaheen Shah Afridi also gained ground, moving up to 35th spot with 552 points, while vice-captain Shadab Khan and spinner Abrar Ahmed have climbed to joint 58th, both securing 476 points. In contrast, promising youngsters Naseem Shah and Sufiyan Muqeem saw their rankings dip, slipping to 92nd and 95th, respectively.
At the top of the bowling charts, New Zealand’s Jacob Duffy leads the global pack, followed by Adil Rashid of England and India’s Varun Chakaravarthy. In the batting department, Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan have maintained their consistent form, holding on to 12th and 13th positions, respectively. Mohammad Haris remains steady at 30th, but Hasan Nawaz and Saim Ayub have dropped to 46th and 62nd. The T20I skipper (unnamed in the release) slid to 76th, and Fakhar Zaman edged down to 87th.

How teams have qualified for the Club World Cup,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320272-how-teams-have-qualified-for-the-club-world-cup,"PARIS: The new-look FIFA Club World Cup kicks off in the United States this weekend with 32 teams from around the globe taking part.
With 12 representatives, Europe is sending more teams than any other continent, followed by South America with six. Asia and Africa both have four competing teams, as does the CONCACAF region of North and Central America and the Caribbean.
In addition, there is one club from Oceania while the line-up is completed by a representative from the host nation. There are two ways of qualifying for the tournament, which football’s world governing body now intends to stage every four years -- either as continental champions or via a club ranking based on performances in continental competitions over a four-year period.
FIFA’s expanded Club World Cup which gets underway in the United States this weekend is a controversial addition to the global football calendar and one that could have a far-reaching impact on the sport in the years to come.
The 32-team tournament, with one billion dollars in prize money on offer, has been crammed into an already overloaded schedule leading to concerns it will push elite players to breaking point.
It also threatens to upset the balance of domestic and continental club competitions, giving competing teams huge financial advantages over rivals. Consider the leading clubs in Europe, which is sending 12 teams including Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Manchester City and Chelsea.
The chances are high that some will go deep into the Club World Cup, with a maximum of seven games to be played up to the July 13 final.
— Continental champions- The following 16 teams qualified as continental champions over the period from 2021 to 2024:
UEFA Champions League winners: Chelsea (ENG/2021), Real Madrid (ESP/2022 and 2024), Manchester City (ENG/2023)
Copa Libertadores winners: Palmeiras (BRA/2021), Flamengo (BRA/2022), Fluminense (BRA/2023), Botafogo (BRA/2024)
AFC Champions League winners: Al Hilal (KSA/2021), Urawa Red Diamonds (JPN/2022), Al Ain (UAE/2023 and 2024)
CONCACAF Champions League winners: Monterrey (MEX/2021), Seattle Sounders (USA/2022), Pachuca (MEX/2024)
CAF Champions League winners: Al Ahly (EGY/2021, 2023 and 2024), Wydad Casablanca (MAR/2022)
OFC Champions League winners: Auckland City (NZL/2022, 2023 and 2024)
— Best four-year rankings -
The following 14 teams qualified via their performances in continental club competitions over the last four years:
Europe: Bayern Munich (GER), Paris Saint-Germain (FRA), Borussia Dortmund (GER), Inter Milan (ITA), Porto (POR), Atletico Madrid (ESP), Benfica (POR), Juventus (ITA), Red Bull Salzburg (AUT)
South America: River Plate (ARG), Boca Juniors (ARG)
Asia: Ulsan HD (KOR)
Africa: Esperance (TUN), Mamelodi Sundowns (RSA)
— Host representatives -
That leaves two berths, both of which have gone to teams who will be playing on home turf.
Perhaps conveniently for FIFA as they look to get eyeballs on their new competition, Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami are the designated representatives of the host nation.
That is after they won the Supporters Shield for being the best performing side during the 2024 MLS regular season -- even though LA Galaxy went on to win the MLS Cup to determine the overall champions.
Los Angeles FC claimed the last spot with a 2-1 extra-time victory against Club America of Mexico in a play-in match at the end of last month. The spot became available following FIFA’s decision to ban Mexican club Leon from the tournament. Leon were barred because the club is owned by Grupo Pachuca, which also controls Liga MX side Pachuca, who are also taking part.

Turkiye to export 48 fighter jets to Indonesia: Erdogan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320351-turkiye-to-export-48-fighter-jets-to-indonesia-erdogan,"ANKARA: Ankara has agreed a deal to export 48 Turkish-made fighter jets to Indonesia, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced on Wednesday. Turkiye´s defence sector, including the famous Bayraktar drones, accounts for a significant share of the country´s export revenues.
“As part of the agreement signed with our friendly and brotherly country, Indonesia, 48 Kaan (fighter jets) will be produced in Turkiye and exported to Indonesia,” Erdogan wrote on X. The contract, valued at 10 billion dollars, includes the production and delivery of the Kaan fighter jets to Indonesia over a ten-year period, according to Turkish media. The deal also includes a technology transfer to Indonesia, Turkish broadcaster TRT Haber reported.

Writer first to die under Italy fast-track assisted suicide law,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320352-writer-first-to-die-under-italy-fast-track-assisted-suicide-law,"ROME: A writer suffering from Parkinson´s disease has become the first to die through medically assisted suicide under a fast-track regional law in Italy, campaigners said on Wednesday.
Daniele Pieroni died at home on May 17, three months after the new legislation was passed by regional authorities in Tuscany, the pro-euthanasia Luca Coscioni Association said. The Italian Constitutional Court ruled in September 2019 that assisted suicide was allowed for patients in certain circumstances. But the national parliament has yet to adopt any legislation, which means that obtaining permission to die is difficult and can take years. In February, Tuscany -- ruled by the centre left -- became the first of Italy´s 20 regions to set out its own rules streamlining and speeding up the request process.

Eight dead as migrants forced off boat near Djibouti: IOM,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320353-eight-dead-as-migrants-forced-off-boat-near-djibouti-iom,"ADDIS ABABA: At least eight people died and 22 were missing after smugglers forced migrants to disembark from a boat in the Red Sea, the UN´s migration agency said on Wednesday.
The boat had around 150 passengers when it was stopped by the smugglers who were carrying them last Thursday, forcing them to disembark midway through their journey. “The passengers were left to swim for their lives in open water,” the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said in a statement. Each year, thousands of African migrants brave the “Eastern Route” across the Red Sea from Djibouti to Yemen in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries.
Last year, the IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the route, with 462 resulting from shipwrecks.

French teens on trial in France over rape of Jewish girl,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320354-french-teens-on-trial-in-france-over-rape-of-jewish-girl,"PARIS: Three French boys went on trial on Wednesday charged with the gang rape of a 12-year-old Jewish girl in 2024 outside Paris, a crime that shocked the Jewish community at a time of rising anti-Semitic attacks.
The trial, which is due to last until Friday, is being held at a juvenile court in Nanterre, a suburb of western Paris.
Two boys, aged 13 at the time, are being tried on charges of the gang rape of a minor on religious grounds.
The third, then aged 12, is accused of being complicit in the crime. All three boys are charged with sexual assault on a minor as well as recording and sharing sexual images, aggravated by being committed on religious grounds.

Afghan knife attack suspect faces German psychiatric detention,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320355-afghan-knife-attack-suspect-faces-german-psychiatric-detention,"FRANKFURT, Germany: An Afghan man suspected of stabbing to death two people, including a two-year-old boy, in a German park should be permanently placed in a psychiatric hospital, prosecutors recommended on Wednesday.
Germany was stunned by January´s attack on a play school group in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg, one of a spate of bloody incidents that fuelled a heated immigration debate ahead of elections.
After concluding their investigation, prosecutors said that, based on a medical examination, “it can be assumed that the accused was not criminally responsible” for the attack “due to a psychiatric illness”.

"UK to tackle asylum backlog, saving ‘£1 bn a year’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320356-uk-to-tackle-asylum-backlog-saving-1-bn-a-year,"LONDON: Britain´s Labour government pledged to cut a backlog in asylum applications and end “the costly use of hotels to house asylum seekers”, saving £1 billion ($1.3 billion) annually, finance minister Rachel Reeves announced on Wednesday.
“Funding that I have provided today... will cut the asylum backlog, hear more appeal cases and return people who have no rights to be here, saving the taxpayer a billion pounds a year,” Reeves said in her Spending Review that sets out Treasury expenditure and savings over the next few years.
The number of UK asylum seekers has risen sharply in recent years, with tens of thousands of applications waiting to be decided, according to official figures.
Labour, which came to power last July, has set about tackling the situation.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer has started formal talks with unspecified countries to create “return centres” outside the UK for those who have exhausted all legal avenues to remain in the country.
The number of asylum seekers in the UK tripled to 84,200 in 2024 from an average of 27,500 between 2011 and 2020.
In 2022, there were approximately 13 asylum applications per 10,000 people in the UK, compared with 25 asylum applications per 10,000 people in the European Union at the same time.
Some 11 percent of migrants in the UK were asylum seekers or refugees in 2023 -- almost twice as high as the 2019 figure of six percent.

"Despite progress, world still had 138m child labourers in 2024: UN",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320357-despite-progress-world-still-had-138m-child-labourers-in-2024-un,"UNITED NATIONS, United States: Nearly 138 million children were still working in the world´s fields and factories in 2024, the United Nations said on Wednesday, warning that given the slow pace of progress, eliminating child labour could be delayed by “hundreds of years.”
Ten years ago, upon adopting the so-called Sustainable Development Goals, the world´s countries set themselves the ambitious target of putting an end to child labor by 2025.
“That timeline has now come to an end. But child labor has not,” Unicef and the International Labor Organization (ILO) said in a joint report.
Last year 137.6 million children ages 5-17 were working, or approximately 7.8 percent of all children in that age group, according to data published every four years. The figure is equivalent to twice the total population of France.
This nevertheless represents a drop since 2000, when 246 million children were forced to work, often to help their impoverished families.
After a worrying rise between 2016 and 2020, the trend has now reversed, with 20 million fewer children working in 2024 than four years prior.
“Significant progress” has been recorded in reducing the number of children forced into labor, Unicef chief Catherine Russell said. “Yet far too many children continue to toil in mines, factories or fields, often doing hazardous work to survive.”

"Musk regrets some of his Trump criticisms, says they ‘went too far’",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320358-musk-regrets-some-of-his-trump-criticisms-says-they-went-too-far,"WASHINGTON: Elon Musk, the world´s richest person and Donald Trump´s former adviser, said on Wednesday he regretted some of his recent criticisms of the US president, after the pair´s public falling-out last week.
“I regret some of my posts about President @realDonaldTrump last week. They went too far,” Musk wrote on his social media platform X.
Musk´s expression of regret came just days after Trump threatened the tech billionaire with “serious consequences” if he sought to punish Republicans who vote for a controversial spending bill.
Their blistering break-up -- largely carried out on social media before a riveted public since Thursday last week -- was ignited by Musk´s harsh criticism of Trump´s so-called “big, beautiful” spending bill, which is currently before Congress.
Some lawmakers who were against the bill had called on Musk -- one of the Republican Party´s biggest financial backers in last year´s presidential election -- to fund primary challenges against Republicans who voted for the legislation.
“He´ll have to pay very serious consequences if he does that,” Trump, who also branded Musk “disrespectful,” told NBC News on Saturday, without specifying what those consequences would be. Trump also said he had “no” desire to repair his relationship with the South African-born Tesla and SpaceX chief, and that he has “no intention of speaking to him.”
In his post on Wednesday, Musk did not specify which of his criticisms of Trump had gone “too far.”

Kosovo says agreed to host migrants deported from US,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320359-kosovo-says-agreed-to-host-migrants-deported-from-us,"PRISTINA: Kosovo has agreed to an American request to host migrants deported from the United States, the Balkan nation´s caretaker Prime Minister Albin Kurti said on Wednesday.
In a message posted on Facebook, Kurti said Kosovo would “within a one-year period, accept and shelter up to 50 individuals to facilitate their safe return to their country of origin”.
Kosovo is the first in the Balkans to officially respond to the US request for the acceptance and relocation of third-country nationals on its territory.
The announcement comes after days of protests in California against US President Donald Trump´s hard-line immigration policy.
It also follows the signing of an agreement between Kosovo and Denmark to receive foreign prisoners convicted by Denmark, who will serve their sentences in a Kosovar prison.
“The selection of these individuals (deported migrants) will be made from a proposed list, provided that they meet the specified criteria related to the rule of law and public order,” Kurti said.
“During their stay in Kosovo, they will act in accordance with the applicable legislation and enjoy the rights determined by our laws.”
The interim government said the United States remained an “unwavering ally” to Kosovo, the pair having had close ties since the 1990s war for independence from Serbia.

France school stabbing suspect said wanted to kill campus monitor: prosecutor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320361-france-school-stabbing-suspect-said-wanted-to-kill-campus-monitor-prosecutor,"CHAUMONT, France: A 14-year-old French pupil detained over the killing of a teaching assistant said he had wanted to attack “any” adult school monitor after he was reprimanded for kissing his girlfriend, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.
“He said he acted in such a manner because he could no longer stand the behaviour of monitors in general,” the prosecutor in the northeastern town of Chaumont, Denis Devallois, told reporters after the stabbing on Tuesday.
Devallois said the teenager did not appear to suffer from any “mental disorder”, but added the self-described fan of “violent video games” appeared “detached” and expressed “no regret” during questioning.
“He said there was perhaps a link with the fact he was told off by a monitor on Friday, June 6, as he was kissing his girlfriend on school grounds. He said this monitor was not the one that became a victim on Tuesday.”
“He stated that he had, as early as the next day, Saturday, mulled over a plan to kill a monitor, in his own words, ´any one of them´,” the prosecutor added.

Fire at Iran petrochemical plant kills three,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320362-fire-at-iran-petrochemical-plant-kills-three,"TEHRAN: A fire broke out at a petrochemical complex in southern Iran on Wednesday, killing at least three people, state television reported.
“Given the scale of the incident, the number of injuries and deaths is likely to increase,” the broadcaster added, airing images of smoke rising from the Kaveh Petrochemical Complex in Bushehr province, 1,200-kms south of Tehran.
The governor of Dayyer county, Alireza Sajadi, told the television that the fire had broken out in the complex´s dedicated port but “has been contained”.

US favourability tumbles since Trump return: global survey,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320363-us-favourability-tumbles-since-trump-return-global-survey,"WASHINGTON: The image of the United States has deteriorated sharply in much of the world since President Donald Trump´s return, with low marks both on his character and policies, a global survey said on Wednesday.
The Pew Research Centre found that favourability of the United States has dropped in 15 of the 24 countries surveyed.
Trump received his lowest marks in neighbouring Mexico, which he has long disparaged and pressed on migration, with 91 per cent of Mexicans saying they did not have confidence Trump would do the right thing on world affairs.
Trump led to a downward shift in perceptions of the United States as a whole.
In both Mexico and fellow neighbour Canada, which Trump has provocatively said should be the 51st US state, majorities now see the United States unfavourably after seeing the country favourably last year when Joe Biden was president.
Views of the United States also darkened in most of Europe, with an especially sharp drop in Poland, a frontline ally of Ukraine, as Trump reduces US support for Kyiv and seeks a negotiated solution with Russia. Sweden, which entered Nato under Biden in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, gave the worst marks to the United States among all publics surveyed, with 79 percent having a negative opinion of the country.
The survey found that on average majorities from all countries surveyed disagreed with all of Trump´s key global policies including on Ukraine, Gaza, immigration and climate change.
Eighty per cent called Trump arrogant and only 28 percent found him honest.
Israel, which has enjoyed robust support from its ally in the Gaza war, had the most favourable opinion of the United States at 83 percent, a notch higher under Trump.
Views of the United States remained positive in Nigeria and Kenya -- which historically have given high marks to the United States no matter who is president -- and India saw little change, with more than half seeing the United States favorably. Since returning to office, Trump has pursued one of the most sweeping agendas of any US president which has included eviscerating foreign aid and aggressively deporting migrants.
Nonetheless, the global perceptions of Trump, while negative, were not as bad as they were in 2017 when he first entered the White House.
Trump in the first term succeeded Barack Obama, who remained wildly popular in most of the world.
This time, he followed Joe Biden, whose marks were similar to Trump´s globally on the issue of the economy, according to Janell Fetterolf, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Centre. The past decade has also seen the growing normalization of right-wing populists.
In Brazil, which Trump´s ideological ally Jair Bolsonaro led from 2019 through 2022, Trump has the confidence this year of 34 percent of the public -- low, but well above the 14 percent he had when he started his first term.
Across the world, Trump consistently enjoyed more support from men than women and was seen more favorably by people on the right of the political spectrum.
But the study also showed the limits of his international appeal.
In both Sweden and France, Trump failed to win confidence of a majority of backers of far-right nationalist parties, although they were more supportive than the general public.

US preparing to partially evacuate Iraq embassy over regional security risks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320364-us-preparing-to-partially-evacuate-iraq-embassy-over-regional-security-risks,"WASHINGTON/BAGHDAD: The United States is preparing a partial evacuation of its Iraqi embassy and will allow military dependents to leave locations around the Middle East due to heightened security risks in the region, US and Iraqi sources said on Wednesday.
The four US and two Iraqi sources did not specify which security risks had prompted the decision and reports of the potential evacuation pushed up oil prices by more than 4 per cent.
“The State Department regularly reviews American personnel abroad and this decision was made as a result of a recent review,” White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly told Reuters when asked about reports of the partial evacuations, without giving further details. A White House official said US President Donald Trump was aware of the move.
The partial evacuations come at a moment of heightened tensions in a region already aflame after 18 months of war in Gaza that has raised fears of a wider conflagration pitting the US and Israel against Iran and its allies.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to strike Iran if stuttering talks over its nuclear programme fail and on Wednesday he said he was growing less confident that Tehran would agree to stop enriching uranium, a key American demand.
Iranian Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh also said on Wednesday that Iran would retaliate against US bases in the region if the nuclear talks failed and it was subjected to strikes. The United States has a military presence in Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has authorized the voluntary departure of military dependents from locations across the Middle East, a US official said. Another US official said that was mostly relevant to family members located in Bahrain -- where the bulk of them are based.

Guantanamo inmates accuse UK of ‘complicity’ in CIA torture,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320367-guantanamo-inmates-accuse-uk-of-complicity-in-cia-torture,"LONDON: Lawyers for two Guantanamo detainees accused UK intelligence agencies in court on Wednesday of being “complicit” in CIA torture following the 9/11 attacks, notably by using information obtained during interrogations.
The trial in London, described as “unprecedented” by UK-based anti-torture organisation Redress, is being held before the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), the judicial body that handles complaints against British intelligence agencies, and runs until Friday.
Redress initiated proceedings with a 2021 complaint against several agencies, including MI5 and MI6 -- the domestic and foreign intelligence services -- for their “possible involvement” in the torture of Mustapha al-Hawsawi.
The question is whether the agencies were “complicit” with the CIA by “providing questions or information” to US agents for use during Al-Hawsawi´s interrogations, or by “receiving information” obtained during his interrogations, Redress lawyer Edward Craven told court.
Hawsawi was captured in Pakistan in 2003, accused by the Americans of participating in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States.
The Saudi national, born in 1968, is still being held at the US military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba more than two decades later. “There is no doubt that he was subjected to the most brutal torture,” the lawyer said, citing waterboarding, sleep deprivation and rape. He was held in secret CIA detention facilities, known as “black sites”, in Afghanistan, Lithuania, Morocco and Romania, said Craven.

Police make arrests in Los Angeles during nighttime curfew,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320368-police-make-arrests-in-los-angeles-during-nighttime-curfew,"LOS ANGELES, United States: Downtown Los Angeles was largely calm overnight into Wednesday, with police arresting at least 25 people for violating a curfew after a fifth day of protests against President Donald Trump´s immigration crackdown.
Heavily armed security officers, including several riding horses, patrolled near government buildings, while men boarded up storefronts after dark on Tuesday to protect against vandalism.
Looting and vandalism in the second-biggest US city have marred the largely peaceful protests over ramped-up arrests by immigration authorities. The demonstrations, which began on Friday, and isolated acts of violence prompted Trump to take the extraordinary step of sending in troops, over the objection of the state governor.
One protester told AFP the arrest of migrants in a city with large immigrant and Latino populations was the root of the unrest.
“I don´t think that part of the problem is the peaceful protests. It´s whatever else is happening on the other side that is inciting violence,” she said on Tuesday.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said the curfew -- meant to stop vandalism and looting -- was in effect within one square mile of the city´s more-than-500 square mile area from 8:00 pm and 6:00 am (0300 to 1300 GMT).
That zone was off-limits for everyone apart from residents, journalists and emergency services, she added. Protests against immigration arrests by federal law enforcement have also sprung up in cities around the country, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, San Francisco and Austin.
Meanwhile, the White House said on Wednesday President Donald Trump would not allow “mob rule” after protests against his immigration policies spread across the United States despite a military-backed crackdown in Los Angeles.
Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt also attacked the Democratic governor of California and mayor of Los Angeles, claiming they had “fanned the flames” of the clashes.
“President Trump will never allow mob rule to prevail in America,” Leavitt told a briefing at the White House, backed by television screens showing images of burning vehicles and masked rioters.
“The most basic duty of government is to preserve law and order, and this administration embraces that sacred responsibility.”
Leavitt´s comments echoed Trump´s in a speech at the Fort Bragg military base on Tuesday, in which he vowed to “liberate” Los Angeles and branded the protesters “animals.”
Trump is in conflict with California authorities who have accused the Republican president of being “dictatorial” and seeking political gain by sending in thousands of troops to break up the protests, which have largely been peaceful.
“Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass shamefully failed to meet their sworn obligations to their citizens,” Leavitt responded, accusing Newsom of having “fanned the flames and demonized our brave ICE officers.”
