Bumrah to feature in three Tests against Eng
India strike bowler Jasprit Bumrah expects to feature in only three matches of the five-Test series against England as he manages his workload following a back injury.
The 31-year-old has taken 205 Test wickets at a stunning average of under 20 apiece, with his unique action and ability to generate sharp pace off a short run making him especially difficult to face.
But he suffered a back injury during the final match of India's 3-1 series loss in Australia, in January.
And with five Tests in less than seven weeks, starting at Headingley on Friday, Bumrah is concerned to maintain peak fitness as India bid for their first series win in England since 2007.
""The body is feeling good, no issues, no complaints,"" the fast bowler told Sky Sports.
""I have to be smart as well as I am not becoming younger by the day. I have to take care of my body as I would love to play for longer and contribute in all three formats. ""The first is definitely going to happen, the rest we see how things are, what is the workload, what are the scenarios. Hopefully in the games I play I give my absolute best.""
Bumrah has taken 60 wickets at an average of 22.16 in 14 Tests against England.

Govt comes under attack in NA for ignoring agri sector,"US
Rana Hayat proposed the creation of a special House committee to focus on the problems faced by farmers
Lawmakers from the treasury and opposition benches on Thursday welcomed improved economic indicators and emphasized the need for bipartisan efforts to sustain economic progress and promote inclusive growth.
Resuming the budget debate, Raja Qamar-ul-Islam of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) praised the budget as historic and lauded the role of Pakistan's armed forces in sending a firm message to India. He expressed confidence that the budget 2025-26 would pave the way for sustainable economic growth in the country.
Amir Dogar of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) criticized the government for overlooking the agriculture sector and called for raising the minimum wage to Rs 50,000.
Atif Khan of SIC criticized the budget and stressed relief measures for the poor segment of society.
Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) legislator Shagufta Jumani appreciated the government for allocating significant funds to the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
She also urged the government to allocate dedicated funds for polio eradication, emphasizing the importance of sustained public health efforts.
Rana Hayat proposed the creation of a special House committee to focus on the problems faced by farmers, a vital segment of the economy.
MNA Usama Ahmed Mela, emphasizing the critical role of agriculture in national development, called on the government to provide incentives for farmers, including subsidies for fertilizer, pesticide and broader agricultural reforms.

"EVs 30% target by 2030 ambitious but daunting, say automakers","US
Cite example of India that could not achieve desired results despite hefty financial packages
Local auto industry has termed the government's target of having at least 30% electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030 both ambitious and daunting for a financially constrained country like Pakistan.
The industry also mentions that when India could not do it in 10 years despite significant financial interventions, how can Pakistan realise this in the next five years?
Jamil Asghar, who has been associated with the motorcycle industry for around 35 years, said that India introduced FAME I (Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Electric Vehicles) scheme in 2015 with an initial outlay of INR895 crore (INR8.95 billion), followed it up with FAME II in 2019 with an outlay of INR10,000 crore (INR100 billion).
Then after the end of FAME II in March 2024 came Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme from April till September 2024, with INR500 crore (INR5 billion) and more recently the FAME scheme has been replaced with PM-EDRIVE (PM Electric Drive Revolution in Innovative Vehicle Enhancement) with effect from October 2024 with a total outlay of INR10,900 crore (INR109 billion).
Despite spending billions of rupees, the results, however, are not that promising so far. In October 2024, the sale of two-wheelers in India was recorded at 2.1 million. Of these, only 80,850 units were electric bikes. This translates into penetration of only 3.7% for E2Ws (electric two-wheelers).
During the same period, E4Ws (electric four-wheelers) constituted only 1.5% of total market as per the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association and the Society of Manufacturers of Electric Vehicles in India.
In Pakistan, according to Jamil, there is an industry-wide excitement that automakers are flexing their muscles with the introduction of New Energy Vehicles (NEVs) as the industry is going through a transition phase with the induction of new entrants.
""Unlike ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles, where localisation is more than 95% for two-wheelers and around 65% for four-wheelers, the NEVs are typically being imported into Pakistan as completely knocked down (CKD) units at best and being assembled here only,"" he said, adding that prices of these vehicles run into tens of millions of rupees, rendering them very expensive for an average Pakistani customer.
""Moreover, globally, wherever NEV uptake was recorded, it has come as a result of a hefty supply and demand-side incentives and subsidies and it immediately dips when the incentives are removed or suspended,"" he pointed out.
Jamil said that considering exorbitant prices of NEVs and in the absence of any significant incentives from the government, which is already financially strained and resource starved, what possible fraction of masses will opt for these fancy vehicles remains to be seen. He feared that the government will direct and allocate already scarce resources for a fraction of society and to a sector whose contribution to air pollution is still unclear.

Consumer courts scrapped across Punjab,"US
Nearly 4,700 pending cases will be transferred to regular district and sessions courts
The Punjab government has approved the dissolution of 17 special consumer courts, originally established to ensure the merit-based provision of essential goods and services to consumers. Beginning in July, these specialised consumer protection courts will cease to function.
Instructions have already been issued to transfer all pending consumer cases from these courts to the respective District and Sessions Judges.
These courts were set up in 17 major cities across Punjab, including all 10 divisional headquarters: Rawalpindi, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Lahore, Sargodha, Sahiwal, Multan, Bahawalpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan.
Currently, 4,693 cases are pending in these courts. Hearings for these cases will be halted this week, after which they will be transferred to the Sessions Courts.
Once received, District and Sessions Judges will assign these cases to Additional District and Sessions Judges, who will be designated as Consumer Protection Courts for this purpose. The closure of these special courts is expected to save the Punjab government millions of rupees each month. Temporary staff employed by these courts will be relieved of their duties, while regular staff will be transferred to other judicial offices.
The District Bar Association and the High Court Bar Association Rawalpindi have expressed mixed reactions to this decision. Malik Asad, Secretary of the District Bar, and Ahsan Hameed Lillah, President of the High Court Bar, welcomed the move, calling it a step in the right direction. They suggested that similar special courtssuch as those for anti-terrorism, customs, and anti-corruptionestablished by both federal and provincial governments in major cities should also be dissolved, with their cases shifted to regular sessions courts.
They further argued that regular session judges are less susceptible to political or administrative pressure and that this move would help restore public confidence in the judiciary while also reducing government expenditures.

'SC must overturn unconstitutional order',"US
.
Justice Aminuddin Khan has observed that the apex court is bound by the Constitution and it can revoke any unconstitutional verdict.
Justice Khan made this remark on Thursday while leading a 11-member constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court that is hearing review petitions filed against the SC's July, 2024 verdict in the reserved seats case.
On July 12, 2024, a full bench of the apex court through a majority of 8 to 5 resurrected the PTI as a parliamentary party, noting that 39 of the lawmakers who had submitted certificates of their affiliation with the PTI along with their nomination papers were already PTI lawmakers.
The SC ruled that the remaining 41 lawmakers who had not submitted the affiliation certificates at the time of nomination papers' submission could do that now within a period of 15 days. The government had later filed review petitions against the verdict.
During the hearing on Thursday, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned whether the Constitution mandated that reserved seats must not remain vacant. The counsel for a petitioner Salman Akram Raja responded that the court had already declared that these seats cannot be left unfilled.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail asked which fundamental rights had been violated by not allocating reserved seats to the PTI, while Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan queried whether the court could fill a political vacuum on its own initiative. The court will resume hearing of the case today.

Terror on the tracks,"US
The remotely-detonated device tore through the train on Sindh-Balochistan border near Jacobabad
Jaffer Express – which had experienced an agonising hijacking drama in March, resulting in the killing of 64 people including hostages, attackers and hostages – is once again in the news. Yesterday, the passenger train was targeted with a powerful explosive device planted on the railway track.
The remotely-detonated device tore through the train on Sindh-Balochistan border near Jacobabad, derailing four bogies. Fortunately, the passenger train escaped what could have been a deadly act of sabotage. That no lives were lost is nothing short of a miracle.
This was not a random act of violence. It was an act of terrorism — targeted, deliberate and calculated to create fear and instability. The banned Baloch Republican Guards claimed responsibility in a statement that began circulating on social media within hours, leaving little doubt about the perpetrators or their intentions. More troubling is the growing evidence that such acts are not just rooted in local dissent but are sponsored and supported by their Indian patrons who aim to sow chaos and exploit internal fault lines.
The train was en route to Quetta, a route long vulnerable to attacks designed to disrupt Balochistan's linkages with the rest of the country. This is not as an isolated incident, but as part of a broader agenda of asymmetric warfare. The message from the perpetrators is that they intend to keep striking at the heart of Pakistan's national cohesion. Mere condemnations and warnings will not suffice. Intelligence and rapid justice must now become the order of the day.
The enemies of Pakistan — foreign and domestic are attempting to derail more than just trains when they target our collective confidence and unity. The response must be equally forceful but rooted in law, powered by will and backed by unambiguous action.

CB upholds transfer of judges to IHC,"US
Remands matter regarding seniority of judges back to the president
In a majority verdict, a constitutional bench (CB) of the Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the transfer of three provincial high court judges to the Islamabad High Court (IHC), noting that these transfers could not be declared new appointments.
However, the majority judges partially remanded the matter to the President of Pakistan to determine the seniority of the transferred judges after examining and vetting their service record ""as soon as possible, including the question of whether the transfer is on a permanent or temporary basis"".
Two of the judges — Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shakeel Ahmed — however, declared the notification for transfer of the judges ""null, void and of no legal effect"" in their minority order.
On February 1, the Ministry of Law issued a notification for the transfer of Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Muhammad Asif — respectively from the Lahore High Court, the Sindh High Court and the Balochistan High Court — to the IHC.
Following this transfer, endorsed by the president, the IHC issued a new seniority list, ranking Justice Dogar as the senior puisne judge. Five IHC judges filed representations against this seniority list.
However, the then IHC chief justice, Aamer Farooq rejected these representations. After elevation of Justice Farooq to the Supreme Court, Justice Dogar was also elevated as the IHC acting chief justice.
The IHC judges and some other petitioners including Imran Khan challenged the ministry's notification as well the new seniority list in the Supreme Court, whose five-member CB heard the matter.
On Thursday, three members of the CBJustice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, and Justice Salahuddin Panhwar issued their short order, disposing of the petitions.
The order noted that the powers of the president under Sub-article (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution for the transfer of a judge and the provisions contained under Article 175A for appointment of judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) are two distinct provisions dealing with different situations.
""Neither do they overlap nor override each other. The transfer of a judge by the President of Pakistan by means of Article 200 of the Constitution (permanently or temporarily) cannot be construed as a fresh appointment.
""Furthermore, the powers of transfer conferred to the President by none other than the framers of the Constitution cannot be questioned on the anvil or ground that if the posts were vacant in the IHC, then why they were not filled up by JCP through fresh appointments.
""One more important facet that cannot be lost sight of is that the transfer from one high court to another can only be made within the sanctioned strength, which can only be regarded as a mere transfer and does not amount to raising the sanctioned strength of a particular high court,"" it said.
It noted that if it is presumed that all posts should be filled by the JCP alone through fresh appointments, then such interpretation or state of mind would not only go against the manifest intention of the framers of the Constitution but will also amount to negating or making redundant the substratum and existence of Article 200 of the Constitution.
""The article is absolutely not dependent, concomitant, or at the mercy of Article 175A of the Constitution, but is an independent and standalone provision dealing with the transfer of judges of a High Court (permanently or temporarily) and not the appointment of judges, which assignment has been incontrovertibly conferred to the JCP autonomously in terms of Article 175A of the Constitution.""
The majority judges, however, partially remanded the matter to the president, without upsetting the notification of transfer, to determine the seniority after examining/vetting the service record of the transferred judges, including the question of whether the transfer is on a permanent or temporary basis.
""Till such time that the seniority and nature of transfer (permanent or temporary) of the transferee judges is determined by the President of Pakistan by means of notification/order, Mr Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, already holding the office of Acting Chief Justice of the IHC, will continue to perform as the acting chief CJ,"" they added.
The dissenting note
Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shakeel Ahmed disagreed with the majority order and declared the notification for transfer of the judge null and void.
They stated that Clause (2) of Article 200 of the Constitution is subservient to Clause (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution and both are interconnected.
""According to the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction, while interpreting Clause (1) and Clause (2) of Article 200, both the clauses have to be harmonized and, being consistent with each other, have to be read in conjunction with each other for giving effect to both without creating conflict or absurdity""
""When Clause (1) and Clause (2) of Article 200 are read in conjunction with each other, it provides that when, in exercise of his discretion, the president transfers a judge from one high court to another, during the period for which he serves as a judge of the high court to which he is transferred, the judge so transferred is entitled to such allowances and privileges, in addition to his salary, as determined by the President.""
The order said the Attorney General for Pakistan conceded and categorically conveyed to the court on behalf of the Federation of Pakistan that the three Judges have been transferred on permanent basis.
It said Clause (1) and Clause (2) of Article 200, read in conjunction with each other, do not provide for permanent transfer of a judge from one high court to another and it provides for transfer of a judge a period — on temporary basis.
It said the permanent transfer of three judges to the IHC has been made in the wrong exercise of discretion under Clause (1) of Article 200 of the Constitution and has offended Article 175A of the Constitution, making it redundant.
""The process for permanent transfer of three judges to the IHC is suffering from concealment of relevant and material facts from the transferee Judges, from the chief justices of the IHC, LHC, SHC, BHC and from the Hon'ble Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP)
""The process for permanent transfer of three judges to the IHC is also lacking meaningful, purposive and consensus oriented consultation with the chief justices of the IHC, LHC, SHC, BHC and Hon'ble CJP on all the relevant issues,"" it added.
The minority order noted the intelligence agencies, including the ISI, have no role under the Constitution for appointment or transfer of Judges.
""Being subordinate to the executive, the intelligence agencies, including the ISI, cannot override the executive, the judiciary, the constitutional bodies and the constitutional office holders,"" it added.

Draper survives scare to reach Queen's quarters,"US
He defeated Alexei Popyrin 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7/5)
British number one Jack Draper survived a scare to reach the Queen's Club quarter-finals with a gritty 3-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7/5) win over Australia's Alexei Popyrin on Wednesday.
Draper was rocked by the world number 21 in the first set of the second round tie at the Wimbledon warm-up event.
But the 23-year-old hit back to level the match before taking the final set tie-break to complete his comeback in a tense encounter lasting two hours and 13 minutes in searing heat in west London.
""It was a tough match, credit to Alexei, he played some amazing tennis,"" Draper said.
""In the first couple of sets it wasn't pretty at all, I need time to adjust to the grass but it's one more under the belt.
""It's an emotional moment. I love playing at home and in front of my friends and family. I think he's gone to the beer tent but my grandad is here! It's an emotional moment.""
Draper, who reached the US Open semi-finals last year, is hoping to make a strong run at Wimbledon this year after failing to get past the second round in his previous three appearance.
The Londoner has made the last 16 at both the Australian and French Opens this year, rising to sixth in the ATP rankings.
If Draper can reach the Queen's semi-finals for the first time after two previous last eight exits, he will be guaranteed to be seeded fourth at Wimbledon when the grass-court Grand Slam gets underway on June 30.
After losing the first set against Popyrin, Draper's powerful ground-stroke dragged him level with a double break in the second set.
Popyrin clung on valiantly, saving two match points as he served at 4-5 in the final set.
In the tie-break he led 4-2, pushing Draper to the brink of a shock defeat.
But the Briton delighted the home crowd as he won five of the last six points, clinching the victory with an ace.
Earlier on Wednesday, Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut beat Czech eighth seed Jakub Mensik 3-6, 6-3, 7-5.

Punjab takes over long-stalled hospital project,"US
Govt includes project in ADP, to prepare new PC-1 for its execution
The long-delayed Rawalpindi Mother and Child Hospital project — under construction for the past 22 years and with its cost rising from Rs1.5 billion to Rs9b billion — has now been transferred from the federal to the Punjab government, which will construct a Children's Hospital instead.
The status of the project has been revised, and it has been decided to complete the unfinished building and establish a Children's Hospital instead. The Punjab government has issued a notification to include the project in its Annual Development Programme (ADP) and to prepare a new PC-1 for its execution.
The foundation stone of the hospital was laid by two former Prime Ministers, Shaukat Aziz and Imran Khan. In addition, the former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Justice Saqib Nisar visited the site just 23 days before the 2018 general elections and announced that the project would be completed under the supervision of a special cell of the Supreme Court.
According to the notification issued on June 16 by the Secretary, Specialised Healthcare and Medical Education Department, Punjab, Dr Hina Sattar, Head of Paediatrics at Rawalpindi Medical University, has been appointed as Project Director for the establishment of the Children's Hospital under the ADP. She will coordinate with Assistant Professor Dr Masood Sadiq, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Child Health Sciences, Lahore, to prepare a revised PC-1 for the project.
It is worth noting that former federal Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had facilitated the foundation-laying of a 200-bed Mother and Child Hospital by then Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz during the federal government formed after the 2002 elections. At the time, the total estimated cost of the project was Rs1.5b. However, the project remained incomplete during the five-year tenure of that government. While the main structure was constructed, critical work, including finishing, renovation, machinery installation, and recruitment of human resources, was never completed.
From 2008 to 2017, the project remained abandoned. Then, on July 1, 2018 — just 23 days before the general elections — then Chief Justice Saqib Nisar, along with Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, visited the site and announced that the SC's special cell would now oversee the project's completion.
Later, after the PTI came to power following the 2018 elections, then Prime Minister Imran Khan visited the site once again and reiterated the promise to complete the hospital. Despite significant progress during PTI's three-and-a-half-year tenure, the project still could not be completed. The construction eventually halted, and the partially built structure began to deteriorate due to weather and neglect.
Now, the project — previously under federal jurisdiction — has officially been handed over to the Punjab government, which will provide the funding and complete the project as a Children's Hospital under a new PC-1.

Healing Hagia Sophia,"US
Historical landmark being restored to combat quake threats
For nearly 1,500 years, the Hagia Sophia has stood tall over Istanbul, weathering empires, earthquakes and time itself. But as the threat of another major quake looms, vulnerabilities in its aging structure have surfaced, and efforts are afoot to protect the iconic landmark.
""Hagia Sophia can be seen like a patient, with more health problems appearing as time goes on,"" architect Hasan Firat Diker told Anadolu.
Now, working with the diligence of a doctor, Diker is part of the Hagia Sophia Scientific Committee, a team undertaking the building's most extensive rehabilitation in a century.
The Hagia Sophia was built in the sixth century, and its dome – among the first built on pendentives – collapsed in 558, and partially again in 989 and 1346.
Since then, the structure and dome have held firm, even as other buildings around it fell in the quakes of 1509, 1526, 1766 and 1894.
""Hagia Sophia is the heart of Istanbul,"" said Diker, a professor of architecture at the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Vakif University in the Turkish megacity.
""Its continued preservation can be attributed to the efforts of every ruling power – from the Byzantines to the Ottomans and into the Turkish Republic era – each doing their best within their economic means to protect it.""
'Protect it, not alienate it'
The Hagia Sophia, a cathedral, museum and mosque at different points in time, is now undergoing its most extensive restoration since the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923.
Initial work focused on surrounding Ottoman-era structures, but attention has now turned to the main building.
""We know its most vulnerable points. Our reinforcement efforts will proceed accordingly,"" said Diker.
One of the biggest issues lies in the four asymmetrical arches supporting the main dome – a result of earlier repairs and historic damage.
""Especially after the last two major collapses during the Byzantine era, the dome and arches had to be rebuilt. But they were made thinner than they should have been, which made the structure more fragile and in constant need of protection,"" he explained.
One major threat during earthquakes is hammering – a phenomenon where two adjacent buildings or structural components collide with each other due to insufficient separation between them.
""During an earthquake, the two semi-domes, which were built to support the main dome, can start to sway. This movement may create hammering, which risks damaging the main dome instead of protecting it,"" he said.
Engineers are now reinforcing connection points between the main dome and semi-domes to reduce this danger.
""Even though Hagia Sophia has structural weaknesses, we're not in a position to rebuild it from scratch. Instead, our goal is to intervene using the most appropriate methods for its current state and extend its lifespan,"" he added.
The restoration includes cleaning the underground sections, restoring the dome and minarets and addressing long-standing structural vulnerabilities.
""In previous restorations, especially when Hagia Sophia was a museum, scaffolding around the whole building was often avoided to preserve the visitor experience,"" he said. ""Now, we're taking a more holistic approach.""
Every phase of the project is being shaped by disaster scenarios, including a high-magnitude earthquake, he said.
""These earthquake simulations aren't new – engineers have been studying this since the 1999 earthquake,"" he said, adding that today, with advanced technology and data from major global quakes, they are able to model much more realistic interventions.
He emphasised that the project avoids unnecessary intervention that might compromise the building's character.
""We want to protect it, but we don't want to alienate it,"" he said.
Quake resilience review
Ilknur Turkoglu, a cultural heritage expert, said Istanbul's seismic risk is well established.
""Though Istanbul does not sit directly on a major fault line, its surrounding region is highly active, causing significant earthquakes that have historically caused damage to the city, like the 1999 Golcuk and Duzce earthquakes,"" Turkoglu said.
""With such a large and dense population, the damage and casualties from a similar earthquake today would be far greater,"" she warned.
Istanbul's cultural wealth – as the capital of the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman empires – adds another layer of risk. Many structures are centuries old and vulnerable.
""Knowing exactly what we have is the first step,"" said Turkoglu, an assistant professor at the Istanbul Gelisim University's Department of Architecture.
""Unfortunately, Istanbul still lacks a comprehensive inventory of its cultural assets, both above and below ground.""
She called for a systematic review of the earthquake resilience of such sites, and for immediate reinforcement where risks are identified.
Museums housed in historic structures also need urgent planning.
""We need to conduct earthquake drills, ensure artifacts and display cases are secure, and check that emergency systems like automatic shutoffs for electricity, gas and water are in place,"" she said.
Even if walls remain standing, she added, unsecured objects inside can still injure or kill.
The situation following the 1999 and February 2023 earthquakes offered a preview, she said, of what could happen without better preparedness, including plans to protect or relocate valuable artefacts.

Extortion shadow looms over the metro,"US
Police form special task force to combat rising threat
The extortion mafia has once again raised its head in the city, with 32 cases reported over the past five months.
The highest number of incidents — 10 — were reported in District Central, where extortionists not only targeted individuals but also caused loss of life through gunfire.
Taking notice of the rising number of extortion cases, Karachi Police Chief Javed Alam Odho has formed a 13-member team comprising the SSP of New Karachi Division, CPLC, SIU, technical team members, and officers from the operations wing of the District Central police.
So far this year, 11 extortion cases were reported in January, four in February, nine in March, five in April, and three in May.
According to reports, hotel owners, food centres, paan shopkeepers, and street vendors were blackmailed and threatened with dire consequences if they did not pay extortion money.
In the New Karachi area of District Central, a young boy and a social worker — who was providing iftar to citizens during Ramazan — were killed in firing by extortionists. Additionally, several shopkeepers have reported cases to the police in which they paid extortion money.
It is worth noting that investigations have revealed evidence of the involvement of the Lyari gang war's Wasiullah Lakho and Samad Kathiawari groups in these extortion cases. Police have already arrested several members of both groups.
The special team formed to crack down on extortionists will be headed by SP New Karachi Division Salman Waheed, and will include Assistant Chief Operations of CPLC Kashif Iftikhar, Deputy Chief District Central Sheikh Faraz, and Naveed Hashmi. Other members include DSP Operations Wasif Qureshi and DSP Investigation Nasir Afridi from the Special Investigation Unit (SIU) of the CIA Police, SHO SIU Inspector Malik Mazhar Awan, and technical team members Sub-Inspectors Qadir Jalali and Zeeshan, along with area Head Constable Faraz. The team also includes the SDPO of New Karachi from the Operations Wing of District Central and the technical team of District Central.
In addition, the team may seek assistance from any police officer within the Karachi Range as needed. The Karachi Police Chief has tasked the team with preventing further extortion cases in District Central and arresting those involved.

"Man, two children drown in canal","US
Due to the canal's powerful current and unfortified, muddy banks, all three were swept away
A man, his daughter and son drowned in the fast-flowing waters of the Chashma Jhelum Link Canal on Tuesday in Piplan's suburban area of Harnoli.
As per initial reports, 42-year-old Muhammad Munawar, a resident of Harnoli, was collecting firewood along the canal with his 11-year-old daughter Shireen and 13-year-old son Anees.
Shireen accidentally slipped and fell into the canal. In a desperate attempt to save her, Anees and their father Munawar jumped in after her.
Due to the canal's powerful current and unfortified, muddy banks, all three were swept away.
Munawar's wife, who also jumped in, managed to survive.
Rescue 1122 officials reported that the flow of water in the canal at the time was approximately 7,000 cusecs, with a depth of 14 feet and a width of 320 feet, making escape or rescue near-impossible for those who fall in.
Rescue divers launched an emergency operation to recover the bodies, which was still ongoing at the time of filing this report.
The Chashma Jhelum Link Canal originates from the Chashma Barrage and plays a critical role in supplementing water flow into the River Jhelum.
However, authorities have long neglected to establish safety barriers or warning systems along the canal's hazardous stretches.

Punjab sets up taskforce to drive 4% agri growth,"US
Focus on climate-resilient seeds, soil health, high-tech breeding strategies
Punjab Agriculture Secretary Iftikhar Ali Sahoo on Thursday announced the formation of an Agriculture Education and Research Taskforce, aimed at presenting actionable recommendations to revamp the province's agriculture sector and achieve a targeted 4% growth in the coming years.
Addressing a high-level meeting attended by top agricultural experts and researchers, Secretary Sahoo emphasised the urgent need for integrated efforts between academia, research bodies, and the agriculture industry.
""We must lower institutional walls and enhance collaboration across the board to ensure national food security and sustainable agricultural growth,"" he said.
The meeting was held with the participation of University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) Vice Chancellor Dr Zulfiqar Ali, Chairman National Seed Authority Dr Asif Ali, Director General Ayyub Research Institute Sajid ur Rahman, Chief Executive PARB Dr. Abid Mehmood, and Consultant to the Punjab Agriculture Department Dr. Muhammad Anjum Ali, among others.
Secretary Sahoo outlined the government's commitment to developing short-, mid-, and long-term policy frameworks to modernise agriculture.
He noted that increasing crop productivity remains a key challenge, particularly in the face of water scarcity and climate change.
""Providing farmers with high-quality germplasm, certified seeds, and climate-resilient crop varieties will be crucial to boosting production,"" he said.
He also stressed the importance of a unified, practical approach involving all stakeholders to secure long-term agricultural sustainability.
""This collaborative session is a clear testament to the government's resolve to renew and stabilize the agricultural sector,"" he added.
As part of the reform agenda, he cited upcoming partnerships between arid agricultural universities and research bodies to enhance per-acre wheat yields, especially in irrigated areas.
Speaking at the session, UAF Vice Chancellor Dr Zulfiqar Ali voiced serious concern over the declining levels of organic matter in soil, describing it as a major threat to land fertility and sustainable farming.
He urged academic and research institutions to work collectively to address the crisis. Prof Zulfiqar Ali said UAF would engage scientists from other institutions as adjunct faculty on collaborative research projects. He emphasised that profiling and selecting heat- and drought-resilient crop varieties should be prioritized in the short-term planning.
""In the long term, establishing a national germplasm resource nursery involving contributions from all agriculture-based institutions is essential,"" he added.

A strategic huddle,"US
The interaction – the first of its kind wherein Pakistan's serving military chief met a sitting US president
An unexpected and emergent huddle between President Donald Trump and COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir has laid a renewed roadmap of cooperation on strategic issues. The interaction – the first of its kind wherein Pakistan's serving military chief met a sitting US president and that too without political aides – summarises the indispensability of Pakistan's geopolitical importance and the role that the security forces can play in counterterrorism efforts in the region along with the US.
The audience also brought to the fore the indispensability of Islamabad for Washington as it navigates its policies in Afghanistan and the necessity of sharing notes as Iran and Israel are locked in a conflagration that threatens world peace and security.
While minutes of the get-together remain elusive and little is known as to what literally transpired on Iran and Israel, as well as the format to handle the soaring terrorism in Afghanistan, the fact that Secretary of State Marco Rubio, US Special Representative for Mideast Steve Witkoff and Pakistan's NSA and ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik were in session makes it comprehensive enough to assume that some constructive parleys were held, meant to scale down the volatility through diplomacy, and make use of influence Pakistan can assert over Tehran and the Muslim world.
The summit reportedly arranged through ''unorthodox efforts"" also came as an apt opportunity to debrief each other over the four-day duel that Pakistan fought with India, and the promising mediatory role of Trump in pulling back the nuclear rivals from the brink.
Pakistan's military authorities, in a presser, also said that avenues for expanding trade and big-ticket ventures such as mines and minerals, crypto-currency and emerging technologies also figured in the meeting. The debut audience, nonetheless, has also flagged hopes that Trump would have shared his views on furthering democracy and rule of law in Pakistan, and brokering a reconciliation of sorts for a win-win people-centric bilateralism.

Financially excluded women,"US
The only way to address these qualms is through financial literacy programmes
Pakistan's financial inclusion landscape reveals a tale of two realities - while overall access quadrupled between 2013 and 2024, rising from 8% to 35% during that period, there is a sharp gender gap that needs to be addressed.
According to the Karandaaz Financial Inclusion Survey 2024, only 14% of women own a financial account, compared to 56% of men. This gap has actually widened over the past decade, suggesting that the minimal improvement in women's inclusion is almost an afterthought. One major hurdle is technological. Mobile ownership is a gateway to digital finance, but while 82% of men have one, only 46% of women have the same. Complicating matters is the fact that only a small portion of women with cell phones actually have SIMs registered in their own names — 47% — compared to 78% of men. As mobile wallet users must have SIMs registered in their own names, this means most women can't open a mobile wallet.
Also disappointing is the fact that women's inclusion rate is appallingly low in every major city and region. Even in Punjab, only 17% of women are included, compared to 62% of men, while the number drops to single digits in Balochistan, and just 1% in AJK. The State Bank's ""Banking on Equality"" policy is a start, but institutions must treat women's inclusion as an economic imperative. Account ownership alone is insufficient. Women's accounts frequently lie dormant due to distrust in institutions or reliance on informal credit networks, which serve an overwhelming majority — 85% — of adults.
The only way to address these qualms is through financial literacy programmes. Pakistan cannot achieve UN's SDGs on poverty or equality while 86% of women remain financially invisible. Technology has spurred progress, but without dismantling the structural and cultural barricades, ""inclusion"" will remain a male privilege.

Pep Guardiola hails new City signings,"US
The Premier League club thrashed Wydad Casablanca 2-0
Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola hailed the impact of the new signings who came straight into the team for the 2-0 win over Wydad Casablanca in their opening match at the Club World Cup on Wednesday.
Dutch midfielder Tijjani Reijnders and France attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki both started the game on a hot afternoon at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia after joining in the run-up to the tournament from AC Milan and Lyon respectively.
""He is a really, really good player. You feel it, you smell it. The pace, in the final third, with the ball, when he will get a little bit more rhythm, he will be top,"" Guardiola said of Reijnders, 26, who played the whole game in sapping conditions.
Brought in to help fill the huge void left by Kevin De Bruyne's departure, the 21-year-old Cherki lasted an hour before being substituted as City eased to victory in the Group G contest thanks to first-half goals by Phil Foden and Jeremy Doku.
""Of course Kevin is difficult to replace, we know that, for the quality that he has,"" Guardiola said.
""There is no doubt about that but at the same time the club decided on Rayan because he has incredible skills close to the box, incredible vision, many things.
""This was just the first game, in really tough conditions, and I am really pleased he is here.""There was an experimental look to the City line-up against the Moroccan side, with young Brazilian defender Vitor Reis starting for just the third time since signing in January while Nathan Ake made a first appearance for his club since late February.
The five most-used outfield players for City over the course of the last campaign — Josko Gvardiol, Bernardo Silva, Erling Haaland, Ruben Dias and Ilkay Gundogan — were all on the bench at kick-off.
New signing Rayan Ait-Nouri was an unused substitute, but Guardiola suggested that he will change almost his entire team for the next game, against Al Ain in Atlanta on Sunday.
""We had new players, players playing in different positions. Vitor Reis played a really good game, Nathan Ake was three, four or five months without playing, so many players we needed to give them minutes,"" Guardiola said.
""The next game 10 new players (are) going to be there and we will try to win the next one.""
City will be without Rico Lewis due to suspension for the clash with Al Ain after he was sent off late on against Wydad.
If that was a source of frustration for the coach, Foden's performance was encouraging as the England star scored the first goal and made the second.
""Obviously last season wasn't the best for me so I put it in my head to start the season strong and I am happy today that I managed to score and get an assist and help the team win,"" said Foden.
""Last season was a bit rough for all of us but it is about trying to go again this season, with the new signings to help us, and trying to win trophies again.""

Govt launches National Electric Vehicle Policy,"US
PM aide calls it transformative step that will lift industry, protect environment
Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan on Thursday officially launched the National Electric Vehicle (NEV) Policy 2025-30 and called it a historic and transformative step in Pakistan's journey towards industrial, environmental and energy reforms.
Speaking at a press conference, Haroon Akhtar Khan stated that the new EV policy was aligned with the prime minister's vision of promoting clean, sustainable and affordable transportation while encouraging the local industry and protecting environment. Transport sector is a major contributor to carbon emissions and ""reform in this area is imperative"".
The PM aide said that one of the major targets under the policy was to ensure that 30% of all new vehicles sold in Pakistan by 2030 were electric. This transition is projected to save 2.07 billion litres of fuel annually, amounting to nearly $1 billion in foreign exchange savings. Additionally, the policy is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 4.5 million tons and cut health-related costs by $405 million per year.
He announced that an initial subsidy of Rs9 billion had been allocated for fiscal year 2025-26, under which 116,053 electric bikes and 3,171 electric rickshaws would be facilitated. Some 25% of this subsidy is reserved for women to provide them with safe, affordable and eco-friendly mobility.
He said that a fully digital platform had been introduced to ensure transparent online application submission, verification and disbursement of subsidies. Furthermore, the policy outlines the installation of 40 new EV charging stations on motorways, with an average distance of 105 kilometres.

Restaurants 'hoard' cylinders amid anticipated LPG crisis,"US

Amid fears of a looming liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) crisis, large hotels and tandoors in Rawalpindi have allegedly begun hoarding gas cylinders, buying and storing four to seven extra commercial cylinders.
LPG Association Chairman Irfan Khokhar warned that tensions between Iran and Israel could aggravate the LPG situation, with negative impacts already being felt.
He expressed concern over a potential nationwide shortfall in LPG supply.
According to Khokhar, the price of domestic gas cylinders could exceed Rs6,000, with per-kilogram rates reaching up to Rs500.
Commercial cylinder prices could hit Rs23,000. Pakistan's daily LPG consumption stands at 6,000 metric tons, while current reserves are insufficient.
Only 13,000 metric tons of LPG are stored at Port Qasim, and imports of 100,000 metric tons per month from the Pak-Iran border have been halted.
The association has submitted a formal request to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the Minister of Petroleum for immediate action. Without timely intervention, a severe gas cylinder crisis is feared.

"India begin new era sans Kohli, Rohit","US
Shubman Gill to lead India in Test series against England
Shubman Gill will be in the spotlight as a new-look India, without star batsmen Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, bid to end their 18-year wait for a Test series win in England.
Gill succeeded Rohit as captain after the latter announced his retirement from Test cricket last month.
Just days later, Kohli said he was bowing out of red-ball internationals as well.
Gill also has the additional responsibility of filling Kohli's shoes at number four in the batting order.
India vice-captain Rishabh Pant on Wednesday revealed that was where his new skipper would bat in the first of a five-Test series against England starting at Headingley on Friday.
The 25-year-old Gill has a modest Test batting average of 35 in 32 matches, a figure that drops to 29 in away games and declines even further to under 15 in three matches in England.
India's number four position has been dominated during the past three decades by all-time batting great Sachin Tendulkar and Kohli, who in that specific position scored 21,056 runs between them in 278 Tests.
Gill's first challenge will be ensuring the demands of captaincy don't detract from his batting in England, where India have won just three Test series -- in 1971, 1986 and 2007.
Thus far Gill has made all the right noises, saying last month: ""I believe in leading by example — not just by performance, but, I think, off the field by discipline and hard work.""
He will have the ebullient Pant to lean on after the wicketkeeper-batsman's return from a life-threatening car crash in 2022, while opener Yashavsi Jaiswal is one of the game's rising stars.
But it is not just in batting where India — who have had limited warm-up time in England — must cope without stalwart performers.
Jasprit Bumrah is arguably the best all-format bowler in world cricket at present but, following a back injury lay-off, the quick may only play in three of the five Tests given the tight schedule.
Veteran off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin has retired from Test cricket, while experienced Mohammed Shami, not fully fit following ankle surgery last year, has been omitted.
If there are concerns about India's ability to take the 20 wickets they need to win a match, those doubts apply to England as well.
Beaten 4-1 in India last year, Ben Stokes' men are tipped to turn the tables on home soil in a series that launches the new cycle of the World Test Championship following South Africa's dramatic defeat of Australia in last week's final at Lord's.
England, however, are without the retired duo of James Anderson and Stuart Broad, their two most successful Test bowlers of all time with a combined 1,308 wickets between them.
""It feels so good when both of them are not there,"" said Pant, adding: ""But at the same time, they have enough ammunition in the England bowling line-up.
""We don't want to take anyone lightly because our team is also young and still looking to develop themselves.""
England's desire to field an attack including both Jofra Archer and Mark Wood has been hampered by repeated injuries to the fast bowlers.
Both Archer and Wood will be missing at Headingley, where Durham paceman Brydon Carse is set to make his home debut in an attack where Chris Woakes, who missed most of the start of the season with an ankle injury, is the senior seamer.
""There's no hiding away from the fact that, over a number of years, England have had Broad and Anderson as the main two bowlers, so it is slightly more inexperienced,"" said Carse.
The 29-year-old added: ""I think it's a good chance for a couple of younger players, with slightly less experience, to stamp down some authority throughout the series.""
Broad, however, told The Times: ""Looking at England, with all the injuries they've got — where are they getting 20 wickets?""

The Anti-Terrorism and Sessions Courts in Rawalpindi district on Thursday awarded strict punishments to convicts involved in cases of explosives recovery, murder, and narcotics trafficking.
In a major decision, special Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Amjad Ali Shah sentenced five individuals to a combined 65 years of imprisonment and imposed a fine of Rs500,000 each in a case concerning the possession of explosive materials. The court also ordered the confiscation of all movable and immovable properties of the convicts.
The case, registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) on September 12, 2023, named Abdul Rashid, Rizwanullah, Luqman Khan, Wahid Khan, and Irfanullah as the accused. In the event of non-payment of fines, each convict will serve an additional six months in prison.
The court awarded seven years of rigorous imprisonment under Section 5 of the Explosives Act, three years and a fine of Rs50,000 under Section 11-F(6) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, and three years and another Rs50,000 fine under Section 11-W of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The time already spent in custody will be counted as part of their sentence. Following the ruling, all five convicts were transferred to Adiala Jail.

Conversion of Hindu minors triggers community uproar,"US
Police recover three sisters, cousin and arrest a suspect
The conversion of three Hindu sisters and their male cousin - two of them minors — to Islam in Sindh's Sanghar district sparked a backlash from the local Hindu community on Wednesday. Acting on urgent appeals from the parents of 13-year-old Hunain Kumar, 16-year-old Jiya, 19-year-old Disha, and 22-year-old Diya — as well as the Hindu Panchayat — police recovered all four on Thursday and arrested the suspect allegedly responsible for the conversions.
The three sisters and their cousin had left home without informing their families on Wednesday morning. Later that day, they released video messages stating they had accepted Islam of their own free will, without coercion. They also claimed they feared being harmed by their families for their decision.
At a press conference, the mothers of the siblings — visibly distressed and weeping — accused a local computer teacher, Farhan Khaskheli, of brainwashing and abducting the children. ""I want my son back. He is only 13 years old and cannot understand religion,"" said Hunain Kumar's mother, breaking down in tears. She appealed directly to Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to help recover her son.
The girls' mother also held Khaskheli responsible for the alleged conversion and abduction. ""I have three daughters, and Khaskheli has taken all of them,"" she said through tears.
Rajesh Kumar, head of the Hindu Panchayat, described the incident as not just a family tragedy, but a communal one. ""These girls are not just daughters of Hindus — they are daughters of Sindh,"" he said, while showing their photos and questioning whether they were mature enough to decide to change their religion.
Kumar added that the Hindu community had always lived in harmony with their Muslim neighbours and actively participated in Islamic festivals and local customs. He thanked civil society and politicians for their support and announced that the panchayat had held an emergency meeting in Sanghar on Wednesday.
Sanghar SSP Ghulam Nabi Keerio visited the panchayat during the meeting and assured the community of swift police action. The FIR was registered on the basis of the parents' complaint.

He has run 80 kilometres (50 miles) over the eight days leading up to her birthday
Myanmar's deposed democratic leader Aung San Suu Kyi marked her 80th birthday in junta detention on Thursday, serving a raft of sentences set to last the rest of her life.
Suu Kyi was the figurehead of Myanmar's decade-long democratic thaw, becoming de facto leader as it opened up from military rule.
But as the generals snatched back power in a 2021 coup, she was locked up on charges ranging from corruption to breaching Covid-19 pandemic restrictions and is serving a 27-year sentence.
""It will be hard to be celebrating at the moment,"" said her 47-year-old son Kim Aris from the UK. ""We've learned to endure when it's been going on so long.""
He has run 80 kilometres (50 miles) over the eight days leading up to her birthday, and collected over 80,000 well-wishing video messages for his mother.

Trump conveyed Pakistan's concerns over Iran-Israel war,"PK
Islamabad reiterates opposition to military solution; Field Marshal invites US president; COAS lauds Trump’s role
A day after the landmark meeting between US President Donald Trump and Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the White House, Pakistan on Thursday reiterated its opposition to a military solution and emphasised diplomacy as the preferred way to resolve the ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran.
At his weekly news briefing, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan stated that the Pakistani delegation, led by the field marshal, likely conveyed Islamabad's concerns and stance on the escalating conflict during the meeting.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) also released a statement confirming a ""detailed exchange"" between the two sides on the prevailing tensions in the Middle East, particularly the Israel-Iran situation. Both leaders reportedly stressed the need for a peaceful resolution through dialogue.
Responding to a question on President Trump's remark that ""Pakistan is not happy with the situation"", the spokesperson said the field marshal must have clearly communicated Pakistan's position and concerns during the high-level discussions
""Pakistan's authoritative position is conveyed in the foreign ministry's statement, Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar's, statement in the Senate. So, you put two together, you can understand what must have been conveyed by our side, our concerns,"" the spokesperson explained.
He, however, would not say any role was being envisaged for Pakistan in the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. ""But what we can say is, we condemn what Israel is doing in Iran. It is in violation of all rules of civilized behavior, interstate relation, international law and international humanitarian law. This is very clear.""
""We prefer and are open to support any diplomatic effort which can lead to the de-escalation and restoration of peace,"" he further said.
Sources said the Trump administration was told that diplomacy was the only way forward and any other means to resolve the conflict would have far reaching implications.
Trump and his team were briefed by the Pakistani side about the likely implications, which prompted the US president to tell reporters later that Pakistan knew more about Iran than many others.
Meanwhile, the military's media wing on Thursday provided more details about the meeting at the White House and what transpired in over two-hour long exchange with Trump.
The high-level engagement was scheduled at the Cabinet Room over Luncheon followed by a visit to the Oval Office.
President Trump was accompanied by Secretary of State Senator Marco Rubio, and Mr Steve Witkoff, the US Special Representative for Middle Eastern Affairs. Field Marshal Asim Munir was joined in by Pakistan's National Security Adviser.
During the meeting, the Chief of Army Staff conveyed the deep appreciation of the government and the people of Pakistan for President Trump's constructive and result-oriented role in facilitating a ceasefire between Pakistan and India in the recent regional crisis.
The COAS acknowledged President Trump's statesmanship and his ability to comprehend and address the multifaceted challenges faced by the global community.
President Trump, in turn, lauded Pakistan's ongoing efforts for regional peace and stability, and appreciated the robust counter-terrorism cooperation between the two states. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to continued collaboration in the field of counter-terrorism.
Discussions also encompassed avenues for expanding bilateral cooperation in multiple domains including trade, economic development, mines and minerals, artificial intelligence, energy, cryptocurrency, and emerging technologies. President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests.
President Trump commended Field Marshal Asim Munir's leadership and decisiveness during a period of complex regional dynamics. In a gesture reflecting the warmth of bilateral ties, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir extended an invitation to President Trump, on behalf of the government of Pakistan, to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date.
Although initially scheduled for one hour, the meeting extended for over two hours, underscoring the depth and cordiality of the dialogue. ""The engagement marks a significant moment in the ongoing efforts to reinforce the longstanding partnership between Pakistan and the United States, built upon shared objectives of peace, stability, and prosperity,"" said ISPR.
Army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and US President Donald Trump discussed trade, economic development, and cryptocurrency during their meeting at the White House on Wednesday, the army said.
""President Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan based on long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,"" the army said in a statement on Thursday.

Mobile clinics to operate in Punjab,"US
CM hails treatment of 10m patients through scheme
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has announced that health services from 911 Clinics-on-Wheels will now be provided across the province.
Addressing the launching ceremony of the Clinic-on-Wheels Project Phase-II, she said, ""The people of Punjab have suffered immensely in the last four years after the tenure of Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif. The cancer patients had to come on the roads over being denied free medicines.""
She highlighted, ""Not only cancer but also hepatitis and cardiac diseases' medicines and insulin doses for two months are being delivered at the doorsteps of patients."" People earlier had to take leave from their jobs and stand in queues for getting treatment and medicines. The health services from the Clinics-on-Wheels will be provided across Punjab.
She maintained, ""The Clinic-on-Wheels project, which was initially started with 245 vehicles a few months earlier, is receiving excellent public feedback. Doctors, lady health visitors and allied staff are working in the rural areas in Clinics-on-Wheels, which also provide maternal and paediatric treatment and minor medical procedures.""
The chief minister said air-conditioned vehicles had been purchased for the second phase of the scheme. ""I felt immense pleasure by getting treatment like a normal patient in a government hospital. I got treatment by getting an admission slip from the hospital, underwent MRI scan and the doctors administered me injections,"" she said.
The chief minister said more than 10 million patients had been provided free treatment immediately through the Clinic-on-Wheels project. The clinics provide facilities for checking the blood pressure, undergoing screening and treatment of diseases.
She emphasised, ""Children suffering from malnutrition in South Punjab will be treated immediately through the Clinics-on-Wheels.""
The clinics will be tracked to prevent misuse of vehicles.

"Opposition rejects budget, pledges shadow version for poor","US
.
The Opposition in the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday rejected the provincial government's proposed budget for fiscal year 2025-26, pledging instead to present a ""shadow budget"" that they claim will reflect the real needs of the poor and underserved.
As Opposition Leader Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar began his opening speech during the general discussion on the annual budget, the House quickly descended into chaos.
Treasury members interrupted the session with loud protests, prompting an equally noisy response from the Opposition benches.
In his address, Bhachar questioned the rationale behind increasing the development budget to Rs1,240 billion when no new development projects were included in the list.
He highlighted that the previous year's development budget stood at Rs842 billion, yet there remains no transparency about how or where those funds were utilized.
""Where did the last budget go? There's no audit, no accountability, and now they want even more money without a single new project,"" Bhachar said, accusing the government of corruption in several of its flagship initiatives, including tree-planting drives and model bazaars.
He criticized the increased allocation for education, pointing out that 25,000 of Punjab's 49,000 government schools have been outsourced, and more than 7 million children remain out of school. ""The state of public schools is there for everyone to see, and outsourcing is not a solution,"" he added.

Russia warns US against 'military intervention',"US
Says entering Iran-Israel war extremely dangerous
Russia on Thursday warned the United States not to take military action against Iran.
""We would like to particularly warn Washington against military intervention in the situation,"" Russian foreign ministry's spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Thursday that it was not up to Trump to reject Putin's offer.
""These services can be accepted by countries that are currently directly involved in the conflict,"" he said.
Zakharova warned any US military action ""would be an extremely dangerous step with truly unpredictable negative consequences"".
Moscow issued its warning after Putin spoke with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, with the pair blasting Israel.
Putin and Xi ""strongly condemn Israel's actions,"" the Kremlin said after the call.
Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters that Moscow and Beijing believed the end to the hostilities ""should be achieved exclusively by political and diplomatic means"".
Russia has for years been a key actor in the Middle East, managing to maintain warm relations with all major players in the region.
But the fall of key ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria last year, and Israel's war in Gaza -- which Putin has repeatedly raised concerns about -- have threatened to dent that position.
Despite their close military ties, Putin said Iran had not requested military help in the week since Israel launched its attacks.
""Our Iranian friends have not asked us about this,"" Putin said in response to a question from an AFP reporter at a late-night televised press conference in Saint Petersburg.
He also pointed out that the treaty signed in January was not a mutual defence pact and did not oblige either side to provide arms or assistance.
Asked what steps Russia would take if Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was assassinated, Putin said: ""I don't even want to discuss such a possibility.""
His spokesman said later Thursday that Russia would be prepared to send humanitarian aid, if requested to by Tehran.
In their phone call, Xi told Putin that a ceasefire was ""top priority"" and also criticised Israel.
""Promoting a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities is the top priority. Armed force is not the correct way to resolve international disputes,"" Xi said, according to China's state news agency Xinhua.
""Parties to the conflict, especially Israel, should cease hostilities as soon as possible to prevent a cyclical escalation and resolutely avoid the spillover of the war,"" he added.

Air India says plane 'well-maintained',"US
At least 38 people were killed in the residential neighbourhood that the plane hit
Air India's Boeing plane was ""well-maintained"" before it crashed a week ago, killing all but one of 242 people on board, the airline said on Thursday.
Indian authorities are yet to detail what caused the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner to hurtle to the ground in the western city of Ahmedabad a week ago.
At least 38 people were killed in the residential neighbourhood that the plane hit, causing such devastation that DNA analysts are still trying to identify dozens of the dead.
As investigators attempt to retrieve data from the plane's black boxes -- the cockpit voice recorder and the flight data recorder -- the airline said no problems were detected with the jet before the disaster.
""The plane was well-maintained, with its last major check in June 2023,"" Air India said in a statement.
""Its right engine was overhauled in March 2025, and the left engine was inspected in April 2025. Both the aircraft and engines were regularly monitored, showing no issues before the flight,"" it said.
The London-bound jet burst into a fireball when it smashed down in Ahmedabad moments after takeoff.
Initial checks on Air India's Dreamliners since the crash ""did not reveal any major safety concerns"", the country's civil aviation regulator said on Tuesday.
India's aviation investigative unit said on Thursday the probe was ""progressing steadily"".
""Key recovery work, including site documentation and evidence collection, has been completed, and further analysis is now underway,"" the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau said in a statement.
Air India said there were 169 Indian passengers, 53 British, seven Portuguese and a Canadian on board the flight, as well as 12 crew members.
The pilots were accomplished flyers, according to the airline.

Congo virus claims three lives in K-P,"US
Health adviser urges public vigilance to prevent further spread
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Health Adviser Ehtesham Ali has confirmed that three individuals have died from the Congo virus so far in the province, while one patient currently undergoing treatment at the hospital has tested positive. Additionally, six suspected patients are admitted and are undergoing diagnostic procedures.
He expressed deep sorrow over the loss of precious lives due to the Congo virus at Hayatabad Medical Complex.
According to the adviser, two of the deceased patients - both from Karak district - succumbed to the virus last night, while a third, hailing from North Waziristan, passed away on June 16. He attributed the recent outbreak to the lack of precautionary measures during Eid celebrations as animal markets had been established across the province.
Ehtesham Ali appealed to the public to strictly follow the health department's guidelines for Congo virus prevention and to exercise caution when handling livestock to avert further loss of life.
He further informed that the Department of Health has activated its Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) system to monitor and respond to Congo virus cases promptly. District Health Officers (DHOs) in the affected areas have been notified, and contact tracing along with sanitization efforts are underway at the homes of the deceased to prevent the virus from spreading.
It may be recalled that last week, two patients affected by the Congo virus were admitted to HMC in Peshawar with their condition reported to be out of danger initially.
According to the hospital spokesperson, 28-year-old Aijaz from Karak was brought to the hospital in critical condition on June 14. Another 23-year-old patient, Safiyan, also from Karak, was admitted on June 15.
After receiving medical treatment, both patients are now stable and no longer in critical condition, he claimed.
The spokesperson added that both affected individuals work in animal care.
In April, Pakistan's National Institute of Health (NIH) issued public health advisories regarding the risks of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) .

Senate passes Civil Servants Amend Bill,"US
Lawmakers call for repeal of solar tax
The Senate on Thursday passed the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aimed at enhancing transparency and enabling public access to asset declarations of senior government officials.
The bill, moved by Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar on behalf of Senator Ahmed Khan Cheema, Minister for Establishment, seeks to amend the Civil Servants Act, 1973, as reported by the Standing Committee.
The legislation is intended to further operationalise the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964 — specifically Rules 12, 13, and 13-A — and align them with the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2017.
Under the proposed framework, asset declarations of officers in Basic Pay Scale (BPS) 17 to 22 — including assets beneficially owned domestically or abroad by the officials or their family members — will be filed digitally and made publicly accessible.
The bill provides that sufficient safeguards will be ensured to protect sensitive personal information, such as national identity numbers, residential addresses, and bank or bond account numbers.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will maintain the digital platform, while the Establishment Division will be equipped with a robust framework, resources, and tools to conduct risk-based verifications of the submitted declarations.
Meanwhile, senators expressed grave concerns over the country's fiscal policies, particularly the imposition of taxes on essential sectors and the economic hardships facing ordinary citizens.
While participating in the general discussion on Budget 2025-26, Senator Dost Ali Jeesor criticized the 18 percent solar tax, calling it unfair and burdensome on low-income families who invest in solar panels and batteries.
He called for the total elimination of the tax, asserting that the recent cut — lowering the GST on solar panels by more than 10 percent from the previous 18 percent — remains insufficient.
Senator Muhammad Abdul Qadir presented an overview of the federal budget, said that we would need more loans to finance ongoing development projects, pension disbursements, and social welfare programs like BISP.
He cautioned that Pakistan's debt servicing costs are alarmingly high, with interest payments consuming 30 to 35 percent of loans taken by successive governments.
Jam Saifullah pressed for the commencement of the long-delayed M-6 Motorway project, criticizing insufficient PSDP allocations.
He also raised environmental concerns, opposing taxes on electric and hybrid vehicles, which he said undermine national climate goals. Furthermore, he called for increased support for salary earners and pensioners to fight inflation.
Senator Haji Hidayatullah Khan highlighted the disproportionate tax burden on the poor, deeming the 10 percent pay raise for government employees inadequate in the prevailing economic crisis.
He warned of declining agricultural productivity and stressed urgent government intervention to revive the sector.
Calling solar energy a vital resource for Pakistan's future, Hidayatullah demanded the removal of taxes on solar panels to encourage wider adoption.
Citing a World Health Organization report, he stressed that 45 percent of people live below the poverty line and over 270 million children remain out of school, underscoring the urgent need to prioritize education and healthcare.

Five bids received for PIA sell-off,"US
Five bids received for PIA sell-off
Pakistan's wealthiest and well-connected business groups with interests in cement, power, fertilizer and real estate sectors have shown interest in acquiring the loss-making Pakistan International Airlines, raising prospects for the success of the second attempt to privatize the entity.
The country's leading business groups, the Lucky Cement, Arif Habib conglomerate and Hub Power have come forward to bid for the acquisition of a majority of stakes of the Pakistan International Airline. Among the interested parties is Fauji Fertilizer Company, the military's commercial venture and Bahria Foundation, which is owned by Pakistan Navy.
According to a statement issued by the Privatisation Commission on Thursday, five parties have submitted both the expression of interests and the statement of qualifications till the extended deadline.
Most of these parties are resource rich and are having right connections, raising prospects for a healthy competition.
Our objective is to pass on the PIA to a consortium, which can make it a truly global profitable organization, said Muhammad Ali, the Advisor to Prime Minister on Privatisation on Thursday.
Privatisation Commission had invited the expression of interests for divestment of 51 to 100 % share capital of PIACL together with management control. It is the second attempt to privatize the airline after the first bid failed last year.
The Commission said that eight parties had shown interest but five of them submitted the statement of qualification. The AKD group, Habib Rafique Engineering and Sardar Muhammad Ashraf D. Baloch (Pvt.) Limited did not submit the statement of qualifications.
The Commission further stated that among the parties that submitted both the mandatory documents is the consortium comprising Lucky Cement Limited, Hub Power Holdings Limited, Kohat Cement Company Limited and Metro Ventures (Private) Limited. This consortium comprises some of the wealthier business individuals.
The second consortium comprises Arif Habib Corporation Limited, Fatima Fertilizer Company Limited, City Schools (Private) Limited and Lake City Holdings (Private) Limited.
The Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited has also submitted documents after months of speculation that the military's commercial venture was keen to acquire the airline.
The other two parties are Air Blue and a consortium comprising Augment Securities & Investments (Private) Limited and Serene Air (Private) Limited, Bahria Foundation, Mega C&S Holding, Equitas Capital LLC.
The SOQs submitted by the parties will be evaluated by the Privatisation Commission against the prequalification criteria and the prequalified parties will proceed to the next stage where they will be given access to the virtual data room to undertake buy-side due diligence, according to the Privatisation Commission.
Muhammad Ali said that due to improved finances and other developments, the PIA's balance sheet and the minimum reserve price would be revised.
During the last attempt, the government had set the minimum price at Rs85.03 billion with Rs45 billion negative balance sheet. Now, the government has taken out more debts from the balance sheet, which should positively impact the minimum price.
PIA's bidding is now expected to take place in the last quarter (October-December) of this year, said Muhammad Ali, the Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation.
The first attempt to privatise PIA in October last year failed because the government ended up with only one bidder. Two other bidders backed out due to disagreements over tax waivers and clearing the remaining balance sheet.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's government has not been able to privatize a single entity during its first year in power. The government has again set a very modest target of generating Rs85 billion from privatisation proceeds in the next fiscal year.
The International Monetary Fund has allowed Pakistan to waive off 18% sales tax on lease of the aircraft and take out Rs45 billion liabilities from the PIA balance sheet before its privatisation. The opening of European routes is considered as major incentives for the success of the second bid on the privatisation, although the United Kingdom route still remains closed.
The Privatisation Advisor said that the commission was happy with the interest and seriousness shown by the potential bidders. He said that all the outstanding issues would be resolved and the transaction is expected to be closed within this calendar year.

Tragedy hits family welcoming Hajjis,"PK
Dumper overturns on SUV, killing woman, her niece and injuring two others
Two members of a family were killed and as many injured when a speeding dumper truck overturned onto their vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road in the early hours of Thursday.
The victims were part of a convoy heading to Jinnah International Terminal to welcome relatives returning from Hajj.
The deceased were identified by their family as 55-year-old Shaheena Naeem and her seven-year-old niece, Ayesha, daughter of Khurram Kareem. The injured included Khurram's wife, Anam, 30, and Khurram himself, who was driving the double-cabin pickup.
The victims, residents of ROC Cooperative Housing Society, Scheme 33, were en route to receive their uncle, Kashif Kareem, and his family, who had just performed Hajj.
Saud Khan, Shaheena's son, recounted the incident, saying that their convoy of four to five vehicles had stopped at the COD signal when a heavily loaded dumper truck, speeding recklessly, overtook from the left, lost control, and toppled onto their vehicle.
""The dumper crushed our car under its weight, burying it in sand and gravel. The driver fled immediately, leaving us helpless,"" Saud said, his voice trembling with grief and anger.
Family members and witnesses expressed severe frustration over the slow and disorganised rescue operation. Saud lamented that it took over three hours to extract the victims, with rescue workers forced to manually remove sand using shovels due to the absence of heavy machinery.
""There were no oxygen cylinders available-rescue teams claimed they had run out. We kept begging for help, but the administration's response was shameful,"" he said. By the time the crushed vehicle was finally pulled out with the help of cranes, Shaheena and young Ayesha had already succumbed to their injuries.
The tragedy has sparked outrage over the negligence of dumper truck drivers, who often flout traffic laws with impunity. Police confirmed that the driver escaped and remains unidentified, though witnesses alleged he appeared to be under the influence of drugs.
Traffic was severely disrupted for hours as officials struggled to clear the wreckage. Family members, overwhelmed by grief, reportedly clashed with media personnel at the scene, with one allegedly assaulting a cameraman.
This tragedy has also brought attention to Karachi's illegal sand and gravel trade. Despite Section 144 being imposed in Malir district to curb unauthorised extraction, trucks continue to operate at night, transporting material from Gadap, Memon Goth, and other areas.
Chhipa Foundation spokesperson Chaudhry Shahid confirmed the accident occurred around 3:15am, attributing it to the driver's reckless speeding. SHO Gadap City, police station Sarfraz reiterated that illegal mining persists despite the ban, raising questions about enforcement.
The funeral prayers for Ayesha were held in Buffer Zone, while Shaheena's took place in Liaquatabad. Both were laid to rest in the C-1 Area Graveyard.

Relieved Pakistanis recall 'horrifying nights' in Iran,"US
Govts around world scramble to evacuate nationals caught up in rapidly spiralling Iran-Israel conflict
Mohammad Hassan anxiously returned to Pakistan from neighbouring Iran this week after witnessing drones, missiles, and explosions tear through Tehran's sky during what he called long, ""horrifying nights"".
The 35-year-old University of Tehran student is one of about 3,000 Pakistanis who, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have returned home since Israel launched its aerial war against its long-time enemy last week.
Governments around the world are scrambling to evacuate their nationals caught up in the rapidly spiralling conflict as Israel and Iran trade missile and drone strikes.
""I was in the city centre where most of the strikes took place and even one of the student dormitories was attacked and luckily no one was dead, but students were injured,"" Hassan said.
There are more than 500 Pakistani students at his university alone, he said, all of them on their way ""back home"".
""Those days and nights were very horrifying... hearing sirens, the wailing, the danger of being hit by missiles. As one peeped out the window in the night, you could see drones, missiles with fire tails,"" he told AFP.
Mohammad Khalil, a 41-year-old petroleum engineer, left Tehran three days ago, the capital of the Islamic Republic looking like a ghost town as residents sheltered indoors and families fled.
""In the last two days, I saw people moving out of the city in different vehicles with necessary commodities,"" Khalil said.
Abdul Ghani Khan sells medical equipment in Peshawar and travels to Iran regularly for supplies.
He had been in Tehran for a week when the first Israeli missiles fell on Friday.
Khan had to make the journey home by road because the airspace is now closed. Pakistan has also shut its border crossings with Iran to all except Pakistanis wanting to return home.
""We saw drones, red lights of anti-aircraft guns and I spotted one building catch fire,"" Khan said.
Mohammad Asif, a lawyer from Lahore in Pakistan's east, heard about the air strikes while on a pilgrimage in Qom. He wasn't initially afraid and continued his pilgrimage to Mashhad.
That was until Israeli strikes hit the airport in Mashhad, nearly 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) from the Pakistani border.
Samreen Ali was also in Mashhad but, like Asif, cut her trip short and returned with her husband and 15-year-old son. She was praying in a mosque in Mashhad when Israel struck the city.
Ali said she had visited Iran nine times before on pilgrimages and never imagined witnessing war there. ""I was offering prayer when I heard two explosions,"" she told AFP.
She then noticed she wasn't receiving messages on her phone and assumed that ""communication was being restricted... because of the war"".
Syed Saqib, 46, was in Qom and had to travel 500 kilometres (310 miles) by bus southeast to Yazd. ""We had to take alternative routes, spend an entire night waiting at a bus terminal,"" Saqib said.
They then boarded buses to Zahedan, a city near the border with Pakistan's Balochistan province. A relieved Saqib recalled making the border crossing at Taftan, surrounded by families carrying heavy luggage.

Indian producer remixes Annie Khalid's hit 'Mahiya',"IE
Hilarious mashup calls out nosy relatives
Indian music producer Yashraj Mukhate has gone viral again with a remix of Annie Khalid's iconic pop hit Mahiya, from her debut album Princess. Known for turning iconic dialogues and viral memes into catchy tunes, Mukhate paired the 2006 song with a clip of a South Asian man responding to an interviewer.
When asked if he prefers his maternal or paternal relatives, the man bluntly replies ""Rishtedar wala jo lafz hai na, woh jahan bhi aajaye, pasand hi nahi"" (The word ""relatives"", wherever it comes up, I just don't like it).
The video, featuring Mukhate looping the line over Khalid's Mahiya, adds a playful twist with lyrics like: ""Meri bua ki bhabi ke beti ki shaadi mein kyun jaon, mahiya, ke hoon mein pareshaan, mahiya."" It quickly racked up more than 12 million views and 850,000 likes on Instagram.
Pakistani celebrities Mawra Hocane, Zoya Nasir, Omair Rana, and Farah Khan Kunder praised the track. Khalid herself responded with laughing emojis and an ""Oh yeah, yeah!"" to which Mukhate replied by calling her ""The OG.""
Mukhate has previously gone viral with mashups like Rasode Mein Kaun Tha? from Indian drama series Saath Nibhaana Saathiya, and Pawri Ho Rahi Hai, based on a reel by influencer-turned-actor Dananeer Mobeen.
Khalid's Mahiya became an instant pop phenomenon when it dropped in 2006. As her debut single, it catapulted her to fame across Pakistan and among South Asians globally. With its catchy melody, romantic lyrics, and slick music video, Mahiya helped define the mid-2000s pop sound and cemented Khalid's status as a breakout star. The song was later featured in the 2007 Bollywood film Awarapan, re-recorded by Suzanne D'Mello. Still, the original version remains a classic and opened doors for more women in Pakistan's pop scene.
In a 2013 interview with Economic Times, Khalid talked about staying true to her Muslim roots while projecting the glamourous image the Western music industry requires. ""I pray five times a day. I don't need to prove to anyone that I'm a good Muslim,"" she said. ""I won't be twerking because I don't think it's cool. But if Miley Cyrus wants to do it, that's great.""
The pop star also voiced support for Muslim women's right to wear face veils in public.

PHC questions DC's TikTok activity,"US
Court seeks PMRU reply on student video without consent
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has sought a response from the Director of the Performance Management and Reforms Unit (PMRU) over a petition challenging the Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Swabi's act of sharing a video from an event at Women University Swabi on social media platform TikTok.
A division bench comprising Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr. Khurshid Iqbal heard the petition filed by Advocate Muhammad Hamdan on Thursday. The petitioner informed the court that the DC attended multiple events, recorded videos, and shared them on his personal TikTok account instead of an official government platform.
He argued that while the government permits the use of platforms like Facebook and Twitter for official communication, the use of TikTok by public officials is unauthorized and raises serious privacy concerns — particularly when such content features individuals without their consent.
Justice Arshad Ali inquired where the TikTok video was filmed. The court was told that the DC recorded the video during a ceremony at Women University Swabi and uploaded it from his personal account. The video included footage of female students, allegedly shared without their permission.
Advocate Hamdan further argued that public officials are only permitted to share content through official government websites or verified accounts. At this point, Justice Arshad Ali questioned whether any departmental representative was present, to which the Additional Advocate General responded that none were in attendance.
Expressing concern, Justice Arshad Ali remarked, ""What is going on here? These officers have created pages for self-promotion. This isn't for official useit's personal branding on social media.""
Following a brief recess, the Deputy Director of PMRU appeared before the court. Justice Arshad Ali asked him whether PMRU had issued any notification allowing such social media accounts and questioned the basis upon which every officer had started their own pages and was sharing all kinds of content.
The court directed PMRU to frame clear Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and submit a detailed report within 10 days. Justice Arshad Ali also cited a recent case where a District Police Officer used inappropriate language regarding civil judges on social media, emphasizing the need for regulation.
""The purpose of these accounts should be strictly official,"" he stressed. ""We are monitoring everything. Videos featuring university students should not be shared online."" The hearing was adjourned until July 10, with clear instructions for PMRU to submit its report before the next session.

Foreign exchange reserves top $17b,"US
SBP's holdings rise $46m; rupee on downward trajectory despite FX buffer
Pakistan's total liquid foreign exchange reserves rose to $17.1 billion as of June 13, 2025, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday.
During the week ended June 13, SBP-held reserves increased $46 million, reaching $11.7 billion. Meanwhile, net foreign reserves held by commercial banks stood at $5.3 billion.
The increase in reserves is due to continued foreign inflows and central bank's purchases of dollars from local market. This has a dual impact on the economy. On the one hand, it provides cushion against upcoming external payment obligations and strengthens foreign currency reserves. On the other hand, it prevents the rupee from becoming stronger.
In fact, the rupee has recently been on a downward trajectory, losing three rupees against the dollar in just one and a half month, reaching an 18-month low. Increasing imports and debt repayments are also the driving factors. This currency decline further erodes the already weak purchasing power of people.
The State Bank reported net foreign exchange interventions of $223 million in February 2025, bringing cumulative purchases to $5.3 billion for the first eight months of FY25 (July 2024 to February 2025).
On Thursday, the Pakistani rupee recorded a loss against the US dollar, slipping 0.03% in the inter-bank market. By the end of the session, the local currency stood at 283.64, down nine paisa compared to the previous day's close at 283.55.
Meanwhile, gold prices in Pakistan declined on Thursday, mirroring a soft trend in the international market where bullion remained largely steady as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East balanced the downward pressure from the US Federal Reserve's hawkish monetary outlook. Meanwhile, platinum prices slipped slightly after touching their highest level since September 2014.
In the local market, the price of gold fell Rs460 per tola, settling at Rs358,595, according to data released by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA). Similarly, the price of 10 grams of gold decreased Rs394 to Rs307,437.
Internationally, gold prices were little changed as heightened geopolitical tensions offset pressure from the Fed's hawkish stance. Spot gold was down 0.1% at $3,365.79 an ounce at 1340 GMT. US gold futures fell 0.7% to $3,382.80.
Interactive Commodities Director Adnan Agar noted that gold prices were in a holding pattern as markets awaited clarity on the Israel-Iran conflict. ""Gold is on pause because the geopolitical situation, especially regarding Israel and Iran, remains unresolved. By the weekend, we'll know whether the US will intervene or not,"" he said.
Agar added that platinum had recently gained attention, hitting a 10-year high after lagging behind other precious metals for an extended period. ""For a long time, platinum and silver were undervalued compared to gold, which recently reached record highs. Now, as gold pauses, investors are turning to platinum and silver, driving their prices up. Both metals reached multi-year highs just a few days ago,"" he elaborated.

"Govt decides to abolish tax exemptions for SEZs, STZs","PK
Senate standing committee rejects several budget proposals
The Senate Standing Committee on Finance was informed on Thursday that the federal government has decided to abolish tax exemptions for Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and Special Technology Zones (STZs) in line with the IMF conditions.
During a meeting chaired by Senator Saleem Mandviwalla on Thursday, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial briefed the committee that under the IMF agreement, all tax exemptions must be phased out by 2035.
He stated that going forward, no SEZ or STZ will receive any form of tax relief. ""Our hands are tied,"" Langrial remarked, adding that tax concessions and reduced rates across various sectors are being withdrawn.
The committee rejected budget proposals for the next fiscal year, including imposing a carbon levy of Rs2.50 per litre on petroleum products, removing the 10 per cent cap on the debt service surcharge for electricity consumers and introducing a levy on small vehicles. The senators termed these measures as burdensome for the public.
Regarding autonomous public-sector entities, Senator Anusha Rahman raised concerns about institutions holding vast investments despite minimal staffing.
She cited the example of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB), which she said is managed by only 12 people but has Rs13 billion invested. She questioned why such institutions are allowed to retain and invest their revenues and called for reforms or exemptions in the Public Finance Management Act (PFMA) if needed.
The officials replied that bodies such as Nadra, CDA, and Karachi Port Trust are allowed to invest their funds and earn profits, and they pay taxes on these earnings. However, the committee chairman said none of these institutions had actually paid taxes recently.
The officials briefed the committee that Nadra had paid a tax amounting to Rs8 billion during the last two years.
The FBR chief proposed amendments to the PFMA, but the committee opposed them, insisting that revenue from all government-owned bodies must be deposited into the Federal Consolidated Fund.
The Ministry of Finance stated that the proposed amendment would allow autonomous bodies to retain and spend their income independently, but Anusha Rahman strongly opposed it, demanding that such entities remain accountable to the national treasury and sought balance sheets of such institutions.
The committee also reviewed proposed changes to property taxation. According to FBR officials, the withholding tax on property sales valued at Rs100 million has been increased from 8 per cent to 9.5 per cent, while properties worth less than Rs100 million will be taxed at 8.5 per cent. For properties valued below Rs50 million, the rate will be 7.5 per cent.
Additionally, the Finance Bill 2025 includes stricter measures against non-filers. While the property purchase tax for non-filers has been reduced, the burden has shifted to sellers.
The committee approved a proposal to impose a 5 per cent tax on foreign online platforms.

Nissanka slams 187 as SL fight back in BD Test,"US
Hosts strongly placed after third day at 368-4 at Galle
Pathum Nissanka's career-best 187 helped Sri Lanka finish the third day of the first Test against Bangladesh in a strong position Thursday, only 127 runs off the Tigers' first innings score.
The 27-year-old opener anchored the Sri Lanka innings before they finished on 368-4 at the close of play, behind Bangladesh's 495.
He struck several key partnerships before he was bowled by Hasan Mahmud towards the end of the day's play.
Nissanka, who had been under pressure before the match with only one half-century in nine innings, hit 23 fours and a six in his marathon 256-ball innings.
Nissanka looked set for his maiden double-ton when he was bowled by Mahmud, who was bowling with the second new ball.
""This is my first Test hundred at home so I was very happy to get there,"" Nissanka said after the day's play.
But Sri Lanka's top-scorer said he was ""disappointed"" with the way he got out.
He acknowledged he had failed to score big since his century in England last year and said that he was ""trying to make the most of today"".
Kamindu Mendis (37) and skipper Dhananjaya de Silva (17) will take charge of Sri Lanka's first innings on the fourth day, with the Galle wicket still playing well for the batters.
Besides Mahmud, Taijul Islam, Nayeem Hasan and Mominul Haque finished the third day with one wicket each in a largely uneventful session for Bangladesh's bowlers.
Nissanka lost his opening partner Lahiru Udara (29) early in the day to the slow left-arm orthodox bowling of Islam.
Dinesh Chandimal came in and took a solid 54 runs before he was removed by Hasan after an important 157-run partnership with Nissanka.
Veteran Angelo Matthews, walking out to bat in his farewell Test with a guard of honour from the opposition, hit 39 runs in a key cameo that took the hosts to 293 before he fell to Haque.
Earlier, the third day started with Sri Lanka wrapping up Bangladesh's innings in just three overs after their overnight score of 484-9.
Bangladesh's last man Nahid Rana feathered a short ball to wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis as fast bowler Asitha Fernando completed a return of 4-86 from his 29.4 overs.
The visitors had been cruising at 458-4 on Wednesday before losing five wickets for 26 runs in the final hour of the rain-hit second day.
Bangladesh's bowling coach Shaun Tait said it was ""a good batting wicket"" in Galle.
""It was difficult conditions for the fast bowlers today, they toiled hard,"" he said after play Thursday.
He acknowledged the Bangladesh ""lower order didn't contribute much"", but said they would have taken the score before the game.
""I am not going to be critical of our batters,"" he said.

Jurassic World: Rebirth' brings back dinosaurs,"US
Seventh instalment to hit cinemas in July
Scarlett Johansson's role in Jurassic World: Rebirth made her recall her earliest memories of the dinosaur film franchise.
The Black Widow actor recalled seeing the first Jurassic Park film at the cinema when she was 10 years old.
""It imprinted on me very deeply,"" she told Reuters at the London premiere at Odeon Luxe Leicester Square.
""For the next three decades, I was like, I would have done anything to be in a Jurassic movie in any capacity,"" she added.
The franchise, created by Michael Crichton, has spawned several films, merchandising deals and video games.
The seventh instalment in the franchise, Jurassic World: Rebirth, directed by Gareth Edwards, follows a team of specialists that embarks on an expedition to a forbidden island, home to a research facility for the original Jurassic Park.
The specialists, played by Johansson and Bridgerton actor Jonathan Bailey, must obtain DNA samples from three dinosaurs to achieve a life-saving medical breakthrough.
The Universal Pictures film arrives in theatres on July 2.
For Rupert Friend, this instalment in the franchise is exhilarating.
""I love adventure. I love being taken on a ride where you don't know what's going to happen. I love the unknown. I love risk,"" he said.
For well-known science fiction director, Edwards, the pressure for the film to succeed did not hit until he arrived at the premiere.
""It's all front and centre here. It feels a bit weird to be honest. I can't quite get my head around it,"" the Rogue One: A Star Wars Story director added.
However, as per IMDb, tracking figures for the dinosaur film suggests one of the lowest opening weekends in the franchise's history. Even accounting for the additional two days in the July Fourth long weekend in the United States, superhero films Superman and The Fantastic Four: First Steps are both expected to outperform Jurassic World: Rebirth.

KBBA to take legal action against parallel body,"US
We are legally recognised, active association: Zahid Malik
In a decisive move to protect the integrity of basketball in the region, the Karachi Basketball Association (KBBA) has announced plans to take legal action against the creation of a parallel basketball association by the Pakistan Basketball Federation (PBF).
This was confirmed by KBBA Secretary Zahid Malik following a key meeting chaired by KBBA President Chaudhry Ghulam Abbas Jamal Advocate.
""Fifteen years ago, PBF made a similar attempt to create problems for us,"" said Malik. ""We are a legally recognized and active association, working for the betterment of basketball in Karachi and beyond. Any attempt to derail this progress through backdoor parallelism will be met with a strong legal response.""
The KBBA also intends to initiate legal proceedings against both PBF and the Sindh Olympic Association (SOA) for their involvement in what it described as the establishment of an ""illegitimate"" body.
On a brighter note, the association celebrated the launch of two major grassroots initiatives — the Shahida Parveen Kiyani Girls Coaching Camp and the Chaudhry Muhammad Masood Shaheed Boys Coaching Camp, inaugurated in a vibrant ceremony by KBBA President Jamal Advocate.
The camps aim to nurture young talent and reinvigorate community interest in basketball.

Mahuchikh headlines Paris Diamond League,"US
Ukrainian has conquered world of high jumping at age of 23
Yaroslava Mahuchikh headlines the Diamond League meet in Paris on Friday as athletes continue to fine-tune their form ahead of September's world championships in Tokyo.
Mahuchikh has conquered the world of high jumping at the age of 23.
The world and Olympic champion set the current world record of 2.10 metres at last year's Diamond League meet in Paris.
It was a jump that erased the legendary world record of 2.09m set by Bulgarian Stefka Kostadinova at the worlds in Rome way back in 1987
""I don't like the world 'pressure',"" said the Ukrainian, adding that her coach insisted she focus on herself and jumping technique.
""It's so exciting to jump here again after the world record, I want to do my best and give a memory to spectators on Friday.""
Mahuchikh, looking ahead to the worlds, added: ""Every Diamond League and every competition now shows what we did, what we should do better, and get in better shape for the season.
""I think something special is coming.""
Also vying to top the podium will be the Australian pair of Eleanor Patterson and Nicola Olyslagers, a two-time world indoor champion who has won twice in Paris (2021, 2023) and beat Mahuchikh in Stockholm last weekend.
US star Grant Holloway makes his return to the track after flopping in the opening Diamond League meet in China.
Holloway finished last after leading for much of his race but losing momentum disastrously after the eighth hurdle.
The three-time world champion and Olympic gold medallist trailed across the line in 13.72sec, way behind fellow American Cordell Tinch.
""Everybody wants to win every track meet they go to,"" Holloway said. ""But you've got to be able to give and take.
""The ultimate goal is definitely the world championships in Tokyo.""
Back competing, he added, would allow him to ""re-evaluate and attack and do the same thing again"".
Tinch is absent from the French capital, but Holloway will feel the heat from compatriots Trey Cunningham and Freddie Crittenden, Japan's Rashid Muratake, and the French trio of Wilhem Belocian, Just Kwaou-Mathey and Sasha Zhoya.
Dominican Republic's Marileidy Paulino tops the field for the women's 400m, and will be up against a strong field including last summer's runner-up, Bahraini Salwa Eid Naser, and Dutch athlete Lieke Klaver.
Paulino, gold medallist at last year's Paris Olympics and the 2023 worlds in Budapest, has been the star of the show for the past two years.
She won the one-lap race in Paris meets in 2023 and 2024. However, it is Eid Naser, world champion in 2019 and victor at Charlety in 2018, who has set the standard this term thanks to a time of 48.67sec in Kingston.
""I believe I can continue to be the star of the show,"" Paulino said. ""I've worked hard to be strong and in track, fans like the show, and between me and Salwa we're capable of putting on a show.
""It's been a packed season, preparing for the worlds, that's the focus.""
Ethiopia's Lamecha Girma lit up the 2023 edition of the Meeting de Paris by smashing the previous world record (7:52.11).
There was disaster at the Paris Olympics, however, after Girma fell heavily in the last lap of the Stade de France track.
""I'm very happy to be able to come back here,"" said Girma. ""Paris is like my home!
""After falling in Paris, the feeling was very bad and my head hurt for a long time. It took some months to return to training.

Stocks fall as Mideast conflict sparks selling,"US
Index sheds 463 points after optimism about circular debt resolution faded
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) ended lower by over 450 points on Thursday following a volatile session as early gains, driven by policy optimism, were wiped out by selling pressure amid escalating Middle East tensions.
Earlier, trading opened on a robust note in the wake of federal cabinet's approval of a large-scale circular debt resolution plan worth Rs1.2 trillion, which fuelled broad-based buying in energy sectors.
However, news of Iran's missile strikes on Israel rattled investors, leading to a sharp reversal. The heightened tensions spurred profit-taking, particularly in fertiliser and cement sectors. Banks emerged as a safe-haven, providing some support.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti commented that stocks closed lower on fears of escalation in Middle East tensions. ""Weak rupee and a slump in global equities were factors behind panic selling,"" he said.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index registered a drop of 463.34 points, or 0.38%, and settled at 120,002.59.
Arif Habib Limited Deputy Head of Trading Ali Najib noted that geopolitical ripples drove bulls to sidelines as the KSE-100 index extended losses by closing at 120,003, just above the key psychological level of 120k. The index reflected a day-on-day decline of 463 points.
The trading session opened with a strong bullish momentum following the cabinet's approval of over Rs1.2 trillion for circular debt resolution. This development was well-received by investors, prompting heavy buying in key energy stocks, including OGDC, Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and Hub Power, he said.
However, news of Iran's attack on the Israeli capital weighed on bullish sentiment, triggering profit-taking. As a result, the index lost its upward momentum and briefly fell below the 120,000 mark, hitting the intra-day low of 119,770, down 696 points, Najib added.
KTrade Securities, in its report, stated that stocks extended their downward trend as escalating Israel-Iran tensions weighed on investor sentiment. The KSE-100 index shed 463 points to close at 120,003, retreating from the intra-day high of 121,745.
Market activity remained muted, with total volumes at 598 million shares. Sector performance was broadly negative, where power, cement and oil and gas sectors faced steep losses, it said.
Key index laggards were Pakgen Power, Engro Fertilisers, Engro Holdings, Lucky Cement and Mari Petroleum. The banking sector was the sole bright spot, largely supported by UBL, KTrade added.
Topline Securities reported that the bourse kicked off trading on a strong footing, buoyed by news that the federal cabinet had green-lighted a financial restructuring plan aimed at slashing Rs1.275 trillion in circular debt within the power sector over the next six years.
Riding on that optimism, the index surged to the intra-day high of 1,279 points. However, the bullish momentum was short-lived as profit-taking set in later in the day in line with global market trends, it said.
Rising geopolitical tensions, particularly the intensifying stand-off between Israel and Iran, dampened investor sentiment and led to a broad-based pullback, overshadowing the earlier euphoria and highlighting the fragility of market confidence.
On the upside, index heavyweights from the banking sector provided some support, contributing 203 points. However, the gains were offset by power and cement sectors that pulled the index down by 270 points, Topline added.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 604.5 million shares compared with Wednesday's tally of 707.3 million. Shares of 459 companies were traded. Of these, 155 stocks closed higher, 269 fell and 35 remained unchanged.
WorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 64.6 million shares, down Rs0.01 to close at Rs1.49. It was followed by Sui Southern Gas Company with 35.6 million shares, falling Rs0.96 to close at Rs43.28 and First Prudential Modaraba with 30.3 million shares, losing Rs0.3 to close at Rs4.31. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs7.6 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

NA panel reviews FBR powers,"PK
The committee, which met here with its chairman Syed Naveed Qamar in the chair
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance on Thursday directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to incorporate safeguards before closing bank accounts of unregistered businesses, amid widespread tax evasion and underreporting by businesspeople.
The committee, which met here with its chairman Syed Naveed Qamar in the chair, reviewed the FBR's proposed measures to enforce sales tax compliance, including the disconnection of utilities and temporary freezing of bank accounts for non-filers.
During the meeting, FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial gave a briefing to the committee. He said that unregistered businessmen would not be able to operate a bank account under sales tax laws, adding that such a person would be served a notice prior to the closure of the bank account.
""The bank account of an unregistered person will be reactivated within two days after registration,"" he said. He revealed that out of 300,000 industrial units in Pakistan, only 30,000 to 35,000 were registered with the authorities. Explaining reasons, he acknowledged that the tax rate in Pakistan was high.
""One-third of manufacturers are not registered in sales tax. People who even come under the tax net do not file returns,"" Langrial said. ""Those who pay taxes underreport their incomes,"" he told the committee. ""Electricity theft alone costs Rs500 to 600 billion every year.""
When asked how the FBR would identify businesses not paying sales tax, the FBR chairman explained that the income declared for income tax purposes would be used to estimate the volume of sales, supplies and overall business activity.
Action would then be taken against individuals who fail to register, he added.
Committee member Javed Hanif supported the FBR's proposals but the committee chair cautioned against enacting a law aimed at catching tax evaders if it also adversely affects compliant businesses.
Another Committee member, Sharmila Farooqi, suggested that instead of making the penalties more stringent, the taxpayers should be given incentives. ""Reduce the tax rate. It will broaden the tax net and encourage the people to get them registered.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb replied that the tax threshold and process would be improved. however, he made it clear that tax exemptions and amnesties would not be given anymore. ""The time for tax exemptions and amnesties has passed. People have to be brought into the tax net.""
Langrial urged the committee to allow the FBR to temporarily deactivate the bank account of unregistered businessmen. The committee, however, directed for including safeguards in the process.
Petroleum levy
Meanwhile, the committee approved a proposal to increase the rate of petroleum development levy (PDL) to Rs90 and impose carbon levy on petrol, diesel and furnace oil. Finance Ministry officials told the committee that there was a proposal to impose the PDL on furnace oil as well.
The officials said Rs100 billion in revenue was expected from the PDL on furnace oil. They added that 1.2 million tons of furnace oil was imported for 1,000MW Independent Power Producers (IPPs). The Power Ministry secretary said that the target of PDL recovery in fiscal 2025-26 was set at Rs1,468 billion.
The Finance Ministry officials said that the government expected Rs45 billion in revenue through the carbon levy. The committee chair asked how much amount the Centre would get if the levy was turned into a carbon tax. On that the officials said that the amount in that case would be Rs18 billion.
The committee was informed that the entire amount of a levy went to the federal government, but in taxes, provinces also get share. The chair stressed that the committee was not taking any decision regarding a levy or a tax on petroleum products.
The industries secretary told the committee that Rs10 billion from carbon levy would be spent of the promotion of electric vehicles. He added that 30% of the vehicles would be shifted to electric vehicles by 2030.
The production of all types of vehicles in the country is around 150,000, the officials said, adding that there were 76,000 electric vehicles in the country at present. ""In the next five years, the production of electric vehicles will be increased to 2.2 million,"" the secretary said.

PTI chief's order stalls K-P budget,"PK
Constitutional dilemma deepens amid looming economic emergency
A directive from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Patron-in-Chief not to approve the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) budget without prior consultation with him has become a serious constitutional and administrative challenge for the provincial government. The government now finds itself caught between the leader's directive and constitutional obligations.
According to the schedule, the K-P budget must be approved by June 24. Failure to do so before the end of the current fiscal year could empower the Governor to ask the Chief Minister to seek a vote of confidence, or even advise the President to impose economic emergency under Article 234 of the Constitution.
The government has held multiple sessions with constitutional experts to resolve the impasse, but no breakthrough has been achieved so far.
The PTI Patron-in-Chief had expressed a desire to meet with K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Finance Advisor Muzzammil Aslam, and other economic experts regarding the budget.
However, prison authorities allowed him to meet only the chief minister. In response, the PTI leader issued strict instructions: no budget approval without full consultation with economic advisors.
Although the budget has been presented in the K-P Assembly, the party leadership has yet to be consulted.
Chief Minister Gandapur has reiterated his stance that the budget will not be passed without explicit approval from the party chief.
As debate on the budget continues, approval of departmental demands for grants is scheduled to begin today.
According to parliamentary procedures, approving these demands effectively means passing the budget. Meanwhile, the government has again consulted legal experts.
Constitutional experts warn that if the budget is not passed by June 30, it would be considered a failure of the government.
Under such circumstances, the Governor can invoke Article 234 and advise the President to impose economic emergency, citing both financial and constitutional crises.
Additionally, the Governor may direct the Chief Minister to seek a vote of confidence, and the President could refer the matter to the National Assembly.
Law Minister Aftab Alam told The Express Tribune that the government is trying its best to ensure timely budget approval in accordance with the schedule. However, he emphasized that the PTI leader's directive stands: no approval without prior consultation.
He warned that if a crisis emerges, the federal government would bear responsibility for denying access to the party leadership.
The Provincial Assembly Secretariat, when contacted, stated that it is following the approved schedule, and it is the government's responsibility to ensure the budget's timely passage.

Govt continues to score legal victories,"PK
Lawyers give mixed reaction to majority verdict
After the 26th Constitutional Amendment, the government has got another major victory on Thursday as the constitutional bench endorsed the transfer of three judges from different high courts to the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The government's legal team must be jubilant that in view of the majority order, Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar will continue as acting chief justice of the IHC, which is seen as crucial for the executive authority.
The majority order will further frustrate the five IHC judges, who have been facing a tough time since writing a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) regarding interference of agencies in the judicial functions, particularly on matters related to the PTI.
A senior government functionary admits that the 26th amendment is the outcome of the six IHC judges' letter. Constitutional Bench (CB) was created through the 26th constitutional amendment. The real purpose of the amendment was to control the superior judiciary for the stability of the current political set-up.
The present government doesn't want that courts should give any substantive relief to the incarcerated former prime minister as he is perceived as a threat to the system.
Since November last year, legal circles were keenly watching the outcome of three cases that they considered would determine how far the judiciary could go to assert its independence.
The constitutional bench did not disappoint the government as two of the cases had been decided in its favour.
Firstly, trial of civilians in the military courts have been endorsed by the CB. Now, the government initiative regarding the transfer of three judges to the IHC has also been endorsed by the constitutional bench led by Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar.
It is interesting to note that the CB is not taking up petitions against the 26th constitutional amendment.
If things stand the way as they are, it is no surprise that the government may get another victory in the reserved seats case soon.
The chance that the July 12 order regarding the allocation of reserved seats will survive is very low. If the CB sets aside the decision, then the government will get a two-thirds majority in parliament.
Moreover, in view of the ""satisfactory performance"", the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) by a majority vote extended the tenure of present CB judges until November 30.
Unlike the past practice, CJP Yahya Afridi also voted in favour of giving an extension to the CB judges' tenure. Earlier, he was advocating that all SC judges should be included in the CB.
The government has also been successful in appointing like-minded judges in the superior judiciary. Now, it would easily manage to appoint like-minded' chief justices in the high courts on July 1.
Legal opinion
Abdul Moiz Jaferii advocate says that the short order in the judges transfer case is disappointing. The majority has focused on the process of transfer itself being acceptable without dilating upon the particular transfer to Islamabad that was effected, how it was effected and what it aimed to achieve.
Jaferii states that the order completely ignores the transfer of judges being expressly temporary in nature by the very language of the Constitution. It proceeds to validate such transfers on the premise of them being safeguarded by needing input from within the judiciary.
""It then allows the president to redo the transfer and make clear the period of transfer and the seniority of the judges themselves, effectively opposing the very basis on which the transfers were validated: that this process was within the judiciary and insulated.""
He states that it is a bizzare reading of a plain constitutional premise. It ignores completely the scheme of appointment envisaged in Article 175A.
And if one were to count the peculiar circumstances leading to this petition, completely ignored in the majority order but expressly considered by the minority, its reasoning becomes obvious. The minority opinion, other than the roundabout poetry at the end; is constitutionally sound"", he adds.
A former law officer says that the majority has taken a literal view. ""It is premised on good faith and institution oriented bona fide exercise within the judiciary by three chief justices. If all three CJs act independently and in the interest of the institution, there should be no problem. Perhaps this was the reason Article 200 was inserted and it is working well in India. But if they don't act independently, this will become an instrument of coercion and silencing some judges, as in the present case. The majority has looked purely on law but not considered ground realities and facts.""
He says that as in many recent important constitutional cases, emotional advocacy and rhetoric continues instead of calm and cogent arguments. It is showing results every day more so when independent minded judges have already been sidelined and disarmed. At least the majority has left the question of temporary or permanent appointment. There is some contradiction as one the one hand the whole exercise is within the judiciary yet the matter has been sent to President alone. The whole exercise should be ordered to be conducted again but now the then CJ, IHC has gone. Who will give input on temporary or permanent status these judges, he adds.
Hafiz Ahsaan Ahmad Khokhar advocate has stated that the majority decision is constitutionally valid, well-founded, and aligned with the spirit and intent of the constitution.
He emphasised that the 3-2 majority judgment rightly affirms that under Article 200(1) of the Constitution, such transfers are permissible with the concurrence of the President, Chief Justices of the concerned high courts, and consent of the transferee judges. The court held that these conditions were conditionally met and found no mala fide on the part of the President.
He noted that the president had issued a notification on February 1, 2024, under Article 200(1), transferring Justice Dogar, Justice Sumro, and Justice Muhammad Asif to the Islamabad High Court. Their inter-se seniority was later determined by then Chief Justice Aamer Farooq on 11th February 2025. However, this seniority order was challenged before the Supreme Court under Article 184(3).
Explaining further, he said Article 194 makes no requirement for a second oath when a judge is transferred between High Courts, as the oath is to the Constitution itself — not to any specific court or jurisdiction. This is a principle recognized across other constitutional systems as well.
Hafiz Ahsaan added that Article 200(1) does not specify whether a transfer must be temporary or permanent. Following the judgment, it now falls to the President to determine the nature of the transfers. If deemed temporary, no further seniority determination is needed; if permanent, the President must determine seniority based solely on the judges' original appointment dates.
He stressed that under Article 200(3), the service terms of a judge cannot be adversely altered upon transfer, thereby preserving their rank, privileges, and entitlements.
He further observed that the President, as directed by the Court, must independently determine seniority without relying on advice from the federal government. If the President declares the transfers permanent, and seniority is accordingly based on initial appointment, Justice Dogar may emerge as the senior-most among the three — qualifying him for consideration as Chief Justice of Islamabad High Court under Article 175A through the Judicial Commission of Pakistan.
Contrasting with India's centralized seniority list, he noted that Pakistan's Constitution entrusts each High Court to determine seniority based on initial appointment — a practice also followed in the UK, US, Canada, and Australia.
Hafiz Ahsaan while concluding said the 3-2 judgment is constitutionally sustainable and reinforces the legal structure under articles 200, 194, and 175A. The president's forthcoming decision will help shape a lasting constitutional precedent on judicial seniority and the limits of presidential authority in such matters.

90% allocated to rural Sindh: MQM-P,"US
Opposition benches accuse govt of ignoring Karachi
The fourth day of general debate on provincial budget continued in the Sindh Assembly with Deputy Speaker Anthony Naveed in the chair on Thursday. The attendance of government and opposition members in the House was extremely low, indicating a general lack of interest in the budget debate.
Rehan Akram of MQM-P stated that in its seventeenth budget, the Sindh government once again allocated 90 per cent of the schemes to rural Sindh. He alleged that the Anti-Corruption Department has become a department of corruption. He claimed that the Sindh government has effectively turned corruption into an industry. He also highlighted the water crisis and sewerage problems in his constituency.
Environment Adviser Dost Muhammad Rahimoon said, planting more trees is need of the hour for environmental improvement.
MQM-P's Muhammad Daniyal said, our proposals were not included in the budget in the pre-budget session of the Sindh Assembly. There is no drinking water in the city and the mayor claims to wash the streets with 'rose water'.
Provincial Minister for Labour Shahid Thaheem drew attention of the house towards severe load shedding in the province where the power utilities increase outage times by two hours if complaints are lodged.
He mentioned that although gas has been discovered near Shahdadpur, gas is not supplyied to the area. He demanded an increase in hospital funding.
Mahesh Kumar of MQM-P said the budget lacks schemes that would allow the minority community to play a role. He demanded interest-free loans for minorities to help them start businesses.
Dr Fauzia Hameed called the budget a budget of destruction. She said it may benefit a few families, but offers nothing for the public. She emphasised that Sindh's resources should be spent on its people. She questioned why the CM holds so many ministries, asking whether there are no other capable individuals.
Jameel Soomro of PPP said, opposition always terms the budget anti-people, even though many taxes have been abolished in the current budget.
Provincial Minister for Women's Development Shaheena Sher Ali said small loans will be given to women for small businesses.
PPP's Ismail Rahoo pointed out water shortages and other public issues in his constituency.
PTI's Rehan Bandukda mentioned water crisis in his constituency and said that Karachi has become the world's fourth worst city to live in.
Najam Mirza of MQM-P said that discussion must be focused on the budget instead of praising the leadership. He described the budget as salt on the wounds of the people.
Special Assistant for Public Health Engineering Saleem Baloch said, water scarcity is a critical issue. Last year, 29 schemes were completed, and 34 new ones have been added this year.
PTI's Rehan Rajput said in his speech that the Sindh government proudly presented a budget with a Rs38 billion deficit. He claimed that 80 per cent of the budget is spent on just a few departments, which is wrong.
PPP's Mumtaz Jakhrani said that a large number of teachers have been recruited in Sindh, and that NICVD centres are present at every divisional headquarters. He said Rescue 1122 now operates from Karachi to Kashmore and that no one serves the people like PPP.
Senior minister Sharjeel Memon told the Deputy Speaker that a few words spoken during the debate on Thursday should not have been said on the floor. He requested that remarks about chief minister should be removed.
MQM's Muhammad Rashid Khilji praised Sharjeel Memon's work against drug trafficking and questioned why the Excise Ministry was taken from him. The Sindh Assembly session was adjourned until 10am on Friday.

Gaza rescuers say Israeli fire kills 72,"US
The army did not comment on the incident reported in the south
Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 72 people on Thursday, including 21 who had gathered near aid distribution sites as famine looms after more than 20 months of war.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that six people were killed while waiting for aid in the southern Gaza Strip and 15 others in a central area known as the Netzarim corridor, where thousands of Palestinians have gathered daily in the hope of receiving food rations.
The Israeli army told AFP that its troops in Netzarim corridor — a strip of land militarised by Israel that bisects the Palestinian territory — had fired ""warning shots"" at ""suspects"" approaching them, but that it was ""not aware of any injured individuals"".
The army did not comment on the incident reported in the south.
In northern Gaza, Bassal said that nine separate Israeli strikes killed another 51 people, updating earlier tolls provided by his agency.
Bassam Abu Shaar, who witnessed the shooting incident in the Netzarim area, said thousands of people had gathered there overnight in the hope of receiving aid at the US- and Israeli-backed distribution site when it opened in the morning.
""Around 1:00 am (2200 GMT Wednesday), they started shooting at us,"" he told AFP by phone, reporting gunfire, tank shelling and bombs dropped by drones.
Abu Shaar said that the size of the crowd had made it impossible for people to escape, with casualties left lying on the ground within walking distance of the distribution point, which is run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
""We couldn't help them or even escape ourselves,"" he said.
At least 300 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while trying to reach aid distribution points in Gaza, which is suffering from famine-like conditions, the Hamas-run territory's health ministry has said.
Israeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by rescuers and authorities in the Palestinian territory.
In early March, Israel imposed an aid blockade on Gaza amid a deadlock in truce negotiations, only partially easing restrictions in late May.

Kneecap rapper denies terror charge,"US
Fans rally around Irish band during court appearance
A rapper with provocative Irish group Kneecap appeared in court Wednesday charged with a terror offence for allegedly supporting Hezbollah, as hundreds of cheering fans gathered outside.
Liam O'Hanna, 27, known by his stage name Mo Chara, was charged in May after being accused of displaying a Hezbollah flag during a London concert in November.
He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Wednesday wearing a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf around his neck, and black sunglasses.
Shouts of ""Free Palestine"" and ""Kneecap"" rang out from the crowd outside, as well as from people inside the court building.
The Iran-backed Lebanese force Hezbollah and the Palestinian militant group Hamas are banned in the UK, and it is an offence to show support for them.
Kneecap, which recently grabbed headlines for statements denouncing the war in Gaza and against Israel, has denied the charge.
""We deny this 'offence' and will vehemently defend ourselves. This is political policing. This is a carnival of distraction,"" the Belfast band wrote on X last month.
The court released O'Hanna on unconditional bail on Wednesday and set the next hearing for August 20. He spoke only to confirm his name and address.
Prosecutor Michael Bisgrove said the case was ""not about Mr O'Hanna's support for the people of Palestine or his criticism of Israel"".
""He is well within his rights to voice his opinions and his solidarity,"" Bisgrove said.
Instead, the prosecutor said, the case was about O'Hanna wearing and displaying ""the flag of Hezbollah, a proscribed terrorist organisation, while allegedly saying 'Up Hamas, up Hezbollah'"".
The raucous punk-rap group has said the video that led to the charge was taken out of context.
O'Hanna told London's Wide Awake Festival in May the charge was an attempt to ""silence us"" after several of their performances were cancelled.
A performance in Scotland was pulled over safety concerns, various shows in Germany were axed, and UK government ministers had suggested the organisers of the upcoming Glastonbury festival should reconsider the band's appearance.
The singer's defence team argued that the charge fell outside a six-month time limit, as the concert was performed on November 21, and he was charged on May 21.
Unfazed
Daring provocateurs to their fans, dangerous extremists to their detractors, the group's members rap in the Irish language as well as English.
Formed in 2017, the group is no stranger to controversy. Their lyrics are filled with references to drugs, they have repeatedly clashed with the UK's previous Conservative government and have vocally opposed British rule in Northern Ireland.
Last year, the group was catapulted to international fame by a semi-fictional film based on them that scooped multiple awards including at the Sundance festival.
O'Hanna, Liam Og O Hannaidh in Gaelic, was charged last month after London's Metropolitan Police investigated a video from the festival in Kentish Town, north London, in November 2024.
One of the supporters outside the court on Wednesday, Sadia Kokni, denounced the charge as ""ridiculous"".
""Kneecap actually represent every one of us. They speak for us, you know, because everything they feel, every injustice that they feel, we feel,"" the 44-year-old told AFP.
""We came to defend the right to protest and freedom of speech,"" said banker, Caitlin McClure, 24.
""I'm a fan of Kneecap, their music means something to me. I'm Scottish and we are not independent either.""
The group apologised this year after a 2023 video emerged appearing to show one singer calling for the death of British Conservative MPs.
Rich Peppiatt, who directed the award-winning semi-autobiographical film about Kneecap, told AFP this week that the group was ""unfazed"" by the legal charge and controversies.
""Even through all the controversy at the moment, they just shrug their shoulders and get on with it,"" Peppiatt said.
""They've always been controversial at a local level, and they've always bounced back from it,"" he added. AFP

Ministry asked to get IMF nod for oil tax,"US
SIFC voices concern over delay in scrapping tax break for petroleum products
The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has directed the Ministry of Finance to swiftly secure consent of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for imposing sales tax on petroleum products as the matter has stalled investments of $6 billion in refinery upgrade projects.
The government had earlier agreed to remove sales tax exemption on petroleum products to support struggling oil refineries and oil marketing companies. It committed to imposing 5% sales tax on petroleum, but did not include it in the Finance Bill 2025, sparking concerns in the oil industry.
The Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) – an industry lobby – had also raised the issue with the federal government for failing to meet the commitment and for continuing the tax exemption.
The oil industry claims it has suffered Rs34 billion in losses during the ongoing financial year, which has prompted the government to allow loss recovery through the inland freight equalisation margin.
""However, the main issue of GST removal from petroleum products remains in place,"" an industry official told The Express Tribune.
Sources said that the issue landed in a recent meeting of the SIFC, which voiced concern over delay in resolving the matter. The finance ministry informed the SIFC that it had presented the proposal of levying GST on petroleum to the IMF and was awaiting its consent.
The ministry expressed hope that the IMF's nod would be secured before the approval of budget by parliament.
Industry officials pointed out that the government had additionally imposed carbon and petroleum levies on furnace oil, which would cause a halt to their furnace oil sales.
Since the release of the Finance Bill 2024 in June last year, refineries have actively pursued the inclusion of high-speed diesel, motor spirit (petrol), kerosene oil and light diesel oil in the exemption regime under the Sales Tax Act, 1990 with the authorities concerned.
Through consistent and collaborative efforts from June 2024 to May 2025, the government approved a mechanism for reimbursing the additional cost of sales tax inputs, resulting from the exemption status of petroleum products for fiscal year 2024-25.
Regrettably, despite assurances and constructive engagement, the matter remains unresolved in the Finance Bill 2025. This undermines investor confidence, disrupts long-term planning and runs counter to objectives of Pakistan Oil Refining Policy for Upgradation of Existing/Brownfield Refineries, 2023 that seeks to attract investments of $6 billion.
In case the dispute drags on, it will not only derail plant upgrade plans but will also pose financial and liquidity challenges to existing operations as refineries run under a regulatory pricing regime and are unable to recover this additional burden from product pricing.
Separately, a summary is circulating on social media, suggesting that the Ministry of Energy (Petroleum Division) has proposed the imposition of petroleum levy on high sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) at Rs82,077 per metric ton. This is in addition to a carbon levy of Rs2,665/MT on HSFO, as proposed in the Finance Bill 2025.
It is feared that the application of petroleum and carbon levies will result in an 80% increase in the end-user price of HSFO. This may lead to a further reduction in industrial activity and domestic demand. With lower local consumption, government revenues with respect to sales tax collection will go down markedly and refineries will be forced to export HSFO at a significant financial loss.
In addition, the refineries that consume HSFO as fuel in their own operations will be burdened with a sharp rise in operating costs due to the inclusion of petroleum and carbon levies.

TikToker allegedly raped by two men,"US
Sources claim suspects have police-backing as case is dismissed
A social media influencer and TikToker from Taxila was allegedly gang-raped by two men on the pretext of a job offer.
As per reports, a 25-year-old woman was lured for a job offer and called in by the two suspects, Najeeb Khan and Faizan. According to her statement, she went to a location near Khanpur Road, where the suspects boarded her in their car and raped her.
The suspects also allegedly snatched her phone, Rs3,000 in cash and a gold pendant before abandoning her. Despite reporting the incident to the police, the authorities reportedly hesitated to register a case, and the woman was sent back to Taxila after a perfunctory investigation.
When the woman reported the crime to the Khanpur police station, but instead of registering a case, the police allegedly labeled her a ""prostitute"" and contacted her husband to come to the station.
The woman was then sent back home with her husband, who has reportedly been having marital issues with her for the past three years.
Sources claim that the accused men have police backing, which raises questions about the police's handling of the case.
The fact that the police did not take action on the woman's complaint and instead sent her back with her husband has sparked concerns about the fairness of the justice system in the area.
Local sources say that seeking justice from the Khanpur police is extremely challenging, and that the woman may need to reach out to high-ranking officials like the Hazara DIG or Haripur DPO to get her case heard.
Meanwhile, the police officer on duty claimed that the woman had gone to Khanpur Dam with the accused individuals of her own accord and that the matter had been resolved.

Nawaz operates from peripheries,"US
.
PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, once expected to reclaim the political reins upon his much-hyped return before the general elections, remains conspicuously on the periphery.
Despite a full-fledged PML-N government at the helm, Nawaz has opted to stay behind the curtain, largely ignoring burning national issues, including Balochistan.
Three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who returned to Pakistan in 2023 after a five-year self-imposed exile in London, widely seen as a calculated bid to sidestep jail, has since kept a low profile, steering clear of the political limelight despite his party forming the government.
Many view this retreat as part of the PML-N's quiet pact with the establishment, a bid to regain the reins of power without rocking the boat.
However, within party ranks, there is growing unease that Nawaz's prolonged absence from the helm, despite being regarded as the ideological glue holding the PML-N's base together, could prove costly if the political playing field were ever truly levelled.
Once the party's undisputed lodestar, Nawaz has now receded into the background to the point where he lacks even a designated spokesperson, morphing into one of the most elusive figures for the local media.
According to media reports, Nawaz was expected to return to Pakistan this Thursday. But when The Express Tribune reached out to two party leaders, neither had any clue about his travel itinerary.
The party's usual fallback – branding Nawaz as the ""guiding force"" behind central decisions – has begun to wear thin. It even backfired recently when Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari credited Nawaz with ""overseeing war planning and execution,"" prompting ridicule and turning him into the butt of jokes.
Interestingly, Nawaz has not spoken to the local media since returning to Pakistan. However, during his frequent trips to London, he appears more at ease, engaging freely with journalists based there.
A senior party leader from Punjab told The Express Tribune that the PML-N was increasingly ceding political space to the establishment, an approach he warned would have severe consequences in the future. ""Now we may enjoy riding the establishment's coattails, but tomorrow, when the command changes, we will feel the heat of our blunders,"" he said.
The leader stressed that Nawaz Sharif must re-enter the political fray to keep the party alive. ""At this stage, the PML-N is stuck between two administrators, Maryam and Nawaz. Both lack political maturity. Everyone in the party knows their actual worth.""
""We shudder to think of the day the establishment ditches us. We don't have a workable narrative to reach out to the people of Punjab.""

Man opens fire at woman over marriage 'refusal',"US
.
A man opened fire inside a woman's house in Amarpura, within the jurisdiction of Waris Khan police station, after she refused his marriage proposal.
The incident left the woman's brother and one of the attacker's accomplices injured. Police have arrested the suspects.
According to Farah Naz, her engagement with Ibrahim Khan was called off two years ago after she discovered his drug addiction.
She claimed he had been harassing her since then. A day earlier, he fired shots in the street, prompting her to file a complaint with the police, who summoned him.
In an attempt to avoid legal action, Ibrahim Khan, along with Akbar Khan, Rizwan Khan, and Zeeshan Khan, allegedly entered her house and pressured her to reconcile.
Upon refusal, they opened fire, injuring her brother Imran in the foot and accidentally hitting their own accomplice Zeeshan. Other bullets struck windows and walls.
The suspects fled the scene, leaving behind the injured Zeeshan. Both Imran and Zeeshan were taken to hospital. Police later arrested the suspects and registered a case.

Juventus thump Al Ain in Club World Cup,"US
Real Madrid held by Al-Hilal in Alsonso's debut
Randal Kolo Muani and Francisco Conceicao both bagged braces as Juventus hammered Al Ain 5-0 on Wednesday in their Club World Cup opener following a trip to the White House.
The Italian giants, who sent a delegation to visit US President Donald Trump earlier in the day, cruised to the top of Group G above Manchester City, who beat Wydad AC.
Some Juventus players and staff were asked by Trump, whom they presented with a club shirt, whether they thought a woman would be able to make their first team. Trump appeared to be making a point against transgender athletes.
Juve general manager Damien Comolli replied that the club had a ""very good women's team"".
The Juventus players stayed silent but were far more comfortable speaking on the pitch as they dismantled UAE's Al Ain at Audi Field in front of 18,000 fans.
Kolo Muani, who extended his loan from Paris Saint-Germain to play in the tournament in the United States, opened the scoring after 11 minutes with a header from Alberto Costa's cross.
Juventus doubled their lead 10 minutes later when Conceicao, on loan from Porto, skipped away from one defender in the box before firing home with the help of a deflection.
Turkish forward Kenan Yildiz netted the third after 31 minutes, carving out some space on the edge of the box and drilling in at the near post.
French striker Kolo Muani grabbed his second with a deft finish in first-half stoppage time to pile on the misery for Al Ain.
Kouame Autonne had a goal disallowed for offside for the UAE side before Conceicao struck again, benefitting from another slight deflection.
Kolo Muani might have completed his hat-trick when sent through but goalkeeper Rui Patricio shut him down well, and Douglas Luiz blasted narrowly off-target late on.
Juventus, who finished fourth in Serie A, are hoping to make up for a trophyless season with success in the United States this summer.
Frustrated Madrid
Federico Valverde missed a stoppage-time penalty as Real Madrid were held to a 1-1 draw by Saudi Arabia's Al-Hilal in the Club World Cup on Wednesday.
A large contingent of Real fans in a crowd of 62,415 at the Hard Rock Stadium were left frustrated after new manager Xabi Alonso's first game in charged ended with the points shared.
For the Saudi club, with Italian Simone Inzaghi also making his debut on the bench, it was an impressive performance where they caused Real's defence plenty of problems before securing a hugely encouraging surprise result.
Al-Hilal started off in effervescent fashion and went close in the 19th minute when Salem Aldawsari volleyed back in to the box and Marcos Leonardo's effort flew just wide.
Renan Lodi had the ball in the net for the Saudi side but the effort was ruled out for offside from another dangerous break Aldawsari showed his pace but dragged his shot just wide. Real gradually gained more control over the game and Rodrygo went close in the 31st minute when he cut in from the right and his left-foot effort zipped just over the bar.
But Real's quality was starting to shine through and they grabbed the lead in the 34th minute.
Gonzalo, starting in place of the absent Kylian Mbappe, started the break from deep and a clever exchange of passes concluded with Rodrygo drilling a low ball into the box where Gonzalo, who had continued his run, provided a delicate finish. It was a classic counter-attacking goal but it did nothing to dampen the enthusiasm of the Saudi side who continued to press forward with energy.
Four minutes before the break, they drew level when Raul Asencio was ruled to have pulled down Marcos Leonardo and Portugal international Ruben Neves calmly tucked away the penalty.
The dangerous Aldawsari, who scored the winner for Saudi Arabia in their upset win over Argentina at the World Cup in Qatar, threatened again just before the break.
But Real came out strongly after the interval with Arda Guler introduced at the break rattling the bar with a volley from a Vinicius Jr. cross.
Moments later, Gonzalo brought a fine save out of Yassine Bounou with a firm header from a Vinicius crosss and then Valverde flashed a shot wide from 25 yards out.

Portrait of Oasis brothers to go on sale in London,"US
Painting shows Gallaghers' early friendship
A 1996 portrait of brothers Liam and Noel Gallagher at the height of their Oasis fame heads to auction next week as the siblings prepare to start a series of reunion gigs, reported Reuters.
Painted by US artist Elizabeth Peyton, Liam + Noel (Gallagher) is based on a promotional photograph of the siblings taken the year before and depicts them ""in a moment of intimacy and repose"", according to Sotheby's.
Like the photo, the painting, which was made after Oasis' historic 1996 Knebworth gigs, depicts Liam resting his chin on Noel's shoulder. In the photo, Liam has his thumbs up, but not in the painting.
The work is being offered at Sotheby's ""Modern & Contemporary Evening Auction"" in London on June 24 with a price estimate of 1.5 million to 2 million pounds ($2 million – $2.69 million).
""It's a beautiful circular moment for the painting... This was made in 1996, on the eve of their then biggest ever concert at Knebworth,"" Antonia Gardner, head of Contemporary Evening Sale, told Reuters on Wednesday. ""And now this is coming back into the market, coming back into the spotlight... on the eve of their incredible... tour.""
Oasis made their debut with 1994's Definitely Maybe before finding international stardom with their second studio album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? released in 1995. It went on to sell 22 million copies worldwide and was the band's breakthrough in the United States.
As well as Liam + Noel (Gallagher), other paintings on offer at next week's sale include Tara de Lempicka's La Belle Rafaela and Pablo Picasso's Nu assis dans un fauteuil, both with estimates of 6 million – 9 million pounds.
The Gallaghers' volatile relationship often made headlines. The group split in 2009 when lead guitarist and main songwriter Noel said he could no longer work with brother and frontman Liam after a number of public spats.
However, last August, the brothers announced they would reunite for a series of gigs in the summer of 2025, bringing an end to years of speculation.
The announcement marked a frenzy of fans rushing to book tickets online, resulting in ticket websites crashing, unable to cope with the surge in demand. News of the reunion tour also also led to instances of UK fans alleging they were scammed out of cash in exchange for gig tickets.
According to details listed on the Ticketmaster website, the tour will see Oasis performing in Cardiff, Manchester, London, Edinburgh and Dublin from July to September. The concerts are due to kick off in Cardiff on July 4.

MPs break ground with budget review,"US
Lawmakers, experts criticise 'unimaginative' budget, IMF loans
Former energy and finance minister Naveed Qamar said Parliament has made history by reviewing the 2025-26 budget word by word through its standing committees on finance and revenue.
Speaking at a parliamentary consultation titled 'Budget 2025-26: Numbers and Beyond' on Thursday, Qamar noted that for a hundred years, the budget-making process remained the sole domain of bureaucrats. ""Parliamentarians were handed the budget as a fait accompli, only to rubber-stamp it. This time, we've amended the rules of parliamentary business, allowing committees from both houses to read the Finance Bill meticulously, calling in experts and officials to better understand the data and narrative,"" he said.
He stressed that Parliament must take the lead in the budget process and proposed setting up a parliamentary budget office staffed by specialists. ""The budget documents reach Parliament in June with only weeks to pass them. The process should start months earlier with expert input,"" he added.
Dr Nafisa Shah and Sher Ali Arbab, co-conveners of the Parliamentary Forum on Energy and Economy, explained how the forum works across party lines to broaden public engagement and deepen debate on energy and economic policies.
Former State Bank governor Shahid Kardar criticised the budget as ""unimaginative"" and repetitive. ""It doesn't address how government operates. Both federal and provincial governments are expanding without improving performance. Salaries and pensions are rising while development projects face major delays and cost overruns,"" he said.
He also criticised international donors like the IMF for continuing to lend without requiring real structural reforms.

Govt to import sugar after exports,"US
Decision to import 750,000MT sparks criticism as prices soar to Rs190/kg
In a paradoxical move, the government on Thursday decided to import 750,000 metric tonnes of sugar after having already exported nearly the same quantity during the current fiscal year — a move that has driven domestic prices sharply higher, benefitting sugar millers.
The move has raised questions over the rationale behind the government's earlier approval of sugar exports, which critics warned would hurt domestic supply and inflate prices.
The new plan includes submitting a policy for the import of 250,000 metric tonnes of raw sugar to the cabinet for approval, while 500,000 metric tonnes of refined sugar have already received in-principle approval, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar announced via X (formerly Twitter) after chairing his second meeting on the issue in three days.
According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the country exported 765,734 metric tonnes of sugar between July and May this fiscal year, earning Rs114 billion. This marks a 2,200% increase in sugar exports compared to the same period last year.
Exporting first and then deciding to import has sparked concerns over the government's contradictory policies and the disadvantageous position imposed on consumers. After exports, domestic sugar prices hit a record Rs190 per kilogram — Rs50 higher than the pre-export price. A Ministry of National Food Security official claimed that there were sufficient stocks and imports are only being considered to lower prices.
As of the latest PBS weekly bulletin, sugar was priced between Rs170 and Rs190 per kilogram across the country.
In March, the government had fixed the retail price of sugar at Rs164 per kilogram — 13% higher than the cap set during the export approval period — allowing millers to enjoy windfall gains in both local and export markets. Dar's committee had negotiated the ex-factory and retail prices of sugar with the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA), which has previously been accused of cartel-like behaviour by the nation's antitrust watchdog — the Competition Commission of Pakistan. Despite the agreed rates, the government failed to ensure stable retail prices.
Dar added on Thursday that the Ministry of National Food Security has been instructed to seek the Economic Coordination Committee's (ECC) formal approval for the sugar imports. Currently, the deputy prime minister is making key economic decisions that are later presented to formal forums for ratification.
On Wednesday, Dar also announced a downward revision of the proposed sales tax on solar panel imports — from 18% to 10% — for the upcoming fiscal year, diverging from the initial budgetary proposal.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, meanwhile, is engaged in trade negotiations with the United States — normally the responsibility of the commerce ministry.
The sugar import decision followed a high-level meeting attended by the Minister for National Food Security, Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Tariq Bajwa, officials from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Ministry of Industries and Production, PSMA, and provincial representatives.
Dar reiterated the government's commitment to balancing the interests of both consumers and producers, stressing the importance of making essential commodities affordable and widely available.
According to PSMA's presentation at the meeting, average monthly sugar consumption last year was 533,000 metric tonnes, with a total annual consumption of 6.4 million tonnes. In the first half of this fiscal year, monthly consumption showed a negligible increase of 0.003% to 535,016 metric tonnes, totalling 3.5 million tonnes so far. PSMA claims current sugar stocks stand at 2.8 million tonnes — enough to meet demand until November 21 even at the compressed consumption level of 535,000 metric tonnes per month. However, the government's decision to import 750,000 tonnes suggests that either the shortage is more acute than reported or consumption is higher than projected.
Experts had earlier opposed the government's decision to export sugar, fearing that it would jeopardise supply and raise prices for the entire population to benefit a small group of industrialists. The government's control over sugar trade also contradicts its recently adopted free-market agricultural policies.
""Export and import decisions should be left to farmers and market forces, not to selective millers with political influence,"" said Usama Mela, a Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA, during a National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance meeting this week.
The PSMA, whose members are direct beneficiaries of the export, also recommended curbing sugar smuggling to neighbouring countries and proposed a tolling policy for importing raw sugar to manage stock shortages. PSMA also suggested starting the crushing season from November 1 —  a proposal that is largely seen as symbolic and may be an attempt to deflect the criticism over the export of sugar. The PSMA stated in the meeting that without duties and taxes the cost of imported sugar was Rs153 per kilogram, which is still Rs37 per kilogram cheaper than the local price bonanza. The millers claimed that the country produced 5.9 million metric tonnes of sugar this year, which was 14% or nearly 1 million tonnes less than the previous crushing season.

Constitutionalism — a lost sanctity,"IE
The journey of the constitutional process in Pakistan has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride
To destroy a people, you must first sever their roots. — Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
Any religious place of worship and its holy book are revered as sacred by their followers. In much the same way, a state and its governing document 'Constitution' holds a sacrosanct place in the hearts of their citizens and constitutionalists. Just as any adulterated alteration of holy scriptures incites the fury of the faithful; likewise, any malicious amendment to the sacred document of the 'Constitution' provokes outrage in a society that firmly believes in upholding democratic principles.
The journey of constitutional process in Pakistan has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. From the prolonged delay in framing and adopting the first Constitution to the recurring adventurism of experimenting with the adoption of a Presidential or a Parliamentary form of government, and from the question over a Federal versus a unitary system, to the abrupt military takeovers and undemocratic overreach of power by elected civilian representatives, Pakistan's constitutional trajectory has been fraught with ambivalence.
Growing up in a household where political conversations were the main course of every table-talk, I was unknowingly familiarised with unsettling phrases like 'abrogation', 'suspension', 'reframing', and the most loathed of all, the Eighth Amendment (inserted by the then military dictator, President Ziaul Haq to strengthen his grip on power and suppress political dissent) that left an unconscious, yet profound impact on my understanding of constitutionalism.
As a political science student, I observed the Seventeenth Amendment saga (brought in by the then President, General Pervez Musharraf in collusion with so-called democratic-minded religious and political parties) with a personal interest from the comfort of my couch, viewing it as an academic learning experience. However, I remained oblivious of the gravity of its repercussions.
Years later, after spending nearly a decade in the professional arena, the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment (introduced in the backdrop of post-9th May political and military tug-of-war) felt like a direct punch to my face – finally making me realise the devastating impact of these calculated executive and legislative maneuvers. I find myself jolted by the ongoing tremors of this Amendment – an impact intensified by the rather unfortunate than fortunate experience of being position at the heart of it all, working on matters closely tied to its aftermath.
Simply put, Constitutional Amendments in the past by the military dictators were focused on consolidation and legitimisation of their authoritarian regimes, whilst the civilian governments concentrated in strengthening the executive branch. However, the insertion of the 26th Amendment has had the effect of targeted weakening of the judicial branch; it has virtually glued the judicial institution with the executive in blatant violation of the fundamental constitutional mandate of trichotomy of powers and independence of judiciary as enshrined in Clause (3) of Article 175 of the presently enforced 1973 Constitution.
Reflecting on my political science lectures, I am, rightly or wrongly, reminded that the Constitution not being merely a legal document but a foundational covenant between the rulers and the ruled; valued as a social contract between the State and its citizens, if that is the correct version, then who grants corridors of power the authority to unilaterally bend its clauses while expecting absolute obedience by the governed. It is an elemental legal principle that a contract loses its legitimacy when one party manipulates its terms to its advantage while disregarding the consent of the other.
With the advent of the 21st century's sophisticated standards, overt military coups becoming increasingly unpopular. In their place, a far more alarming trend of employing covert methods to dominate the ruthless game of thrones has emerged, which stems from the nations' most revered legal scripture itself. In the guise of upholding the constitutional spirit and rule of law, state actors systematically set legal machinery into motion, weaving legal frameworks into a silken trap.
They wield the axe of 'amendment' like executioners, striking down democratic norms and enclosing them in a gilded cage, all under the banner of legitimate governance. Thus, authoritarian forces are granted the licence to seize power under the illusion of constitutionality, gradually hollowing out state institutions like termites devouring the foundations of a grand structure, all while flawlessly maintaining the façade of constitutional integrity.
This wave of Constitutional adventurism leading us down the path of legal debacle and ultimate frustration compels me to question my very choice of entering the legal profession, especially as I stand witness to a judiciary that mirrors a disarmed soldier on the battlefield, a toothless prey confronted by a fierce and unrelenting executive.
The survival of a nation does not merely depend upon its military might or economic prosperity, but hinges on an unwavering commitment to the principles enshrined in its primitive framework.
The Constitution, like faith, must be honoured, protected and upheld – for once its sanctity is lost, the risk is not just the erosion of legal provisions, but the very soul of the nation itself.

AI and the environment,"PK
AI is making it much easier to spread disinformation, enable fraud, and cause conflicts to become deadlier
For Gen X people like me, who are trying to get used to the new world of AI, like we learnt using the computer, and then the Internet many years ago, it is intriguing to see how AI is becoming integrated into our lives. For researchers like me, AI is making it easier to navigate Internet searches, and to synthesise relevant literature. Besides such novice applications of AI, however, this evolving technology is going to start playing an increasingly prominent role in more salient aspects of our lives ranging from healthcare, education, manufacturing, agriculture, and even warfare.
There are also legitimate reasons to be wary of AI's power. AI is making it much easier to spread disinformation, enable fraud, and cause conflicts to become deadlier. Moreover, AI, like many other technologies that we have become so dependent on in our consumerist world, ranging from cars to cell phone, has significant environmental impacts. This heavy ecological footprint of AI is more concerning to me than speculations about AI dominating or replacing humans.
AI has a much larger environmental impact than many of the other innovations we now depend on, due to the exorbitant amount of energy needed to operate and train AI systems, and because of the e-waste produced by the hardware used to run AI. Training and operationalising large language models such as ChatGPT depend on energy still being generated via fossil fuels, which is leading to more carbon emissions, and increased global warming. Each ChatGPT question is estimated to use around 10 times more electricity than a traditional Google search.
Producing and disposing of AI hardware also generates a lot of e-waste comprised of harmful chemicals. Running AI models need a lot of water too, to cool the data centres which house massive servers, and to cool thermoelectric or hydroelectric plants which supply electricity for these data centers. The race to produce AI is also compelling major tech giants to walk back on their earlier environmental pledges. Consider, for instance, the case of Google. A few years ago, Google set an ambitious target to address climate change by becoming 'net zero' emissions, but now the company's emissions are growing due to Goggle's bid to become a leader in AI.
As the AI industry continues to grow, its environmental impact will grow too. However, as is the case of ecological destruction caused by over consumption of other products, the environmental impacts of AI will not be evenly distributed across different regions or socio-economic classes. The benefits of AI will not be evenly spread either. Higher income countries are better poised to capture economic value from AI because they already have better digital infrastructure, more AI development resources, and advanced data systems.
Better off households will be able to enjoy the benefits of AI, while having more resilience in terms of shielding themselves from its adverse impacts. Conversely, the quest to produce more AI may cause exploitation in poorer countries that provide the critical resources needed for AI. This is not a speculative statement, but one based on ground realities.
Consider, for instance, the dismal condition of miners, including children, in poor African countries like Congo, who are toiling away to produce cobalt to power batteries used to run electric cars, and our phones. Al will require many more of these critical resources, potentially leading to even more exploitation of people and natural environments in resource-rich but poor countries.
It is important to improve the energy efficiency of AI models and data centers, and to use renewable energy sources to power AI data centres. Moreover, it is also vital to promote more sustainable mining and manufacturing practices and improve e-waste management to reduce the amount of harmful chemicals entering the environment. However, whether these efforts will be paid more attention than maximising profits within this highly unregulated new domain of human innovation remains to be seen.

Can 'GTA VI' revive the videogame industry?,"US
Delay of long-awaited title blamed for uncertain spending
The global videogame market's growth rate is expected to improve marginally in 2025 from the previous year, according to a report from research firm Newzoo, seen exclusively by Reuters on Tuesday.
Analysts and industry experts had projected a surge in industry growth this year due to the expected blockbuster launch of Take-Two's Grand Theft Auto VI and new consoles.
However, the delay of the long-awaited title to next year and price hikes to videogame hardware, arising from tariffs, have made consumer spending uncertain.
The global videogame market is projected to grow 3.4 per cent to $188.9 billion in 2025, compared with last year's growth of 3.2 per cent, according to the report.
""This forecast reflects concrete changes, hardware cycles, pricing trends, install base growth, and title pipelines,"" said Michiel Buijsman, principle analyst at Newzoo.
Compounded annually, Newzoo expects the market to grow 3.3 per cent till 2027, compared with its earlier forecast of 3.7 per cent
As GTA VI is scheduled to launch in 2026, the industry will most likely see the boost from sales next year along with the release of other premium titles such as Capcom's Resident Evil Requiem.
The launch of GTA VI on PC is also expected to carry growth through 2027, the report said.
Price increases to Microsoft's Xbox and Sony's PlayStation devices have sparked fears of slower hardware sales as consumers globally grapple with market uncertainty.
Xbox also unveiled its own handheld console, the Xbox Ally, earlier this month, developed in partnership with ASUS and set to launch in holidays 2025.
However, despite this uncertain trajectory of videogame uptake, earlier this month, as per AFP, the Switch 2 smashed records to become the fastest-selling console ever after gamers snapped up 3.5 million units in its first four days.

Minister highlights reforms at SPIEF, invites investors to explore Pakistan's mineral potential
Federal Minister for Energy Ali Pervaiz Malik is leading Pakistan's delegation to the St Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF) 2025 from June 1821, 2025.
According to an official statement issued Thursday, Malik held key meetings on the sidelines of the forum, including one with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Tsivilev, who also chairs the Pakistan-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC). Both sides discussed avenues for cooperation in energy, connectivity, trade, investment, banking, insurance, mining, and people-to-people exchanges.
Russia expressed strong interest in expanding bilateral cooperation and welcomed the upcoming 10th session of the IGC, scheduled for the second quarter of 2025 in Islamabad.
Malik also met with Alexey Shemetov, First Deputy Director of Rosatom Minerals, and invited the corporation to invest in Pakistan's mining sector, particularly in technology transfer and sharing expertise on enhancing safety and efficiency. Shemetov agreed to explore investment opportunities and submit proposals for collaboration in Pakistan's mining sector.
In a high-level panel discussion titled 'The Responsibility of World Leaders for Mineral Reserves and Production for the Sustainable Development of Global Economy,' Malik presented Pakistan's recent reforms in the mining sector at the SPIEF 2025. He highlighted the newly launched Mining Framework Policy and the completion of the Reko Diq Mine feasibility study as major steps toward creating an investor-friendly environment for sustainable mineral development.
He underscored the successful Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum, held in Islamabad in April 2025, as a turning point for the sector.
""Under the leadership of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan has undertaken comprehensive reforms to become a top destination for mining investment,"" said Malik. ""Our new policy offers unparalleled opportunities in copper, gold, and critical minerals, while ensuring environmental stewardship and community benefits.""
He added that Pakistan has harmonised its legal framework with international standards through consultations with global legal firms. These reforms, he said, would unlock vast mineral resources through responsible development. Pakistan's mineral wealth, he added, is not limited to copper or gold but there are vast reserves of lithium and other rare earth elements.
The minister noted that these initiatives were successfully unveiled at the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025, which saw strong participation from global mining leaders. He extended a formal invitation to international investors to participate in the next edition of Pakistan's Mineral Investment Forum.
Multiple international mining companies expressed keen interest in participating in Pakistan's minerals forum. The positive engagement reflects growing confidence in Pakistan's reformed mining landscape.

Trump keeps world guessing on war decision,"PK
US president to make Iran decision in 'next two weeks'
US President Donald Trump said Thursday he will decide whether to join Israel's strikes on Iran within the next two weeks as there is still a ""substantial"" chance of negotiations to end the conflict.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt read out a message from Trump, saying there had been ""a lot of speculation"" about whether the United States would be ""directly involved"" in the conflict.
""Based on the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place with Iran in the near future, I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks,"" Trump said in the statement.
The announcement could lower the temperature and give space for diplomacy, after a fevered few days in which Trump said Iran's leader was an ""easy target"" and vowed that Tehran could never have a nuclear weapon.
But Leavitt also told reporters that Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in the space of a ""couple of weeks.""
""Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon. All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that, and it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon,"" she said.
Leavitt would not give details of what had led Trump to believe that negotiations with Iran were possible, but denied he was putting off a decision.
""If there's a chance for diplomacy the president's always going to grab it, but he's not afraid to use strength as well,"" Leavitt said.
The spokeswoman said ""correspondence has continued"" between Washington and Tehran when asked about reports that Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff had been in touch with Iran's foreign minister.
Trump held his third meeting in three days in the White House's highly secured Situation Room on Thursday as he continued to mull whether to join Israel's bombing campaign.
The White House meanwhile urged Trump supporters to ""trust"" the president as he decides whether to act.
A number of key figures in his ""Make America Great Again"" movement, including commentator Tucker Carlson and former aide Steve Bannon, have vocally opposed US strikes on Iran.
Trump's promise to extract the United States from its ""forever wars"" in the Middle East played a role in his 2016 and 2024 election wins.
""Trust in President Trump. President Trump has incredible instincts,"" Leavitt said.
Meanwhile, Israel bombed nuclear targets in Iran on Thursday and Iran fired missiles and drones at Israel after hitting an Israeli hospital overnight, as a week-old air war escalated with no sign yet of an exit strategy from either side.
Following the strike that damaged the Soroka medical centre in Israel's southern city of Beersheba, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tehran's ""tyrants"" would pay the ""full price"". ""Are we targeting the downfall of the regime? That may be a result, but it's up to the Iranian people to rise for their freedom,"" Netanyahu said.
""Freedom requires these subjugated people to rise up, and it's up to them, but we may create conditions that will help them do it."" Defence Minister Israel Katz said the military had been instructed to intensify strikes on strategic-related targets in Tehran in order to eliminate the threat to Israel and destabilise the ""Ayatollah regime"".
As darkness fell on Thursday evening, Iranian media reported air defences engaging ""hostile targets"" in northern Tehran. Israel's sweeping campaign of airstrikes aims to do more than destroy Iran's nuclear centrifuges and missile capabilities. It seeks to shatter the foundations of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's government and leave it near collapse, Israeli, Western and regional officials said.
Netanyahu wants Iran weakened enough to be forced into fundamental concessions on permanently abandoning its nuclear enrichment, its ballistic missile programme and its support for militant groups across the region, the sources said.
Three diplomats told Reuters that Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi have spoken by phone several times since last week. In an apparent reference to the US, Iran's Supreme National Security Council said on Thursday it would use a different strategy if a ""third party"" joined Israel in the war.
STRAIT OF HORMUZ THREAT
Earlier, Israel said it had struck Iran's Natanz, Isfahan and Khondab nuclear sites. It initially said it had also hit Bushehr, site of Iran's only functioning nuclear power plant, but a spokesperson later said it was a mistake to have said this.
An Iranian diplomat told Reuters Bushehr was not hit and Israel was engaged in ""psychological warfare"" by discussing it. Any attack on the plant, near Arab neighbours and housing Russian technicians, is viewed as risking nuclear disaster.
On Thursday, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said it had launched combined missile and drone attacks at military and industrial sites linked to Israel's defence industry in Haifa and Tel Aviv.
Israel reported missiles launched from Iran towards its territory. Iran has been weighing its wider options in responding to the biggest security challenge since its 1979 revolution. A member of the Iranian Parliament's National Security Committee Presidium, Behnam Saeedi, told the semi-official Mehr news agency Iran could consider closing the Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of daily global oil consumption passes.

Answering the host's question on making love last, Fazila commented on the ever-changing nature of love, saying that in the early stages of a relationship, ""Love is accompanied by friendship, but when you have spent time with each other, a different kind of bonding develops.""
She added, ""Once kids come into the picture, a different kind of love evolves."" According to her, the key to keeping love alive is ""regard, and respecting each other's sacrifices,"" and valuing each other's commitment to spend life together through thick and thin.
The couple, who tied the knot in 1993, have two sons together, Ahmed and Zorain. Fazila further stressed the importance of personal space in relationships, saying, ""Love is not you sticking to someone like a sticker and assuming everything will always stay the same way."" She explained that love isn't about losing yourself in another person, but about understanding and respecting each other's individuality.
""We are not twins who are supposed to do the same kind of things,"" the Kashish actor said. ""We are two different individuals who come from different backgrounds. We understood each other and changed ourselves.""
On modern relationships
Fazila maintained that a ""fake feminism"" as evidenced by slogans like ""Mera Jism Meri Marzi"" has ruined many relationships.
Fazila's critique of the slogan ""Mera Jism Meri Marzi"" follows a pattern seen among several Pakistani celebrities who have publicly dismissed or misrepresented it. Actor Yasir Hussain, husband of host Nida Yasir, previously mocked Aurat March placards on social media, and Faysal Quraishi also criticised the slogan as ""vulgar.""
However, Aurat March organisers have consistently defended the slogan as a demand for bodily autonomy. Their Instagram account clarified that it ""means an enforcement of a human right every individual is born with, but women, trans, and non-binary people are robbed of.""
Joining the conversation, Kaiser compared a household to a country, saying that just as a country runs on its economy, a home depends on financial stability. He said that a man who provides well for his family naturally feels more protective and secure. ""If another country looks at your country with an evil eye, then your country, or in this case, the establishment of the household, should be strong enough to defeat them.""
Fazila has spoken previously about her relationship in a separate TV appearance, sharing that she manages all internal household matters, while Kaiser takes care of things outside. ""The rule in our house is that I oversee all household matters, and Qaiser is not allowed to interfere,"" she said, laughing. She added that she sometimes advises him on his outside work, but she never listens when he tries to interfere in the house. She joked that while she is not a typical mother-in-law, Kaiser has a ""hidden mother-in-law"" inside him. Her daughter-in-law is slightly afraid of him, but shares a friendly bond with Fazila.
In another interview in 2024, Fazila spoke about the importance of care and sacrifice in marriages. ""Everyone's become far too career-oriented,"" she insisted. ""I'll remove gender here. What this does is that the one who has to sacrifice says, 'Why should I? You should sacrifice.""

The couple had four daughters and a son. Faisal revealed that he had once intervened during a domestic dispute, warning Shabbir to stop mistreating his sister after Tahira Bibi informed him that Shabbir had tortured her and her daughter Ansa. However, on June 18, another heated altercation took place.
Faisal visited the couple again. Once he reached the house, he witnessed the two engaged in a loud argument. Tahira and Ansa, expressing despair over the continued abuse. told him that they were considering ending their lives. Shortly afterward, both women ingested poisonous tablets.

War on women,"US
Every year, we mourn the tragedies of the past and the violence of now and walk in processions
Another Muharram approaches. Once again, we will gather and mourn wearing black while remembering a tyrant's violence and a family's sacrifice. But let this not be another year where we ritualistically grieve Karbala and then return to silencing our women. Let this not be another Muharram where we cry over Yazid's cruelty while enabling our own.
Because if not for a woman, Islam wouldn't have survived. Not the Quran you recite. Not the Hadith you forwarded. Not the faith you gatekeep while violating every principle it upholds. Islam would never have made it past its earliest trials, political boycotts, economic starvation and rebellions, if it weren't carried on the backs, in the arms, and through the voices of women.
Before Islam had a following, it had Bibi Khadijah (RA), not just a supporter, but the first believer. A businesswoman. A strategist. A financier. The one who bankrolled the mission of the Prophet (PBUH) when no man dared. When Quraysh exiled him, it was her caravan, her gold, her unwavering faith that sheltered him.
It was Bibi Fatima (AS) who bore the lineage through which the Ahlul Bayt lived on. The axis of legacy. The embodiment of strength in grief. It was Aisha (RA) who brilliantly narrated over 2,000 hadith and debated scholars. Her voice helped shape the jurisprudence we now cite while refusing to let women speak in the same rooms.
And then came Bibi Zainab (AS), shattered, shackled, but unafraid. After Karbala had become a graveyard and her brother Imam Hussain (AS) lay slaughtered in the sand, it was she who rose, not with weapons, but with words. Dragged to the court of Yazid, surrounded by mockery, she did not ask for mercy. She gave a sermon. She didn't break. She broke him. She was not just surviving. She was defying.
And yet today, in a land that recites their names in every sermon, we silence their daughters. We call it modesty when we erase them. We call it culture when we kill them. We turn their resistance into relics, then light candles at their graves. As though mourning without action ever saved anyone.
In 2024 alone, over 5,200 cases of gender-based violence were reported in Pakistan — murders, rapes, forced marriages, suicides, disappearances. We call our daughters Zainab, but fear their fire. We call them Aisha, but shush their speech. We call them Khadijah, but question their independence. We call them Fatima, but scorn their principles. We want them quiet. Covered. Passive. We fear their intellect, police their tone and question their clothing.
Every year, we mourn the tragedies of the past and the violence of now and walk in processions. We cry for Karbala and for today's graves. And then? We go back. Back to honour killings, child brides, acid attacks. To clerics who blame women, politicians who mock abuse, courts that shame victims, and homes where daughters are silenced. We mourn the dead but never protect the living. Guilt has never been enough.
You cannot grieve Karbala and ignore the women being buried in your own neighbourhood. You cannot claim love for Imam Hussain (AS) while tolerating Yazid's spirit in your own actions. If your grief does not make you just, then it is performance. If your rituals don't translate into compassion, then they are empty. If you cry for the women of Islam but ignore the pain of living women, then you are the problem.
Because Karbala was not just a battlefield. It was a woman with a voice. And she didn't whisper. Because Muharram will come and go. But the Yazid of today doesn't need a throne; he rules from homes, offices, police stations, pulpits, parliaments, WhatsApp groups, comment sections, and benches. All he needs is a gun, a platform, and our silence.
And too many others, like the armies that watched Karbala unfold, just looked away. Had Bibi Zainab stayed silent, you wouldn't even have a story to tell. So tell it. Live it. Let this be the year your grief grows a spine.

Sahulat Bazaars to offer year-round relief,"US
Punjab government allocates Rs10 billion for initiative
The Punjab government has begun preparations for establishing 100 Sahulat Bazaars across the province, aiming to curb inflation and ensure consistent access to essential goods at notified prices.
Announced as a Special Chief Minister's Initiative under the Fiscal Year 202526 Budget, the project carries an allocation of Rs10 billion. Unlike previous short-term Ramazan markets, the Sahulat Bazaars will be permanent, purpose-built marketplaces established in every tehsil. These facilities will provide essential food and household items at government-notified prices in regulated environments designed to ensure the dignity and convenience for all consumers.
Construction is under way at 13 sites, including Jaranwala, Pattoki, Sharaqpur, Muzaffargarh, Okara, Khanewal, Narowal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Chunian, Wazirabad, Bhalwal, Noshehra Virkan, Jalalpur and Burewala. The government has already disbursed Rs3.4 billion for the initial projects, which are expected to become operational by August.
The initiative also includes mobile markets, currently active at 15 locations across Lahore, aimed at improving access in densely populated areas while curbing encroachment and price gouging.
Additional measures include free home delivery services, Sahulat Stalls offering prices below official rates, solar-powered bazaars, and upgrades to 36 existing facilities.
Punjab Sahulat Bazaars Authority (PSBA) chief Naveed Rafaqat Ahmad affirmed that the government is treating the project with ""unmatched urgency"".
The target is to have all 100 bazaars operational before Ramazan next year.
To accelerate the rollout, Secretary of Planning, Coordination and Monitoring Dr Ehsan Bhutta convened a meeting to enforce tight deadlines for concept paper submissions and early funding releases. Divisional commissioners across Punjab have been instructed to fast-track land identification and resolve implementation hurdles.
The PSBA, an autonomous authority, is overseeing the execution of the initiative. Officials say the programme represents a shift toward institutionalised price relief.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Food Authority (PFA) launched legal action against a poultry supplier after intercepting a vehicle carrying dead chickens intended for sale in Lahore, seizing over 1,800 kilogrammes of diseased and unfit meat, officials said on Wednesday.
The operation by a PFA enforcement team took place in the Chak Dhera area on the outskirts of the city. A loader rickshaw transporting dead poultry was stopped and an FIR was registered against the supplier.
As part of a crackdown on unsafe practices, a safety task force also inspected more than 217,000kg of meat from 53 suppliers and warehouses in Tollinton Market. Meat prepared from birds suffering from various diseases was found and discarded on the spot.
""Preparing meat from dead or sick birds is a serious crime,"" said the PFA director general, adding that investigations are under way to identify those involved in the supply chain of tainted poultry.
He said the PFA is committed to aligning the meat processing and transportation with international standards. He said the authority is employing all available resources to dismantle what he termed an adulteration mafia operating in Punjab.
He urged the people to purchase poultry that is slaughtered in their presence to ensure health safety and to report violations on the PFA helpline.

Cotton woes hurt textile exports,"US
Rising imports, US trade deal tensions hit sector despite monthly growth
Pakistan's textile exports — the country's largest export-earning sector and a crucial pillar for its trade balance — recorded a 2% year-on-year (YoY) decline in May 2025, totalling $1.53 billion compared to $1.55 billion in the same period last year.
The drop was primarily driven by reduced shipments of cotton yarn, cotton cloth, bedwear, towels, and tents & canvas, which fell by 34% YoY, 22% YoY, 3% YoY, 11% YoY, and 11% YoY, respectively, according to data compiled by Taurus Securities.
The textile exports, however, posted a strong month-on-month (MoM) recovery in May 2025, surging by 25% compared to April 2025, driven by improved shipments of cotton yarn, value-added textile products, and made-up articles such as art silk and other specialty textiles.
According to a report by Taurus Securities, total textile exports during May 2025 reached $1.53 billion.
Basic textile exports showed a noticeable fall on a yearly basis, totalling $181 million — a decline of 24% YoY. The slump mainly stemmed from reduced exports of raw cotton products such as yarn and cotton cloth. In contrast, value-added exports demonstrated resilience, posting a marginal 2% YoY increase to $1.2 billion, while other textile exports rose to $177 million.
Cotton imports during the first eleven months of FY25 reached $1.18 billion, showing a substantial increase of 2.2 times compared to $370 million in the same period last year. The surge was triggered by a sharp 34% YoY decline in domestic cotton arrivals due to poor crop output.
Despite this, local cotton prices remained relatively stable in May 2025 at Rs16,700 per maund, indicating that the market absorbed the supply shortfall without significant price volatility.
Looking ahead, the outlook for cotton production in FY26 is optimistic. Analysts expect an increase in cultivation areas and average yields, aided by early sowing activities in Punjab. This anticipated rise in domestic cotton availability could reduce dependence on costly imports and restore balance to the local supply chain.
The government's recent move to impose an 18% sales tax on imported cotton yarn under the FY26 budget is intended to bolster local yarn manufacturers. However, other critical raw materials like cotton remain exempt from sales tax and GST when supplied locally — a policy inconsistency that continues to squeeze domestic producers and distort market competitiveness.
Meanwhile, the ongoing US-Pakistan trade negotiations are seen as a double-edged sword for the textile industry. While Pakistan has agreed to increase imports of US cotton to secure greater access to American markets for its finished textile products, this commitment may lead to added stress on local cotton growers and spinners by intensifying import reliance.
The textile sector's mixed performance in May highlights the competing forces shaping Pakistan's largest export industry: strong global demand for value-added products versus domestic supply constraints in raw cotton. Taurus Securities suggested that a recovery in local cotton production, supportive policy adjustments, and successful trade talks with the US will be critical to sustaining export growth and preserving industry competitiveness in FY26.

Slugfest in the Middle East,"US
President Trump wanted a 'deal' with Iran on the Nuclear Enrichment issue
Slugfest, yes; but of no ordinary consequences. It will take the world to keep it contained. Iran in the western construct is Middle East, not West Asia, and it is important to note. It comes under the geographical responsibility of US Central Command that oversees the Middle East. Israel too is a part as is Pakistan on its eastern most boundary.
Nothing moves in the US CENTCOM AOR without its consent or at least without its notice. To imagine anything else is naïve. That is why the CENTCOM was created with its forward Headquarters conveniently placed in Al Udeid in Doha, Qatar. General Kurilla, the CENTCOM Chief, knows it all.
Dial back a few weeks. President Trump wanted a 'deal' with Iran on the Nuclear Enrichment issue. Iran too wanted to settle now that a more aggressive administration was in power in Washington with its own peculiar worldview and willingness to support Israel to establish its dominance over the Middle East. For the more pliable wary of Israeli prowess there exist the Abraham Accords to help secure their future for Israel's acceptability only if Iran, the remaining stumbling block, could be subdued.
The Houthis in Yemen would then easily acquiesce too. Iran's aspiration to be a nuclear power was already established. Agreement with the P5+1 had laid limits on Iran's ambition (Iran is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty). But then Trump chose to dump the Agreement in 2018, three years after the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) was first signed. It opened the space for Iran to pursue its nuclear enrichment programme at its own pace. The IAEA could visit to inspect if Iran was complying to the limits of enrichment levels and the stockpiled enriched uranium.
Iran though built in greater ambiguity. It is said that Iran moved significantly ahead of its below-5 per cent limit on enrichment under the Agreement and held a significantly higher value of stockpiled enriched uranium than stipulated. In 2023 it was reported that Iran had enriched up to and over 83 per cent level. It was barely short of the magical 90 per cent mark to turn into a weapon.
Trump in his second term, aware of the leeway the US exit had afforded Iran, sought an immediate renegotiation of the deal to rein Iran in. Implicitly he may have had in mind to reinforce his credentials of a deal and a peacemaker before the Alfred Nobel Committee. Israel did not seem to agree nor did some from within Trump's team.
Donald Trump's was the stated position. More likely it left space for its partner, Israel, to eliminate or at the least significantly degrade Iran's nuclear programme as a living and present danger to Israel's long-term health and security. Iran had/has two major nuclear enrichment facilities, one at Natanz, that Israel struck with some effect in the ongoing war with Iran, and at Fordow near Qom, which is far more sophisticated and secure where enrichment levels are suspected to have been breached.
When Iran was reluctant to enter negotiations, Trump declared a sixty-day window for Iran to agree to a deal proposed by the US, else the cost to Iran would be heavy and unbearable in military terms. Five rounds down and sixth on the anvil when it was more than likely that Iran was coming around to agree on most terms, Israel attacked Iran. It was the sixty-first day from the day Trump had announced the window of opportunity. Coincidence? Or a well deliberated execution? I don't think it needs much thought.
What has followed since June 13 has been a conflagration ready to envelop the whole region unless handled with care. Both sides rain missiles on each other and wreak untold pain and misery. Soon, civilian populations will be the victims to test and breach their threshold of tolerance and of the two societies and their political masters. In a slugfest, one who can absorb more is usually the one to prevail. Mohammad Ali, the late Boxing Champion, perfected this art and established a psychological edge over his opponent by inviting him to give him body blows.
The national character of Iran and its thousands of years of civilisational history and the size of its population hold it in better stead than Israel which is still young as a nation even if it boasts of a history of suffering over centuries. In the Iranian character, death is celebrated albeit with remorse; in the Israeli experience suffering and victimhood is emphasised to gain empathy. These two characteristics will hugely define the ultimate victor in the civilisational sense.
Either Iran will now run out of its missiles or Israel will breach its threshold of pain. Each may be the first sign for that side to find accommodation or exhaust itself to desperate resort. How might Iran's nuclear programmes be affected will depend on the damage the programme suffers, possibly delaying the timeline for weaponising its ability – an important Israel-US aim for this war.
Negotiations will surely follow when the war finally ends but how much Iran may give to the US will depend on how Iran has fared in the war in perceptions and in real terms. If Iran seems to have held her line resolutely the regime and the ongoing system in power will sustain and survive – it can surely outrun Israel in this madmen race. Or if the US offers it a chance for peace on terms that may save the regime and buy time and keep foundations of Iran's nuclear programme, Iran may take that route. It would be prudent in a long game. It will also save the region from chaos, uncertainty and falling dominoes which are sure to follow. Regime change, the deeper or implicit political objective, is a more complicated and extended effect of the war and where might it first happen, Iran or Israel, is moot.
What is of essence here is that Israel and its supporters are now loudly calling for the US to intervene on Israel's behalf; that Israel with its existing capacity cannot complete the mission of eliminating Iran's nuclear programme. Iran's resilience and unexpectedly ferocious response on an overly sensitive Israeli psyche to the losses amidst their population centers is the key to shout for the patron to come to the rescue. Israel stands exposed with its civilisational inadequacies. This is Iran's great achievement.
Similarly, were Trump to jump in and directly attack Iranian assets it shall not only be an act of desperation but will also puncture Trump's long held position of withdrawing from forever wars. Iraq is what he always refers to as an example. Iran will still survive despite Fordow but what carnage may ensue at the US installations in the Middle East will only expand, engorge and envelop all the Middle East which will be rendered chaotic, explosive and uncontrollable for years to come. Iraq, Libya and Syria stand as sorry examples of such ill-thought adventurism. More likely better sense will prevail despite Netanyahu's Israel.

Salaried class slams 719% rise in tax burden,"PK
They urged the government to raise the tax-free salary slab to Rs100,000 per month
Representatives of the Salaried Class Alliance Pakistan have raised serious concerns over the proposed Finance Bill 2025-26, calling it unfair to the country's most tax-compliant group.
Speaking at a press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Thursday, alliance members Bilal Farooq Alvi, Rizwan Hussain, Adeel Khan, and Lesha Fazal said salaried individuals have seen their tax contributions rise from Rs76.44 billion in FY2018-19 to over Rs550 billion in FY2024 -25 — a jump of nearly 719%.
They said this increase reflects inflation and policy changes, not real income growth. Key concerns include taxation on pension funds, increased taxes on bank and mutual fund profits, and the continued 10% surcharge on high-income earners, while undocumented sectors remain untaxed.
They urged the government to raise the tax-free salary slab to Rs100,000 per month, restore earlier slab rates, reduce the top slab to 32.5% and the second-highest to 27.5%, and keep the lowest slab at 1% as per the budget speech.
They also demanded the reinstatement of tax credits for insurance, education, and investments, removal of the 10% surcharge, and equal treatment of all taxpayers.
