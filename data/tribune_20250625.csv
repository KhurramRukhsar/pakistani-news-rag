"Couple dies, child survives in road crash","US
The injured child was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.
A road accident claimed the lives of a couple from Attock on Tuesday, while their young child miraculously survived with injuries in the scenic Kaghan Valley. According to police, the family's vehicle skidded off a mountainous road and plunged hundreds of feet into a deep ravine.
The incident occurred near a sharp curve, where the vehicle lost control and fell into a fast-flowing stream below. Rescue 1122 and local volunteers conducted a challenging operation to retrieve the bodies.
The injured child was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.
Eyewitnesses described the scene as deeply distressing, leaving both tourists and locals shaken. This is the latest in a series of accidents that have marred the ongoing tourism season in Kaghan and Naran valleys.
Earlier this year, three people — including a child — died in a similar crash near Batakundi, while another incident near Jalkhad left multiple tourists injured when a car overturned on a slippery road due to over-speeding.
Despite safety measures such as increased patrolling, warning signs, and awareness campaigns, road accidents in the region continue to rise. The KDA and district administration have once again urged tourists to drive cautiously, especially on steep slopes and blind turns, and called for stricter enforcement of road safety protocols.

Raducanu praises Wimbledon,"US
The former US Open champion had been followed by a man
Briton Emma Raducanu said she felt reassured about her safety after Wimbledon prevented a man who had been stalking her from buying tickets for the Grand Slam that begins on Monday.
The former US Open champion had been followed by the man to WTA events in Singapore, Abu Dhabi and Doha earlier this year and she broke down in tears after noticing him during one of her matches at the Dubai Championships in February.
The man was given a restraining order by Dubai police and banned from all Tour events but officials at Wimbledon, which is organised by the All England Club, had to block him following a sweep of the public ballot applicants.
""Wimbledon and everyone did an amazing job,"" Raducanu told the BBC. ""I got a notification, the police contacted me and told me everything was OK.""
""I know that I'm not the first athlete to go through this, and I probably won't be the last — not just as an athlete, but females in general.""
The 22-year-old, who had not yet been born when then world number one Monica Seles was stabbed in the back by a fan at an event in 1993, said she felt much safer with extra security at events.
""I have a lot more protection around me — especially the ones here in the UK, where it's busy and there's more spectators around. I feel a difference, and that reassures me and makes me feel more comfortable,"" she added.
Raducanu also praised British number two Katie Boulter for sharing her experience of online abuse.
""I try and not read the comments or look at the messages because it makes you upset,"" she said. ""It doesn't matter how many positive comments you read, you are always going to remember the more negative ones — so I just try and stay away.""

13m passports issued in two years,"US
Directorate working round the clock to clear the backlog
Authorities have issued over 13 million passports in the last two years, including 130,318 to the overseas Pakistanis via online service, as the country witnesses a surge in demand for this vital travel document, according to the annual performance report of the Directorate of Immigration and Passports.
According to the report, the directorate has been working round the clock to clear the backlog and provide prompt service to the citizens. It said that the total number of the Pakistani passports issued to the people has reached 232 million.
The data showed that for the past 17 years, the authorities have been issuing 3.4 million passports annually. However, a surge has been witnessed in the demand for passport during the last two years. As a result the issuance increased to 6.7 million passports annually. In the last 16 years, the directorate collected a total of Rs295.7 billion as the passport fee. In the last two years, the amount has doubled to Rs40 billion annually. Last year, the department issued 53 Pakistan Citizenship Certificates, 4,447 renunciation certificates and one naturalisation certificate.
The report says that the directorate has upgraded its Infrastructure and introduced modern security features. It included 32 new passport counters across the country and round-the-clock passport provision facility in all major cities of the country.
Ten modern passport printers and 6 laminators have been purchased for timely printing of passports, while an e-gate system is being introduced on passports across the country linked to e-passports. The passport app has also been updated. During the last year, the passport department has been built as per modern requirements. The department is committed to providing easy services to Pakistani citizens around the world, DG Passports Mustafa Jamal Qazi said.

Female pharaoh's erasure unrelated to gender,"SG
Why did Queen Hatshepsut's stepson destroy her statues?
She was one of ancient Egypt's most successful rulers, a rare female pharaoh who preceded Cleopatra by 1,500 years, but Queen Hatshepsut's legacy was systematically erased by her stepson-successor after her death.
The question of why her impressive reign was so methodically scrubbed has attracted significant debate, but in new research published Monday, University of Toronto scholar Jun Wong argues far too much emphasis has been placed on her gender.
""It's quite a romantic question: why was this pharaoh attacked after her death?"" Wong told AFP, explaining his interest in a monarch who steered ancient Egypt through a period of extraordinary prosperity.
Earlier scholars believed Queen Hatshepsut's stepson Thutmose III unleashed a posthumous campaign of defilement against her out of revenge and hatred, including because he wanted to purge any notion that a woman could successfully rule.
""The way in which (Hatshepsut's) reign has been understood has always been coloured by her gender,"" Wong said, referencing beliefs that Thutmose III may have viewed her as ""a kind of an evil stepmother.""
Hatshepsut ruled Egypt roughly 3,500 years ago, taking over following the death of her husband Thutmose II.
Wong reassessed a range of material from damaged statues uncovered during excavations from 1922 to 1928.
He said there is no doubt Thutmose III worked to eliminate evidence of Hatshepsut's achievements, but his efforts were ""perhaps driven by ritual necessity rather than outright antipathy,"" Wong said.
Thutmose III may have been trying to neutralise the power of his predecessor in a practical and common way, not out of malice.
He also found that some of the statues depicting Hatshepsut were likely damaged because later generations wanted to reuse them as building materials.
""For a long time, it has been assumed that Hatshepsut's statuary sustained a vindictive attack,"" Wong said, arguing that a fresh look at the archives suggests ""this is not the case.""

Samar talks about co-star Aina,"US
'Parwarish' star on new drama, fans shipping
Samar Abbas Jafri and Aina Asif have captured the hearts of Pakistani drama fans through their on-screen chemistry and compelling performances in Parwarish. Sharing a candid off?screen friendship as well, Aina and Samar play Maya and Wali in the hit TV series.
In an interview with a local news outlet, Samar said that he is happy that fans are enjoying his pairing with Aina. ""If you are playing a character and they are showing a 'love angle', and people love it, what's better than that for the actors?"" Samar added, ""Chemistry is the most important thing for the male and female leads.""
Talking about what he feels he has in common with Wali, he said, ""I could relate to that character because one of his biggest struggles was about music."" Samar, who released the music video for Hoor earlier this month, said Wali's arc made him reflect on his journey as a musician, confessing, ""I thought I was not good enough for music."" Building confidence in his music was not easy, but the young actor is grateful for the positive reception of his songs for the drama series.
Parwarish is a family drama that delves into the emotional complexities of parenting and adolescence, exploring how generational trauma, pressure, and societal expectations shape young minds. The story follows two teenagers, played by Aina and Samar, as they navigate rigid upbringings, conflicting family dynamics, and the search for personal identity.
The duo first appeared together in the 2023 hit Mayi Ri, where Samar played Fakhir and Aina portrayed Annie. Critics and audiences alike praised their acting skills, and the internet was soon ""shipping"" the pair. In a recent interview with Buzz, Aina echoed her co-actor's sentiments, ""We are very good friends, and I don't mind fans shipping us together,"" she said.
""I wouldn't want it to happen with anyone else."" Aina explained, ""Because that would make me uncomfortable to work with them then. But with Samar, I'm comfortable because we share such a good bond. And I know that he always has the best interest and heart for me.""
Earlier this year, while appearing on a local channel's morning show, the duo appeared with their Parwarish castmates Reham Rafiq and Abul Hasan. Talking about the themes of their drama, the Gen Z actors gave their take on parenting. Samar advised parents not to pressure their children to do things, ""If you force them, kids become rebellious."" Talking about facing challenges, Aina said, ""Before delving into solutions, we must first identify the problem,"" building on her own life experiences and how parents can help their children successfully.

"Six killed, 10 injured in Quetta bus inferno","US
Balochistan government orders inquiry to ascertain cause of fire
In a tragic incident, at least six people lost their lives and more than ten others sustained injuries when a passenger bus suddenly caught fire near the Western Bypass in Quetta, the provincial capital of Balochistan.
Rescue teams rushed to the site and shifted the injured to nearby hospitals for urgent medical treatment.
According to eyewitnesses, the fire broke out during the journey, causing panic and chaos among the passengers. Rescue personnel managed to save several individuals through prompt action, but unfortunately, six individuals succumbed to their injuries.
The Balochistan government expressed deep sorrow over the tragic incident and has ordered an immediate inquiry into the cause of the fire.
Provincial government spokesperson Shahid Rind extended heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families. He said the injured are being provided immediate and quality medical care, adding a formal investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the fire.
He noted that strict legal action would be taken against those found responsible, adding all possible assistance will be provided to the victims and their families.
The spokesperson further said all relevant authorities are fully mobilized and hospitals are providing the injured necessary facilities and support.
This incident is yet another grim reminder of the dangers posed by reckless driving, poor vehicle maintenance, and inadequate road safety measuresfactors that continue to claim precious lives in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan.
Such accidents, unfortunately, have almost become the order of the day, highlighting the urgent need for reform and enforcement of safety standards on public transport.
CM discusses province issues with NP chief
National Party (NP) chief and former chief minister Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch called on Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti on Tuesday.

RDA halts promotions amid fraud probe,"US
NAB, Punjab fact-finding committee begin summoning current and former officials
Over a month after a major financial scandal involving Rs1.94 billion surfaced in the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), the administration has begun implementing key reforms to restore financial discipline.
As an initial step, the implementation of an irregular promotion has been halted, and a revised framework for financial authority has been introduced.
Under the new structure, the director finance and deputy director finance have been jointly authorised to approve financial transactions up to Rs0.5 million.
According to sources, these reforms come in response to ongoing investigations by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment, and a fact-finding committee set up by the chief secretary.
The scandal involved the unauthorised transfer of Rs1.94 billion in public funds to various companies and individuals through Call Deposit Receipts (CDRs).
In the first phase of corrective actions, the promotion of building inspector Nadeem Jamal has been suspended. Initially working in the engineering department, Jamal was promoted from Grade 11 to Building Superintendent (Grade 16) and subsequently to Assistant Director Engineering (Grade 17). However, a fresh directive has now halted the implementation of his most recent promotion, pending the committee's final decision.
In parallel, significant reshuffling has taken place within the finance department. Sohaib Ahmed Qazi, previously Director Finance, has been appointed Deputy Director State Management while continuing to hold additional charge of Director Finance and Administration. Meanwhile, Masood Arshad, formerly Deputy Director of State Management, has been reassigned as Deputy Director Finance.
Under the new management, both officials will co-sign all cheques up to Rs0.5 million and jointly manage the bank account used for RDA staff salaries, pensions, utility bills, and other routine expenses.
It is worth noting that a dual-signatory system for higher-value cheques was already in placerequiring signatures from both the director general and director finance for amounts exceeding Rs0.5 million.
However, years of weak oversight and poor monitoring enabled manipulation of the CDR mechanism, which ultimately led to the massive embezzlement.
Investigations suggest the CDR-based system remained unchecked for nearly a decade, allowing for widespread misuse of public funds.
NAB probes scam
On the other hand, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has begun summoning both serving and retired officers of the RDA in connection with the alleged embezzlement in government funds.
All former directors of administration and finance who served over the past decade are being called in phases, with summons already issued. Separately, the fact-finding inquiry committee set up by the Punjab chief secretary is scheduled to hold its second session on Wednesday (today) in Lahore to further investigate the matter.
On Monday, several key officials, including RDA Director Land Malik Ghazanfar, who has been the Director of Admin and Finance in RDA, Assistant Director Finance Waqar Asghar Raja, retired Assistant Director Khawaja Arshad Javed, and other officials from the Finance Directorate, appeared before NAB, Rawalpindi.

Justice for sale: true cost of plea bargains,"US
This isn't just unsustainable, it's corrosive.
The Communist Manifesto (Marx, 1996) opens with a spectre, an idea so disruptive that it promised to upend entire class structures and build a society where development was free and fair. The dream, of course, was grand.
But like most idealisms, it tripped over its blind spot: humans. Marx theorised systems but underestimated their participants. William Golding may have understood better: we do not destroy systems, we build them to destroy themselves.
Plea bargaining, in Pakistan, is one such self-defeating system. A mechanism born of necessity, marketed as reform, and now repurposed as cover for legalised impunity.
It started with a logic: courts are overwhelmed, cases drag on for decades, prisons are overcrowded. Let the accused confess, pay back a portion of what they stole, and be released. On paper, it's pragmatic. In practice, it's industrial-scale laundering – of money, names and responsibility.
In the United States, plea bargains function within a known structure. There's Rule 11, sentencing guidelines, judicial supervision. It is flawed, certainly, and often accused of coercing confessions from the poor. But the system at least performs its due process. There is a courtroom. There is a record. There is the illusion of checks.
Pakistan, in contrast, has no need for illusions. Section 25 of the National Accountability Ordinance allows for what is called ""voluntary return"" or a ""plea bargain""— terms that suggest civility. What actually happens is that the accused confesses, offers a settlement figure, and in return is granted freedom. No trial. No conviction. No record. No stigma.
We don't even pretend this is justice. We just call it ""recovery"".
And some recover remarkably well. The public was defrauded in three separate housing projects by an individual who settled each case with NAB without conviction. Each time, he re-emerged with a fresh business name, a clean legal history, and a ready market. This is not a loophole. This is the system.
At the centre of it stands the NAB chairman. He decides who gets to bargain, what the terms are, and when the deal is done. The courts are often little more than silent endorsers. Victims are not asked. The public is not told. The media may report a number, but the documents stay tucked away.
And still, we insist on calling this deterrence. As though the quiet return of stolen wealth is the same as punishment. As though justice can be transacted like a tax dispute.
The logic unravels when you start asking who actually benefits. The accused avoids prison. The state reclaims a portion of the loss. And the public, the ones defrauded, receive nothing. No apology. No compensation. No closure. A man who steals from the state pays the state and walks away. It's restorative, yes, but only for the powerful party in the room.
The rest of us are left watching from the gallery.
In another time, we held public trials. Witch-hunts, literal ones. The Salem witch trials were brutal, but at least they were honest about their spectacle. Now we conduct no trial at all. Guilt is negotiated, not examined. Evidence is sidestepped in favour of receipts. The public is asked to believe that the return of a few billion rupees justifies the loss of accountability.
We have created a justice system with no memory. No scars. No institutional record. A man can offend, confess, pay, and return to public life as though nothing happened. Repeat offenders are welcomed back into business. Sometimes even into politics. And we nod approvingly because the docket is lighter.
And what of those who don't or can't bargain?
They rot in jails that barely qualify as habitable. The accused poor are thrown into remand cells where illness spreads faster than legal representation. Those accused of petty theft or minor offences endure years awaiting trial. They do not get settlements. They get silence.
Plea or drown. That's the real choice.
And yet, we continue to treat the return of embezzled funds as a moral victory. When Changpeng Zhao of Binance was fined $4.3 billion in the United States, he still served time, albeit only four months. Sam Bankman-Fried, the FTX founder who refused to settle, got 24 years.
The contrast is staggering, but also revealing. In the US, even the largest financial criminals receive punishment, but it still reflects the same inequality: cooperation is rewarded, wealth softens consequences, and high-profile plea deals come with PR statements, not moral reckoning. It's not a triumph of justice, it's a controlled descent.
But even that descent exists. In Pakistan, there is no fall at all. Accountability ends with a cheque. The wealthier the crime, the better the outcome.
This isn't just unsustainable, it's corrosive. It erodes what little faith remains in institutions. It reinforces the idea that laws are for the poor, and negotiations are for the elite. It teaches that crime, when well-funded, is not only survivable, it's reversible.
Plea bargaining doesn't need to be abolished. But it must be reformed beyond recognition. All agreements must be made public. Repeat offenders must be disqualified. Judicial oversight must be meaningful, not procedural.
And the power to investigate must be distinct from the power to pardon. Most importantly, victims. Whether individuals or the public at large, must have a place at the table.
Until then, what we have is not justice. It is a system of selective mercy, reserved for those who can afford it.
Because here, justice isn't blind. It knows exactly who you are. And how much you're worth.

Khawaja dismisses retirement rumours,"US
The batter says he still has a role to play
Usman Khawaja on Tuesday reaffirmed his commitment to Australia's Test team, insisting he still has plenty to offer as he prepares to return to the top of the order against West Indies — and help guide emerging opener Sam Konstas.
Speaking to the media at Barbados ahead of the Test against West Indies, Khawaja showed confidence that his experience and role remain vital as Australia enters a new era following David Warner's retirement.
""I understand I'm 38 years old — people will always look for an excuse. I still have a role to play, opening the batting, providing a solid start, and setting up a platform for Australia,"" he said.
Reflecting on his strong bond with Warner — built over 41 innings together — Khawaja said he hopes to develop a similar understanding with Konstas, both on and off the field.
""With young Sammy coming in, it's an added role for me — helping him through his journey and passing on knowledge. I won't be around forever, so it's important to build some stability at the top and guide him while I can. He's still very young, and it's exciting to see what he can do,"" Khawaja said.
Despite questions about his output against high-quality seam attacks — he averages 25.29 against pace since January 2024, slightly below the global opener average of 27.84 — Khawaja defended his record.
""I don't understand how people say I struggle against seam if I've scored so many runs in Shield cricket and been Australia's top scorer in the WTC. As an opener, you face the new ball every time — that's just the nature of the job. I wish I could face more spin,"" he said.
The Sydney Test at the end of this year's Ashes is often touted as a possible farewell stage for Khawaja, but unlike Warner, he has resisted putting an end date on his career.
""I'm not someone saying I want to play another 10 years — it's about what's best for the team. I could have stopped two years ago, but I knew I was still contributing. When that changes, everyone will know,"" he concluded.

The revised structure aims to enhance child identity verification and close loopholes that were previously exploited in human smuggling.
The new system introduces age-specific protocols for registration. For children under the age of three, NADRA will issue a CRC without a photograph or biometric data, and this certificate will automatically expire when the child turns three. Once the child reaches 10 years of age, a full biometric profile, including fingerprints, photographs, and iris scan (where available), is compulsory

Consumer confidence at highest since 2022,"US
CCI records increase of 9.2% over previous quarter and 24.6% improvement vs same period last year
The overall Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) recorded a notable increase of 9.2% over the previous quarter and exhibited a substantial 24.6% improvement compared to the same period last year.
According to the 18th edition of the Pakistan Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) for Q4 FY2024-25 — based on interviews conducted during April-May 2025 by Dun & Bradstreet Pakistan in collaboration with Gallup Pakistan — consumer confidence regarding both the overall economic environment and individual financial conditions has improved.
The CCI report assesses consumer sentiments across four key areas: Household Financial Situation, Country's Economic Situation, Unemployment, and Household Savings. This index offers insights into the ""Current Sentiments,"" reflecting economic shifts experienced in the past six months, as well as ""Future Expectations,"" ie, expected changes in the next six months. The CCI is measured on a scale ranging from 0 to 200, with 100 serving as the neutral benchmark. A score below 100 indicates consumer pessimism, whereas a score above 100 reflects optimism.
The latest survey results reveal that the CCI stands at 96.2 points, marking an improvement from the previous quarter's score of 88.1. This upward shift reflects growing optimism among consumers, particularly in their financial outlook and expectations for the future.
""The CCI report serves as a critical reference for policymakers, financial institutions, and businesses. This quarter, we have observed a continued upward trajectory in consumer confidence, supported by improvements in financial sentiment and future expectations,"" said Muhammad Zubair Qureshi, Chief Business Officer of Dun & Bradstreet Pakistan. ""The fact that the Future Confidence Index has surpassed the 100-point benchmark for the first time since the launch of this report is a significant indicator of growing public optimism. However, persistent concerns around employment emphasise the need for sustained economic reforms and inclusive job creation strategies,"" he added.
The Net Indicator for Household Income increased significantly from 98.3 to 110.0, reflecting a rise in consumer confidence regarding future income. Similarly, the Household Financial Situation registered the highest Net Indicator this quarter, with over half of the respondents expecting their financial conditions to improve or remain stable. Consumer expectations for Household Savings also improved, with 57% anticipating either stability or growth in the coming months.
Despite improvements in financial optimism, concerns about employment persist, with 61% of respondents perceiving a rise in unemployment over the last six months. However, the overall confidence levels have improved compared to the previous cycle, with 57% of consumers expecting economic conditions to improve or remain stable.
A demographic analysis revealed that consumer confidence improved across all segments. The highest rise in optimism was recorded among respondents under the age of 30, who showed an 8% increase in confidence compared to the previous year, followed by male respondents.
""In Q4 2025, consumer confidence has continued its upward trajectory. The CCI is now at its highest level since Gallup & Dun & Bradstreet began tracking it in 2022,"" said Bilal I Gilani, Executive Director of Gallup Pakistan. ""For the first time, the Future Confidence Index has crossed the 100 mark — a key threshold indicating that more Pakistanis are optimistic about the economy's future than those who are pessimistic. These are all positive and vital signs for our economic outlook,"" he added.

PR to assemble 200 Chinese trains,"US
.
Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi stated on Tuesday that 200 advanced Chinese trains are currently being manufactured at the Railway Carriage Factory under a technology transfer agreement.
He made these remarks while speaking at the ""Meet the Press"" event at the National Press Club in the federal capital.
Abbasi called the development of Pakistan Railways (PR) key to the country's progress, highlighting the major initiatives taken during his first 100 days in office that have resulted in meaningful improvements.
He said the uplift of PR is also vital for the success of strategic projects such as Thar Coal, Reko Diq, and regional connectivity. ""Without the upgradation of ML-1, ML-2, and ML-3, the development of railways cannot be envisioned,"" he stated.
Abbasi maintained that 200 advanced Chinese trains are currently being manufactured at the Railway Carriage Factory through a technology transfer agreement.
On the occasion, he noted that the Punjab government had allocated billions in the 2025-26 budget, including Rs250 billion for three years for the renewal of the Lahore-Rawalpindi track — expected to reduce travel time between the two cities to two hours and benefit over 30 million people.
Additionally, Rs50 billion was earmarked for the development of eight railway stations, and Rs9 billion allocated for the upgradation of level crossings across Punjab to help reduce accidents.
The minister shared that the Balochistan government has allocated Rs3 billion, with a commitment to increase the amount, for upgrading existing stations and establishing new ones. He added that development initiatives are also being planned in Sindh and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Highlighting passenger amenities, Abbasi said that steps have been taken to improve the overall passenger experience - including the establishment of information desks, sanitation facilities, upgraded food outlets at stations, a modern helpline system, and other services.

Jesus actor visits Vatican,"NL
'The Chosen' star Jonathan Roumie will meet Pope Leo
A US actor known for playing Jesus on a popular television show visited the Vatican on Monday.
Jonathan Roumie, star of the streaming series The Chosen about the life of Jesus Christ, spoke at an event ahead of a special Vatican screening of an episode from the fifth season of the show, which will release internationally in July.
Roumie was joined by fellow cast members Elizabeth Tabish, George Xanthis, and Vanessa Benavente, who respectively play Mary Magdalene, St John the Apostle, and Mary, the Mother of God.
""Coming to the Vatican is always an honour,"" Roumie, a practicing Christian, told Reuters. ""The possibility of getting to meet the newest pontiff is extraordinary.""
The Chosen is a historical drama that follows the life of Jesus Christ – from gathering disciples to his ultimate persecution at the hands of the Roman empire.
Season 5 includes Jesus's last supper with his disciples and many of the renowned biblical events just before his death.
The cast came to the Vatican a day after wrapping up three weeks of shooting for the sixth season of the show which will portray the crucifixion, an episode filmed in the southern Italian town of Matera.
One of the world's oldest continuous human settlements, with stone houses cut from surrounding cliffs, some of which have been occupied for millennia, Matera stood in for Jerusalem.
US filmmaker Mel Gibson also used the Italian town for his 2004 film about the crucifixion, The Passion of the Christ.
Roumie and the other cast members are set to meet Leo, the first US pontiff, during the pope's general audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday.
The show's creator, Dallas Jenkins, originally financed the pilot of The Chosen through crowdfunding in 2017. The series will come to an end with its seventh season, focused on Jesus' resurrection. Reuters

Water crisis intensifies in Hyderabad,"US
Tanker mafia, filtration plants thrive, administration least bothered
A severe water crisis has grappled the city due to the inefficiency and negligence of the Hyderabad Water and Sewerage Corporation (HWSC). Despite the abundance of water in the Indus River and the continuous discharge of water from the Kotri Barrage into three canals — Akramwah, Old Phuleli and New Phuleli — the city's residents are facing a dire shortage of drinking water.
The corporation's failure to supply the required 60 million gallons of water per day has forced citizens to rely on expensive water tankers or filtration plants. The administration is neither taking action against them nor providing an alternative system to the citizens. Civil society members claim that the water shortage has been deliberately created to benefit certain elements. The crisis has affected various parts of the city, including Kohisar, Latifabad, Hyderabad City, Phuleli, Preetabad, Tando Tayyab, Faqir ka Pirr, Gaari Khata, Khokhar Mohalla, Qazi Qayyum Road area, Pakka Qila, and Qasimabad. Even mosques in some areas lack water for ablution.
Major political parties, religious, social, and business organisations have maintained a criminal silence on this issue.
With the holy month of Muharram approaching, the demand for water is expected to increase manifold during majalis and nazr-o-nayaz at homes.

"Tariff cut on chemicals, plastic stokes concerns","PK
Industry claims it is already on verge of collapse due to high energy and raw material costs, elevated taxes
The chemical and plastic manufacturing sector has voiced serious concerns over the proposed tariff reduction on the import of chemicals and plastics.
According to industry experts, such changes could trigger an irreversible decline in a sector that forms the backbone of Pakistan's industrial value chain. The local industry has urged the government to maintain the current tariff regime for fiscal year 2025-26 and initiate broader, multi-stakeholder dialogue before making long-term changes.
The chemical industry contributes 3-4% of national gross domestic product (GDP) and supports over 300,000 direct and indirect jobs. Annually, it enables import savings of over $7 billion, makes exports of $1.2 billion and pays more than Rs700 billion in taxes and duties.
Industry players claim the sector is already on the verge of collapse due to structural disadvantages including high energy tariffs, exorbitant raw material costs, elevated capital costs and heavy taxation. Gas prices in Pakistan have increased nearly fourfold in the last three years for most captive power plant-based chemical players, rendering them uncompetitive versus peers in other countries.
Adding to this challenge is a corporate tax burden of approximately 37%, far higher than the average rate of 20-25% in countries like Vietnam, Bangladesh and India.
Despite these challenges, listed companies in the industry have collectively invested Rs100 billion in the last three years to expand production capacity and improve operational efficiency. Stakeholders have asked the government to maintain the current tariff regime for FY26 and begin broader consultations.
The case for tariff reduction is a hypothesis, which suggests that reduced duties will start Pakistan's journey towards export-led growth. This theory is contestable.
There are several petrochemicals like polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP) that have minimum duties today; if lower tariffs could drive exports, Pakistan would have tangible PE and PP downstream product exports, which is not the case.
On the contrary, the export of petrochemicals protected through tariffs is higher. Two petrochemical companies were also among top 50 exporters in 2023 because they invested over and above the local market and were able to export surplus products and generate foreign exchange, a path that India follows to date. It is also important to note that anything imported for exports is duty free under the Export Facilitation Scheme, which means tariffs don't affect exports.
Critics argue that export schemes are complex, but that's not the case; if a company can't manage documentation for export schemes, it's unlikely they'll compete in the global trade system, which requires extensive compliance and documentation.
As Pakistan considers reforms to stimulate long-term growth, many in the industry are advocating deeper consultation. Industry players say tariff changes must be part of a broader, sequenced industrial policy, not standalone interventions.

"Pakistan, Russia aim to remove barriers","US
Envoy vows to facilitate clearance of potato consignments
Pakistan and Russia on Tuesday deliberated on key issues concerning bilateral trade in the agriculture sector and committed to deepening cooperation and addressing trade barriers.
The issues came up for discussion during a meeting between Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain and the ambassador of the Russian Federation.
The minister highlighted the challenges faced by Pakistan's citrus and potato exports to Russia during the current year. He emphasised the importance of resolving such issues to ensure smooth continuation of trade and mutual economic benefits.
He informed the ambassador that the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) had conducted a comprehensive technical investigation into the concerns raised by the Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (FSVPS) of the Russian Federation. The DPP's findings were supported by scientific literature, seasonal pest survey reports and laboratory results, which collectively demonstrated that claims of presence of the Mediterranean Fruit Fly in Pakistan were not substantiated. Following extensive technical exchange, the FSVPS withdrew the specific objection to citrus imports.
In response, the ambassador assured the minister that he would immediately take up the matter with relevant authorities in the Russian Federation to facilitate the clearance of potato consignments.

KSE-100 index registers second highest increase of over 6,000 points in buying spree
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) skyrocketed over 6,000 points on Tuesday as US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, bringing an end to regional hostilities.
The benchmark KSE-100 index surged at the open, where bullish momentum drove it to the intra-day high of 122,725, up 6,557 points. As the session progressed, investor confidence strengthened, culminating in the KSE-30 index hitting its upper circuit breaker, a rare and historic moment that sent a wave of excitement.
Market activity was further buoyed by renewed macroeconomic optimism, including news of Pakistan's plans to secure $3.3 billion in external financing from Chinese banks. Trading activity was robust, with 805 million shares changing hands valuing at Rs38 billion.
At the end of trading, the KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 6,079.17 points, or 5.23%, and settled at 122,246.64.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Deputy Head of Trading Ali Najib commented that regional peace ignited a rally at the PSX, which posted the second-highest surge of over 6,000 points in a day. The KSE-100 ended trading at 122,247 points by easily crossing the psychological barrier of 120,000.
Earlier, the bourse opened on a strong note with an increase of over 4,000 points post-ceasefire between Iran and Israel. There was across-the-board stock buying, which lifted the benchmark index to the high of 122,725 in intra-day trading, he said.
On the macro front, Najib pointed out, Pakistan plans to secure $3.3 billion via syndicated and refinanced commercial loans from Chinese banks, potentially boosting forex reserves to over $14 billion. ""Now, all eyes are on the 130,000 index level by month end.""
Topline Securities, in its review, said that the local bourse opened with a bang as investors cheered the breakthrough ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, which brought a welcome pause to rising geopolitical tensions in the region.
Riding on a wave of optimism, the KSE-100 index surged at the commencement of proceedings, clocking in an eye-popping 4,202-point jump. The bullish momentum intensified as the session progressed, culminating in a historic moment, when the KSE-30 index hit its upper circuit breaker, it said.
The KSE-100 reached the intra-day high of 6,557 points, before settling at 122,247, up a whopping 6,079 points, or 5.23%. The brokerage house called it a remarkable session that reflected renewed investor confidence and the return of broader risk-on sentiment.
Top contributors to the index were Lucky Cement, Engro Holdings, UBL, Pakistan Petroleum and Oil and Gas Development Company (OGDC), which collectively added 1,795 points.
Pakistan State Oil (Rs2.4 billion), OGDC (Rs1.98 billion), Pakistan Petroleum (Rs1.62 billion), Lucky Cement (Rs1.60 billion) and DG Khan Cement (Rs1.49 billion) dominated in terms of traded value, signalling strong interest in key blue-chip and mid-cap names, Topline added.
In its commentary, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) noted that diplomatic resolution to the Middle East conflict triggered a sharp rally in risk assets globally.
At the PSX, 96 shares rose while two fell on the KSE-100. Earlier, trading was halted following a 5% rise for the index. Lucky Cement (+9.4%), Engro Holdings (+7.85%) and UBL (+4.29%) contributed the most to index gains, AHL observed.
""Pakistan is aiming to secure $3.3 billion in two foreign loans – one a syndicated loan and the other refinancing of commercial loans – from Chinese banks. This will take State Bank's forex reserves above $14 billion in FY25,"" it said. ""With the KSE-100 regaining its hold on the 120,000 range, 130,000 points comes back into focus.""
According to JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala, the PSX soared as ceasefire in the Middle East triggered a buying spree. ""Just seconds after the market halt ended, the KSE-100 index surged over 6,500 points, sparking widespread euphoria,"" he said.
Bullish sentiment dominated the entire session, pushing the index to the intra-day high of 122,725. Investors jumped in across sectors, encouraged by signs of geopolitical de-escalation.
""Near-term outlook remains positive, with fresh opportunities in cement, banking and fertiliser sectors,"" the analyst added.

Two female drug suspects exonerated,"US
They had been in jail for several months
Judge Muhammad Akmal Khan of the Special Court for Drug Control exonerated two sisters in the alleged smuggling case of 164kg of drugs.
The court ruled that unclaimed narcotics cannot be falsely attributed to any citizen. The sisters, Aasiya Bibi and Gul Naz were arrested while travelling on a public transport vehicle, which also had a driver, young children and several other male passengers.
According to the prosecution, 117kg of hashish and 47kg of opium were allegedly recovered from the vehicle, not from the possession of the women.
Advocate Shan Zeb Khan, appearing on behalf of the sisters, argued that the narcotics were found unattended in the vehicle and not in the immediate proximity of the women's seats. Despite this, the police arrested only the two women, leaving the male driver and other male passengers untouched.
They had been in jail for several months, which worsened their household conditions, family issues and domestic problems. Both women had no prior record of involvement in any criminal case, and their arrest seemed to be based solely on suspicion.
The court underscored the importance of evidence-based prosecution, stating that no one can be declared guilty on mere suspicion without any evidence.

Polluted water alarms Ghulam Muhammadabad residents,"US
Foul-smelling supply triggers health fears
Thousands of residents in Ghulam Muhammadabad have been forced to endure foul-smelling tap water for the past days, accusing the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) of ignoring repeated complaints and failing to resolve the issue.
Locals report that the piped water supplied by WASA has a pungent, unpleasant odour, making it nearly impossible to consume.
Kashif Ahmad, a resident of Tower Wali Street, told media that despite lodging a complaint with the WASA consumer centre and its official helpline (1334), no action has been taken.
""No one has contacted us, and no one has visited to inspect the problem,"" he said.
Another local resident, Muhammad Aslam, expressed frustration over the matter, saying many families are considering relocating to other areas due to what he termed WASA's ""indifference and delaying tactics.""
Muhammad Din added that no technical team from the Water and Sanitation Agency had shown up despite the issue persisting for two days.
""We are fed up and will be forced to take to the streets if this continues,"" he warned.
Akbar Ali blamed the crisis on the deteriorating condition of the drinking water supply infrastructure and aging sewerage pipelines.
""If WASA doesn't act, we'll hold a sit-in outside the Zila Council and Deputy Commissioner Office,"" he said.
WASA's response has only added to residents' anger. Amin Dogar, in charge of the agency's complaint cell, said he was unaware of the issue but promised to follow up if the situation persists.
Similarly, another official, Sohail Qader Cheema, claimed he had not been informed but would issue orders to address the matter.
A gastroenteritis outbreak had previously erupted in the same locality due to the deteriorated sewerage infrastructure, resulting in the tragic deaths of at least six residents after consuming polluted water.
An official further said that a two-member WASA team recently visited the area and collected water samples from various streets.
He said the situation would become clearer within a day or two once the test results are received.

Pakistan warns UNSC of dire TTP threat,"US
Ambassador Iftikhar urges Kabul to deny terrorists safe haven
Pakistan informed the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Tuesday that the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the largest UN-designated terrorist group operating from Afghan soil with an estimated strength of around 6,000 fighters, poses a direct threat to Pakistan's national security.
Participating in a debate on the situation in Afghanistan, Pakistan's permanent representative to UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said that terrorist entities, including Al-Qaeda, the TTP, and the Baloch militant groups, continued to operate from ungoverned spaces in Afghanistan.
The Pakistani envoy also voiced concern over the potential destabilising impact of the situation in Iran following unprovoked Israeli attacks and warned that a refugee influx from Iran could pose significant challenges for the neighbouring countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
""Terrorism emanating from Afghanistan remains a serious threat to its neighbours, particularly Pakistan,"" Ambassador Ahmad told the 15-member UNSC. He pointed out that the TTP had safe havens close to the Pakistani border.
As part of defensive measures, the envoy said, Pakistan has confiscated a significant cache of modern weapons originally left behind by international forces in Afghanistan when they departed after the Taliban captured Kabul four years ago.
In April, the Pakistani envoy continued, 54 TTP terrorists, attempting to infiltrate Pakistan were neutralised by the Pakistani security forces, an incident underscoring the scale and seriousness of the threat.
""We also have credible evidence of collaboration between the TTP and other groups, such as the BLA [Baloch liberation Army] and its Majeed Brigade, aimed at disrupting strategic infrastructure and economic development projects in Pakistan,"" Ambassador Ahmad said.

"Trump pressures Iran, Israel into ceasefire","US
Pezeshkian, Netanyahu both claim victory; Tehran signals willingness to talk to US; Oil prices plunge, stocks rally
A shaky ceasefire began to take hold between Israel and Iran on Tuesday under pressure from US President Donald Trump, raising hopes for an end to the biggest ever military confrontation between the Middle East arch-foes.
Both Iran and Israel sent signals that the 12-day air war had concluded, at least for now, after Trump scolded them for violating a ceasefire he announced at 0500 GMT.
Israel's military lifted restrictions on activity across the country at 8pm local time (1700 GMT), and officials said Ben Gurion Airport, the country's main airport near Tel Aviv, had reopened.
Iran's airspace likewise will be reopened, state-affiliated Nournews reported. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country had successfully ended the war in what he called a ""great victory"", according to Iranian media.
Pezeshkian also told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Tehran was ready to resolve differences with the United States, according to official news agency IRNA.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also claimed a historic win. The developments came after what appeared to be a shaky start to the truce, seen as a critical step to de-escalating the worst fighting between Iran and Israel in decades.
Both Israel and Iran took hours to acknowledge they had accepted the ceasefire and accused each other of violating it, underscoring the fragility of the truce between the two bitter foes and the challenge of achieving lasting peace between them.
Trump scolded both sides but aimed especially stinging criticism at Israel, telling the close US ally to ""calm down now"". He later said Israel called off further attacks at his command.
Israel's defense minister, Israel Katz, said he told his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, that his country would respect the ceasefire unless Iran violated it. Pezeshkian likewise said Iran would honour the ceasefire as long as Israel did, according to Iranian media.
Whether the Israel-Iran truce can hold is a major question given the deep mistrust between the two nations. But Trump's ability to broker a ceasefire showed Washington retains some leverage in the volatile region.
Israeli armed forces chief of staff Eyal Zamir said a ""significant chapter"" of the conflict had concluded but the campaign against Iran was not over. He said the military would refocus on its war against Hamas in Gaza.
Iran's military command also warned Israel and the United States to learn from the ""crushing blows"" it delivered during the conflict.
Iranian authorities said 610 people were killed in their country by Israeli strikes and 4,746 injured. Iran's retaliatory bombardment killed 28 people in Israel, the first time its air defenses were penetrated by large numbers of Iranian missiles.
Oil prices plunged and stock markets rallied worldwide in a sign of confidence inspired by the ceasefire, which allayed fears of disruption to critical oil supplies from the Gulf.
CEASEFIRE VIOLATIONS?
Earlier in the day, Trump admonished Israel with an obscenity in an extraordinary outburst at an ally whose air war he had joined two days before by dropping massive bunker-buster bombs on Iran's underground nuclear sites.
Before departing the White House en route to a NATO summit in Europe, Trump told reporters he was unhappy with both sides for the ceasefire breach but particularly frustrated with Israel, which he said had ""unloaded"" shortly after agreeing to the deal.
""I've got to get Israel to calm down now,"" Trump said. Iran and Israel had been fighting ""so long and so hard that they don't know what the f**k they're doing.""
Netanyahu's office acknowledged Israel bombed a radar site near Tehran in what it said was retaliation for Iranian missiles fired three-and-a-half hours after the ceasefire was due to begin. It said Israel had decided to refrain from further attacks following a call between Netanyahu and Trump, but did not explicitly say whether the strike on the radar site took place before or after they spoke.
The Islamic Republic denied launching any missiles and said Israel's attacks had continued for an hour-and-a-half beyond the time the truce was meant to start.
A SENSE OF RELIEF
In both countries there was a palpable sense of relief. ""Who mediated or how it happened doesn't matter. The war is over. It never should have started in the first place,"" said Reza Sharifi, 38, heading back to Tehran from Rasht on the Caspian Sea, where he had fled with his family.
Arik Daimant, a software engineer in Tel Aviv, said: ""Regrettably, it's a bit too late for me and my family, because our house back here was totally destroyed in the recent bombings last Sunday. But as they say, 'Better late than never', and I hope this ceasefire is a new beginning.""
Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One heading to the NATO summit, Trump said he did not want to see Iran's ruling system toppled.
""Regime change takes chaos and ideally we don't want to see so much chaos,"" he said. A senior White House official said Trump brokered the ceasefire deal with Netanyahu, and other administration officials were in touch with the Iranians. Qatar's Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani secured Tehran's agreement during a call with Iranian officials, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters on Tuesday.
Israel launched the surprise air war on June 13, hitting Iranian nuclear sites where it said Iran was trying to develop an atomic bomb and killing top military commanders in the worst blow to the Islamic Republic since the 1980s war with Iraq.
Iran says its uranium enrichment programme is for peaceful purposes and denies trying to build nuclear weapons.

Russian strikes kill 19 in Ukraine region under pressure,"US
.
Russian missiles on Tuesday crashed into schools, hospitals and kindergartens in central Ukraine, killing at least 19 people and wounding nearly 300 in a region coming under mounting pressure.
The attacks came as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky arrived in the Netherlands to meet with allies on the sidelines of the NATO defence alliance summit. He is expected to meet with US President Donald Trump on Wednesday to discuss more sanctions on Russia and arms procurement, a senior Ukrainian source told AFP.
Trump has struggled to deliver on his vow to quickly end the Ukraine war, now in its fourth year.
He clashed bitterly with Zelensky at the White House in February, which stunned Ukraine's Western allies.
Since then, Zelensky has been at pains to try to mend the relationship. The pair had a brief sit-down at the Vatican in April.
In the aftermath of Moscow's latest attack, emergency services in the industrial Dnipropetrovsk region, now threatened by Russian battlefield advances, published photos of rescuers helping civilians covered in blood. ""Putin destroys lives, that's how he defines control. If he can kill people, destroy homes, blackmail others, he believes he has power,"" Zelensky said on X.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga said the strikes amounted to a ""rejection of peace"" from Russia, which has rebuffed US and Ukrainian ceasefire proposals.

NEPRA issues notice to K-Electric over load-shedding,"US
Says outages based on technical and commercial losses violate law
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has served a show-cause notice on K-Electric (KE) over failure to comply with its instructions relating to forced load-shedding.
The regulator pointed out that KE had been resorting to load-shedding based on aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses, which violates the Nepra Act and the Performance Standards (Distribution) Rules, 2005.
According to the authority, distribution companies (DISCOs) are bound to maintain plans and schedules to shed up to 30% of their connected load at any time upon instructions from the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC).
This load must be divided into separate, switchable blocks that can be disconnected as directed by NTDC. Copies of these plans must be shared with NTDC.
Nepra emphasised that NTDC, where possible, should provide distribution companies with advance warning of impending load-shedding to help maintain system voltage and frequency in line with the Grid Code.
NTDC is also responsible for instructing distribution companies about the specific amount of load to be disconnected and the timing, using clear and unambiguous communication based on approved plans.
Previously, on January 8, 2025, Nepra issued an explanation to KE under Regulations 4(1) and 4(2) of the Nepra (Fine) Regulations, 2021, citing non-compliance with its directives.
The regulator stated that KE had been implementing load-shedding based on AT&C losses, which violates the Nepra Act and the Performance Standards (Distribution) Rules, 2005.
In this practice, entire feeders with commercial losses – such as electricity theft and non-payment – are shut down for hours, even when some consumers on those feeders are fully compliant and regularly pay their bills. ""Nepra considers this unfair to compliant consumers.""
In response to this practice, the authority had initiated and concluded legal proceedings, resulting in a Rs50 million penalty on KE.
""Nepra continues to stress that load-shedding should only be carried out at the Pole Mounted Transformer (PMT) level and only when absolutely necessary – such as in the case of generation shortages or transmission constraints, and only under instructions from system operators.""
Meanwhile, KE launched a project in 2021 to install Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) and Automated Meter Reading (AMR) system at the distribution transformer level, costing Rs600 million.
The project aimed to identify energy losses due to theft and non-payment and to facilitate commercial benefits. KE also claimed that these meters would enable remote connection and disconnection at the transformer level. The project was completed in December 2021, with a test run conducted through June 2022.
Nepra reviewed the project's records, reports and KE submissions and found that while the company has reaped commercial benefits from the AMI/AMR system, it has not utilised the technology to provide relief to consumers by performing targeted load-shedding at the PMT level, despite the capability to do so.
Furthermore, during public hearings on monthly fuel cost adjustments (FCA), Karachi residents widely complained about excessive and unfair load-shedding, reinforcing Nepra's concerns.
A KE spokesperson regarding Nepra's show-cause notice stated, ""KE is currently reviewing the show-cause notice received from Nepra. After a comprehensive review, we will submit our response in line with the timeframe set by the authority.""

Poverty alleviation: what really makes a difference?,"PK
Self-employment also plays a key role in lifting families out of poverty.
Poverty headcount in Pakistan has risen to 44.7% as per updated poverty line for lower income countries, according to a recent World Bank report. This means 108 million people have been pushed below the poverty threshold.
Poverty remains one of most pressing challenges, despite decades of economic reforms and policy efforts aimed at improving living standards. The real question is: what truly drives meaningful change? There are specific factors which, if prioritised by the state, have the potential to make a significant difference.
Education proves to be one of the most influential contributors to poverty alleviation and welfare improvement. Education not only increases earning potential but also improves access to better jobs and strengthens social mobility.
Self-employment also plays a key role in lifting families out of poverty. Households engaged in self-owned businesses or small enterprises experiences significant improvement in welfare.
This highlights the importance of promoting entrepreneurship and creating an environment where small businesses can thrive. In both urban and rural areas, access to healthcare, utilities like electricity and clean water, and adequate housing are closely linked to higher welfare levels. Affordable healthcare, especially for children and women, has a particularly strong impact. Having reliable access to basic services improves the quality of life and contributes to long-term poverty reduction.
Another critical factor is the role of social safety nets, particularly in rural areas. Government cash transfer programs, such as the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), provides valuable support for the poor, especially during economic shocks.
Surprisingly, the paid employment often failed to improve welfare levels. In fact, households with members in regular paid jobs experiences reduction in welfare. This is mainly due to low wages, job insecurity and wage inequality, especially in rural areas and low-skilled sectors. This suggests that simply having a job is not enough — it must offer fair pay and decent working conditions.
Asset ownership, particularly agricultural land, is not as effective in improving welfare as many would expect. This is largely due to the unequal distribution of land in Pakistan, where a small number of wealthy landowners control most of the valuable farmland. As a result, land ownership does not significantly help poor households improve their living conditions.
There also exist significant gender disparities. Female-headed households have welfare levels lower than male-headed ones, reflecting deep-rooted gender inequality. Women continue to face limited access to economic opportunities, lower wages and fewer educational chances. There is a clear difference in poverty dynamics between urban and rural settings.
In cities, education, self-employment and access to services like health and utilities are the strongest contributors to welfare improvement. In rural areas, social safety nets and access to basic health services are more critical, while land ownership and regular jobs offers limited benefits.
This means that one-size-fits-all solutions do not work. Urban and rural areas need different types of support, and policymakers must design region-specific strategies to effectively fight poverty.
The moment has arrived for the state to rethink its strategy for poverty alleviation. Economic growth alone has not been enough to lift people out of poverty. To make real progress, the country must focus on equitable income distribution, improved wages and affordable access to education, healthcare and housing.
Policymakers should also promote self-employment and small businesses while strengthening social safety nets, especially for women and rural households. Increasing women's participation in the workforce and providing them with targeted skill development, especially in technology and vocational sectors, will be essential for future progress.
In short, fighting poverty in Pakistan requires focusing on people, not just profits. A fairer, more inclusive development model is the key to building a more prosperous and equal society for all.

Lecturer arrested over alleged harassment,"PK
Student claims teacher attempted abuse in exchange for higher marks
A visiting lecturer at the Islamia University of Bahawalpur (IUB) has been arrested on charges of attempted sexual harassment and bribery, following a complaint lodged by a female student of the IT department.
According to the FIR registered at Baghdadul Jadeed Police Station, the accused, Ahmed Mahmood, allegedly lured the student to his home under the pretense of helping improve her English paper marks — from 40 to 85.
Once there, he allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs50,000 and attempted to sexually harass her.
The student raised an alarm, prompting the lecturer to flee through the back door of his residence.
The complaint was first reported to the Chairperson of IUB's anti-harassment committee, who immediately referred the matter to the Vice Chancellor, Professor Kamran.
In response, the vice chancellor terminated the lecturer's services and imposed a ban on his entry into the university campus.
""The university will extend full cooperation to the police in their investigation,"" he said.
The police have taken the accused into custody and initiated a formal investigation after registering the case.

46 Gazans killed by Israeli fire,"US
United Nations slams US-backed aid system
Gaza's civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed another 46 people waiting for aid in the Palestinian territory on Tuesday as rights groups and UN agencies slammed the US-backed food distribution system.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that 21 people were killed and around 150 wounded by Israeli fire near an aid point in central Gaza early Tuesday, and that another 25 were killed in a separate incident in south Gaza.
""Every day we face this scenario: martyrs, injuries, in unbearable numbers,"" paramedic Ziad Farhat told AFP at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.
""Hospitals cannot accommodate the number of casualties arriving,"" he said.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) called the system an ""abomination"" while a spokesman for the UN human rights office, Thameen Al-Kheetan, condemned the ""weaponisation of food"" in Gaza.
According to figures issued on Tuesday by the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, at least 516 people have been killed and nearly 3,800 wounded by Israeli fire while seeking rations since late May.
The Israeli military said the reports of deaths near the Netzarim corridor were ""under review.""
Gaza civil defence spokesman Bassal reported a first deadly shooting ""with bullets and tank shells"" near the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza where thousands of Palestinians gather each night for rations from a nearby GHF distribution point.
The Israeli military later said that a crowd had been identified in an area ""adjacent"" to its troops.
France condemned what it called deadly ""Israeli fire"" against civilians in a statement from the foreign ministry apparently referring to the Netzarim corridor incident.

"Inmate killed, three injured in prison van ambush","BE
Police sources link attack to clash between two groups of Rind tribe
A prisoner died, while two others were injured, in an ambush on a prison van returning to the central jail in Khairpur, on Tuesday. Reportedly, one of the attackers was also injured in the exchange of fire.
Reportedly, the prisoners were disembarking when five armed men initiated an assault, killing inmate Muhammad Hashim Rind on the spot, and injuring inmates Imamuddin Rind and Sikandar Gopang. One of the assailants, identified as Wahab Rind, also sustained a bullet wound by a prison warden. He was later arrested. The injured individuals were shifted to Civil Hospital Khairpur, and are reportedly in serious conditions, while the deceased's inmate's body was handed over to his family after post-mortem.
Meanwhile, a police source reported that the clash between two groups of the Rind cast started around three months ago, after the killing of Nasir Hussain Rind. The slain inmate Hashim, and the injured inmate Imamuddin were arrested and imprisoned in connection with Nasir's murder. The ambush occurred when they were returning from the court hearing of the murder case.
SSP Khairpur visited the crime scene, and revealed that an investigation regarding the incident has started, and police have collected evidence from the crime scene.

Trump casts doubt on mutual defence,"US
Flies to Europe for NATO summit
President Donald Trump cast doubt on Tuesday over the United States' commitment to defending its NATO partners, suggesting there were ""numerous"" definitions to the cornerstone of the alliance's mutual defence pact.
Trump was speaking to reporters en route to a NATO summit in the Netherlands, a two-day gathering which is intended to signal to Russian President Vladimir Putin that NATO is united, despite the US president's past criticism, and determined to expand and upgrade its defences to deter any attack from Moscow.
However, pressed by reporters on Air Force One over whether he remained committed to mutual defence among allies as set out by NATO's Article 5, Trump responded: ""I'm committed to saving lives. I'm committed to life and safety.
And I'm going to give you an exact definition when I get there."" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte played down the comments.
""I have no doubt that the US is totally committed to NATO, totally committed to Article 5,"" he told reporters at the summit venue in The Hague. Trump also posted a screenshot of a message from Rutte congratulating him on his ""decisive action in Iran"" and getting all NATO allies to agree to spend more on defence.
""Europe is going to pay in a BIG way as they should, and it will be your win,"" Rutte's message read, indicating the effort he has put into keeping on the right side of Trump and ensuring the summit is a success.

Dairy sector shrinks 20% after GST blow,"US
Soaring costs stall investment, threaten industry: PDA
The government may have generated a revenue of Rs44 billion after the imposition of 18% General Sales Tax (GST) on dairy products in the last budget. However, this move has also resulted in a 20% drop in the production and sales of these products in Pakistan.
Some key office-bearers of the Pakistan Dairy Association (PDA) on Tuesday told the media that since July 2024, investment of millions of dollars has stalled in the dairy sector due to rising production costs.
Moreover, around 500 milk collection points — set up by dairy companies for purchasing milk from farmers — have also been shut down and 20% of the workforce has lost employment.
PDA Chairman Usman Zaheer, CEO Dr Shehzad Ameen, Noor Aftab and other officials stated that over 100 developed and developing countries, including India, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, the US, and the UK, do not impose taxes on packaged milk. Where taxes are levied, the rate is usually around 5%.
In response to a question, they said that before the 18% GST, the dairy sector was already contributing over Rs13.7 billion in revenue through income and super taxes.
But in 2024, the sudden imposition of GST pushed the total tax revenue — income tax, super tax, and GST — up to Rs44 billion — a significant increase on the surface, but one accompanied by a dangerous decline in dairy product sales and production, which threatens the industry's sustainability.
They warned that the decrease in dairy product sales will eventually reduce Federal Board of Revenue's (FBR) revenue collection and affect employment. They added that if the GST had been reduced, even higher tax revenues could have been achieved.
The PDA admitted that there is a public perception that loose milk is safer than packaged milk but this is not true. In Pakistan 92% of the population uses loose milk, which poses serious health risks, while only 3% to 4% consume packaged milk.
The association emphasized that taxation is a major challenge for this industry. Despite the obstacles, Pakistan's dairy sector has exported $35 million worth of packaged milk in the current fiscal year — double the amount compared to the previous year.
According to the association, 45% of loose milk is unsafe, due to higher risks of bacterial contamination, whereas packaged milk meets international safety standards. The official said Rs1.3 trillion loose milk economy remains undocumented, which needs to be brought under the tax net.
They also noted that Pakistan currently exports packaged milk to the Middle East, Africa, the US, and Central Asian countries, and efforts are underway to expand exports to China.

Monsoon preps criticised,"US
The lawmakers warned that the increasing likelihood of heavy rainfall, coupled with administrative negligence
The members of the Sindh Assembly belonging to the Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan (MQM-P) have criticised the city and provincial governments for their failure to take adequate precautionary measures ahead of the expected monsoon rains.
The lawmakers warned that the increasing likelihood of heavy rainfall, coupled with administrative negligence, could once again worsen the city's problems. They mentioned that despite repeated warnings and identification of issues, both local and provincial authorities have limited their action to mere lip service, particularly regarding the cleaning of roads and drains.
They pointed out that piles of garbage along streets, alleyways, and intersections have been left unattended for a long time.
During rainfall, these could clog pathways, cause traffic gridlocks, and severely increase public hardships. They further added that encroachments on stormwater drains and giant hoardings mounted on buildings pose serious safety risks and could potentially lead to major accidents.

Jeweller shot dead during robbery,"BE
Store's auto-lock door trapped robber, leading to his arrest
An attempted robbery at a jewellery shop turned deadly in the Sadiqabad police precinct near Haroon Chowk.
A man, posing as a customer and accompanied by a woman, tried to snatch gold items from the display. When the jeweller resisted, the armed suspect opened fire, fatally injuring him.
The robber was trapped in the store and arrested, however, the woman accompanying him managed to escape. According to police, Aqeel Abbasi reported that his brother, Aqeed Abbasi, owned the jewellery shop, and both were present at the time of the incident. A young man and woman arrived on a motorcycle and asked to see gold rings.
When Aqeed showed them the rings, the man attempted to snatch the box. Upon resistance, the suspect pulled out a pistol and demanded that all the valuables be handed over.
When Aqeed resisted again, the man opened fire and injured him. As the suspect tried to flee, the shop's auto-lock glass door shut, trapping him inside. In an attempt to break the door, he struck it with the butt of his pistol and injured himself. He was eventually overpowered with the help of others nearby. He was later identified as Imran.
Meanwhile, the woman accompanying him managed to escape in the crowd and the brother Aqeed succumbed to his injuries.
The police initially treated the incident as a financial dispute. However, after receiving a formal complaint from the victim's brother, a case was registered under charges of murder and robbery, and an investigation has been launched.

Capital to get UK-backed high-tech hospital,"GB
Novacare Hospital is set to open in Islamabad's DHA by 2026
London's Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust has signed its first official partnership with a Pakistani hospital, Novacare Hospital, to share clinical best practices and foster healthcare staff development.
Under the agreement, Imperial College NHS will provide expert consultation in hospital planning, training, and clinical guidance. In return, affiliate fees generated by Novacare will be reinvested into Imperial's NHS services in the UK.
The Novacare Hospital, currently under construction in Islamabad's DHA Phase, is scheduled to open in 2026. It aims to deliver advanced medical care across 28 clinical specialties including cardiology, oncology, orthopaedics, neurology, and maternal health. The facility will feature smart building management systems, AI-optimised elevators, and cutting-edge infection control and fall prevention technologies.
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott CMG OBE called the partnership a milestone in healthcare collaboration. ""This agreement is bringing the UK's world-leading healthcare expertise to Pakistan and, in turn, supports the UK's NHS. By sharing best practices and helping to develop clinical staff, this partnership will directly help save lives,"" she said.
The initiative is part of the UK's broader strategy to export NHS clinical standards globally. The partnership will also allow Novacare clinicians to observe NHS multidisciplinary meetings, consult UK specialists for second opinions, and receive training based on NHS protocols.
Additionally, complex cases may be referred to Imperial's private facilities in London, further supporting UK healthcare revenue.
Marriott, accompanied by UK Trade Envoy to Pakistan Mohammad Yasin MP during his three-day visit to the country, toured the Novacare construction site. The delegation met with key Novacare and Andalus Holdings executives including CEO Johannes Kedzierski, Director Faraz Minai, Partner Ghalib Hafiz, Director Mustafa Hassan, and Project Director Qaiser Rafiq.

Towards academic openness,"US
Globally, such transfer pathways are not only permitted, but encouraged
At the recent Academic Council meeting of the University of Karachi, the decision to allow the transfer of MPhil and PhD students from private universities into our postgraduate programmes sparked passionate debate.
Concerns were raised, caution was advised, and multiple perspectives were articulated – all reflecting the seriousness with which the Council treats matters of academic integrity. Yet, after a rigorous and wide-ranging discussion, the policy was passed and rightly so.
As a member of this Council, I listened carefully to both opposition and support. Some colleagues feared this would blur institutional boundaries, or create complications in managing standards.
Others questioned the parity between the academic depth of private and public sector research work. But ultimately, a larger and more progressive vision prevailed one that rests on merit, inclusivity and institutional confidence.
Let us be clear: the policy does not open a backdoor into Karachi University. It introduces a structured, multi-tiered vetting mechanism: no student may transfer without clearance from the Departmental Research Committee, approval of the concerned Head of Department, and endorsement from the Dean. All admission criteria remain fully intact. There is no compromise on standards. What this policy does, however, is offer opportunity i.e. a word that sits at the heart of public education.
Too often, students begin their academic journeys in private universities due to proximity, cost, timing or availability. But with time, many discover a mismatch between their evolving academic ambitions and institutional limitations.
Are we, as a leading public university, to tell them that their academic fate is sealed at their starting point? Or should we allow them to be assessed fairly, and if found capable, welcomed into our research community?
KU, by design, has been a centre of knowledge dissemination, not isolation. It has long accepted students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, regions and disciplines. This policy simply extends that ethos to embrace students from other universities, while maintaining the same standards we demand of our own.
Globally, such transfer pathways are not only permitted, but encouraged. Research thrives in environments where ideas cross-pollinate, where institutional walls do not become intellectual barriers. KU's move signals alignment with these best practices, ensuring our researchers have exposure to diverse academic influences.
One must also address the perception that this policy may dilute our reputation. Quite the opposite, it reinforces the fact that KU is strong enough to engage with wider academia, assess on merit, and mentor students regardless of where they began. It is a mark of maturity, not vulnerability.
Alongside this, the Council also approved a much-needed revision: the abolition of the No Objection Certificate (NOC) requirement for employed students seeking MPhil or PhD admission. In today's world, where many researchers are also professionals, this requirement often served as a bureaucratic bottleneck. Removing it not only widens access but also reflects KU's sensitivity to the realities of working scholars.
Both these decisions, the transfer policy and the removal of the NOC, reflect a shift in KU's academic posture: from gatekeeping to guidance, from rigidity to relevance. They send a message that excellence is not the preserve of a select few, but a goal that can be pursued across institutional lines, provided the standards are met.
This is not a softening of KU's identity; it is a powerful reaffirmation of its role as a national academic leader, one that invites talent, not fears it. By embracing merit-based transfers while maintaining rigorous standards, KU demonstrates confidence in its systems and a forward-looking approach to academic collaboration.
These bold step reflects not only the Council's collective wisdom but also the visionary leadership of our worthy VC whose commitment to inclusive excellence continues to steer the university in the right direction.

NEPRA considers 10 paisa power tariff hike for May,"US
The proposal has been submitted by the Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G)
Power consumers across Pakistan, excluding K-Electric (KE) and lifeline users, may face a 10-paisa per unit increase in electricity tariffs under the Fuel Charges Adjustment (FCA) for May 2025.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) is scheduled to hear the proposed hike of Rs0.1015 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) on June 30, 2025, at NEPRA Tower, Islamabad. The session will also be available online via Zoom.
The proposal has been submitted by the Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G) on behalf of Ex-WAPDA Distribution Companies (XWDISCOs). According to CPPA-G, the actual fuel cost in May stood at Rs7.4940/kWh, compared to a reference cost of Rs7.3925/kWh, resulting in the requested hike.
In May, 12,755 GWh of electricity was generated at a cost of Rs99.153 billion, averaging Rs7.7739/kWh. After deducting transmission losses of 355 GWh (2.78%) and adjustments, 12,367 GWh was delivered to DISCOs at Rs92.676 billion or Rs7.4940/kWh. Hydel power led the generation mix with 37.98% (4,844 GWh), followed by RLNG (16.99%), nuclear (15.77%), and local coal (11.08%). Imported coal contributed 6.24%, while gas added 6.92%. Other sources included RFO, solar, wind, and bagasse.
NEPRA has invited stakeholders to join the hearing and submit feedback. If approved, the FCA will apply for one month only.

Not just a joke,"PK
How Pakistan's celebrity men keep reinventing misogyny
A few days ago, veteran actor Naumaan Ijaz decided to weigh in on a viral video of YouTuber Maaz Safdar gifting his wife a truck-sized bouquet. Most people online found the gesture amusing or sweet. Ijaz, however, turned it into a lecture, as he commented, ""Dear sisters, please don't start expecting this kind of nonsense from your boyfriend/ husband — now the poor innocent guys are going to suffer again.""
It was condescending, bitter, and steeped in a familiar tone, blaming women for asking ""too much."" Women in Pakistan are certainly not expecting a truck-sized bouquet. This stunt by Safdar is clearly an exaggerated one, a common practice with influencers and vloggers in the post-Mr.Beast internet. It is clearly for the theatrics, and no average person expects to be treated like this, but seeing Ijaz's comments, one is compelled to think that he must think of women as the most brainless creatures on the planet.
What women in Pakistan are expecting in reality is respect and basic human rights. According to the current Global Gender Disparity Report by the World Economic Forum, Pakistan has ranked last in terms of gender disparity ratios. While the Commission for the Status of Women has taken issue with the validity of its reporting of Pakistan, one cannot deny that the situation of women in Pakistan is dire. According to the same report, 90 per cent of women in Pakistan have faced some form of domestic violence. On that issue, Ijaz has but one thing to say — Let's blame the victim!
On Me Too Movement
In an interview with Iffat Omar in 2023, Ijaz said, ""You can't clap with one hand. It takes two."" He continued, ""These things only happen as long as they're allowed to happen. If you stop it right then and there, it won't continue. So when it happened on the first day, you should've walked away — you should've left.""
But for those familiar with Ijaz's career, it was hardly surprising. His interviews are often teemed with casual misogyny. In a viral clip from the same interview, he boasted about cheating on his wife: ""I'm an actor and an intelligent man — my wife doesn't find out."" Iffat asked, ""And the ones you cheat with?"". He laughed, ""Their husbands don't find out either."". She inquired, ""Do they reciprocate?"" and Ijaz responded casually, ""Of course.""
The host laughed, saying, ""I need to learn a few things from you."" No accountability. No discomfort. When this moment received massive backlash on the internet, he chalked it up as a joke. Humsafar actor, Atiqa Odho, rushed to defend him, ""Trust you to joke about infidelity and people start to take it all so seriously — Keep smiling and exposing others' petty-mindedness.""
This is how the industry works. One man crosses a line. Another powerful voice pats him on the back. The audience is scolded for reacting. It's all a big joke, unless you're the woman being mocked, lied to, or silenced.
In the same interview, when asked about the # MeToo movement, Ijaz dismissed it outright, weaving an elaborate narrative on why such things are detrimental to society. ""If I see a girl who is 18-20 years old — and say, 'You have that spark. I have this project coming, come over.'"" According to Ijaz, the girl would then ""tell her entire family and friends"" in excitement and arrive expecting an opportunity. He adds that upon their meeting, if he feels that she isn't a fit for the role, and tells her that he has a better project for her later, she will become disappointed and may weave false stories about him. He claimed, ""People will use it as a weapon.""
When Iffat raised a valid point of having a witness or third person present in such meetings, Ijaz dismissed the idea of ""protecting"" himself: ""No, no. What's the point of a witness? Allah is a witness."" Such narratives border on unhinged behaviour. If one must bring Islam into it, even Islam calls for a third party to be present if an unrelated man and woman are meeting, or participating in a legally binding contract.
He closed the segment with the ultimate dismissal of the movement itself, ""This MeToo, HeToo, SheToo — trust me, it is because of distance from religion.""
Slut-shaming and age-shaming
Of course, Ijaz isn't alone. Khalilur Rehman Qamar has been using religion as a weapon for misogyny as a brand and a career strategy.
Earlier, he was involved in a ""honey-trapping"" controversy, with leaked recordings and inappropriate exchanges that raised eyebrows. One has to ask: What is a man doing alone in a woman's house at night, while ranting about women's ""honour"" on primetime TV? He claimed that he visited her in the wee hours of the night to give her the opportunity to work with him. Perhaps he and Ijaz need to take Iffat's advice and have a witness to protect their so-called business meetings with young women. However, it seems that these meetings have no intention of being professional.
Qamar is remembered for calling Marvi Sirmed a ""ghatiya aurat"" on live television. Qamar has repeatedly shown disdain for women who challenge him. In another TV talk show in 2021, he lashed out on air again, this time at journalist Ailia Zehra during a talk show. Zehra tweeted, ""Khalilur Rehman Qamar lost his marbles when I called him out over his hateful rhetoric. Called me a RAW agent and spewed sexist slurs.""
Still, he continues to write hit dramas. He's invited to talk shows. He's never been made to apologise, because anger sells, and women are disposable.
Faysal Quraishi, another big name in the industry, also had the audacity to age-shame Saba Qamar upon the release of her drama Fraud in 2022. He wrote a message on his socials, saying, ""If she is 24 years old in the drama, then please make me 27 years old."" Ironically, Quraishi has been trying too hard for his age, appearing in roles for characters decades younger than him with female co-stars who often look like they could play his daughters.
The industry likes to pretend these are just opinions, different worldviews, and personal beliefs. But these public comments are not harmless. They're cultural cues. And they're echoed in the scripts we see on screen, where women are beaten, abused, gaslit, and somehow always end up asking for forgiveness.
Younger actors have learned from these veterans to deliver the same misogyny with confidence. Hosting a Ramazan transmission this year, Danish Taimoor, while seated beside his wife Ayeza Khan, discussed the topic of multiple marriages, stating, ""I have the permission from God for four marriages. That I'm not availing it 'for now' is my decision."" Ayeza looked visibly uncomfortable. The audience clapped. And once again, the matter was brushed under the rug.
If there's one story that ties it all together, abuse, denial, and rebranding, it is the story of Feroze Khan. In 2022, his ex-wife, Syeda Aliza Sultan, publicly accused him of domestic violence. Court documents revealed disturbing allegations, including repeated physical assault, threats, and emotional trauma. Photos shared by Sultan showed signs of bruising and injury, alongside a statement saying she feared for her and her children's lives.
Despite the gravity of the accusations, Feroze walked away unscathed. No ban. No public censure. He was cast in new drama projects soon after. He has been hard at work building his new image, not as an abuser, but as a misunderstood soul. He has been making rounds in the media recently, cheerily boasting about his new marriage to his then-therapist. If Pakistan had any regulatory body or laws, psychologists and therapists, her license would have been taken away in an instant for gross malpractice.
This is not about one man or one controversy. This is about an entire culture where misogyny is not just tolerated, it's rewarded. The public sees these moments and shrugs: ""It's just a joke,"" and women are expected to laugh along, stay silent, or forgive.
It's time to call it what it is, abuse of power, dressed as performance.

'Rewarding' waste workers,"BE
True recognition requires more than ceremonial praise.
In what was touted as a gesture of gratitude, the Punjab government recently awarded Rs10,000 worth of cheques and a meal to each of the 1,000 sanitation workers of the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company for their good work during Eid-ul-Azha.
While the ceremony under the 'Suthra Punjab' campaign was no doubt well-intentioned, this token appreciation cannot and should not be mistaken for genuine support.
A one-time handout cannot substitute for systemic support. Sanitation workers perform one of the most demanding and dangerous jobs in our cities, often without job security, protective equipment or access to basic benefits.
Offering them a meal and a token sum may seem like a kind gesture, but it falls far short of what these workers actually need and deserve. If they are indeed the ""true heroes"", then why are they still denied the most basic protections under the law?
Many continue to work without formal contracts, with wages below the minimum threshold. They are excluded from the social safety net, and most are not enrolled in EOBI pensions, depriving them of long-term financial security. Their work is essential to public health and urban sanitation, yet they remain among the most marginalised segments of the workforce.
True recognition requires more than ceremonial praise. These workers must be brought under formal labour protections. This includes regularised employment and enforcement of the minimum wage along with occupational health coverage and inclusion in EOBI and other government support schemes.
While symbolic gestures may generate headlines, they do little to change the material conditions of those they aim to honour. The government must move beyond performative appreciation and enact policies that reflect real respect for labour. That is the only way to repay the people who keep our cities clean day in and day out, without fail and without fanfare.

The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) has decided to install e-gates at all the three major airports of the country — the Karachi airport, the Lahore airport and the Islamabad airport.
The e-gates to be installed at the international arrival and departure lounges of the airports will simplify and speed up immigration process and the international commuters will no longer have to wait in long queues.
The e-gates will also use artificial intelligence (AI) for the documentation and biometric identification of passengers and the project including installation of around 100 such gates will be completed in 2 years.
According to PAA officials, German experts have finalized the basic design for e-gates. During their visit to Pakistan, they also conducted a three-day workshop in Karachi. The PAA also held consultations with other stakeholders, including the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
They said the project reflects a commitment to providing modern, state-of-the-art facilities and is part of efforts to bring Pakistan's airports up to international standards.
The project aims to deliver a secure, scalable, and technology-driven solution for major airports in Pakistan. As per the agreement, the consultants are performing satisfactorily.
Additional Director of Engineering Services Adnan Ahmed told The Express Tribune a globally renowned German firm M2P was selected for the e-gates project that began in September last year.
As part of the process, a German expert team visited Pakistan and after extensive consultations in Karachi, completed the basic design for the project. During their three-day workshop, it was explained that e-gates are self-service systems that automate the immigration process.
This enhances the travel experience for passengers by saving time and reducing hassle. One of the key benefits is that passengers do not have to interact directly with immigration staff. The system will be helpful for both passengers and border officers and will also introduce improvements in security.

The lethal Iranian retaliation on US bases in Qatar led to the meltdown
It's ceasefire! Israel and Iran are apparently returning from the brink. A desperate deal doctored by US President Donald Trump is on the cards, primarily meant to save the skin of his allied-ally. To what extent this unassured and fragile understanding will hold is hard to guess, as both the Jewish state and the Islamic republic are not in it by heart.
An episode of mutual destruction played for 12 days has cost them their regional reputation, and they are now in a state of utter destruction. The only good point is that the world has been saved from a third world war, and it seems some tactical diplomatic alignment will reshape a new order in the Middle East.
Tel Aviv's aggression over Tehran under the aegis of Washington not only exposed its hegemonic designs, but also the gruesomeness of the US to bomb Iranian nuclear installations.
As per International Law, both these states must face retribution for violating Iran's sovereignty and, especially, the Trump administration for waging a war without the Congressional approval. The hurried manner in which Trump scaled down from his rhetoric of ""destroying"" Iran and was desperate to seek cessation of hostilities is a telling tale of the capitulation of a superpower.
The lethal Iranian retaliation on US bases in Qatar led to the meltdown, and the fantasy of regime change came crumbling down. Moreover, the security scare to the extent of annihilation that was evident over many of the Gulf States as missiles and jets flew over their territories, coupled with the fear of closure of Strait of Hormuz, led to a rapid rollback.
Similarly, the digging of heels by Russia and China to stand with Iran was the writing on the wall for Israel and the US that this misadventure will not be limited to Persia, and could snowball into a major trans-regional catastrophe.
Now is the time to get back to the dialogue table and address in a multilateral manner not only the issue of bad blood between the warring sides, but also the nuclear question as well as the Palestinian statehood.

Govt rules out tax reversal on car imports,"US
Mandatory registration, certification planned; EV policy aims to convert 2.2 million vehicles by 2030
In a bid to regulate the used car market and uphold quality standards, the government has decided not to reverse existing taxes on car imports and will introduce mandatory registration and certification procedures for used imported vehicles.
These measures were communicated during a meeting chaired by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan with the Car Dealers and Importers Association in Islamabad.
As per an official statement, the discussions focused on key areas including the upcoming Auto Policy 2026, import and export issues, and additional customs duties.
The PM's aide recognised the Car Dealers and Importers Association as a vital stakeholder in the consultation process for policy formulation. He reiterated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's vision emphasises promoting a liberalised and competitive import mechanism for vehicles in Pakistan.
Highlighting the shift towards sustainable transportation, he stated that Pakistan is moving away from petrol-based vehicles towards environmentally friendly alternatives. In line with the prime minister's directives, the government has introduced a comprehensive Electric Vehicle (NEV) Policy 2025-2030.
Under this policy, Pakistan aims to convert 2.2 million vehicles to electric by the year 2030. ""The promotion of electric vehicles is crucial for reducing smog and improving public health,"" said Khan. ""EVs are not only cost-effective but also beneficial for the environment and the people of Pakistan.""
During the meeting, the Association assured the ministry that they will submit detailed proposals to support the policy process. The SAPM assured the delegation that the government will carefully review their suggestions and extend full cooperation.
Meanwhile, Rana Ihsaan Afzal Khan, Coordinator to the Prime Minister of Pakistan on Commerce, conducted a meeting with Patron in Chief, Chairman and representatives of the All-Pakistan Car Dealers and Importers Association (APCDIA) to strengthen collaboration between the private and government stakeholders.
The APCIA, while appreciating the government's plans to allow import of commercial vehicles via amendments to the Import Policy Order, were of the view that consultations with the association could lead to formulation of a well-rounded policy for import of commercial vehicles.
Afzal Khan assured the association that the Ministry of Commerce understands the importance of conducting stakeholder consultations and invited tangible proposals from the association for incorporation in the updated Import Policy Order, expected to be issued after September, 2025.

Dairy industry offers price cut by Rs50 if tax reduced,"PK
This is for the first time that tax hike may actually lead to a drop in tax receipts
Pakistan Dairy Association has offered a reduction of Rs50 per litre in milk prices, if sales tax rate is revised downwards from 18% to 5% while approving the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
The government's refusal to cut sales tax on packaged dairy milk in the budget has caused dismay among members of the dairy association, which has cautioned the government that its revenue collection and industry exports may go down. Tax collection on packaged dairy milk was Rs13 billion in 2023, which went significantly higher to Rs44 billion in 2024.
""This is for the first time that tax hike may actually lead to a drop in tax receipts,"" remarked Pakistan Dairy Association Chairman Usman Zaheer, along with representatives from different dairy companies, at a press conference.
He added that they had started exporting milk to the United States and Middle Eastern nations while new markets in Central Asia were also being explored. Exports of milk amounted to $15 million in 2023, which jumped up to $35 million in 2024. ""We will not be able to achieve our export target of $70 million due to higher taxes,"" they lamented, adding that the government had agreed to reduce taxes in the budget but their proposals were not adopted. They had requested the government to slash general sales tax on dairy items (liquid and powder) from the existing 18% to 5%.
The dairy association added that since the imposition of the tax in July 2024, sales volume had dropped 20% and it would continue to decline further. Reduction in sales tax to 5% from July 2025 could help volumes grow by 20%. Similarly, government revenue will rise 22% year-on-year.
""The move will renew investments in farms, milk processing and exports. Lower taxes will also lead to contraction in the undocumented economy by limiting the consumption of loose milk,"" they stated, adding that milk prices would fall by Rs50 per litre.

CM instructs WASA to immediately prepare PC-1s for all proposed schemes
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has given in-principle approval to the Rawalpindi Development Plan, prioritising upgrades to the city's water supply and sewerage systems. The Water and Sanitation Agency's (WASA) managing director has been instructed to immediately prepare PC-1s for all proposed schemes.
This directive was issued during a joint meeting on Monday, chaired by the Punjab Secretary for Urban Development and Public Health Engineering, Noorul Amin Mengal. Officials from the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), WASA, Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), and Public Health Engineering attended the session.
The secretary emphasised the need for swift monsoon preparations and urged the early completion of the feasibility study for sourcing water from Daducha Dam to ensure a sustainable supply for Rawalpindi. He proposed building ground storage tanks in parks, following the Lahore model, to store rainwater for horticultural use, stressing that ""every drop of water must be saved.""
The secretary housing praised WASA for exceeding its revenue recovery target, collecting Rs2.6 billion against the assigned Rs2.3 billion, and called for an even higher target in the upcoming fiscal year.
WASA Managing Director, Muhammad Saleem Ashraf, shared that a comprehensive monsoon plan is already in place, including the expedited cleaning of 15 city drains and Nullah Leh. Staff training and sewer line maintenance have been completed, and five monsoon camps will be operational, backed by a central control room at WASA Headquarters.
To ensure an uninterrupted water supply during summer, 20 new tube wells are being installed, and additional intake from Rawal and Khanpur dams has been secured. Ongoing dam projects will soon add 12 MGD from Chahan Dam, 5 MGD from Rawal Dam, and 8 MGD from Khanpur Dam. The feasibility for the Daducha Dam, expected to provide 35 MGD, is set to conclude within two months.
During the meeting, the RDA director general gave progress updates on major projects, including the Ring Road and Nullah Leh schemes, which were highlighted for timely and transparent completion. PHA Director General, Ahmad Hassan Ranjha, also briefed the participants on citywide park beautification efforts.

Duckett stars as England stun India,"PK
The batter smashed 149 chasing a 371-run target on Tuesday
Ben Duckett smashed a superb hundred while Joe Root hit an unbeaten half-century as England chased a massive 371-run target at Headingley on Tuesday.
Joe Root finished with 53 not out with wicketkeeper Jamie Smith unbeaten on 44 as England complete the record run-chase with five wickets to spare. This was England's second highest chase against India.
Krishna, in only his fourth Test, struck twice in quick succession to leave England 206-2 following a superb opening stand of 188 between Duckett and Zak Crawley (65).
And medium-pacer Thakur then took two wickets in two balls as Harry Brook followed the prize scalp of Duckett for 149, to leave England 253-4.
Play had continued through fine drizzle in the morning session as Duckett and Crawley withstood a stern test from star paceman Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.
But after a 20-minute stoppage for rain, India finally broke through thanks to the inexperienced Krishna, who had 2-69 in 11 overs at tea.
One ball after pulling Krishna for four, Crawley edged a drive to first slip, where KL Rahul held a sharp catch.
Crawley's exit brought in Ollie Pope after the vice-captain top-scored with 106 in England's first-innings 465.
Pope, however, could only manage eight before he was bowled by a fine ball from Krishna that nipped back.
Duckett dropped
An undaunted Duckett continued his assault with a reverse sweep off Ravindra Jadeja for an extraordinary six.
But his impressive innings ended when he drove Thakur to short extra cover where substitute fielder Nitish Kumar Reddy, in a game of dropped chances, clung on to a sharp catch.
Next ball Harry Brook, out for 99 in England's first innings, saw a whip shot well caught down the legside by wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant.
Stokes survived the hat-trick but the game is back in the balance.
Earlier, Duckett was fortunate to complete his sixth hundred in 34 Tests.
He had made 97 when he top-edged a pull off Siraj only for Yashasvi Jaiswal, running in from deep square leg, to drop the catch to the fast bowler's visible fury.
If England achieve their target, it will be just behind their record fourth-innings chase of 378 against India at Edgbaston three years ago.
It would also be the second-highest chase in a Test at Headingley, surpassing England's 362-9 against Australia in 2019 when Stokes' unbeaten century secured a stunning one-wicket Ashes win.
England resumed on 21-0, with both sides eyeing an early lead in the five-match series.
Crawley (12 not out) and Duckett (nine not out) were confronted with the daunting task of facing Bumrah, fresh from a five-wicket haul in the first innings, in overcast conditions.
Duckett went on the attack after lunch, on-driving Bumrah for a superb four, before a quick single took Crawley to a 111-ball fifty — the slowest of his England career but still hugely valuable.
Pant became only the second wicketkeeper to score two hundreds in a Test when he made 118 on Sunday to follow his first-innings 134.
But, despite five individual centuries in this match, India would have been in a stronger position had they not suffered collapses of 7-41 and 6-31 at the back end of each innings.

Development without discrimination was carried out in all seven districts, including, A 1.5 km road connecting Lyari to the port and shipyard (Rs56 million), overlay and patchwork on both tracks of Hub River Road (180,000 ft), repairs and carpeting of Malir River Bridge and adjacent road from Anwar Baloch Hotel to Murghi Khana Bus Stop. Construction of a 1.4km overhead bridge on Korangi Causeway.
He said Long-pending dues of retired and deceased KMC and DMC employees were addressed. KMC, through its own resources, paid Rs600 million and cleared all dues up to June 2018. Through investment, Rs576 million was earned and a total of Rs1.3 billion was disbursed.
He said KMC is the first municipal body in Pakistan to begin converting its buildings to solar energy. Rs220.2 million has been allocated for this in the upcoming fiscal year, with plans to solarise markets, parks, and streetlights.
He said renovation of Denso Hall, Khaliq Dina Hall, KMC Building, and Frere Hall has been completed. Next year, six more historical structures - including Empress Market, Muhammad Ali Hothi Market, Machhi Miani Market, and Lea Market - will be restored to their original form.

Truce draws swift Pakistan welcome,"PK
PM speaks with Iran president, Saudi crown prince
Pakistan on Tuesday welcomed the announcement of ceasefire agreement between Iran and Israel and called on the relevant parties to uphold the truce, as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif spoke with the Iranian president as well as the Saudi crown prince to discuss the evolving regional situation.
After Iran launched missile strikes on the US military base in Qatar last night, there were fears that Israel-Iran war could engulf the entire Gulf region. But hours later, US President Donald Trump, as he did during the Pakistan-India conflict, sprang a major surprise when he broke the news of a ceasefire.
Although, the two sides, particularly Israel, initially violated the truce but later Trump's telephone call to the Israeli prime minister made sure the ceasefire remained in intact.
The news of ceasefire was seen as major relief for countries like Pakistan, which shares the border with Iran and any further hostilities would have far reaching implications for the country. That was the reason Pakistan was quick to welcome the truce deal.
""We also welcome and support the efforts aimed at reviving dialogue and diplomacy in the region,"" read a statement issued by the Foreign Office. ""Pakistan believes that peace and stability in the region can only be achieved through strict adherence to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter and by refraining from the use of force,"" it added.
The statement further said Pakistan would continue to support all efforts in this regard.
Hours after the ceasefire deal, the prime minister held a telephone conversation with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian. He said that Pakistan was closely following the rapidly evolving situation in the Middle East. He emphasised the importance of restoring peace through dialogue and diplomacy.
The prime minister reiterated Pakistan's support for Iran at all diplomatic forums, including at the UN Security Council and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), while calling for adhering to the international law and the UN Charter principles, by all sides.
President Pezeshkian thanked the prime minister for the telephone call and appreciated Pakistan's consistent and principled support to Iran, throughout the crisis. He also acknowledged Pakistan's constructive role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The two leaders agreed to the importance of unity among the Ummah during this most challenging time. They agreed to remain in touch.
Separately, the prime minister also spoke Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and discussed the Middle East situation.
According to the official handout, during their ""most warm and cordial conversation"", the prime minister conveyed his ""warm regards and profound respects to the Custodian of the two Holy Mosques, His Majesty King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud"".
""He also warmly felicitated His Royal Highness on the successful completion of Hajj this year and thanked the Kingdom for the gracious hospitality extended to the Pakistani pilgrims,"" read a statement issued by the Prime Minister House.
The prime minister reiterated profound gratitude for the Kingdom's steadfast support to Pakistan during the recent standoff with India. He stated that Pakistan was ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism.
The two leaders also exchanged views on the rapidly evolving situation in the Middle East. In this regard, the prime minister said that Pakistan fully supported the immediate de-escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict, as well as its peaceful resolution through dialogue and diplomacy.
While referring to last night's attacks, he called for adherence to international law and the UN Charter principles by all sides. In this context, the prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan's unwavering support for the Kingdom's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The prime minister conveyed ""deep appreciation to His Royal Highness for his sagacious leadership and commendable efforts to restore peace"" in the region. This, he said, was reflective of the Kingdom's remarkable status as a peacemaker at the international stage, as well as its leadership of the Ummah.
The Saudi crown prince thanked the prime minister for the telephone call and appreciated Pakistan's expression of solidarity and support for the kingdom. He acknowledged Pakistan's constructive role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the Iran-Israel conflict.
Crown Prince Mohammed said that Saudi Arabia was fully committed to efforts aimed at fostering lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.
Earlier, Pakistan expressed its deep concern and alarm at the serious escalation in the security situation in the region as a result of attacks against the Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar.
""We strongly condemn the recent violations of the principle of respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries,"" the Foreign Office said. ""We urge adherence to fundamental principles of international law and call for exercise of restraint by all sides,"" according to the statement.
Pakistan reiterated its call for dialogue and diplomacy to resolve all conflicts, and urged immediate steps for de-escalation. The prime minister met the Qatari ambassador to Islamabad and expressed solidarity with Doha. He also held a telephonic conversation with the Saudi envoy and discussed the evolving situation.

Imran distances himself from K-P budget,"US
Aleema alleges PTI founder not consulted; Barrister Saif insists Imran was briefed
In an apparently fresh internal split within the PTI, party patron-in-chief Imran Khan has distanced himself from the approval of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa budget, saying it was made behind his back and was invalid without his prior consultation.
He rejected the manner in which the budget was passed, saying that a budget approved in just three hours without proper consultation was unacceptable.
Imran's concerns were conveyed through his sister Aleema Khan, who, speaking outside Adiala Jail on Tuesday, said the decision to pass the K-P budget was made in undue haste and without the consent of the party's founder.
""In my view, the 'Minus Imran Khan' formula has already been executed,"" she said, adding that her brother was denied even a two-day wait for input on the budget.
The former premier also asserted that no amendments should proceed without the Supreme Court's permission and only under his instructions – even as K-P Information Adviser Barrister Ali Saif claimed Imran had given his nod to the provincial budget after being briefed.
Aleema said that Imran demanded that the party approach the SC to seek permission for a formal consultative meeting between him and the party's economic team. ""Only after such consultation will he review and decide on the amendments required in the budget,"" she quoted Imran as saying.
Aleema Khan, who spoke to the media outside Adiala Jail after meeting with family members who were allowed access to the imprisoned party founder, said that she herself was denied permission to meet her brother. However, her sisters, Dr Uzma and Noreen Niazi, were able to see him and convey his views.
She expressed frustration over being denied a meeting with Imran. ""What was the rush in passing the K-P budget?"" she asked.
""What was hidden from the PTI founder in that budget that they couldn't even wait two more days?"" ""In my view, Imran Khan has been sidelined,"" she added.
Aleema also slammed the authorities for attempting to block communication from within Adiala Jail.
""Barrister Saif had been sent to explain why the K-P budget was presented so hastily and under compulsion,"" she said, quoting Imran, who also noted that ""Ali Amin Gandapur should have come to see me much earlier"".
However, Barrister Saif said he informed the incarcerated supremo of the party of the province's political scenario and apprised him of the opposition's alleged conspiracies to derail the budget process.
""I conveyed everything to the patron-in-chief that Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur and Muzzammil Aslam wanted to share with him,"" he said. ""After listening to all the facts and concerns, he expressed his consent regarding the budget.""
The meeting, according to Saif, involved detailed discussions not only on political matters but also on the K-P budget.

Art market dependent on new generation of collectors,"US
Sales slump in the sector continues
The global art market is not immune to current economic and geopolitical tensions, and is counting on a new generation of collectors to revitalise the momentum.
Some big transactions were concluded last week during Art Basel, the world's top contemporary art fair, notably by London's Annely Juda Fine Art gallery, which sold a David Hockney painting for between $13 million and $17 million, without disclosing the exact price.
The David Zwirner gallery sold a sculpture by Ruth Asawa for $9.5 million and a Gerhard Richter painting for $6.8 million.
However, prices did not reach the heights achieved in 2022, when the art market was in full swing. Back then, a sculpture by French-American artist Louise Bourgeois was purchased for $40 million.
""The market is certainly softer,"" Art Basel's chief executive Noah Horowitz told AFP, though major sales still happen at such fairs ""despite, somehow, all that's going on in the world"".
Switzerland's biggest bank UBS and the research and consulting firm Arts Economics prepared a report for the fair.
According to their estimates, the art market slowed in 2023, then fell by 12 per cent globally in 2024, to $57.5 billion, with the decline particularly affecting works valued at more than $10 million.
""In the next six to 12 months, I don't see any changes on the horizon,"" said Hans Laenen, an art market specialist at insurer AXA XL.
In a time of economic and geopolitical uncertainties, ""investors are turning very strongly to gold"", he told AFP.
In the art sector, behaviour is ""more conservative"" among both buyers and sellers, who prefer to wait before putting works on the market in the current climate, he continues.
""The number of transactions is increasing,"" but in ""lower price segments,"" he noted.
According to the insurance firm Hiscox, the number of lots sold for less than $50,000 increased by 20 per cent in auction houses in 2024, while very highly priced works saw a sharp drop, indicating a change in collector behaviour.
New generation
According to Jean Gazancon, chief executive of art insurer Arte Generali, a younger generation of collectors is entering the market.
""We are insuring more and more 30-somethings for collections of 300,000, 500,000, or a million euros,"" he noted.
""These are successful start-uppers, investment bankers, lawyers, or sometimes people who have inherited,"" and they begin their collections ""very young"", sometimes making ""very radical"" choices, he said.
UBS expects that trend to increase. According to its projections, an unprecedented wealth transfer will take place over the next 20 to 25 years with the general ageing of the population.
Globally, around $83 trillion in assets will change hands, it says, meaning ""there's a whole new generation of collectors coming to the market with different buying patterns"", said Eric Landolt, global co-head of the family advisory, art and collecting department at UBS.
The four-day Art Basel fair, which closed on Sunday, featured more than 280 galleries presenting works by around 4,000 artists.
It is a must for collectors, who can buy everything from Pablo Picasso paintings to very recent works.
The Thaddaeus Ropac galleries notably offered a portrait of Pope Leo XIV by the Chinese-French artist Yan Pei-Ming.
It also highlights young artists, such as Joyce Joumaa, 27, who jointly won the 2025 Baloise Art Prize for her work focusing on the energy crisis in Lebanon.

The NDMA issued the statement a day after the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast that the monsoon season this year was set to begin on Wednesday (today) bringing rain to various regions of the country.
The NDMA issued an impact-based weather report of the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC), outlining weather conditions across various regions of Pakistan from Wednesday (today) until next Tuesday.
The report indicated the likelihood of thunderstorms, windstorms, and flash floods in different parts of the country, posing potential threats to public safety, infrastructure, and transportation systems. It said Isolated rainfall, thunderstorms, and windstorms were expected in Islamabad and most parts of Punjab.
These conditions might lead to uprooting of weak trees, temporary power outages, and damage to vulnerable structures, rooftops, vehicles, and electric lines, the NDMA said. ""Citizens are advised to avoid standing near trees, signboards, or weak structures and to park vehicles in secure locations.""
The NEOC also highlighted the risk of flash flooding in upper Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), Kashmir, Potohar region, and Islamabad, because of scattered to widespread moderate-to-heavy rainfall, with chances of very heavy downpours at isolated places.
""The risk to property, infrastructure, and public safety in flood-prone and low-lying areas is significant. Residents in vulnerable locations are urged to exercise caution, avoid unnecessary travel, and secure household belongings and livestock,"" the NDMA stated.
In K-P, isolated thunderstorms and rainfall were expected in several districts, it said, adding that strong winds and thunderstorms might affect power supply, cause structural damage, and reduce visibility on roads.
In Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), isolated heavy rainfall and thunderstorms were expected from 25th June to 1st July 2025, with occasional gaps. Additionally, isolated rainfall and thunderstorms were likely in Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) from 26th to 29th June.
The NDMA strongly urged all citizens, travellers, and relevant departments to take precautionary measures and remain vigilant throughout this period. Emergency response units were advised to stay on alert for possible rescue and evacuation operations.
Public was encouraged to stay informed by regularly checking weather updates and downloading the ""Pak NDMA Disaster Alert"" mobile application.

Asif decries 'Western hypocrisy',"IE
Minister calls IAEA biased, says Tehran never left negotiating table
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif has come down hard on Israel and its Western allies for ""unprovoked"" and ""illegal"" aggression against Iran, warning that the West's double standards and disregard for diplomacy have pushed the region toward dangerous escalation.
In a wide-ranging interview with Iran's official news agency IRNA, conducted in Islamabad, Asif lashed out at both the United States and the Zionist regime, accusing them of dismantling diplomatic avenues and fuelling regional instability through repeated violations of international law.
""Unlike Iran, the Westerners have destroyed the opportunity for diplomacy and are the cause of the beginning of the aggressions of the Zionist regime and the United States,"" he said, adding that Iran's conduct had remained ""very constructive"" throughout.
Pointing out the ""hypocrisy"" of global nuclear oversight bodies, Asif criticised the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), saying its track record was tainted by bias and inconsistency.
""A regime that is not even a member of the NPT and there is no monitoring and inspection of its nuclear arsenals, can do anything and has the authorisation to carry out any aggression and attack on Palestine, Gaza, Yemen and now against Iran,"" he said, referring to Israel's exemption from the scrutiny faced by others.
""All these countries are the targets of these deliberate and reckless actions of Tel Aviv, which is not held accountable by the IAEA,"" he added.
The defence minister said Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure, and the American backing of those attacks, had grossly violated international norms.
He called the attacks ""terrorist"" in nature and accused the US of committing ""aggressive crimes"" by striking Iran's nuclear facilities.
""These actions,"" Asif said, ""are contrary to international law, the UN Charter and humanitarian norms"".
Expressing concern over the growing volatility in the region, Asif observed that Tehran had consistently pushed for diplomacy, while it was the opposing side that walked away from negotiations.
""I think the situation has escalated to a dangerous level, especially over the past few weeks when Iran continuously emphasised the need for negotiations and participation in this entire process, and that the Iranians have never left the negotiating table,"" he said.
""Iran has never initiated the war, but both the destruction of diplomacy and the initiation of the war were carried out by the other side (America and Israel), which led to the illegitimate aggression of Israel against the nation,"" he added.
The minister pointed out that Iran had always favoured engagement, despite provocations.
""It is ridiculous that the West always wants Iran to return to the negotiating table, because the Iranians did not leave the negotiating table, but have always demanded interaction and negotiations,"" he said.
He noted that even while Iranian diplomat Abbas Araghchi was holding talks with European counterparts, another act of aggression was launched against Tehranshowcasing a pattern of undermining peace efforts.
Asif argued that Israeli aggression had crossed borders and was now being directed squarely at Iran, which he described as a ""planned conspiracy"".
""Israel's continued aggression against Palestinians had now reached Iran,"" he said, ""calling it a conspiracy planned and implemented by the Zionist regime.""
Backing Tehran's alignment with the Palestinian cause, Asif said, ""Iranians stand with Palestine, and this is never a crime.""

Experts warn of rising diabetes-linked blindness,"US
.
Al-Shifa Trust (AST) has raised serious concerns over the rising threat of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) in Pakistan, linking it to the country's alarming surge in diabetes cases — now reportedly the highest in the world.
Speaking to media on Tuesday, Dr Nadeem Qureshi, Head of the Retina Department at Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital, warned that the increasing diabetes prevalence is fuelling a parallel spike in vision-threatening complications, including diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma.
""Prolonged uncontrolled blood sugar damages the retinal blood vessels and, if left untreated, can lead to irreversible vision loss,"" he said. He emphasized that early detection and routine screening are critical in preventing vision impairment.

'Excited to have Shaheen in Brisbane',"BE
Pak cricketers bring a lot of interest to BBL, says Johan Botha
The likes of Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan, Shadab Khan, and Haris Rauf will be seen playing against each other during the Australian summer and thus, it is safe to say that a lot of people from Pakistan would be excited for the BBL 2025/26.
As Brisbane Heat managed to pick Afridi, their head coach, Johan Botha, seemed very pleased to have the star pacer in his side.
The former South African captain himself has been a part of various T20 leagues including the Pakistan Super League (PSL), and has an impressive CV as a T20 player. As a matter of fact, he has coached several franchises across the globe too.
During an exclusive interview with Arvind Kalyana Krishnan during the BBL 15 Draft in Melbourne, Johan Botha expressed his excitement about getting Shaheen, and spoke about the fans and support he'll be getting along with him. The former Proteas all-rounder drew light on the prospect of all the Pakistani players playing against one another, and the amount of fan following they have. Botha stated that it was a big tick for the BBL in terms of popularising the tournament.
""We've very excited (to get Shaheen Afridi). You know, I think the whole BBL now! With Babar going to Sydney, Shadab is back, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Rizwan.....I think that's a big tick for the Big Bash.
""I think it'll bring a lot of interest, and especially when you have those guys play against each other, I think that will you know get crowds in through the gates and that's ultimately what it is.
""It's entertainment and we're look into those match-ups. You know I've been at PSL quite a lot and it's exciting to see the best players going against each other,"" said Johan Botha.
Shaheen Afridi has grabbed the cricketing headlines in Australia as Brisbane Heat managed to acquire his services during the recently-concluded KFC Big Bash League 15 Draft.
Brisbane Heat were quick to get the pacer as he was their first pick on June 19. Post which, several other star cricketers from Pakistan were picked by various teams during the BBL 15 overseas player draft.
Further on, the 43-year-old also spoke about South Africa winning the World Test Championship 2025. As a former South African cricketer and skipper himself, Botha felt that the ""Rainbow Nation"" winning their second ICC tournament was massive for the cricketing world.
He also spoke about how some of the Proteas players still rate Test cricket very highly and want to continue playing the longest format of the game.
The Temba Bavuma-led side had beaten Australia at Lord's during the WTC 2025 Final with Aiden Markram hitting a scintillating century in the fourth innings to deny the Pat Cunmins-led side their second WTC title.
""South Africa winning is massive. You know, following that over the last few days obviously. A huge win for South Africa. Their rugby has done so well for a long time and it's nice to finally see the cricket guys get over the line and it's huge for cricket.
""Even those guys in the team speaking about important Test cricket still is. You know when I was there and playing, you always felt that guys want to play One-day cricket to playing franchise cricket, but it's great to hear that top players still speak so highly of Test cricket and yeah, it's exciting and hopefully that you know those young guys can come through and play Test cricket for South Africa,"" he said.

Nearly half the US population face scorching heat wave,"US
.
Tens of millions of Americans sweltered outside or sought air-conditioned refuge as an ""extremely dangerous"" heat wave blanketed the eastern United States on Tuesday with record high temperatures.
As a fierce sun reflected off the skyscrapers of New York, the normally frenetic Times Square was virtually deserted by mid-day as the mercury reached 99 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius), the hottest since 2012 in the Big Apple.
By mid-afternoon Newark, New Jersey hit 103F (39.4C), according to the National Weather Service, and Philadelphia also reached 100F (38C).
New Yorkers walked under umbrellas as they navigated the streets of Manhattan, while others sunbathed in swimsuits in parks.
""It's been kind of a cold spring. Then all of a sudden, boom, here it is,"" Eleanor Burke, 82, told AFP of the heat, recalling how she took a dog for a walk the night before and ""he almost looked like he was dead.""
Soaring temperatures are straining the city's power grid as people crank up their air conditioning. In the Bronx, a New York borough, a blackout left more than 34,000 homes without power, prompting energy supplier Con Edison to urge residents to moderate their electricity consumption.
The NWS warned of East Coast temperatures of 97F-103F (36C-39.4C) on Tuesday, and a heat index — what the temperature feels like with humidity factored in -— spiking as high as 110F (43.3C) for the New York metropolitan area. AFP

Climate change: students' woes,"US
This will have a profound impact on long-term outcomes
It is not just flooding or other disasters that are taking a toll on our schoolchildren. Increasing extreme weather events are making school a dangerous place to be for several weeks out of the year.
The searing classrooms of Lahore and many other parts of Punjab feel like brick kilns during May's heatwave, with news reports describing children fainting and getting nose bleeds due to excruciating heat, made even worse by power outages and overcrowding.
The opposite is often true in the winter, as students shiver due to subpar heating arrangements or lack of gas for heating, though in this case, at least the overcrowding helps keep the classrooms a little warm.
But whether it is floods after the rain, blistering heat around the summer, or toxic smog in the dry winter months, weather-induced school closures are occurring with increasing frequency, and little is being done to address them.
Experts agree that the situation is becoming untenable, with students losing too many days of school during the year, and the weather being too hot or too cold to schedule make-up days before winter or summer vacations.
And even if make-up days could be scheduled, attendances drop as much as 25% on extreme weather days, meaning many students are even further behind.
This will have a profound impact on long-term outcomes, with some experts suggesting that there will be far fewer kids making it to university in the future if things continue unchanged.
Some long-term strategies are being implemented, such as World Bank-funded 'resilient campuses' that are elevated and solar-powered, but financing, building and populating these new schools will take time, and with some 26 million students already out of school whom authorities desperately need to bring back into the system, we cannot afford to get distracted by the risk of more kids quitting school because of inhumane conditions.
Without urgent investment and adoption of resilient education systems, Pakistan's children will inherit not just a broken ecosystem but a broken future.

PSG ease past Seattle Sounders,"US
Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Achraf Hakimi scored for the French champions
Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Achraf Hakimi scored either side of half-time as European champions Paris Saint-Germain eased to a 2-0 win over Seattle Sounders on Monday to secure their place in the last 16 of the Club World Cup.
PSG needed to bounce back from their 1-0 loss at the hands of Botafogo in their last Group B outing and they were too strong for the MLS side without ever really playing to their full potential.
Kvaratskhelia deflected a wayward Vitinha shot into the net to open the scoring on 35 minutes in front of 50,628 fans at Lumen Field, Sounders' home stadium.
Hakimi then made it 2-0 just before the midway point in the second half to kill off any prospect of a comeback by the hosts.
PSG are through and advance as group winners on goal difference, climbing up from second place because of Botafogo's late defeat at the hands of Atletico Madrid at the same time in Pasadena.
The French champions will now go through to a tie against the Group A runners-up in Atlanta on Sunday, as they leave the west coast for the first time since arriving in the United States.
""It wasn't easy because the pitch was very different to what we are used to in Europe so we couldn't play with the fluidity that we like, but we adapted,"" said PSG coach Luis Enrique.
He complained that the ball ""bounced around like a rabbit"" but also praised the opposition for their performance.
""It was a great match, difficult for us, tough from the beginning because Seattle played a great match, with intensity and quality on and off the ball,"" said the Spaniard.
Dembele again absent
The Paris coach made four changes to his line-up following the defeat at the hands of Botafogo, with captain Marquinhos, Nuno Mendes, Fabian Ruiz and Joao Neves all coming in.
However, Ousmane Dembele, their top scorer during the European season just finished with 33 goals in all competitions, played no part for a third game running after travelling to the tournament with an injury.
The Sounders needed a big win combined with a defeat for Atletico to progress to the last 16, something which was always going to be a big ask for the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League winners.
They didn't have the quality to overly trouble PSG, who saw Desire Doue threaten early on with a powerful shot that was tipped over by home goalkeeper Stefan Frei.
A mistake by goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma at the other end gifted a chance to the home side, but it was not an easy one for Jesus Ferreira and he fired off-target.
The UEFA Champions League winners got the opening goal 10 minutes before the interval when the ball came out to Vitinha on the edge of the area and his attempt took a rather lucky touch off the back of Kvaratskhelia to find the net.
The second goal arrived on 66 minutes after Doue played a delightful pass out to the wing for Bradley Barcola and the substitute cut in from the left before setting up Hakimi to control and slot in his 10th goal since the season began.

China to reschedule $1.8b debt,"US
Revised arrangement critical for IMF programme as reserves fall below $10b
China has shown willingness to reschedule $1.8 billion debt for a period of two years, which is about half of the amount that Pakistan had requested last year but is still critical for meeting requirements of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.
Islamabad sought the rescheduling of the government's concessional loans, preferential buyer credit, and the buyer's credit from the Export-Import (Exim) Bank of China, according to government officials. China has not agreed to reschedule the buyer's credit loans, they added.
There is now a possibility that China may reschedule $1.8 billion worth of government concessional loans and the preferential buyer credit by next month, they added. These loans have been taken for various projects and are over and above the commercial financing that Chinese banks have given to Pakistan.
The Ministry of Finance spokesman Qumar Abbasi did not respond to requests for comments despite repeated reminders during the past many days.
The development came amid thin foreign exchange reserves temporarily slipping below $10 billion after Islamabad made bullet commercial debt repayments to Beijing last week. However, the figure is expected to jump to close to $14 billion in the next one week, once China refinances these facilities.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has already announced that the foreign exchange reserves would close over $14 billion by the end of this fiscal year. The fiscal year 2024-25 would close on the coming Monday.
Pakistan had initially requested China to reschedule $3.4 billion Exim Bank debt for two years to bridge a foreign funding gap identified by the IMF. Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar also took up the issue during his visit to Beijing in February this year.
The government had requested the Exim Bank of China to consider rearrangement of its loans falling due from October 2024 till September 2027. China was not willing to negotiate the further rescheduling of the COVID-19 period loans, which consumed significant time, according to government officials.
Under the $7 billion deal, the IMF had identified a $5 billion external financing gap for the three-year programme period.
The Exim Bank has extended direct lending to the federal government and guaranteed lending to State-Owned Enterprises, said the sources. Pakistan has sought a two-year extension in repayment of the official and guaranteed debt obtained from Exim Bank. The country would keep making interest payments.
During recently held negotiations, the Exim Bank had proposed that in order to expedite the rescheduling process, Pakistan should exclude the buyer's credit from the request, said the sources. The Chinese authorities were of the view that rescheduling of the buyer's credit was not possible.
After excluding the buyer's credit, the remaining amount is $1.8 billion for the period spanning from July 2025 to June 2027. The IMF programme will end in September 2027 but it will review the government's targets till the June 2027 period.
China had also proposed that Pakistan should get rescheduling of the loans maturing from September 2025 to September 2027, to which the Ministry of Finance did not agree. China has also placed a condition that its loans should be converted from the US currency to the Chinese currency.
It will be the second time that the Chinese Exim Bank would reschedule Pakistani debt during the past two years. Earlier, in July 2023, the then Finance Minister and now Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar had announced the $2.43 billion worth of 31 loans rescheduled by China for two years.
Pakistan is heavily dependent on Beijing for remaining afloat and meeting the IMF-determined foreign reserves requirements.
Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves have temporarily slipped to below $10 billion after the country repaid the $2.1 billion Chinese facility last week in the hope of receiving the money back before the end of the month. In total, Pakistan has returned $3.7 billion of Chinese commercial loans in the past three months, which the Chinese are expected to refinance before the end of this month.
The ADB-backed $1 billion foreign non-Chinese commercial loan is expected to be disbursed by June 26th, according to central bank officials, in addition to another $415 million facility. This would return the reserves level back to double digits.
Pakistan has assured the IMF that its gross foreign exchange reserves would close at $13.9 billion by the end of this fiscal year. This is only possible if China refinances three separate loan facilities valued at $3.7 billion.
About $20 billion of public external debt matures in the next fiscal year, including nearly $13 billion in bilateral deposits. The bilateral partners will roll over, as per their promises to the IMF.

Judicial credibility hangs in balance,"PK
CB gears up to resume hearing on review petitions tomorrow
As the Supreme Court's Constitutional Bench (CB) gears up to resume hearing on review petitions against the majority verdict in the reserved seats case on Thursday, speculation is swirling about the direction of the decision and the political tremors it may unleash.
Experts believe the ruling will rest on how the court chooses to read the Constitution: either with a microscope or a magnifying glass.
Former additional attorney general Waqar Rana notes that the fate of the case hinges on two distinct interpretative approaches to the Constitution: a literal and pedantic reading, treating the Constitution as an ordinary statute or a liberal and organic interpretation that upholds foundational constitutional values.
""It is a test of the judiciary when judging the state (Paula Newberg) whether it follows and upholds the Constitution by approaching it with the latter rules of interpretation or it follows the former rules,"" Rana stated.
He added that from a historical perspective, the judiciary has been split into two camps: one aligned with the tradition of Justice Cornelius and the other with that of Justice Munir.
""Choices are simple. The Court either follows constitutional faith or continues with idolatry of necessity. In the ultimate analysis, the faith of people in the judicial system as an independent arbiter of justice and the rule of law is at stake.""
The reserved seats case is pivotal in determining whether Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) secures 23 additional National Assembly seats, which would significantly affect the power balance in the lower house and determine whether the ruling coalition secures a two-thirds majority.
To date, the judgment authored by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah – and endorsed by seven other judges – has not been implemented by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), despite being nearly a year old.
Observers note that four judicial opinions were rendered in the case. Among them is the second opinion, authored by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail and supported by then chief justice Qazi Faez Isa.
This view, widely referred to as the ""Mandokhail Formula,"" allows PTI some representation in the National Assembly. Should this view be endorsed by a new majority, the ruling coalition could achieve a two-thirds majority, while PTI reclaims a parliamentary presence.
A senior lawyer commented that endorsement of Justice Mandokhail's view could offer a ""win-win situation"" for both the government and PTI: the ruling alliance gets its supermajority, and PTI regains entry into Parliament.
The third opinion was penned by Justice Aminuddin Khan, head of the CB, and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan. They dismissed the Sunni Ittehad Council's (SIC) petition, upholding both the Peshawar High Court and ECP decisions, which held that reserved seats could not be allocated to SIC.
Their opinion called for the redistribution of the 78 unallocated seats among all qualifying parties, especially the PML-N and PPP.
Justice Amin's role as the CB's presiding judge gives his position added weight, and notably, six new judges have joined the current bench. However, none of the six judges who were part of the original bench are included in the review proceedings.
Even two judges who had earlier endorsed the majority order are not publicly supporting the July 12 judgement in court.
One judge, during recent hearings, even used the term ""biased"" to describe the original majority decisionan unprecedented move that has added further uncertainty to the case's outcome.
Meanwhile, debate is growing over whether the new majority will side with Justice Amin's stance or adopt the Mandokhail formula.
Legal insiders note that although two judges – Justice Ayesha Malik and Justice Aqeel Ahmad Abbasi – have already dismissed the review petitions and their votes will count in the final decision, many believe the July 12 majority judgement may not survive the ongoing review.
Some pro-government legal voices claim that the 27th Constitutional Amendment is under discussion, allegedly aiming to restructure judicial authority over the long term. This has reignited debate on whether judicial independence, a core feature of the Constitution, is being preserved or compromised.
Notably, petitions challenging the 26th Constitutional Amendment have yet to be scheduled by the CB, despite repeated calls from senior SC judges.
Observers argue that the judges who benefited from the 26th Amendment appear less concerned about judicial independence than those who were sidelined by it.
Though the government appears confident about the outcome, the bench is reportedly eager to conclude the review proceedings swiftly. PTI's counsel, Hamid Khan, has requested adjournment until August 5, citing his general adjournment, but sources suggest the court is unlikely to delay proceedings, especially with judges' summer vacations already in effect.

Bugti directs expansion of Quetta cleanliness drive,"US
n the occasion, the chief minister also approved the appointment of magistrates
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugt on Tuesday directed that the ongoing cleanliness campaign under the ""Safa Quetta Program"" should be expanded and be made more effective it for increasing of beautification of the Quetta City.
He said that the campaign against encroachments in the city and its surroundings should be further accelerated and this process should be completed without any pressure, recommendation or concession.

Atletico win in vain as Botafogo advance at CWC,"US
Diego Simeone's men defeated Botafogo 1-0
Brazilian side Botafogo booked their place in the last 16 of the Club World Cup on Monday despite a 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid which was not enough to prevent the Spaniards crashing out.
Atletico, routed 4-0 by Paris Saint-Germain in their opening game of the tournament, went into the final round of Group B fixtures knowing they would likely need a big win to advance.
With PSG defeating the Seattle Sounders 2-0 elsewhere in Group B, that task proved beyond Diego Simeone's men in another sweltering midday kick-off in front of 22,992 fans at the Pasadena Rose Bowl.
Former France international Antoine Griezmann scored the game's only goal, lashing home a Julian Alvarez cross in the 87th minute to give Atletico a victory that ultimately was in vain.
Botafogo — who upset European champions PSG 1-0 in their second group game — finished the group stage in second on six points behind the French giants, who top the section on goal difference.
Atletico, who also finished with six points, missed out on goal difference behind Botafogo.
""We're frustrated that we didn't qualify — we had six points,"" Atletico coach Simeone said afterwards. ""At the end of the day we were punished because it wasn't enough.
""I'm proud of the work of my guys. We played our hearts out; we won two games but unfortunately we are not going through.""
Botafogo, the South American champions, started brightly against Atletico, with the lively Venezuelan international Jefferson Savarino testing Jan Oblak in the opening minutes.
Atletico though grew into the contest and controlled possession and territory as the first half wore on.
Argentina international striker Alvarez had a promising opening in the 41st minute, but saw his shot deflect off Botafogo centre-half Alexander Barboza for a corner.
Atletico thought they had made a crucial breakthrough on the stroke of half-time when Alvarez appeared to be kicked in the penalty area, prompting a penalty check by the video assistant referee.
But while Alvarez appeared to be fouled, the review spotted a foul on Barboza in the build-up and no penalty was given.
""None of the decisions went our way,"" Simeone said of the incident afterwards.
With time running out in the second half, Atletico spent long periods camped in Botafogo territory with the Brazilians seemingly content to soak up pressure.
The side from Rio de Janeiro came closest to breaking the deadlock on 67 minutes, with Igor Jesus's first-time volley from Cuiabano's cross parried away by Oblak for a corner.
Yet in the closing stages Griezmann grabbed what turned out to be the winning goal, taking advantage of poor marking to tuck away Alvarez's whipped cross — but it was too little, too late for them.

"Finch excited about Babar, Smith batting together","US
The duo will play together for Sydney Sixers in BBL 15
Former Australia T20I captain Aaron Finch has expressed his excitement over the potential pairing of Pakistan superstar Babar Azam and Australian batting maestro Steve Smith for the upcoming Big Bash League (BBL) season 15.
Earlier this month, the Sydney Sixers confirmed the signing of Babar as their direct overseas player for BBL 15.
With the Pakistan captain expected to be available for the full season, there is a strong possibility that he will share the crease with Steve Smith, following the conclusion of the NRMA Insurance Test series — scheduled to wrap up by January 8.
Finch discussed the prospect on The Surge: Big Bash Podcast alongside host Adam White, calling the idea of Babar and Smith playing together ""extraordinary.""
""How extraordinary. Steve Smith, anytime he's played in the Big Bash, he's looked a class above everybody else"", said Finch.
""Then you throw in probably the most beautiful batter in the world, Babar Azam — I'm sure they're both looking forward to it as much as we are as fans.""
While the two have faced off in international cricket across formats, BBL 15 could mark their first time as teammates, donning the magenta of the Sydney Sixers.
Finch believes moments like these can reignite motivation for even the most seasoned players.
""Steve hasn't played with Babar before anywhere around the world, so to get that opportunity, they're (the) kind of things that keep you going when you're getting towards the end of your career.
""I'm not saying for any moment that Steve Smith is towards the end, but as you get on, and you've ticked almost every single box, you get a lot of joy out of small things like that.""
When asked if Smith would try to outperform Babar should they bat together, Finch didn't hesitate.
""100 per cent. He tries to out-bat anybody,"" said Finch.
Smith made a strong impression in last season's BBL, scoring 173 runs in three matches, including an unbeaten 121 off just 64 balls against the Perth Scorchers at the SCG.
Although Smith hasn't featured in a T20I since February 2023, Finch believes his hunger for excellence remains undiminished.
""He's made his point pretty clear that he wants to get to the Olympics in 2028 and be a part of that side,"" said Finch.
""We've seen in domestic cricket wherever he plays around the world, he is a level above.
""We've seen him at his best in international cricket be a level above as well, so it's not that he's got a point to prove because he's won a (T20) World Cup, he's been (at the) top of the tree.
""I think it's just for his own sanity. He wants to be the best player in the world, and that's what's made him as great as he's been for such a long time.""

LHC rejects Imran's bail in eight May 9 cases,"PK
Prosecution claims Khan incited supporters to target military facilities, cited forensic evidence
The Lahore High Court on Tuesday rejected bail petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan in eight cases linked to the May 9, 2023, riots, prompting sharp criticism from the party, which called the ruling a ""blatant miscarriage of justice"".
The decision, delivered by a two-member bench led by Justice Shahbaz Ali Rizvi, followed the conclusion of arguments from both prosecution and defence.
Imran's legal team had argued that the former prime minister was implicated without credible evidence while he was already in custody and denied any involvement in the violence.
The May 9 unrest erupted nationwide following Khan's arrest in a graft case and included attacks on civil and military installations, including Lahore's Jinnah House.
The prosecution claimed Khan incited supporters to target military facilities and cited forensic evidence, including audio recordings, which Khan allegedly refused to verify via voice matching.
PTI's legal counsel contended that the charges were politically driven and based on vague allegations of abetment. They argued the cases were part of a broader campaign to discredit the party and its leader.
In a strongly worded statement, PTI Punjab expressed deep disappointment, accusing the judiciary of operating under political influence.
""The courts have failed to uphold the principles of justice,"" the party said, vowing to continue its legal fight and launch a peaceful protest movement demanding democratic restoration and the release of political detainees.
Imran, who has been jailed since August 2023 after multiple convictions, remains a central figure in Pakistani politics despite his ouster in April 2022 through a no-confidence vote. Several PTI leaders and workers remain incarcerated over the May 9 incidents, while others have been granted bail.
The party maintains that the ongoing legal actions are an attempt to dismantle the country's largest political force ahead of critical political transitions.

A flexible approach to World Environment Day,"US
UNEP is our best bet in this situation.
Every year on June 5, people worldwide observe World Environment Day. It's a crucial reminder that we must protect our surroundings, or face severe consequences like higher medical costs, reduced productivity, increased poverty and societal decline.
While many awareness campaigns by governments and NGOs are largely superficial, a small part of society genuinely participates with limited resources. In contrast, wealthier groups often spend significantly to lead commemorative efforts, leveraging their financial power.
Notably, over the past twenty years, there's been almost a tenfold increase in social engagement on this day. This resurgence echoes the original environmental pledge made in the early 1970s, which aimed to renew humanity's commitment to protecting and conserving our environment.
When the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) established this day for global environmental commemoration, climate change was only just emerging. At that time, temperatures in the Global South weren't as extreme as they are today, especially for the large populations already living with limited resources.
In June, many southern South Asian cities now experience temperatures consistently above 40 degrees Celsius. Consequently, most awareness activities for this day are held indoors.
Those who can't afford air conditioning must rely on fans, bearing the brunt of their marginalised status. In contrast, those who can afford air-conditioned venues — often from government or business sectors -— celebrate the day in comfort.
In our region of hot climate, the most effective awareness activity for this occasion, tree plantation, faces significant hurdles. The intense heat, even in the early or late hours, makes it quite challenging for participants. Furthermore, summer is far from ideal for planting trees; the monsoon season, which follows shortly after, is much more suitable. For these reasons, we've largely abandoned tree plantation as a commemorative activity.
Instead, organisations here have gravitated towards indoor, rhetoric-based activities to raise awareness. These events, often labeled as seminars, workshops, conferences, debates or symposia, are presented to the public as significant awareness-raising efforts.
Unfortunately, the focus of these events often strays from their intended purpose. Instead of prioritising insightful and inspirational presentations and speeches, much attention is given to formalities.
This includes inviting VIPs as chief guests, serving refreshments and distributing mementos and giveaways. This often leaves the ""awareness"" aspect taking a backseat to event logistics and ceremonial aspects.
A significant hurdle for observing this day in Pakistan, particularly when it comes to tree planting activities, is the start of summer vacation on June 1. This means our most promising target audience — students — are out of reach. No institution can realistically ask students to return solely for this activity after they've been dismissed for their holidays.
Beyond students, we lack a community that voluntarily participates in these awareness campaigns. If we resort to forced nominations, such as government or corporate employees, their engagement and attentiveness will likely be low compared to those who willingly participate to learn. In essence, this situation severely limits our ability to both plant trees effectively and involve students to create a wider impact.
Both the government and civil society, along with the business sector, largely organise environmental awareness activities for this day. They're doing so without considering the intense heat, which poses a significant risk to both organisers and participants.
While those with access to safe transportation might not face many issues commuting for field activities, individuals without good quality conveyance will suffer from the heat, having to travel to venues and meet others under the open sun.
Ultimately, the primary goal for the leaders of all these sectors is to demonstrate their environmental commitment to their superiors, competitors, donors and critics, regardless of the challenging conditions.
Pakistan has been observing World Environment Day since the late 1980s. Even back then, June was a hot month, yet the suitability of this timing for Pakistan's climate was never really discussed.
The main goal, not just in Pakistan but in many donor-dependent developing countries, seems to be to follow Western practices and project an image of environmental awareness.
Pakistan's civil society already observes numerous other days dedicated to various important issues, so the odd timing of World Environment Day doesn't get much attention.
A few NGOs have, on occasion, floated the idea of proposing a National Environmental Day that aligns with local educational calendars and weather conditions, but this has never progressed beyond a mere suggestion.
The environmental civil society sector in Pakistan is relatively small and often works in isolation. As for the government, there's a perceived lack of initiative to develop innovative solutions. Their primary role is often seen as complying with directives rather than initiating ""out-of-the-box"" thinking.
UNEP is our best bet in this situation. If we bring this issue to their attention, they're likely to consider the document that established June 5 as World Environment Day. They just need to make a small change, adding that countries aren't obligated to observe the day exactly on June 5. Instead, they could observe it locally at their convenience.
The main goal isn't just to show unity, but to spread environmental awareness globally. The Global South, in particular, needs more outreach, as many people there aren't yet ready to act on environmental messages.
If signatories of the Paris Agreement can develop their own contributions to meet their obligations, then a day of such environmental importance should also be flexible for countries to observe according to their unique circumstances.

MPA apologises over unproved allegation,"US
Opposition, treasury members spar over corruption claims
PML-N Member of Punjab Assembly Muhammad Bilal Yamin apologised to opposition lawmaker Mian Ijaz Shafi on Tuesday after his allegation of his wristwatch having been stolen on the budget day was not proved.
Amid the opposition's protest during the budget speech, the treasury lawmakers resisted them from moving ahead. Since the day, the allegation of the watch theft had been surfacing during the budget debate. Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan had made it clear that Yamin would be required to apologise to Shafi if he failed to prove his allegation.
""After examining CCTV footages, I could not get any proof against Shafi. I tender apology to Mr Shafi if he is hurt,"" Yamin said in the House. Ijaz Shafi asked the speaker to train the treasury lawmakers to avoid making such accusations against others merely to appease their leadership. Lawmakers from the treasury benches continued praising the provincial budget for 2025-26, while the opposition criticised it on the fifth day of the general discussion.
Challenging the government's claim of lack of corruption, opposition member Rana Aftab asked if anyone could declare on oath that ""we are living in a corruption-free society"".
PML-N's Sardar Sher Ali Gorchani responded that he could swear that 90 per cent corruption had been eliminated from mines and minerals department since PTI's rule.

"No, not all Iranians are terrorists","US
Professor sheds lights on the Iranians invisible in Hollywood and US news media
It will come as little surprise to anyone who has ever consumed Hollywood entertainment that when foreign elements (and by foreign, we mean 'not Caucasian American') enter the picture, the stereotypes fly high and proud. Russians are criminal masterminds, Mexicans exist in a perpetual yellow-orange universe, and Iranians follow the well-beaten path taken by the committed terrorist.
In light of the ongoing military action in Iran, connoisseurs of American news media will be aware that even fact-based organisations follow the stereotypical parameters laid out by the entertainment industry. At least, such is the view held by Iranian professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey, Hooshang Amirahmadi. During a recent conversation with The Hollywood Reporter, Amirahmadi explains how Iran has been consistently misrepresented in US television.
A skewed perception
""Iran, unfortunately, has been presented to Americans as a pariah state made up only of terrorists,"" says Amirahmadi. "" It's actually really a similar situation to what Iranian TV portrays vis-à-vis Israel — 'they're all terrorists.' And unfortunately it doesn't seem to ever get better. I've worked on US-Iran relations for more than 40 years and there's still animus for Americans toward Iranians because of this.""
Founder of the transnational American Iranian Council, Amirahmadi is well versed on the subject of how the country of his origin is viewed through an American lens. As per the publication, he also ran the Center for Iranian Research and Analysis, visited Iran during its war with Iraq to try to bring about a resolution, has authored numerous books in English and Persian, and even (unsuccessful) submitted bids to run for president of Iran in 2005, 2013 and 2017.
Amirahmadi concedes that US networks are limited by the difficulties faced by reporters in gaining access to the ground and delivering direct news coverage to their audience.
""That's obviously a challenge,"" he admits, but adds that other issues are also at play. ""Another big problem is that American universities produce very few Iran specialists. There used to be a lot, and now you have less, and those you do have tend to be American. They're great, but we really need more who aren't just giving the American view.""
Films to the rescue
Fortunately for those on the lookout for authentic content, however, despite the difficulties of getting news coverage from the country, there are still Iranian filmmakers committed to getting their stories out for the world to see. This past Oscar season, for example, saw director Mohammad Rasoulof's The Seed of the Sacred Fig, which showed a younger generation opposing the Iranian regime. In addition, Jafar Panahi, one of the most well-known dissident filmmakers in Iran, walked away with the Palme d'Or at Cannes in May for his political film It Was Just an Accident. But are these anti-regime, pro-democracy films an accurate representation of Iran?
""What people don't remember is that Iran was the most pro-American country in the Middle East before the revolution,"" Amirahmadi reminds readers. ""Why would that change? People below 50 or 60 may not remember. But people above 50 or 60 do, and they can help the younger people.""
The professor adds that despite images perpetuated in American media about Iranians' devotion to terrorism, the reality on the ground is different.
""I think the Iran street is actually very pro-American,"" he muses. ""It's the regime that isn't.""
Amirahmadi adds that for a true picture of anti-American sentiments, one needs look no further than Saudi Arabia, despite the friendly relations between the governments of both countries.
""If you want to see anti-American, go to the streets of Saudi Arabia, where 35 per cent of the people live below the poverty line,"" he continues. ""Not the palace. The palace, the so-called pro-American palace, that's just billionaires having fun. Trust me, they are not pro-American. In 10 years, they'll have the most anti-American country in the region. The average Iranian is 10 times more pro-American than the average Saudi.""
The ordinary Iranian
Bearing all this in mind, the professor takes pains to illustrate that most Iranians are not quite the regime-devoted terrorists the American media depicts on either the news or in Hollywood. ""Many Iranians, even if they're Muslim in name, they're secular, and they can be either socialist or capitalist, just like Americans,"" he explains. ""The Iranian economy is a capitalist economy. But we tend to see things from a political lens and a regime lens and we don't realise that.""
Amirahmadi explains it best when he lays out the dichotomy between any government and the people it rules. Once again using Saudi Arabia and Iran as an example, he summarises it thus: ""In Iran the regime is anti-American and the street is pro-American. And in Saudi it's the reverse. But, of course, it's the street that should matter more. The regime changes. The street doesn't.""
Is there any hope?
None of this manages to slip through the net on American television news coverage, and in Amirahmadi realistic (if pessimistic) opinion, unless American politicians get a better handle on the facts they spout on air, there is no change beckoning on the horizon.
""I mean, you have Ted Cruz telling Tucker Carlson he doesn't even know the population of Iran,"" he points out. ""I think many Americans understand these differences, but our leaders on television don't give me a lot of hope.""
Amirahmadi concludes that there is just one way Americans can start seeing Iranians as people they can identify with, and the key lies with churning out films and television series that prove that Iranians have more things to do than engaging in terrorism.
""We need to see ordinary Iranians on television, not just the regime in the news,"" he insists. ""Someone needs to make a show [in Hollywood] where the main characters are Iranians in Iran. That's what will make for a deeper understanding.
Until that day comes, however, audiences will have to be content with whatever Iranian filmmakers like Panahi churn out, fighting tooth and nail and risking disbarment in their countries.

Gold prices tumble on Israel-Iran ceasefire,"PK
Slip by Rs3,800 per tola; rupee gains 10 paisa against greenback
Gold prices in Pakistan registered a sharp decline on Tuesday, mirroring the downtrend in the international market where bullion slipped nearly 2% to hit a more than two-week low as geopolitical tensions cooled. The global drop came as investor demand for safe-haven assets eased following Trump's announcement of a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.
In the domestic market, the price of 24-karat gold fell by Rs3,800 per tola to settle at Rs354,365, according to rates issued by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA). Similarly, the price of 10-gram gold dropped by Rs3,258 to reach Rs303,810.
On the previous day, gold had posted a modest decline of Rs300 per tola, closing at Rs358,165.
""There had been talk of a correction for several days and with tensions easing, the metal is now gradually retreating,"" said Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, noting that gold was trading lower after geopolitical tensions subsided.
Gold touched a high of $3,357 an ounce and a low of $3,303 on Tuesday and is still hovering near its lower range. The key support zone lies between $3,300 and $3,290. ""A breach below this level could push the market down towards $3,200,"" he said.
Agar indicated that if the geopolitical situation remains stable, gold prices may continue their downward correction, potentially sliding to $3,000 or even $2,800.
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee registered a slight gain against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Tuesday, appreciating by 0.04%. By the close of trading, the local currency settled at 283.77 against the greenback, marking an improvement of 10 paisa from the previous session's close at 283.87.
In the global market, the US dollar weakened while the Australian and New Zealand dollars strengthened after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran. The development boosted investor sentiment and triggered a risk rally across international markets.
Moreover, Pakistan's broad money (M2) grew by 0.9% on a week-on-week (WoW) basis to Rs38.4 trillion as of June 13, 2025, according to data released by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
The increase was mainly driven by a 1% WoW rise in total deposits with banks, which climbed to Rs27.5 trillion. Meanwhile, currency in circulation (CIC) edged higher by 0.7% WoW, standing at Rs10.9 trillion.
On a month-on-month (MoM) basis, the broad money expanded by 3.2% while year-on-year (YoY) growth stood at 11.6%. So far in 2025, M2 has posted an increase of 7.9%.
Currency in circulation surged 5.3% MoM and 17.4% YoY, reflecting higher cash demand after Eid holidays. Total deposits grew 2.3% MoM and 9.6% YoY during the period.
Other deposits with the SBP, however, declined 3.2% WoW and 13% MoM, marking a sharp 30.6% fall on a yearly basis.

Al Ahly and Porto share 4-4 thriller,"PL
Both teams were eliminated from the Club World Cup
Al Ahly and Porto shared a 4-4 thriller in their final game at the Club World Cup on Monday but both will head home after Inter Miami and Palmeiras drew to progress to the round of 16 from Group A.
Palestine striker Wessam Abou Ali scored a hat-trick and Mohamed Ali Ben Romdhane also found the net for the Egyptian champions but Porto pegged them back every time they went ahead.
Teenagers Rodrigo Mora and William Gomes, substitute Samu Aghehowa and Pepe all scored for the Portuguese club as both teams all but abandoned defending in search of goals that might keep them alive in the tournament.
In the end, though, a draw was not enough for either side and the 2-2 stalemate between Inter and Palmeiras in Miami was enough to render all of the many other permutations null and void.
""I'm very sad, very, very sad,"" said Abou Ali. ""I feel like we should have scored maybe five, six goals in the end, the opportunity was there to at least win the game and score some goals.""
Both teams came into the match played in suffocating heat at Metlife Stadium without a goal from open play in the tournament but they made up for it in a sometimes frenetic contest.
Al Ahly took the early initiative and got their reward when Abou Ali gave them the lead in the 15th minute with a cool finish into the far corner of the net.
Lively 18-year-old Mora equalised eight minutes later after skipping through the Al Ahly defence and past goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shenawy before clipping the ball into the net.
Egypt midfielder Zizo was brought down in the box by Fabio Vieira running onto an Abou Ali cutback in stoppage time at the end of the first, and the Palestinian sent Claudio Ramos the wrong way from the spot to put Al Ahly 2-1 up at the break.
Three goals in three minutes soon after the break had the scores back level at 3-3 in the 53rd minute, Gomes starting it all off by curling a beautiful shot into the top right-hand corner of the net.
Abou Ali then completed his hat-trick with a powerful header from a corner but Aghehowa responded in kind almost immediately down the other end.
Ben Romdhane put Al Ahly back in front with a lovely strike from the edge of the box in the 64th minute and the Egyptian side poured forward looking to boost their goal difference in case the result in Miami went their way.
Al Ahly missed a host of gilt-edged chances, however, and Pepe ensured the honours would be shared when he drilled a shot from the edge of the box past Al Ahly captain El-Shenawy a minute from time.
""I think the game in the second half was not a normal football game anymore,"" said Al Ahly coach Jose Riveiro.
""A good show for the fans, I guess, a lot of goals. Not the result, obviously, that we were looking for, because we wanted to go through.""

PA approves Rs156b supplementary budget amid uproar,"US
CM defends expenditures on judiciary, debt servicing, and official hospitality
The Sindh Assembly on Tuesday approved supplementary expenditures amounting to Rs156 billion for the fiscal year 2024-25, brushing aside 735 cut motions submitted by opposition lawmakers.
The session, chaired by Speaker Syed Owais Qadir Shah, witnessed heated exchanges as opposition members demanded individual debate on each motion — a request ultimately denied by the chair.
The supplementary budget, presented by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, who also holds the finance portfolio, included allocations for the Governor's Secretariat, Provincial Assembly, and judicial expenses, among others. The CM tabled 84 supplementary demands for grants, which were passed by a majority vote after the opposition's motions were clubbed and rejected collectively.
In his address, CM Shah detailed the breakdown of the expenditures: Rs5 billion for judicial (charged) expenses, Rs3 billion for the Sindh Assembly, over Rs1 billion for the Governor's House, and a significant Rs59 billion for debt servicing. He emphasized that judicial expenses are constitutionally protected and beyond the executive's control, while urging administrative departments to exercise fiscal restraint.
Opposition Leader Ali Khursheedi criticized the consolidation of cut motions, arguing that the opposition had invested considerable effort in drafting them individually. However, the Speaker maintained procedural authority and moved forward with a collective vote.

Opposition rejects PPP's 'visionless' budget for city,"US
Demands Rs30m for development in each union council
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation City Council Opposition Leader Saifuddin Advocate has rejected the local government budget presented by the Pakistan People Party regime, dubbing it a ""vision less"" budget.
The opposition leader expressed these views while sharing the JI's vision 2025-30 at his chamber during the pre-budget briefing to the media on Tuesday.
He said that not even a single development scheme was presented in the city council for the past two years. This year 116 development schemes are being presented in the Annual Development Plan but unfortunately all of them were supposed to be carried out in the UCs run by either the PPP or it's partner the Muttahida Qaumi Movement.
He added that the JI runs nine towns and 87 union councils but the PPP's mayor showed extreme biasness when it comes to development schemes. He suggested that at least Rs30 million should be allocated for development in each union council of the mega city.
On the occasion, he floated an idea to take all stakeholders of the mega city onboard for the Karachi Development Plan-- a comprehensive strategy to develop the mega city.

"Osaka, Azarenka advance on grass","US
The Japanese seed defeated Olga Danilovic 7-6 (8/6), 7-6 (7/4)
Former world number ones Naomi Osaka and Victoria Azarenka both advanced to the second round in the Wimbledon warm-up tournament at Bad Homburg on Monday.
Japan's Osaka battled past Serbian qualifier Olga Danilovic 7-6 (8/6), 7-6 (7/4) as Belarusian Azarenka beat Germany's Laura Siegemund 6-2, 6-2.
Azarenka, 35, next meets Poland's Iga Swiatek in the second round.
Osaka fired 16 aces with Danilovic hitting 10 in a big-serving battle which lasted just over two hours.
""It's my first grass-court win of the year, so I'm really excited about that,"" said Osaka, a wildcard to the main draw.
""I think I have potential (on grass), but everyone else is also really good.
""I can never take it for granted, the wins. Just super excited that I won today.""
The victory halts Osaka's three-match losing streak after Rome, the French Open and Berlin as she continues her comeback from maternity leave last year.
The four-time Grand Slam winner advances to a second-round meeting with fifth seed Emma Navarro of the United States.
Osaka saved four break points, while Danilovic fought off six, with the Japanese player coming through two tight tie-breaks.
Osaka came back from 4-2 down in the first-set breaker, using her backhand to force an error on her second set point.
Danilovic started the second set with three consecutive aces.
In the tiebreak Osaka challenged a called ace by Danilovic and the review showed the ball just out. Danilovic then double-faulted, and Osaka took a 3-1 lead.
A smash gave Osaka a 6-4 advantage and double match point which she wrapped up with a forehand winner on the next point.
Two-time Australian Open champion Azarenka had to qualify for this week's main draw, but eased past wild card Siegemund.

Khalil's 'horrendous' 104 days in custody,"CN
Pro-Palestinian activist details recent hardship
Mahmoud Khalil, one of the most prominent leaders of pro-Palestinian protests on US campuses, recounted his experience surviving 104 days in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention after being targeted for deportation by the Trump administration.
""I shared a dorm with over 70 men, absolutely no privacy, lights on all the time,"" the 30-year-old said Sunday on the steps of Columbia University, where he was a graduate student.
Khalil, a legal permanent resident in the United States who is married to an American citizen and has a US-born son, had been in custody since March facing potential removal proceedings.
He was freed from a federal immigration detention centre in Jena, Louisiana on Friday, hours after a judge ordered his release on bail.
The activist was a figurehead of student protests at Columbia University against US ally Israel's war in Gaza, and the administration of Donald Trump labelled him a national security threat.
""It's so normal in detention to see men cry,"" Khalil recalled, deeming the situation ""horrendous"" and ""a stain on the US Constitution.""
""I spent my days listening to one tragic story after another: listening to a father of four whose wife is battling cancer, and he's in detention,"" Khalil detailed in his first protest appearance since regaining his freedom.
""I listened to a story of an individual who has been in the United States for over 20 years, all his children are American, yet he's deported.""
The circumstances of the detention were tough, Khalil described, and he took solace where he could find it to gain the strength to carry on.
""It is often hard to find patience in ICE detention,"" Khalil said.
""The centre is crowded with hundreds of people who are told that their existence is illegal, and not one of us knows when we can go free.
""At those moments, it was remembering a specific chant that gave me strength : 'I believe that we will win,'"" he continued, to cheers from the audience.
Khalil said he even scratched the phrase into his detention center bunk bed as a reminder, being the last thing he saw when he went to sleep and the first thing he read waking up in the morning.
He repeats it even now, ""knowing that I have won in a small way by being free today.""
Khalil took specific aim at the site of his speech, Columbia University, chastising the institution for saying ""that they want to protect their international students, while over 100 (days) later, I haven't received a single call from this university.""
