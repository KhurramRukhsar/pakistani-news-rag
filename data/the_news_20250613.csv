Whither austerity drive?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320781-whither-austerity-drive,"ISLAMABAD: In a stark reversal of its earlier commitment to financial restraint, the Shehbaz Sharif government has allowed a dramatic increase in the salaries and perks of the parliamentarians.
These raises fly in the face of the austerity measures once championed by the Shehbaz Sharif-led administration. Just two years ago, during his previous tenure (2022–23), the government proposed significant cuts to the salaries and benefits of cabinet ministers, lawmakers, and even judges, as part of a broader effort to curb excessive public spending.
The National Austerity Committee (NAC), established by Shehbaz Sharif himself, had recommended capping pensions at Rs500,000 a month — primarily aimed at addressing the growing financial burden posed by retired high court and Supreme Court judges. However, the government left the responsibility of implementing these recommendations within the judiciary to the Chief Justice of Pakistan.
In a striking about-face, the current Shehbaz Sharif administration has now proposed a five-fold increase in the salaries of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly, as well as the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the Senate.
Almost a month back the salaries of federal ministers, ministers of state, and advisers were increased by 188 percent through a presidential ordinance issued by the government. The salary increase was effective from January 1, 2025. The Federal Ministers and Ministers of State Salary and Benefits Amendment Ordinance 2025, was amended to set the new salary for both federal ministers and ministers of state at Rs519,000.
Earlier in January this year, the Finance Committee had approved a similar salary increase for members of the National Assembly (MNAs) and senators, bringing their monthly pay to Rs519,000, which will take effect from January 1, 2025.
Members from both the treasury and opposition benches set aside political rivalries to unanimously approve a 300 percent increase in their own salaries. When the move triggered public backlash, some PTI leaders attempted to distance themselves from the decision.
Last year, the government also doubled the salaries of superior court judges and substantially increased their pensions. Where retired judges once drew around Rs1 million a month, they now receive over Rs1.5 million, along with a variety of post-retirement benefits. Following the adoption of the recent 26th Constitutional Amendment, the house rent for Supreme Court judges rose from Rs68,000 to Rs350,000 a month. Judicial allowances for apex court judges surged from Rs428,040 to Rs1,161,163. Similarly, High Court judges saw their house rent increase from Rs65,000 to Rs350,000, and their judicial allowances jump from Rs342,431 to Rs1,090,000. These substantial hikes have directly affected the pension structure, allowing retired superior court judges to draw over Rs1.5 million a month - contradicting the very austerity measures previously advocated.
During Shehbaz Sharif’s 2022-23 tenure, the NAC had initially recommended a 15 percent reduction in the salaries and allowances of all legislators including MNAs, Senators, and MPAs but no action was taken.The NAC had also proposed abolishing the longstanding practice of lawmakers identifying development projects - a system in place since 1985 that enables MNAs, MPAs, and Senators to influence public spending. Like many other recommendations, this one too was ignored and even in the present budget tens of billions are allocated for the MPs development schemes.
These developments come at a time when Pakistan continues to grapple with economic hardship and mounting debt, raising serious concerns about the government’s commitment to responsible governance.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Atta Tarar reaffirmed the government’s commitment to its austerity drive, stating that there is no question of reversing it. He emphasised that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in the latest cabinet meeting, specifically stressed the need to continue with the existing cost-cutting measures.
Tarar noted that the prime minister has taken notice of the proposed salary increases for the Chairman Senate and Speaker of the National Assembly, assuring the public that these increases will not be approved and will instead be revised downward. However, Tarar explained that the salaries of cabinet ministers (majority of whom are not taking salaries) have been made equal to those of Members of Parliament. Salaries of MPs were increased a couple of months back in current financial year. This is not a quantum jump but an increase at level which will enable them to meet daily expenses. No increase in salaries had been done in a long time and this decision was taken by Parliament keeping in view genuine difficulties of MPs.

Telco to pay Rs22bn taxes after IHC verdict,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320782-telco-to-pay-rs22bn-taxes-after-ihc-verdict,"ISLAMABAD: A Division Bench of the Islamabad High Court, led by Justice Babar Sattar, has given a verdict in favour of revenue collector in a tax reference filed by a major telco.
The ruling upholds the powers and jurisdiction of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in assessing tax liability on a high-value intra-group transaction involving the transfer of telecom operator’s tower assets. As a result, the teleco is now liable to pay taxes amounting to approximately Rs22 billion ($78 million) on its gain from the transaction.
The assessment order was written by former FBR chairman Amjad Zubair Taiwana when he was serving as Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU), Islamabad, chief commissioner.
According to the FBR’s announcement, this case focused on a 2018 internal asset reorganisation, where the teleco transferred its nationwide tower infrastructure to its wholly owned subsidiary. The disposal of these assets for Rs98.5 billion ($940 million) by the telecom operator was recorded in its financial statements as an accounting gain of approximately Rs75.9 billion. However, the teleco contended that the transaction was not taxable because the asset was disposed of to its wholly owned subsidiary, according to section 97(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (ITO) concerning intra-group transfers. The IHC dismissed the petitioner’s argument, stating that the provision permits a tax-neutral event only if all conditions of section 97 of the ITO are met. This includes ensuring that the written-down value of the transferred asset remains unchanged in the hands of the transferee compared to the transferor, meaning the transaction should not generate any economic value leading to taxable income. The court determined that the transaction was conducted at a fair market value of $940 million, accepted by the petitioner as consideration, thereby violating section 97 of the ITO. Consequently, the court concluded that the gain from the transaction was clearly a taxable event since nothing remained to defer taxation to a later date. Additionally, it ruled that the commissioner had the authority to consider accounting income when evaluating taxable income. While dismissing another petition of the same telecom operator filed against a show cause notice issued under the Federal Excise Act, 2005, the court-imposed cost of Rs100,000 on the petitioner to be paid to the LTO, Islamabad, deputy commissioner (Inland Revenue) within four weeks.

Survivor of Air India crash jumped out of emergency exit,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320783-survivor-of-air-india-crash-jumped-out-of-emergency-exit,"NEW DELHI: Ramesh Viswashkumar, the only known survivor out of the 242 people onboard an Air India plane that crashed in Ahmedabad on Thursday, had been sitting near an emergency exit of the London-bound flight and managed to jump out, police said.
Speaking from his hospital bed, the 40-year-old told Indian media that he was a British national and was travelling to Britain with his brother after visiting family in India.
“When I got up, there were bodies all around me. I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me. Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital,” Viswashkumar told the Hindustan Times. Social media footage shown on Indian news channels showed a man in a bloodstained white t-shirt and dark pants limping on a street and being helped by a medic. The man had bruises on his face and a goatee beard, resembling photographs of Viswashkumar in hospital after the crash that were published by local media.
Reuters could not immediately verify the video, in which people gathered around the man and asked him where were the other passengers, to which he replied “they’re all inside”.
A photo of Viswashkumar’s boarding pass shown online by the Hindustan Times showed that he was seated in seat 11A of the plane bound for Gatwick Airport.
He told the paper his brother Ajay had been seated in a different row on the plane and asked for help to find him. “He was near the emergency exit and managed to escape by jumping out the emergency door,” said Vidhi Chaudhary, a senior police officer in Ahmedabad, speaking about Viswashkumar.
A member of Viswashkumar’s family based in Britain, who requested anonymity, told Reuters over the phone that he had survived and that the family was in touch with him, but declined to share further details.
Ajay Valgi, a cousin of Viswashkumar who lives in Leicester, central England, told the BBC that Viswashkumar spoke by phone to confirm he was all right. “He only said that he was fine, nothing else,” Valgi said. Valgi said the family had not heard anything about his brother. “We’re not doing well. We’re all upset,” he said. Viswashkumar is married with one child, a boy, he added. Police said Viswashkumar was the sole passenger known so far to have survived but added that rescue operations were still ongoing. “Chances are that there might be more survivors among the injured who are being treated in the hospital,” Chaudhary said.

Pakistan to secure $2bn commercial financing this month: Aurangzeb,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320784-pakistan-to-secure-2bn-commercial-financing-this-month-aurangzeb,"ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance on Thursday that Pakistan will return to commercial financing, aiming to secure $2 billion this month to boost forex reserves to $14 billion. Half of this will be guaranteed by Asian Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.
He stated that while monetary policy falls under the State Bank’s domain, he expects a rate cut in the upcoming meeting, with inflation likely to enter single digits next fiscal year.
Aurangzeb said that the government would move towards downsizing and rightsizing in Utility Stores Corporation and Passco. “I want to make it clear that the government will move towards downsizing and rightsizing these SOEs, he told the panel. Federal Secretary Finance Imdadullah Bosal informed the committee that the government has approved a 10 percent salary increase for all public sector employees and a Special Relief Allowance at 50 percent for Armed Forces officers and 20 percent for Junior Commissioned Officers (JCOs) and soldiers in the 2025-26 budget.
Initially, a six percent salary hike was proposed, but the federal cabinet raised it to 10 percent during the budget approval meeting.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, chaired by Syed Naveed Qamar, held its first session to review the budget and finance bill.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani—who assumed the role after the post-budget press conference boycott by journalists (later resolved by the Information Minister)—attended the meeting.
The finance secretary briefed the committee on relief measures, including 10 percent salary increase for government employees, seven percent pension hike, 30 percent Disparity Allowance to reduce pay gaps, and Special Relief Allowance at rate of 50 percent for officers of Armed Forces and 20 percent for JCOs/soldiers.
Along with hiking salaries and allowance both for civilian and military personnel, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) also reduced tax rates for slabs of salaried class. The sources said that the FBR has done its working and estimated that for the first income slab earning from Rs0.6 million to Rs1.2 million, the tax rate was proposed reduction from five percent to one percent in the Finance Bill 2025-26. In the cabinet meeting when the salary of public sector was proposed to be increased from 6 to 10 percent then the tax rate for first slab was jacked up from one to 2.5 percent. It means that the tax incidence for first slab of Rs0.6 million to Rs1.2 million was increased from Rs6,000 to Rs15,000 per year. At the moment, the tax rate for the first slab stood at Rs30,000 per month. Now for all other slabs, Rs9,000 will be added while their rate will remain the same as proposed originally in the Finance Bill 2025-26 tabled in Parliament.
Opposition Leader Omar Ayub criticised rampant Iranian oil smuggling, causing Rs500 billion in losses, including Rs149 billion in petroleum levy evasion. He questioned Customs’ failure to curb smuggling and opposed granting FBR officers arrest powers in the Finance Bill.
The finance secretary shared all important fiscal and budgetary numbers with the standing committee.
The secretary clarified that the petroleum levy stands at Rs77–78 per litre, with an additional Rs2.5 carbon levy, bringing the total to around Rs80 per litre—with no upper cap.
The government also introduced an EV Adoption Levy on locally made and imported vehicles to generate Rs10 billion.

Trump offers arbitration over Kashmir,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320786-trump-offers-arbitration-over-kashmir,"WASHINGTON DC: United States President Donald Trump on Thursday once again offered to arbitrate over the Kashmir dispute, and again claimed credit for the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, saying he prevented a potential nuclear war.
Addressing reporters at the White House, the US President said he “stopped a war” between Pakistan and India, as the confrontation could eventually lead to a nuclear exchange. Trump said he made personal calls to both Indian and Pakistani leaders at the height of tensions. “I respect both the leaders of India and Pakistan. They are great people, and I know them. I stopped the war through phone calls and by offering them trade deals.”
“Eventually, they were gonna go nuclear… and I stopped it. I called each leader… and I spoke to them and talked about trade,” Trump said. “I said, ‘You’re not trading with us if you go to war… if you’re going to start throwing nuclear weapons around.’”
“They were both unbelievable. They understood it exactly. They stopped. I stopped that war with phone calls and trade,” Trump added.
“They have a large stockpile of nuclear weapons, and I think I should get some credit for bringing them back from the precipice.” He said that India is working on a trade deal in Washington, and a Pakistani delegation would arrive next week.
Trump said, “We will bring them together.” Offering to arbitrate the decades-long Kashmir dispute, the US President said he told the leadership of India and Pakistan, “I can solve anything. I will be your arbitrator.”

Pakistan slips to last on WEF Gender Gap Report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320787-pakistan-slips-to-last-on-wef-gender-gap-report,"KARACHI: Pakistan ranks last among 148 countries on the World Economic Forum (WEF)’s Global Gender Gap Report 2025. Released on Wednesday, the report gave Pakistan a gender parity score of 56.7 per cent, a 0.3 per cent decline from the score it received in 2024. A score of 100 per cent indicates gender parity.
This year’s results are a second consecutive drop from the nation’s best score of 57.7 per cent, achieved in 2023. To assign countries their gender parity score, the Global Gender Gap Index annually benchmarks the current state and evolution of gender parity across four key dimensions (subindexes): ‘Economic Participation and Opportunity’, ‘Educational Attainment’, ‘Health and Survival’ and ‘Political Empowerment’. Though coming last, Pakistan has not fallen far, dropping just three spots from last year’s rank of 145th. Iceland stands on top of the list, while Bangladesh got the highest rank out of the seven countries in the ‘Southern Asia’ region, at 24th. India placed 131st globally and fifth in the region.
Since launching in 2006, it has been the longest-standing index tracking the progress of numerous countries’ efforts to close gaps across these dimensions and move towards gender parity over time. Despite the recent drops and its bottom ranking on this year’s report, Pakistan has closed +2.3 of its gender gap since 2006. The sole subindex advance registered by Pakistan in this year’s edition is ‘Educational Attainment’, bumping educational parity upwards by +1.5 percentage points to reach 85.1 per cent. The report argues that part of the shift is driven by an increase in female literacy rates (from 46.5 per cent to 48.5 per cent). However, parity has also risen because male enrolment shares have dropped in tertiary education, increasing the relative balance between men and women but lowering educational reach overall. Pakistan ranks 137th out of 148 countries on the ‘Educational Attainment’ subindex, and its highest subindex rank, 118th, is in ‘Political Empowerment’. However, Pakistan’s score on ‘Political Empowerment’ has dropped from 12.2 per cent in 2024 to 11 per cent for this year. Despite a rise in parity in parliament, the country was listed among those with all-male ministerial cabinets. The country’s highest score is on the ‘Health and Survival’ subindex at 95.9 per cent, and it attained a score of 34.7 per cent on ‘Economic Participation and Opportunity’. The report says that income disparity in Pakistan has increased slightly since the last edition (+.02 points), as has perceived wage inequality (+4 percentage points).  Overall, the report finds that there is still a combined global average gender gap of over 30 per cent across the four areas that it covers. The global gender gap score in 2025 for all 148 economies included in this edition of the index stands at 68.8 per cent, rising slightly from 68.4 per cent in 2024. In her comments on this year’s report, WEF Managing Director Saadia Zahidi says that it “arrives at a decisive moment, with the world in flux. Technological breakthroughs, geopolitical conflict, and economic uncertainty are creating unprecedented challenges as well as bringing new opportunities. Amid such change, gender parity is both a principle and a strategy.” According to the managing director, “Economies that tap into the full spectrum of their talent and human capital are best positioned to navigate an era of transformation and accelerate productivity and prosperity. Yet most economies are not fully leveraging this pathway for growth”.

IHC stops auction of Bahria Town’s property,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320788-ihc-stops-auction-of-bahria-town-s-property,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday issued a stay order in the case against NAB’s move to auction Bahria Town properties.
In the order issued by the division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muhammad Asif on the petition of Bahria Town, the court ordered not to take any disciplinary action against Bahria Town and said that the court was told that Bahria Town is a private limited company which is associated with the construction sector.
The court was told that Bahria Town is neither a party, nor an accused, nor an absconder in the £190 million NAB case. It said that according to the petitioner, NAB nevertheless seized Bahria Town’s properties. After the court’s stay order, the court issued notices to NAB and other parties and sought their replies. The hearing of the case was adjourned indefinitely. NAB had issued an advertisement to auction Bahria Town’s properties on June 12.

PBS defends 2.68% GDP growth amid data controversy,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320789-pbs-defends-2-68pc-gdp-growth-amid-data-controversy,"ISLAMABAD: Chief Statistician Pakistan Bureau of Statistics Dr Naeemuz Zafar on Thursday defended the controversial GDP growth figure of 2.68 per cent estimated by the National Accounts Committee (NAC) and claimed that there would be no major revision in it.
However, he conceded that the livestock growth was calculated on the basis of the livestock census held in 2005-6, while the budgeted numbers were used to estimate growth in electricity sector.
During the news conference along with Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal here at P Block, the PBS chief statistician relied to different questions raised by journalists and stated that the growth numbers were estimated in line with best international standards placed by United Nations as well as the IMF. The quarterly growth figures were released. He said that the different surveys were underway to change base year from 2015-16 to 2025-26.
When asked about finance minister’s willingness to constitute a committee comprising independent experts, the chief statistician said that it would be the prerogative of the government but they were ready to defend their growth figures at any forum.
The GDP growth figures triggered controversy owing to variety of reasons as first of all in the agriculture sector where the major crops witnessed a decline by 13pc the livestock higher growth and turned negative growth into slight positive rate of growth of 0.56pc for overall agriculture sector.
Secondly, there were certain assumptions for the last quarter (April-June) for elevating the growth number as in the first three quarters the average growth rate remained at 1.7pc but a miracle can result into jacking up growth up to 5.3pc in the last quarter in order to achieve the growth rate of 2.68pc for the outgoing fiscal year.
Alone construction sector and electricity sector contributed 1pc hike to the growth rate and if exclude, the growth number would fall to 1.7pc instead of 2.7pc for the outgoing fiscal year. The construction sector showed impressive growth in papers on the basis of increased utilisation of funds under Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).
The GDP growth figure is calculated quarterly basis  and now the NAC meeting is expected to be held in October/November 2025 in order to calculate the growth of first quarter of the next fiscal year and revising the growth figure of the fiscal year 2024-25. Keeping in view assumptions, there is a chance of substantial revision because till that time the actual numbers of different sectors will be available.
To another question on poverty and unemployment figures, he said that the PBS was busy in population census and other assignments but the poverty and labour force survey were underway and data would be available by coming October/November to analyse and come up with latest numbers on poverty and unemployment.

"Rs1,275bn power sector loan: Consumers to pay Rs3.23 per unit debt surcharge for 6 more years",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320790-rs1-275bn-power-sector-loan-consumers-to-pay-rs3-23-unit-debt-surcharge-for-6-more-years,"ISLAMABAD: The much-discussed Debt Service Surcharge (DSS) of Rs3.23 per unit is already being charged to electricity consumers through their monthly bills, meaning there will be no additional financial burden on them under the current arrangement.
However, consumers will continue to pay this surcharge for the next six years to help repay a Rs1,275 billion loan — along with interest — secured by the state-owned Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) from 18 commercial banks. The loan was taken as part of a long-term strategy to eliminate the persistent circular debt in the power sector once and for all, according to a senior Power Division official involved in negotiations with the banks. He said the term sheet between the CPPA and commercial banks has been finalised, and a summary has been forwarded to the federal cabinet for approval. The decision is expected shortly after Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif returns from his official visit to the UAE.
In response to a question, the official said that the Rs3.23/unit surcharge had reached its 10pc cap and the government did not plan to raise it. However, under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the cap has now been removed, as it was considered a structural benchmark. “This initiative — raising Rs1.275 trillion from commercial banks — will likely be operationalised in the third or fourth week of June,” he said. “The circular debt currently stands at Rs2.381 trillion and will be reduced by Rs1.275 trillion through the loan.”
The remainder of the circular debt will be addressed through multiple avenues, including gains from lower discount rates, renegotiated power purchase agreements with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), and the termination of six IPP contracts. The government expects the circular debt to drop to just Rs300 billion, which it plans to eliminate through operational efficiencies.
Under the finalised term sheet, commercial banks will provide a fresh loan of Rs617 billion at a markup of 10.50–11pc, calculated as KIBOR minus 0.90 basis points. This amount will be repaid by electricity consumers over six years via the DSS already embedded in their bills.
Banks will deduct the DSS amount at source when consumers pay their electricity bills, a mechanism expected to enhance the credit risk profile for lenders.
The official noted that the IMF has allowed banks to extend credit directly to CPPA without requiring a government guarantee. This latest tranche of Rs617 billion adds to an earlier Rs658 billion loan provided to the power sector through Power Holding Limited (PHL), which was backed by a sovereign guarantee. Together, the two loans comprise the Rs1.275 trillion figure being used to tackle the sector’s financial woes.

Reforms averted default: Ahsan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320791-reforms-averted-default-ahsan,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday said that Pakistan has transitioned from near economic collapse in 2022 to a phase of macroeconomic stability, crediting tough but necessary reforms for this turnaround.
Speaking at a press conference at the P Block Auditorium, he said, “When we assumed office, Pakistan was on the brink of internal default, the rupee was crashing, reserves were depleted, and we faced a collapsed economy. What critics called austerity was, in reality, a rescue operation.”
He noted that the GDP has rebounded to 2.7pc in the current fiscal year, with a growth target of 4.2pc set for 2025–26. “We’re now financing debt and defence from our own resources. Soon, we’ll be self-sufficient in development spending,” he added.
The minister said the Planning Commission would propose removing population as a primary criterion in the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award formula.
He described the current approach, where population plays a dominant role in determining the distribution of financial resources among provinces, as regressive, arguing that it incentivises provinces to inflate population figures for greater fiscal allocations.
Ahsan Iqbal said the process of devolution under the 18th Amendment remains incomplete. While powers were shifted from the Centre to the provinces, the provinces, he noted, have largely retained authority without devolving it further to the district level. “This should now be part of our national agenda—ensuring that governance reaches the grassroots level to improve service delivery,” he stressed.
The minister stated that the government is committed to a gradual and stable economic recovery, avoiding past patterns that led to twin deficits. “This time, the Urran will not be allowed to crash,” he asserted.
Ahsan Iqbal pointed out that development spending through the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) has declined from 2.6pc of GDP in 2017–18 to just 0.8pc, which he called a serious concern. However, he added that provinces’ share in development has increased, bringing the total national development outlay to Rs4.2 trillion.
Addressing a question about salary hikes for the Senate chairman, National Assembly speaker, and parliamentarians, Ahsan remarked that provincial ministers now earn more than federal ministers and MNAs. “Even my subordinates are drawing higher salaries. I receive Rs200,000 a month, while the Planning secretary gets Rs500,000,” he said.
Outlining key targets, Ahsan Iqbal said the government is pursuing 4.5pc growth in agriculture, supported by Rs4.2 billion in investment in crop productivity, livestock, modernisation, and mechanisation — augmented by initiatives like the Punjab Kissan Card. Industry is projected to grow at 4.3pc, aided by lower tariffs and improved energy supply, while the services sector is expected to grow at 4pc, driven by IT exports, digital retail, and fintech. He projected that inflation will remain within 7pc to 7.5pc, thanks to easing global oil prices and a stable exchange rate. Remittances, growing exports, and foreign inflows are also contributing to macroeconomic stability. “The world is acknowledging Pakistan’s turnaround,” he said.
Ahsan Iqbal noted a marked improvement in investor confidence, citing the IMF’s approval of $1.4 billion under the RSF, a first for Pakistan. He also highlighted the successful completion of the SBA programme, the second tranche under the EFF, and credit rating upgrades by Fitch and Moody’s. The World Bank’s ten-year $20 billion Country Partnership Framework, he said, reflects strong international trust in Pakistan’s reform trajectory.
He emphasised that the fiscal deficit has declined from 5.9pc to 3.9pc, and remittances are expected to reach $38 billion this year. Additionally, Rs140 billion in losses from power sector companies have been curtailed, and $5 billion in new energy exploration and production investments have been secured.
The minister said the FY2025-26 budget aligns with the ‘Urran Pakistan’ five-sector growth strategy, offering relief to the salaried class and pensioners, simplifying taxes for small businesses, and boosting social protection. The BISP budget has been increased to Rs716 billion, he said, reaffirming the government’s commitment to inclusive development.
He also shared that under the 13th Five-Year Plan, total development spending of Rs17 trillion is envisaged — Rs7 trillion from the federal government and Rs10 trillion from provinces. This year’s Rs4.2 trillion outlay, he said, reflects ambition despite constraints. “We requested Rs1.6 trillion for the federal PSDP, but only Rs1 trillion was approved, leading us to drop 367 low-impact projects, saving Rs2.73 trillion.” Ahsan Iqbal said the federal government is currently managing Rs12.8 trillion worth of projects, with Rs8.5 trillion in throw-forward liabilities, adding that delays and underfunding inflate project costs annually. “Our new focus is on high-impact initiatives that generate employment, boost exports, build climate resilience, and enhance human capital.”
He emphasised reform through data-driven governance, streamlined processes, citizen-focused delivery, and robust monitoring to eliminate inefficiencies and leakages.
The minister said 280 projects were completed in 2024-25, including seven major health initiatives such as the expansion of PIMS with 6,600 beds and digital health infrastructure. He cited the success of olive production as an example of effective PSDP investments.
Ahsan reiterated that current priorities include completing ongoing projects and targeting development in underserved areas — Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, and KP’s merged districts. A total of Rs42 billion has been earmarked under the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP) for solar energy, FATA University, and policing infrastructure.
Major infrastructure projects underway include: Diamer Bhasha Dam (Rs33 billion); Mohmand Dam (Rs35 billion); Quetta-Karachi Highway (Rs100 billion); M-6 Motorway and N-55 Indus Highway; Eastbay Expressway Phase II.
Over Rs223 billion has been allocated to water and energy, including 12 hydropower projects and the 1,200-MW Sindh Solar Project, as part of a shift toward a clean, self-reliant energy future.
In the education and tech sectors, Ahsan announced the launch of Daanish Schools and new university campuses in Muzaffargarh and Rajanpur. The government is also rolling out over 23,000 IT training slots, 18,000 internships, and 100,000 laptops to equip youth for the digital economy. He said that initiatives like National Centres and Quantum Valley aim to place Pakistan on the global tech map.

IMF rejection stalls $6bn refinery upgrade investments,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320793-imf-rejection-stalls-6bn-refinery-upgrade-investments,"ISLAMABAD: In a major setback for Pakistan’s oil refining sector, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has refused to accept the government’s proposals aimed at facilitating $6 billion in refinery upgrade projects, dealing a blow to efforts to produce cleaner Euro-V standard fuels.
A senior Petroleum Division official confirmed to ‘The News’ that the IMF’s rejection has effectively stalled the planned investments, leaving top officials—including Federal Petroleum Minister Ali Parvaiz Malik—deeply frustrated. The minister immediately escalated the matter to the prime minister, urging urgent intervention.
“In the Finance Bill for FY26, the government financial managers as per their promises have not resolved the issue of sales tax exemption on POL products --- a measure introduced in the Finance Bill for FY25 that has made the upgrade projects extremely unviable,” he said.
The petroleum minister had earlier told ‘The News’ that since the IMF response had not been received on time, the government could not remove sales tax exemption in the budget for FY26. The sales tax exemption measure earlier imposed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in the Finance Bill for FY25 resulted in a loss of Rs34 billion to refineries and oil marketing companies in the outgoing fiscal.
Now the government functionaries have received the IMF response rejecting the government proposals.
The petroleum minister, according to the top official, seems determined to resolve the issue as the upgradation of the local refineries was a project of paramount importance. “Once these upgrade projects are completed, the consumers would use fuel as per the Euro V specifications which are environment friendly. The production of furnace oil will be at the lowest ebb after the upgradation and the whole crude oil would be converted into finished products at par with Euro-V specifications.”
When asked about the nature of the government proposals, that the IMF refused to accept, the official said one was seeking restoration of zero-rated status of POL products and the second was about imposition of a 10 percent sales tax to make upgrade projects viable. The IMF has disallowed the restoration of zero rate status. However, on the proposal of imposition of the 10 percent sales tax, the Fund argued that FBR functionaries didn’t have a capacity to judge if the imported plants or spare parts and machinery are new or old ones which will be part of the upgrade projects for imposition of the sales tax. So IMF has refused to accept both proposals, urging the government to come up with new proposals for upgrade projects.
The officials said that the IMF had agreed to impose the 10 percent sales tax on motor spirit and high speed diesel which would have impact of Rs25 per litre.
However, the official said that some of the refineries are in talks with lenders for investment in upgrade projects, but lenders were eyeing the budget for FY26 in which the government has failed to undo the sales tax exemption on POL products.
On May 20, 2025, the managing directors and CEOs of the country’s leading refineries in separate meetings with the petroleum and finance ministers stressed the solution of sales tax exemption imposed on POL products in the upcoming budget ensuring no change in tax policy for seven years so that refineries could initiate investment of $6 billion on their upgrade projects.

Maryam launches Pakistan’s first virtual centre for child safety,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320794-maryam-launches-pakistan-s-first-virtual-centre-for-child-safety,"LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz launched Pakistan’s first virtual centre for child safety.
Maryam Nawaz while chairing a meeting announced to establish Pakistan’s first Virtual Centre for Child Safety with regard to forced child labour under the auspices of Punjab Safe Cities Authority.
A team of professional experts in the Virtual Centre for Child Safety is tasked to carry out search operation for the missing persons, getting in touch with heirs and verifying their credentials.
The Virtual Centre for Child Safety has proved to be an effective in bringing back home not only missing children but also frail elderly people. In case of disappearance of a child or an elderly person of loved ones, there is an easy-to-use contact system at Virtual Centre for Child Safety. It is possible to contact the Virtual Centre for Child Safety immediately by calling the emergency helpline 15 and pressing the button number 3.
Citizens across Punjab can contact the Virtual Centre for Child Safety through the Safety App. For the first time, a special helpline 0309-0000015 has also been activated for missing children and citizens of other provinces as well. There is also a facility to report missing children by making a call, sending WhatsApp message or text message on a special helpline.
More than 59,635 people have contacted the Virtual Safety Centre to complain about missing persons. 53,542 cases of missing persons have been successfully resolved through Punjab’s first Virtual Centre for Child Safety. More than 26,000 people have reached their homes after going missing on account  of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’ innovative initiative to establish Virtual Center for Child Safety.
The chief minister highlighted “Children are my red line, I can understand the profound grief of parents in case of their disappearance. Whether children belong to Punjab or any other province, they are all dear to us.” She maintained, “In case of disappearance, we are determined to fulfill our responsibility of bringing every child home safe and sound. Every citizen of the country can benefit from Pakistan’s first Virtual Centre for Child Safety.”
She outlined, “Punjab’s first Virtual Center for Child Safety is a successful initiative of promoting humanitarianism, national solidarity, digital technology and good governance. We are ready to utilise all available state resources for the safe return of missing children.”
Maryam Nawaz said that Punjab has become the first province to implement child protection policy for the safe future of children. She highlighted, “Punjab is ensuring the protection of children’s rights by establishing the first Virtual Child Safety Station.”
The chief minister in her message on the World Day Against Child Labour said, “Child labour is absolutely intolerable, children are my red line. In today’s era, incidents of child labour are a colossal tragedy for humanity. Forced child labour is a moment of grave concern for the conscious citizens of the society.”
She highlighted, “Children should have pens, books and laptops in their hands instead of tools and bricks. Children who are forced to bear the burden of forced child labour at a tender age instead of holding a pen in their hands is a big question mark for every civilized society.”
She outlined, “If the childhood of an innocent child is not protected, the society will be deprived of useful citizens in times to come. I deem child labour not just a problem as it will put at stake bright future of our coming generations. Effective steps are being taken to eliminate child labour.”
She emphasised, “The Punjab government is taking effective measures against child labour, children are being freed from forced labour and are driven towards attaining education. We want such a Punjab where every child is not forced to do child labour and by getting education and knowledge, the bright future of the nation will be guaranteed.”

Salaries of govt officials: how Pakistan and India stack up,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320795-salaries-of-govt-officials-how-pakistan-and-india-stack-up,"KARACHI: The recent revision in the salaries of Pakistan’s top parliamentary leaders, including the speaker of the National Assembly and the chairperson of the Senate, has sparked debate in political and public circles.
While some critics, including incumbent defence minister and PML-N leader Khawaja Asif, have voiced concern over the scale of the increases, a comparative look at similar office holders in neighbouring India offers a broader regional perspective.
According to official figures, the monthly salary of the speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan now stands at Rs1.3 million, while the chairperson of the Senate receives the same amount. In India, their counterparts -- the Lok Sabha speaker and Rajya Sabha chairperson -- earn slightly higher, with monthly salaries of approximately Rs1.48 million and Rs1.32 million, respectively, when converted from Indian rupees (INR450,000 and INR400,000 respectively). One INR is equivalent to Rs3.3.
Other top constitutional office holders show varying trends. According to data available on the official website of the Cabinet Division, the president of Pakistan earns Rs846,550 per month, significantly lower than the president of India, who receives about Rs1.65 million (INR500,000), per the data shared by Indian media outlet ‘News18’. Similarly, India’s prime minister earns a basic salary of Rs165,068 (INR50,000) compared to Rs107,280 in Pakistan, according to several reports.
For members of parliament, however, the reverse is observed. Pakistani MPs receive Rs519,000 per month, which is higher than the Indian MPs’ pay of approximately Rs409,368 (INR124,000).
The government has not yet issued an official statement in response to the outrage, however a day after the federal budget was unveiled, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb defended the proposed salary increases.
“Consider when the salaries of ministers, ministers of state and parliamentarians were last revised. The last increase for cabinet ministers was in 2016,” Aurangzeb said during a press conference on Wednesday.
Similarly, back in March, when the Indian government okayed an increase in the salaries of MPs, the government defended its decision by saying that the salary revision “was based on a mechanism introduced in 2018 that linked MPs’ salaries to inflation with the aim of preventing arbitrary increases”.

Air India crash makes 2025 deadliest for air travel in years: report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320796-air-india-crash-makes-2025-deadliest-for-air-travel-in-years-report,"The crash of Air India Flight 171 has turned 2025 into one of the deadliest years in the past decade for civil aviation, according to Bloomberg.
There were over 240 people aboard the Boeing Co. 787 jetliner, according to the airline, when the plane went down in a fireball Thursday shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad, India.
The accident is likely to produce more fatalities given it crashed into a residential area.
Globally, the number of civil aviation fatalities has reached more than 460 in 2025, according to Jan-Arwed Richter, founder of Jacdec, a German consulting firm that tracks aviation safety. The average over the past decade is 284 based on the firm’s methodology.
“This year still has more than six months to go, so this could be concerning if this rate of fatal accidents would go on,” Richter said.
Commercial-aviation safety reached a high-water mark in 2023, when industry groups said there were no fatal crashes. Since then, a number of high-profile incidents have grabbed headlines.

Ex-CIA analyst Asif Rahman jailed for 37 months for leaking Iran attack plans,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320797-ex-cia-analyst-asif-rahman-jailed-for-37-months-for-leaking-iran-attack-plans,"WASHINGTON: Former CIA analyst Asif William Rahman has been sentenced to 37 months in prison for unlawfully retaining and transmitting Top Secret National Defence Information to people who were not entitled to receive it, information which was publicly posted on social media platforms in October 2024.
According to court documents, Rahman, 34, of Vienna, Virginia, was an employee of the CIA since 2016 and had a Top Secret security clearance with access to Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) until his employment was terminated after his arrest.
Some media reports have claimed that Rahman was born in California, and grew up in Ohio. He allegedly leaked secret information about Israeli plans to attack Iran after Tehran had launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1.
“For months, this defendant betrayed the American people and the oaths he took upon entering his office by leaking some of our Nation’s most closely held secrets,” said John Eisenberg, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.
“As this case demonstrates, the Department of Justice will continue to protect our nation by vigorously investigating and prosecuting leakers who compromise our nation’s security”, remarked John Eisenberg.
“[Asif] Rahman violated his position of trust by illegally accessing, removing, and transmitting Top Secret documents vital to the national security of the United States and its allies,” said Erik S Siebert, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia.
“The urgency with which Rahman was identified, arrested, charged, and prosecuted is a testament to the commitment and professionalism of the investigators and prosecutors who brought him to justice. This case should serve as a stern warning to those who choose to place their own goals over their allegiance to our nation”, maintained Siebert.
“By stealing and divulging classified information and then attempting to conceal his crimes, Rahman not only violated the law; he also betrayed his oath as a government employee and his responsibility to the American people,” said Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division.
“Now he will pay the price for putting American lives and US national security at risk. Let this be a warning to all clearance holders: The FBI will exhaust all avenues to find and bring to justice anyone — no matter who they are — who endangers our nation by disclosing sensitive information without authorization,” remarked Rozhavsky.
According to the Department of Justice (DoJ): “On October 17, 2024, Rahman accessed and printed two Top Secret documents containing National Defence Information regarding a US foreign ally and its planned actions against a foreign adversary. Rahman removed the documents, photographed them, and transmitted them to individuals he knew were not entitled to receive them”.
However, those who received the documents were not named.
By October 18, 2024, the documents appeared publicly on social media platforms, complete with the classification markings. The DoJ says that after October 17, 2024, Rahman engaged in a deletion campaign of work products on his Top Secret workstation.
In 2024, continuing through November, Rahman repeatedly accessed and printed classified National Defence Information, including documents classified up to the Top Secret and further compartmented levels, that he learned in the course of his employment and transmitted to multiple individuals he knew were not entitled to receive it.
Rahman was indicted by a grand jury on November 7, 2024. Earlier, he was arrested in Cambodia where he worked at the US Embassy in Phnom Penh On January 17, 2025, Rahman pleaded guilty to two counts of willful retention and transmission of classified information related to the national defence.
He has remained in custody since his arrest.
Rahman’s sentencing coincides with the Iranian intelligence minister’s claim that his country has a treasure trove of secret information related to Israeli nuclear facilities and its relationship with the West. Esmail Khatib has vowed to make them public soon.

Sindh PAC holds 97 sittings in 10 months; recovers Rs16bn,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320759-sindh-pac-holds-97-sittings-in-10-months-recovers-rs16bn,"KARACHI: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Sindh has made significant strides in ensuring financial accountability, holding a total of 97 sittings over a span of 10 months to examine audit paras concerning 36 provincial administrative departments, five autonomous authorities, and 30 councils.
As per the official record Rs16 billion has been recovered due to the efforts of the PAC, i.e. Rs3.4 billion were deposited into the government treasury  by the different government departments; and Rs. 12.59 billion recovered by the Water and Sewerage Corporation in the head of water charges, between July 2024 and April 2025.
Official correspondence stated that the PAC also took up the issue of non-realisation of Electricity Duty valued at Rs3.28 billion, including Rs29 billion in outstanding dues from K-Electric. The committee has initiated proceedings for recovery, which remain in progress.
According to official data, the PAC reviewed 1,383 audit paras during this period, of which 325 were settled -- amounting to 23.5 per cent of the total. The remaining 1,058 paras (76.5 per cent) were deferred for further scrutiny, pending departmental responses or compliance measures.
The committee, in its push for transparency, issued 63 directives to various departments and Drawing and Disbursing Officers (DDOs) for the recovery of outstanding government dues and taxes flagged in audit reports.
Additionally, 17 directives were issued to departmental secretaries, instructing them to initiate enquiries and disciplinary proceedings against officials allegedly involved in financial irregularities.
In a further step towards accountability, three enquiries were referred to the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team (CMIT), while two cases were handed over to the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) for investigation.
The PAC’s efforts have borne tangible results. The Director General Audit reported that recoveries worth Rs3.4 billion were deposited into the government treasury between July 2024 and April 2025.
Besides, in a major development, the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KW&SC) confirmed that, following PAC’s intervention regarding ‘non-recovery of water charges’, various departments cleared their outstanding liabilities amounting to Rs. 12.59 billion.
PAC Sindh Chairman Nisar Khuhro lauded the PAC’s robust oversight and enforcement, noting that sustained efforts of PAC team in audit compliance and departmental accountability are key to financial discipline in the public sector.
Khuhro said that he and his team would continue this work for transparency and smooth working in government departments.
Khuhro said he has recommended four increments for the staff of the Public Accounts Committee for their remarkable work and dedication.

"Chewing tobacco, tea consumption linked to Pakistan’s oral cancer surge",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320760-chewing-tobacco-tea-consumption-linked-to-pakistan-s-oral-cancer-surge,"ISLAMABAD: Chewing tobacco products such as Niswar, Areca Nut, And Paan/Gutka are driving Pakistan’s growing oral cancer crisis, a landmark study has revealed.
The research also found a strong association between tea consumption and oral cancer, urging urgent, locally tailored interventions to address the escalating disease burden. Experts believe oral cancer has reached crisis levels in Pakistan, where it is now the second most commonly diagnosed cancer overall—and the most common among men.
Conducted across all provinces, the study highlights that most oral cancer patients in Pakistan are poor, uneducated men in their 50s and 60s, with diagnoses often made at advanced stages—placing immense pressure on the country’s already stretched healthcare system. The hospital-based case–control study, jointly carried out by researchers from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCH&RC) and Government College (GC) University Lahore, is the largest of its kind in the country. It underscores how cultural practices and socioeconomic conditions are fuelling a preventable cancer epidemic and calls for Pakistan-specific public health measures.
Published in the international peer-reviewed journal Global Health, Epidemiology and Genomics (Cambridge University Press), the study investigated 688 participants—277 histopathologically confirmed oral cancer patients and 411 healthy controls. It examined a wide range of factors, including demographics, lifestyle, environmental exposures, and familial traits, to identify key risk determinants associated with oral cancer in Pakistan. The findings revealed that men are significantly more likely to develop oral cancer, accounting for over 71 percent of the cases.
Most cases were presented at late stages, significantly reducing survival chances and adding to the healthcare burden. Unlike in many Western countries, where cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are among the leading risk factors for oral cancer, the Pakistani study found chewing substances like Niswar, Areca Nut, and Paan/Gutka as the major contributors to cancer risk. Tea (chai) consumption also showed a strong link to cancer development, while coffee had a potentially protective effect. The tongue was identified as the most commonly affected site, followed by the buccal mucosa (cheek), mandible (jawbone), and lips.
Notably, patients with a family history of cancer and those born to parents from the same clan or close relatives (consanguineous unions) were also more likely to develop the disease. The study establilshed lack of physical activity appeared to increase the risk.
Dr M Usman Rashid, senior research scientist at SKMCH&RC and the principal investigator of the study, said the findings challenge conventional assumptions about oral cancer and underscore the need for culturally contextualized prevention strategies. “This study reveals that our biggest threats are not necessarily the global risk factors, but our own deeply rooted habits and practices,” he said. “We must craft public health campaigns that speak directly to our people’s realities.”
It provides an evidence-based foundation for developing oral cancer control policies, including targeted awareness campaigns, early screening programmes, and stronger regulation of Gutka, Paan Masala, and Niswar.
The researchers emphasize that unless local authorities act swiftly to incorporate these findings into national cancer control plans, the disease burden will continue to grow unchecked. “Our results offer a roadmap,” said Dr. Rashid. “It’s now up to policymakers and public health institutions to translate this data into action that can save lives.”

Tribal dispute claims four lives,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320761-tribal-dispute-claims-four-lives,"SUKKUR: Four people were killed when their car was attacked by suspected motorcyclists near the Shikarpur-Larkana, Indus Highway Toll Plaza, here on Thursday.
The three men along with the taxi driver were returning to their village from a hearing in Shikarpur Sessions Court when the incident occurred. The deceased were identified as two brothers: Noor Mohammad, Niazmuddin and their newphew Adam along with the taxi driver Rasool Bux Marfani. A heavy police force reached the site of the incident and intitiated investigations.  The mother of the victims Mst Habiban Sundrani accused Wahid Bakhsh, Nadir, Bhoro and some other people of the Brohi community for the murders.
The Brohi-Sundaran dispute was apparently settled through a jirga a few months ago. SSP Shikarpur Shahzeb Chachar while ordering the arrests has sought a detailed investigation report from DSP City and DSP Gharhi Yasin. Special teams have been formed to arrest the accused, while blockades, search operations and raids are ongoing to arrest them.

Rabbani slams finance minister for ‘threatening’ parliament,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320763-rabbani-slams-finance-minister-for-threatening-parliament,"ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani on Thursday took a strong exception to the remarks of Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb for imposing additional taxes of Rs400-500 billion if Parliament did not approve the proposed legislation regarding taxes and said that Parliament cannot be dictated and be held hostage because the legislation has been approved by the IMF.
“The remarks of the finance minister amount to contempt of Parliament. The Senate chairman should take note of it,” he said in a statement while condemning the threat given to Parliament by the finance minister to pass the legislation or face new taxes.
Rabbani also took an exception to the remarks of the finance minister about non-fixation of minimum wage. “If non-payment by the capitalist class of the minimum wage is the excuse of not fixing it, then on the same logic a number of taxes should not be levied because a number of people don’t pay these,” he said.
He said this government is hostage and has bartered the country’s economic sovereignty at the hands of the IMF. “It is also protecting the interests of the comprador capitalists,” he said.

"PTI slams govt for derailing economy, accuses it of data manipulation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320764-pti-slams-govt-for-derailing-economy-accuses-it-of-data-manipulation,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram Thursday lambasted the government for allegedly derailing once a rapidly growing economy through its short-sighted, self-serving, and fundamentally flawed approach to governance.
He strongly criticised the finance minister, dismissing him as an imported figure with no real stake in Pakistan’s future. He claimed that the minister lacked both empathy and vision to address the country’s struggling economy.
Speaking to a news conference alongside with PTI Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) here, he said that while the so-called Form-47 government speaks of an economic turnaround, the grim reality tells a different story.
“Families are being forced to sell their land and ancestral jewellery just to afford migration — a heart-breaking reflection of how deeply the public has lost faith in the country’s current direction,” he maintained.
He stated that large-scale industries have been in decline for three consecutive years, with skilled labour continuing to flee the country due to a hostile and unsupportive business environment.
Waqas rejected the projected growth figures for large-scale manufacturing in the upcoming fiscal year, calling them nothing more than fabricated data and wishful propaganda.
The exodus of talent was not just a statistic, he emphasised and noted that it is a national tragedy. “Our brightest minds were giving up on their homeland because the government has failed to provide them with a future here,” he added.
He also strongly criticised the ‘imposed’ government for presenting fabricated and misleading data in the Economic Survey, dismissing it as nothing more than a smokescreen designed to conceal its glaring economic failures.
The reality on the ground paints a much bleaker picture, he contended and explained that over 3 million educated and skilled young Pakistanis have been forced to leave the country in search of better opportunities abroad. “This alarming brain drain, he emphasised, is a direct result of the growing hopelessness, economic mismanagement, and lack of prospects under the current regime,” PTI spokesman said.
He revealed a troubling statistic, as the number of tractors sold — an essential indicator of agricultural health — has plummeted from 38,000 to just 24,000. He insisted that this sharp decline is a clear sign of the agricultural sector’s collapse.
Waqas stressed that while nearly 70pc of Pakistan’s population relies on agriculture for their livelihood, the regime has failed to release any credible unemployment data, further exposing its disconnect from the harsh realities faced by ordinary citizens.
“These oppressive individuals have pushed the country to the brink of economic collapse. The people of Pakistan are losing hope. This regime is not just incompetent — it is utterly callous and disconnected from the suffering of the masses,” he said.
Waqas claimed that this government has lost all credibility and added even segments of the media that once supported them are now turning away. “They have no place left to hide after wrecking a country that was once on the path to progress,” he said.
PTI MNA Rana Atif strongly condemned the government’s economic ‘mismanagement, manipulation of official data, and betrayal of public trust’, challenging the authenticity of the figures presented in the federal budget and economic survey.
On the occasion, MNA Usama Ahmed Mela noted that even countries like Bangladesh, despite enduring a bloody revolution, managed to achieve 4pc economic growth. “Several African nations are also registering higher growth rates than Pakistan,” he said, underscoring the gravity of the situation.
Referring to official data, the PTI MNA pointed out that the State Bank’s own website lists the inflation rate at 10.5pc, contradicting the government’s misleading claim of 4pc. He added that Pakistan has now suffered three consecutive years of negative growth, a sign of sustained economic decline.
“What Ishaq Dar did through figure-fudging is now being repeated by Aurangzeb,” he alleged.
MNA Chaudhary Mubeen Arif Jutt, another party lawmaker, questioned how the large-scale manufacturing sector is expected to grow when the government has failed to provide any electricity subsidy in the federal budget.

Talent knows no geography: CSA expands CSS training to Balochistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320771-talent-knows-no-geography-csa-expands-css-training-to-balochistan,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Civil Services Academy (CSA) has unveiled an ambitious CSS Outreach and Preparatory Programme for graduates of Balochistan. The flagship initiative seeks to bridge long-standing disparities in access to quality mentorship and academic resources, empowering talented youth from the province to compete effectively in Pakistan’s Central Superior Services (CSS) examinations. The move also aimed at promoting inclusivity and fostering national integration.
The programme, meticulously designed by CSA’s Capacity Building Wing and supervised by Director General Farhan Aziz Khawaja, envisions a structured, fully residential preparatory course to enhance regional representation within the country’s bureaucracy. With core consultation from selected probationary officers of the 51st and 52nd Common Training Programmes, the initiative exemplifies CSA’s commitment to equity and excellence.
Scheduled to run through three dedicated batches between October 2025 and January 2026, the programme will host 150 participants (male and female) at the CSA’s Walton Campus in Lahore. Each one-month batch will provide intensive academic and skill-based training, targeting fresh graduates from different Universities of Balochistan with a preference for those enrolled in leading universities such as Quaid-e-Azam University, Punjab University, and other HEC-recognised institutions within the province.
Prospective candidates will undergo a rigorous selection process involving an aptitude test conducted by a national testing service, under the auspices of Balochistan’s Higher Education Department. To ensure a long-term commitment to public service, selected candidates must pledge to attempt the CSS examination at least three times.
The curriculum has been crafted to address both core academic needs and essential skill development. Participants will receive comprehensive instruction in subjects such as English Essay Writing, Pakistan Affairs, Current Affairs, and Comparative Religion, complemented by targeted modules in time management, analytical thinking, communication skills, and structured writing. The daily schedule will include expert lectures, peer mentorship, group assignments, mock exams, and exposure visits, creating a dynamic learning environment.
A hallmark of the programme is its mentorship component, which will pair each participant with a current CSA probationer and an alumnus of the Academy. This personalized support system aims to provide practical guidance, motivation, and strategy-sharing based on real-life experiences. Beyond academics, participants will benefit from CSA’s extensive on-campus facilities, including hostel accommodation, modern library resources, high-speed internet, sports facilities, and balanced meal services.
In line with its mission of inclusivity, the programme has been designed to be financially accessible. The Government of Balochistan is expected to underwrite the cost through scholarships or direct funding, ensuring that no deserving candidate is excluded on financial grounds.
The anticipated impact of the initiative is far-reaching. By enhancing academic readiness and reducing exam-related anxiety, the programme will not only boost socio-economic mobility among marginalized communities but also contribute to a more representative and diverse civil service. The effort aligns with broader federal goals of strengthening centre-province integration and fostering public trust in state institutions.
For the participants, the experience promises to be transformational. Exposure to national institutions, interaction with senior civil servants, and participation in civic dialogues will cultivate a deep sense of civic responsibility and national belonging. Ultimately, these graduates are envisioned as future role models and change agents within their communities.
The CSS Outreach and Preparatory Programme reflects CSA’s enduring belief that “talent knows no geography.” By opening new pathways to public service for Balochistan’s youth, the Academy is not merely preparing candidates for an exam but investing in a more inclusive and equitable future for Pakistan.

"Irfan Siddiqui, Ambassador Neziroglu discuss inter-parliamentary cooperation",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320772-irfan-siddiqui-ambassador-neziroglu-discuss-inter-parliamentary-cooperation,"ISLAMABAD: Chairman Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Irfanul Haque Siddiqui and Turkish Ambassador to Pakistan Dr Irfan Neziroglu held a comprehensive meeting on Thursday, focusing on strengthening bilateral relations between Pakistan and Turkiye.
Key areas of discussion included inter-parliamentary cooperation, diplomatic engagement, and evolving regional and global dynamics.
During the meeting, held as part of a courtesy call by Ambassador Neziroglu, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to expanding collaboration across various sectors of mutual interest. They emphasised the need to further build on the historic and cordial ties between the two brotherly nations.
Senator Siddiqui underscored Pakistan’s deep appreciation for its longstanding relationship with Turkiye, rooted in shared history, cultural ties, and mutual trust. He noted the enduring bond between the leadership and peoples of both countries.
Ambassador Neziroglu reciprocated the sentiments, expressing gratitude for Pakistan’s warm hospitality and highlighting the century-long depth of the Pakistan-Turkiye relationship. He stressed the importance of elevating bilateral cooperation to unprecedented levels in the coming years.
Senator Siddiqui voiced concern over reports of Indian authorities targeting Turkish companies and attempting to obstruct their operations, calling it a regrettable move aimed at politicising trade.
The two dignitaries also expressed grave concern over the ongoing genocide committed by Israeli forces against the people of Gaza. They condemned the killing of thousands of civilians, including women and children, and urged the international community, especially the United Nations, to take immediate, concrete steps to halt the bloodshed. Both sides reiterated their shared resolve to advocate for peace, justice, and human rights on all international platforms.
Senator Siddiqui stated that the shared religious, cultural, and moral values between Pakistan and Turkiye provide a strong foundation for enhanced cooperation in areas such as defence, security, education, trade, cultural exchange, and the promotion of traditional arts, including Islamic calligraphy.
The meeting also touched on recent regional developments, particularly the escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India. Senator Siddiqui thanked the Turkish government for its steadfast support during times of adversity and reaffirmed Pakistan’s position that sustainable peace in South Asia is unattainable without resolving the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
Ambassador Neziroglu assured that Turkiye would continue to support Pakistan’s principled and just stance on the Kashmir issue.

IHC restrains FIA from action against Farhatullah Babar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320774-ihc-restrains-fia-from-action-against-farhatullah-babar,"ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday restrained the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) from action against former senator Farhatullah Babar in a petition filed by him.

During the hearing, the lawyer said that the petitioner is being repeatedly issued vague and illegal notices and summons.

Police firing kills woman at Gilgit hospital,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320775-police-firing-kills-woman-at-gilgit-hospital,"GILGIT: A woman was shot dead late Wednesday night inside City Hospital Gilgit after police opened fire while chasing a suspect involved in a narcotics case.
The fatal shooting triggered widespread outrage prompting Chief Minister Gilgit-Baltistan on Thursday to suspend senior police officers and order the arrest of the suspects.
According to eyewitnesses the police pursuing a suspect wanted in a narcotics case, entered the City Hospital and fired multiple rounds in the presence of patients and medical staff. A CCTV footage of the incident shows police firing near the emergency ward, where a woman holding her newborn baby was shot. The incident that went viral on the social media, was widely condemned as a serious breach of hospital and police conduct.
Reacting to the public backlash, Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan suspended the SSP Gilgit and the local SHO. He termed the police action as “highly unprofessional and unacceptable.” The CM also announced setting up a Joint Investigation Team. A case under the Anti-Terrorism Act was also registered, and the suspected police officials  were taken into custody.
The hospital administration also filed an official complaint and demanded the dismissal of the police officials. The medical staff have also warned of protests if decisive action is not taken.

KP police warehouses: SC seeks complete report on all case-property vehicles,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320777-kp-police-warehouses-sc-seeks-complete-report-on-all-case-property-vehicles,"PESHAWAR: A three-member bench of the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday asked the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa advocate general to submit a detailed report on the vehicles held as case property in all police stations of the province and their current status.
The SC bench comprising Justice Musarrat Hilali, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Shakil Ahmad was hearing an appeal filed by Muhammad Imran and others at the Peshawar Registry.
KP Advocate General (AG) Shah Faisal Utmankhel and police officers appeared in the court.
During the hearing, Justice Musarrat Hilali asked the AG to inform the court about the report submitted and the number of vehicles currently parked in police warehouses.
The AG informed the court that 1,119 vehicles were parked at the Daudzai Police Station warehouse, while 36 vehicles were temporarily parked at the warehouse of Mathra Police Station.
Justice Musarrat Hilali remarked that the vehicle summoned the previous day had been in use by a retired police officer for the past five years, was in working condition, and had no entry in the official record. She questioned why it had not been kept in the warehouse.
Justice Shakil Ahmad said that if this was the situation, the court would issue a contempt notice to the relevant police officer and pass an order to ensure that no case property vehicle was used in the future.
Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim remarked that the police appeared to be running a personal kingdom where they used to give vehicles to whoever they wished. He emphasized that this was not above the law and would not be tolerated under any circumstances.
The AG said that due to limited time, he did not have the complete status of each vehicle. However, overall, these vehicles were currently parked in police warehouses. Justice Musarrat Hilali then asked whether this was documented and if the vehicles were indeed still parked there.
The AG affirmed that they were, but added that it would take more time to determine which vehicles belonged to which police stations and to which cases they were related.
Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim inquired whether the provincial government had established any rules under the new narcotics law to auction these vehicles and deposit the proceeds in the government treasury, with compensation to be paid to the accused if a verdict was given in their favour.
The AG responded that no such law or rules had been formulated yet. To this, Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim questioned why this matter hadn’t been considered.
The AG informed the court that a comprehensive report covering all police stations would soon be submitted. In response, the court directed him to present the report in a way that identifies which vehicle belonged to which police station and its current status, as thousands of vehicles were rusting into scrap and now resemble junkyards.
It was noted that some vehicles had even been stacked on top of each other, destroying their market value. The AG assured the court that every effort was being made to provide all the necessary information as requested.
Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim remarked that the Inspector General of Police (IGP) was considered the station house officer for the entire province, both in practice and under the law. “If the situation is not rectified, the court would issue a notice to the IGP,” he added.
Justice Shakil Ahmad observed that the court was not aware of who was using which vehicle, but warned that if such issues arise again, the concerned District Police Officers, Deputy Inspectors General and SHOs would be held accountable.
The AG said that meetings had been held with all relevant officials, making it clear that the SC’s orders must be followed precisely. He emphasized that the unauthorized use of case property vehicles would not be tolerated and that, according to the law, these vehicles must be parked in official warehouses.
Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim suggested that such vehicles be submitted to the Excise Department’s warehouse, as the court had personally inspected one of the vehicles and found it to be in working condition. He warned that if things continued as they were, all vehicles would end up being found operational and misused. He also noted that valuable parts were being removed from the vehicles.
The court asked the AG to submit a detailed report on all case property vehicles in the province’s police stations and warned that any errors in the report could result in action against the responsible officials.
The judges admonished the AG, saying, “All of this is happening right under your nose, and you claim to be unaware? Open your eyes and activate your officers. This is not your responsibility alone; it’s the entire Advocate General’s Office’s duty to monitor such matters. You are the Principal Law Officer of this province.” The court then adjourned the hearing until July.

Finishing Polyclinic expansion early to ease hospitals’ load in capital: minister,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320778-finishing-polyclinic-expansion-early-to-ease-hospitals-load-in-capital-minister,"ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Health Mustafa Kamal has directed the authorities concerned to expedite the under-construction Polyclinic Hospital expansion in G-11/3 Islamabad, emphasising that the Rs16 billion public health facility must be completed ahead of schedule to address the worsening burden on the capital’s overstretched hospitals.
“This is a critical public health initiative. We cannot afford delays,” Minister Kamal asserted during a site visit on Wednesday. “Double the workforce, work day and night, and complete this hospital before the deadline,” he instructed officials and contractors on-site.
Accompanied by Federal Secretary for Health Syed Waqarul Hassan, Director General Health, Executive Director Polyclinic Hospital, and the Joint Secretary Health, the minister received a detailed briefing from the Project Director of the Punjab Infrastructure Development Authority (PIDA), which is overseeing the development.
The Polyclinic expansion—expected to add 400 beds to the existing facility—is being constructed at a cost of approximately Rs16 billion. Once completed, it will play a pivotal role in relieving patient load from Islamabad’s limited and increasingly overwhelmed public hospitals.
“Islamabad is a growing metropolitan city where the population is expanding rapidly,” said Kamal. “Healthcare facilities are under immense pressure, and the construction of this hospital will bring much-needed relief not only to residents of Islamabad but also to people from nearby regions.”
Minister Kamal announced that he would personally visit the site again next week to monitor progress. “This is not just a construction project—it is a lifeline for thousands. Its timely delivery is non-negotiable,” he said.
Officials were also instructed to proactively resolve any bottlenecks or challenges the project may face and to maintain the momentum of work. Kamal warned that since this is a public health project, any form of delay would directly affect citizens’ access to vital medical services.
Calling it a top health priority for the federal government, the minister reiterated that completing the Polyclinic expansion ahead of schedule is essential to strengthening Islamabad’s healthcare infrastructure and meeting future demand.

"Sindh govt determined to eradicate child labour, says CM",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320637-sindh-govt-determined-to-eradicate-child-labour-says-cm,"Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said on Thursday his provincial government is determined to eradicate child labour.
In his message on the occasion of International Day Against Child Labor, he said the Sindh government's determination to end child labour has become firmer. Shah said the campaign to end child labour has been made more effective so that every child can get education. Strict implementation of the laws against child labour is being ensured and action is being taken against the violators of the law, he added.
The chief minister further said that taking children as forced labour is a serious crime, for the prevention of which the government has adopted a coordinated strategy. He noted that the government has allocated a special budget for the protection, education and welfare of children.
He stressed that full implementation of International Labor Organisation (ILO) convention is the first priority of his government. Partnership with social organisations and Unicef is being increased for the elimination of child labour. Moreover, during the year 2025, there has been a significant reduction in child labour in Sindh, but the struggle will continue until its complete elimination, he added. Through the school return campaign, thousands of children have been brought out of labour and into education.
The chief minister stressed that awareness campaigns should be continued so that parents and society are informed about the rights of children. More steps are being taken for the health, education, safety and welfare of children, he said.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took strong notice of the Shikarpur incident, strongly condemned the killing of four people and sought an immediate report from Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon.
There will be no compromise on law and order, he said and added that the accused involved in the Shikarpur incident should be arrested immediately. He directed strict action against elements hostile to peace.
The firing incident took place near Garhi Yasin Toll Plaza in the Shikarpur area, the IGP informed the CM. Armed suspects opened fire on a car, resulting in the death of four people. The CM expressed heartfelt sympathies for the families of those killed in the Shikarpur incident.

Bail plea of five men held for ‘cutting mangroves’ dismissed,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320638-bail-plea-of-five-men-held-for-cutting-mangroves-dismissed,"A judicial magistrate has dismissed the bail application of five men in a case pertaining to cutting mangroves.  Ismail, Qadir, Ali, Abdul Ghafoor, and Asif were arrested and booked by Maripur police on the complaint of a forest range officer for their alleged involvement in the illegal activity of cutting mangrove trees near Mazar Shidi Baba on Manora Road at Sandspit beach on June 4.
The suspects through their lawyer Sardar Javed moved the bail application before Judicial Magistrate (West) Inaamullah Phulpoto. After hearing both sides, the magistrate dismissed the bail plea.
""In view of the seriousness of the offence, the environmental harm caused, the recovery of stolen property, and the potential for the accused to abscond or tamper with evidence, I am of the considered view that the applicants have not made out a case for the grant of bail at this stage,"" he ruled.
The magistrate observed that the allegations against the applicants were serious in nature, adding that the FIR, though not assigning specific roles, clearly stated that they were apprehended at the scene with stolen mangrove wood and an electric saw.
He noted that the recovery of 1,790 kilograms of wood, while substantial, was not implausible given the presence of multiple accused and the use of mechanical tools. ""The environmental implications of the offence cannot be ignored. Mangroves are a national asset, and their destruction has long-term consequences for coastal resilience, marine life, and climate regulation,"" he maintained.
""The argument that the offence does not fall within the prohibitory clause is not sufficient in itself to grant bail. The Honourable High Court of Sindh in Muhammad Aslam vs. The State clarified that the nature of the offense, its impact on society, and the strength of the evidence must all be considered.""
Furthermore, the court observed, the possibility of the suspects absconding or influencing the investigation cannot be ruled out. The escape of several accomplices from the scene raised concerns about the applicants’ potential to evade justice or coordinate with others to obstruct the investigation, it said.
The defence counsel contended that the applicants were innocent fishermen who were present at the location for rest and routine activities. He argued that the FIR was vague and did not assign any specific role to any of the suspects as none was alleged to have been in possession of any particular item of stolen property, nor was there any clear attribution of who used the electric saw or who cut the mangroves. An FIR was lodged under Sections 379 and 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 26 of the Forest Act.

SHC dismisses plea of contract employees seeking job regularisation,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320641-shc-dismisses-plea-of-contract-employees-seeking-job-regularisation,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has dismissed as not maintainable a petition of the provincial human rights department’s contract employees seeking regularisation of their employment.
The petitioners, Dohni Das and others, had filed a petition with the SHC seeking regularisation of their contract employment in the human rights department. Their counsel submitted that the human rights department had extended illegal, mala fide, highly discriminatory and unlawful treatment to the petitioners.
He submitted that the impugned order of their termination of contract was unlawful and discriminatory and other employees were regularised with their regularisation effective from the date of acquiring requisite qualifications rather than their initial appointment date.
He submitted that the petitioners, despite being similarly situated, were denied these benefits due to mala fide reasons. The counsel said the petitioners faced hostile discrimination and qualified the test of intelligible differentia, deserving similar treatment. He submitted that the impugned order violated the Articles 2, 4, 10, and 25 of the Constitution.
An assistant advocate general submitted that the petitioners were contractual employees hired for a specified period, and their contracts had expired. He submitted that the cases of petitioners for regularisation were not recommended at the time of appointment due to lack of qualification or unsatisfactory performance.
He further submitted that their cases were considered by the scrutiny committee but it rejected them for the same reasons. The SHC was told that the cases were considered with due diligence, and a detailed and speaking order was passed.
The law officer said that all the contractual employees were considered for regularization to avoid partial treatment and the committee decided not to recommend the petitioners due to multiple reasons, including qualification and performance.
A division bench of the high court headed by Justice Mohammad Karim Khan Agha observed in the judgment that regularisation of employment hinged on legal backing and without a specific law, policy or rules governing regularisation, and an individual could not simply petition the high court for such relief.
The high court observed that the petitioners were hired for temporary contract-based positions as explicitly stated in their employment contracts and these contracts also stipulated that they could not claim regularisation.
The SHC observed that the application of the law made by the respondents while scrutinising the cases of the petitioners was correct appreciation of the law supported by both regularisation policy and existing legal precedents, rendering the decision of the scrutiny committee valid and sustainable as the issue of qualification had been raised. The SHC observed that it could not change the disqualification into qualification.  The high court found the petition as meritless and dismissed it.

SHC seeks comments on bail petition of Salman Farooqi,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320642-shc-seeks-comments-on-bail-petition-of-salman-farooqi,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has issued notices to respondents on the bail plea of Salman Farooqi and Owais Hashmi who have been arrested in a case pertaining to threatening and beating up a youth.
A counsel for the petitioners, Naeem Qureshi, informed the high court that the man who was subjected to violence had forgiven the suspects and given a statement in this regard. However, the high court observed that bail could not be easily granted in the case because of particular sections included in it.
The SHC issued notices to respondents and directed the prosecutor general to submit a reply on the next hearing. In the FIR, an eyewitness stated that he was at Ittehad Commercial on May 31 when he witnessed a minor accident between a motorcycle and a Land Cruiser. Farooqi, reportedly the Land Cruiser’s owner, allegedly ordered his armed guard and driver to forcefully detain the motorcyclist inside his vehicle, where he was assaulted and abused.

Mayor lays foundation stone for Baldia Town sports complex,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320643-mayor-lays-foundation-stone-for-baldia-town-sports-complex,"Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Thursday laid the foundation stone for a state-of-the-art sports complex worth Rs1.4 billion in Baldia Town.
Terming the sports complex a gift to the people of District Keamari, he said it was a testament to the Pakistan Peoples Party’s commitment to public welfare. Speaking to media representatives at the ceremony, Wahab said federal institutions must play their part in resolving Karachi’s longstanding problems and lamented that the city had been ignored in the federal budget.
Addressing the prime minister directly, the mayor said, “We have submitted a request on the Governor of Sindh’s recommendation, please approve it and release Rs100 billion in development funds for Karachi.”
He called on federal ministers from Karachi, including Mustafa Kamal and Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, to convey this message to the prime minister, federal planning minister and finance minister, stressing that federal entities had a stake in the city and must contribute to its development.
Appealing for cross-party cooperation, Wahab invited members of the Jamaat-e-Islami and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to join hands for the betterment of the city. “Let us fight the case of this city together. We need to move beyond divisive politics for the greater good,” he said.
Highlighting the scope of the Baldia Town Sports Complex, Wahab said the project would include facilities for football, cricket, hockey, futsal, tennis and basketball, an indoor games block, racing tracks, gymnasium, walking area, family park, and children’s play area.
“This ground was in a dilapidated state. Today, we’re transforming it into a modern facility. The difference is not in the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) or the area, it’s in the leadership,” he remarked, referring to the role played by local MPA Liaquat Askani for actualising the project.
The mayor promised that the project would be completed and opened for the public within six months. “This is Bilawal Bhutto’s promise in action to devolve authority and spend resources on the people. We are delivering.”
On the issue of water scarcity in the locality, Wahab revealed that the government was bringing a new canal from the Hub Dam to address the area’s severe shortages. “I assured the party chairman this would be completed in a year,” he said, adding that the new canal’s inauguration was expected on August 14.
He also underscored the PPP’s governance approach, stating, “Power is a trust of the people and must be used for their benefit. Karachi is Pakistan’s economic and industrial engine. The federal government should support the KMC.”
Responding to a reporter's question, he clarified his recent remarks about Maryam Nawaz. “I haven’t criticised Maryam Nawaz. I only said I don’t have the resources to run ad campaigns. Please, don’t compare a mayor with a chief minister.”
He added that Azma Bukhari seemingly wanted tensions between the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz. “I have no issue with Punjab progressing, but the same courtesy should be extended to Sindh. Should I stay silent when my city is treated unfairly? I’m not part of MQM. I raise my voice for Karachi.”
Wahab reiterated his call for serious efforts to resolve the city’s challenges. “If the prime minister cannot allocate funds, at least grant the NOC so the bridge construction in Malir can proceed.”
He noted that the Sindh government would present its budget on Friday (today), followed by the KMC’s own budget. Compared to the past, he said, the KMC’s revenue had increased by a factor of three.
The mayor said he never promised to turn Karachi into Paris. “I’m only trying to restore the greatness this city once had. With support from the Sindh government, the Water Corporation is committed to augmenting the K-IV project. But if the federal government doesn’t even allocate 10 per cent of the cost, how can it be completed? Despite all odds, I will continue representing my city,” he said. Karachi Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad, MPA Liaquat Askani and other elected representatives attended the ceremony.

Strict orders issued to check misuse of powers at District East police stations,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320645-strict-orders-issued-to-check-misuse-of-powers-at-district-east-police-stations,"Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Farrukh Raza, police chief of District East, has expressed his concern over misuse of powers at police stations and ordered stopping the process of giving informal powers to duty clerks, saying that the station clerk (head moharrar) will be the only one responsible for assigning duties.
Talking to The News over the issue on Thursday, SSP Raza said he has identified an administrative lapse in police stations whereby, despite the presence of a regularly appointed head moharrar, informal powers of assigning duties have been given to the “duty munshi”, due to which ambiguity and irregularity have been created in the internal order of the police station.
He noted that according to the police rules, only the station clerk has the authority to distribute duties, monitor records and other administrative matters on the instructions of the SHO, and that there is no post like ‘duty munshi’ in the rules.
He has told all SHOs that the process of transferring powers informally should be stopped immediately, as this is an important step towards administrative transparency, professional discipline and improvement in the police stations.
Moreover, an order letter was also issued to all police stations, and DSP and SP offices by the District East SSP office. The order reads, “It has been observed with serious concern that in various police stations across District East, Karachi, Head Moharrars have delegated the duties of deployment clerks or ""Munshis"" to other police officials. This practice has led to confusion, disrupted workflow, and is in direct violation of Rule 22(3) and 22(4) of the Police Rules, 1934.
“In order to examine the legality of this practice, SP Gulshan Division, was assigned to go through the law, rules, regulations and furnish views. The following were his findings and comments; As per Police rules 1934, the Station Clerk (Head Moharrar) holds a central and accountable role within the police station.
“The Head Moharrar is solely responsible for the daily assignment of duties, under the instructions of the Officer In-Charge (SHO), and is entrusted with several critical responsibilities, including; maintaining all official records of the police station, including FIRs, daily diaries, case files, registers, and correspondence.”
The order further calls for ensuring accuracy, completeness, proper indexing of all records, safeguarding official documents and police station property entrusted to their care, distributing duties to police station staff, as directed by the SHO and according to established protocols, preparing reports, statements, and official documents as required by the SHO or senior officers, managing communication and proper documentation of all incoming and outgoing official correspondence.
“While Head Moharrars may be assisted by junior clerks or police personnel, this assistance does not reduce their core responsibilities. The Head Moharrar remains fully accountable for all official tasks and must ensure the role's integrity is upheld at all times.
“Therefore, in view of above all Station House Officers (SHOs) are ensure full compliance with Chapter 22, Rules 3 and 4 of the Police Rules, 1934. Formally appoint a Head Moharrar at each police station, ensuring the designated officer understands the scope of their duties and the accountability that comes with the role. Refrain from using informal titles or designations such as ""Duty Munshi.""
The order calls for conducting regular inspections to verify that official records are maintained properly and duty assignments are carried out in line with established procedures and the SHO's directions.
“Recommend prompt disciplinary action, under the Sindh Police (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules, against any officer found to be violating these orders or engaging in practices that undermine the formal administrative structure. These directives are effective immediately. All officers are instructed to ensure the order is widely communicated and strictly followed at every level within District East, Karachi.”

Japanese CG highlights importance of human capital in national development,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320647-japanese-cg-highlights-importance-of-human-capital-in-national-development,"Masaru Hattori, the consul general of Japan in Karachi, addressed the participants of the 43rd Mid-Career Management Course at the National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA).
Officials said the session took place at the NIPA Auditorium and was attended by officers from various autonomous bodies and public sector organisations. Speaking to the participants, Consul General Masaru Hattori emphasized the critical role of discipline, innovation, and strategic policymaking in Japan’s post-war transformation.
He stated, “Japan improved international competitiveness by adapting, internalizing, and enhancing innovative technologies. As business globalized, appropriate policies for foreign capital introduction became necessary.”
He elaborated on the importance of human capital in national development, remarking, “Lifetime employment and seniority-based promotion increased worker loyalty and fostered a culture of diligence. Companies conducted in-house training and OJT (On-the-Job Training) to foster long-term development.”
Referring to Japan’s post-WWII revival, he highlighted how discipline, rooted in Japanese culture and religious values, laid the foundation for rebuilding the nation. “It was this culture of discipline and technological advancement that helped rebuild Japan’s economy after World War II,” he said.
During the Q&A session, when asked about Japan’s aging population and low birth rate, he acknowledged, “This is a serious concern. The average age in Japan is now 50, and the government is designing forward-looking policies to address this demographic challenge.”
Responding to a question on China’s dominance in the Electric Vehicle (EV) market, Hattori said, “Japan is actively working on this challenge. Companies like Toyota are leading the way with innovative EV technologies to maintain global competitiveness.”
Director General NIPA Saifur Rehman also addressed the participants and emphasized the importance of learning from Japan’s innovative and disciplined leadership approach. “Japan is a shining example of how visionary leadership, combined with hard work and innovation, enabled a war-torn country to become a global leader in technology—producing world-class products like televisions, electronics, automobiles, and industrial machinery,” he stated.
The session concluded with a vote of thanks and the presentation of a memento to CG Masaru Hattori. His address was a powerful reflection on resilience, policy reform, and the enduring value of institutional excellence.

‘Bilawal’s economic vision driving Sindh’s transformation’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320648-bilawal-s-economic-vision-driving-sindh-s-transformation,"The Sindh government is actively implementing a series of high-impact development and investment initiatives aimed at transforming the province into a regional economic hub.
According to a spokesperson for the Sindh government,  Mustafa Abdullah Baloch, these efforts were being undertaken under the progressive economic vision of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
Several flagship projects were currently underway, including Education City, Marble City, the Dhabeji Special Economic Zone (SEZ), and the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund. These initiatives were strategically designed to enhance industrial capacity, attract both domestic and foreign investment, and create meaningful employment opportunities across the province.
Education City was envisioned as a hub of knowledge and innovation, offering world-class academic and research facilities to promote human capital development. Marble City aimed to leverage Sindh’s natural mineral resources to establish a value-added stone and marble industry with strong export potential.
The Dhabeji SEZ, a priority project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), was set to become a major industrial zone, offering investors modern infrastructure and proximity to Karachi’s ports. Meanwhile, the Sindh Enterprise Development Fund was supporting small and medium enterprises (SMEs), agribusinesses, and startups through improved access to finance and institutional backing. The Sindh government was also taking concrete steps to improve the ease of doing business, modernise infrastructure, and foster a business-friendly regulatory environment. These measures form part of a long-term strategy to position Sindh as a key driver of national economic growth.
“These projects are a direct reflection of Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s commitment to a progressive and economically vibrant Sindh,” said Baloch. “Our focus is on sustainable development that benefits all segments of society and strengthens the province’s contribution to the national economy.” The government remained committed to inclusive growth, public-private partnerships, and innovation-led development, ensuring that Sindh remained at the forefront of Pakistan’s economic future.

Students brave blazing sun as varsities indecisive over summer break,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320654-students-brave-blazing-sun-as-varsities-indecisive-over-summer-break,"LAHORE:As the heat wave continues across Punjab and other parts of the country, university students remain especially vulnerable. But sadly, those at the helm remain indifferent.
While schools and colleges are closed for annual summer vacation in the province, there is no uniform policy for universities. Some, like Punjab University which is closed for summer vacation from June 5, 2025, to August 29, 2025,  are off but many others, both public and private, remain open, forcing students to attend classes and commute in extreme heat.
This discrepancy in policies, in the name of autonomy, means that while some students enjoy a break, others must continue to navigate the difficulties of attending classes and commuting in extreme temperatures. The differing strategies highlight a lack of consensus on managing academic schedules during the peak summer weeks, raising questions about the impact on student well-being and academic performance.
In Lahore, the ongoing heat wave pushed temperatures to extreme highs on Thursday, with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reporting that temperatures soared to as high as 50°C, and the heat intensity peaking at a scorching 60°C.
Over the past few weeks, the government issued multiple heat alerts, warning citizens of the heightened risk of heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses. These heatstroke alerts emphasise the need for precautions, especially during the hottest parts of the day. These alerts advise staying hydrated, avoiding direct sunlight, and wearing light clothing.
However, for students who must commute long distances, these precautions are often insufficient to mitigate the harsh conditions. The exposure to extreme heat during travel compounds the difficulties they face on campus, making it a struggle to maintain their health and academic performance. In the context of the ongoing discussion about the challenges faced by university students during the intense heat wave in Punjab, Dr Amjad Magsi, former president of the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (FAPUASA), who is also the incumbent president of PU Academic Staff Association (PUASA), agrees with the concerns raised by the university students and their parents about the impact of extreme heat on students’ health and academic performance.
Dr Magsi, while appreciating PU administration for summer break, proposes that universities could shift to an online mode of education during the peak of the heat season. This approach would allow students to continue their studies without the need to commute or attend classes in person, thereby reducing their exposure to the harsh weather conditions, he says.
Additionally, another university official points out a practical benefit of implementing a summer break for all universities: the potential reduction in electricity bills for universities. With campuses closed or operating minimally during the summer break, the energy consumption would decrease, leading to cost savings for the institutions.
These suggestions highlight the potential for flexible academic scheduling and the adoption of online learning as strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of extreme heat on the university students. Furthermore, they underscore the financial advantages for universities in aligning their academic calendars with the summer season.

20pc increase in salaries demanded,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320655-20pc-increase-in-salaries-demanded,"LAHORE:General Secretary of the All Pakistan Federation of Trade Unions, Khurshid Ahmad, has demanded the Prime Minister announce a 20pc increase in the salaries and pensions of government, semi-government, private sector, banking, media, press, industry, and trade employees in light of the alarming rise in the cost of living and prices of essential commodities, including education.
Addressing a press conference, Khurshid Ahmad criticised the government’s decision to enhance the salaries and perks of the Speaker National Assembly, Chairman Senate, federal and provincial ministers, and members of the national and provincial assemblies and Senate, while ignoring the plight of the working class. He demanded the removal of restrictions on receiving pensions beyond 10 years, stating that with rising inflation and growing unemployment, workers and retirees are finding it increasingly difficult to sustain their families. The federation called for immediate attention to workers’ financial hardships and urged the government to ensure fair and just relief for all employees across sectors.

Ban on all forms of child labour demanded,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320661-ban-on-all-forms-of-child-labour-demanded,"LAHORE:Rights organisations have sounded the alarm over the rampant and unchecked abuse of child labour in Punjab, calling for immediate and concrete action from the government to eradicate the practice across all sectors.
The call came during a joint press conference held at the Lahore Press Club by WISE (Women in Struggle for Empowerment), Child Rights Movement (CRM), and Women Domestic Workers Union – Punjab.
Iftikhar Mubarak, Director of Search for Justice and Coordinator of Child Rights Movement, cited the Punjab Child Labour Survey 2019–20, revealing that over six million children aged 5–17 are engaged in child labour in Punjab alone. He said 3.3 million children work in agriculture, over 800,000 in manufacturing, and Sahiwal Division alone houses more than 750,000 child labourers, while Rawalpindi reports under 250,000. Boys account for 4.1 million of those working, while 1.9 million are girls. Mubarak criticised policy inaction and demanded integrated, cross-sector efforts to end this crisis. Syeda Ghulam Fatima, General Secretary of the Bonded Labour Liberation Front Pakistan (BLLF), exposed the prevalence of bonded child labour at brick kilns, with children trapped in modern-day slavery due to family debts. She denounced the authorities’ failure to enforce the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, which legally bans this practice.
Bushra Khaliq, Executive Director of WISE, reported that from January 1, 2019 to May 31, 2025, 190 cases of violence against child domestic workers were documented in Punjab through media monitoring. Of these, 43 girls were killed, and 147 suffered brutal physical or sexual abuse. Victims were mostly between the ages of 4 and 15, with Lahore, Faisalabad, and Kasur emerging as the most affected districts. She condemned the lack of enforcement of Article 3 of the Punjab Domestic Workers Act 2019, which prohibits employment of children under 15 in households.
According to official data from the Punjab Bureau of Statistics and the Punjab Labour Department, there are approximately 912,000 domestic workers in the province, many of whom are children working in abusive, slavery-like conditions.
Meanwhile, stakeholders from government, workers’ and employers’ organisations, and civil society came together to reaffirm their commitment to eliminating child labour in Pakistan. The event was organised by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Pakistan in collaboration with the Labour Research and Development Institute (LRDI) and the Pakistan United Workers Federation (PUWF).
Held under the global theme “Progress is evident, but there's more to do: let’s speed up efforts,” the event brought together representatives from government, workers' and employers' organisations, civil society, and communities engaged in cotton production. It was organised under the ILO’s project Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work in the Cotton Supply Chain – RISE for Impact, which works to eliminate child labour and promote social justice in Pakistan’s cotton sector. Geir Thomas Tonstol, Director, ILO Country Office for Pakistan, said “Child labour remains one of the gravest violations of fundamental rights.

PM&DC announces new syllabus for MDCAT,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320662-pm-dc-announces-new-syllabus-for-mdcat,"LAHORE:The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PM&DC) has officially uploaded the new syllabus for the Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) 2025 on its official website.
This new syllabus will serve as the core framework for the upcoming MDCAT examination likely to be held on the last Sunday of September or 1st Sunday of October 2025. However, the final date will be announced in a couple of days in consultation with the admitting universities and with the approval of the council.
As the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council is the national statutory body responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country it oversees curriculum development, licensing, and accreditation of medical institutions. The new syllabus encompasses five key subjects i.e, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, English, and Logical Reasoning, with a focus on conceptual understanding and critical thinking. The PM&DC encourages all aspiring medical and dental students to begin their preparation following the newly issued syllabus.
The structure, weightage, and difficulty levels for the MDCAT 2025 exam have also been officially defined. The exam will consist of a total of 180 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), to be completed within a three-hour duration. The distribution of the questions will be as follows: 15% easy, 70% moderate, and 15% difficult. The format of the exam will be entirely MCQ-based, and no negative marking will be applied. To qualify for admission, candidates must achieve a minimum of 55% marks for admission in medical colleges and 50% marks for admission in dental colleges. These standards have been lined up to ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation of each candidate’s knowledge and readiness for medical or dental education.
PM&DC President Prof Dr Rizwan Taj in his statement, apprised that the new syllabus is a step towards promoting transparency, fairness, and standardisation in medical and dental admissions. He added that, few gaps were pointed out in the previous syllabus, which have been rectified and the PM&DC addressed the issue and introduced the revised syllabus within just six months. He added that this updated curriculum was compiled to balance foundational knowledge with analytical and reasoning skills, serving the evolving academic needs of our next generation of healthcare professionals. Dr Taj reaffirmed that the updated syllabus lays the foundation for a merit-based, unified national assessment. He added that PM&DC is also developing a question bank with expert input. He acknowledged past challenges and emphasised that the Council has worked diligently to resolve these issues and ensure a fair testing system.

MoU signed on eradicating polio from country,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320663-mou-signed-on-eradicating-polio-from-country,"LAHORE:The Punjab Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) and the Lahore Press Club (LPC) have reaffirmed their commitment to eradicating polio from Pakistan.
The two institutions highlighted the critical importance of sustained media engagement in dispelling misinformation, promoting vaccine acceptance, and ensuring every child receives life-saving immunisation.
The reaffirmation came during a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing ceremony held at the Lahore Press Club, where stakeholders from the media and health sectors pledged collaborative efforts to advance public health goals, with a special focus on polio eradication.
Speaking at the event, Uzma Kardar, Chief Minister’s Focal Person on Polio, emphasised the role of the media as an essential ally in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases. ‘Media is not just a source of information — it is a force for change,’ said Ms Kardar. ‘We are committed to working closely with journalists and media platforms to ensure that accurate, timely, and factual information about polio vaccination reaches every corner of the province. Together, we can counter myths, confront misinformation, and help parents to make decisions for their children’s future.’
Adeel Tasawur, Coordinator of the Punjab Emergency Operations Centre, said: ‘The media is one of our strongest partners in this fight. We rely on their reach and credibility to break down resistance, share facts, and encourage families to vaccinate their children.’
He added, ‘Our frontline polio workers are the backbone of this campaign. With the support of the media and civil society, we can ensure they are welcomed into every home and empowered to do their jobs safely and effectively.’
Uzma Kardar also praised the frontline polio workers, the leadership of the health department and the provincial administration for making swift, evidence-based decisions to contain virus transmission.
Arshad Ansari, President of the Lahore Press Club, pledged full media support to the anti-polio drive. ‘The Lahore Press Club and its members are fully aligned with the goal of a polio-free Pakistan.’ He reiterated media’s commitment to supporting both government agencies and field teams. ‘We stand with polio workers and will amplify their efforts to ensure every child is vaccinated.’

"SKMT distributes 518,000 kg meat among needy families",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320666-skmt-distributes-518-000-kg-meat-among-needy-families,"LAHORE:For over a decade, Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust (SKMT) has turned the spirit of Eidul Azha into an opportunity to serve humanity through its annual sacrifice service.
This initiative not only brings joy to thousands of families by providing nutritious meat but also supports SKMT’s mission to fight cancer, with proceeds from animal hide sales directly funding treatment for underprivileged cancer patients.
This year, SKMT recorded a notable increase in both sacrifice orders and hide collections compared to the previous year, reflecting the steadfast trust and generosity of supporters across Pakistan. Over 75% of SKMT’s patients receive financially supported treatment, made possible through initiatives like this.
SKMT carefully selected goats and cows meeting stringent requirements for age, weight, and health, ensuring they were strong and suitable for sacrifice. The slaughtering process was conducted by trusted partners adhering to industry-leading standards of hygiene and safety. The entire process was carried out in a timely and carefully organised manner, with full adherence to Islamic principles and utmost respect for the sanctity of the act.
Despite a heat wave, SKMT’s staff and volunteers worked tirelessly to ensure safe and dignified meat distribution. This year, 518,000 kg meat was distributed among 86,000 needy families in different parts of Pakistan, spreading smiles on Eidul Azha. SKMT extended heartfelt gratitude to all supporters, volunteers, and staff whose contributions made this initiative a resounding success, creating a meaningful impact for cancer patients and families in need.

"Rain, windstorms forecast from today",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320679-rain-windstorms-forecast-from-today,"Islamabad:The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued an advisory amid forecast of welcome cloudy weather, scattered rain and windstorms between Friday and Wednesday (June 13–16) in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and upper regions of Punjab.
The NDMA’s National Emergencies Operation Centre urged people to take precautions as extreme heat is expected to affect the rest of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan, some areas of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir, from Friday to Wednesday (13–18 June).
A weak western weather system is forecast to affect the upper regions of the country from 13 to 16 June, which may influence weather conditions across multiple provinces.  In Punjab, hot weather is expected to persist throughout the week.
In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP), mostly hot conditions are predicted, but scattered rain and windstorms are likely in several districts, including Chitral, Dir, Haripur, Karak, Kohat, Kohistan, Khyber, Kurram, Mansehra, Mohmand, Nowshera, Malakand, Charsadda, Abbottabad, Bannu, Buner, Hazara, Peshawar, Swabi, Swat, Waziristan, and adjoining areas.
Sindh and Balochistan are forecast to remain predominantly hot and dry throughout the advisory period.  In Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), hot weather will prevail, although areas such as Astore, Skardu, Hunza, Shighar, Bagh, and Neelum Valley may receive isolated rainfall from 13 to 16 June.
NDMA, through NEOC, is closely monitoring the situation and maintaining coordination with provincial and district authorities to ensure timely preparedness and response.  The public, particularly those residing in heat-prone regions, is advised to take necessary precautions during extreme temperatures. These include staying hydrated, avoiding outdoor activities during peak heat hours (11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.), wearing light and breathable clothing, and checking on vulnerable individuals such as children, the elderly, and those with health conditions. It is also crucial never to leave children or pets unattended in parked vehicles.  Travellers and tourists planning to visit northern or hilly regions are urged to remain updated with local weather conditions and follow safety advisories.

She made these remarks during a meeting held here with Hafiz Muhammad Basharat, President of the Private Educational Society and a candidate for the board of governors at the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education.
The meeting included detailed discussions on the challenges faced by the private education sector, the rising number of out-of-school children, and improvements in education policies. Hafiz Muhammad Basharat informed the Minister that private schools are providing quality education to millions of children, but rising inflation, lack of policy continuity, and stringent regulations from oversight bodies pose serious challenges.
He stressed that private institutions could play a crucial role in reducing the number of out-of-school children if they are supported at the policy level. Wajiha Qamar reiterated that the Ministry of Education values the contribution of the private education sector and is working on a comprehensive and effective strategy to address its concerns. She noted that collaboration between public and private institutions is essential to reintegrate out-of-school children into the education system.
Also present at the meeting, Professor Rafiq Tahir highlighted the need for continuous consultation with private institutions during policy formulation. Chaudhry Shakeel Chauhan shed light on the practical challenges faced by private schools in the field and emphasized the importance of government support.
Meanwhile, Chaudhry Imran praised the efforts of private institutions in improving education standards and providing student facilities, and called for their concerns to be raised at higher levels. The meeting concluded on a positive note, with all participants agreeing to strengthen coordination and cooperation to promote education in the country.

‘Uplift projects for Islamabad reflect vision of model city’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320683-uplift-projects-for-islamabad-reflect-vision-of-model-city,"Islamabad: Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari, a member of the Central Core Committee of UBG, has welcomed the proposed development projects for Islamabad in the Federal Budget 2025-26.

Debt and deception: India’s mockery meets fiscal reality,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320684-debt-and-deception-india-s-mockery-meets-fiscal-reality,"For decades, India has wielded the narrative of economic superiority over Pakistan as a strategic and political tool. From podiums in New Delhi to nightly TV panel rants, Indian political discourse has consistently depicted Pakistan as a “beggar state”-perpetually in crisis, perpetually in need. But as global economic institutions and cold fiscal facts come under scrutiny, this narrative seems less like a truth and more like a diversion.
A recent turn of events at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has amplified this contradiction. India, despite its posturing as a regional economic powerhouse, failed to convince the IMF to reconsider its support for Pakistan during loan negotiations. The message was clear: economic diplomacy is not about power plays; it’s about numbers, need, and reform. In this equation, India’s grandstanding was found wanting-according to The Hindu, India attempted to dissuade IMF assistance but was unsuccessful, as the Fund judged Pakistan’s eligibility on institutional criteria, not geopolitical pressure.
As of March 2024, India’s total public debt stood at a towering $2.18 trillion. The IMF projects India’s debt-to-GDP ratio to peak at 82.3% in 2024-25, a level that rivals China’s, which hovers around 83%, according to reports in Business Standard and The Hindu. To put this into perspective, India’s debt burden is now significantly higher than that of many developing nations.
The IMF has tempered its warnings by noting that most of India’s debt is domestic and long-term, yet it also flagged an urgent need for fiscal consolidation and improved public financial management to avoid systemic risks-issues raised in Economic Times and Financial Times. More concerning is the parallel rise of household debt, an often overlooked facet of financial vulnerability. As of June 2024, Indian household debt had reached $617.3 billion, or 42.9% of GDP-a dramatic increase from 37.6% in 2023-driven largely by middle-class credit consumption and retail lending expansion, as reported by Financial Express and CEIC Data.
In contrast, Pakistan’s total public debt stood at Rs74 trillion ($265 billion) as of December 2024, translating into a debt-to-GDP ratio of 71.4%, lower than India’s, according to Economy.pk and The Nation. While Pakistan’s economic struggles are real-marked by low reserves, revenue constraints, and global commodity shocks-its household debt remains contained at around 2% of GDP, based on figures reported in The Nation.
The IMF has acknowledged Pakistan’s economic vulnerabilities but also commended the country for adhering to reform commitments under its Extended Fund Facility. These include rationalizing energy subsidies, expanding the tax net, and digitizing tax administration-steps recognized by both Dawn and The News International.
What’s particularly notable is the contrast in IMF perception. Despite India’s overtures to block or reduce aid, the IMF declined to heed its recommendations. This rebuff underscores that international financial institutions are increasingly immune to nationalist lobbying and instead operate based on empirical assessments, as emphasized by The Hindu.
The image of Pakistan as a perennial defaulter serves a convenient purpose-fuelling political narratives within India-but falters under empirical scrutiny. India’s claims of financial exceptionalism ring hollow when juxtaposed with its ballooning debt, rising household credit dependency, and widening fiscal deficits. Its rejection at the IMF table highlights that performance, not posture, dictates credibility in global finance.
Conversely, Pakistan, often dismissed as economically undisciplined, has engaged constructively with multilateral lenders, undertaking politically painful reforms and resisting consumer debt expansion. This less glamorous approach earns little media praise but accumulates trust where it matters-among institutions that assess sustainability over sentiment.
If the India-Pakistan economic narrative were a courtroom drama, the evidence would present a case of shared vulnerabilities rather than one villain. India may boast significant foreign exchange reserves and a large GDP, but its economic model is increasingly weighed down by consumer borrowing, fiscal populism, and widening inequality. Pakistan, though economically smaller, has demonstrated surprising resilience and willingness to adjust its course, even amid geopolitical pressure and domestic hardship.
The IMF’s rejection of India’s lobbying effort is a potent reminder that credibility in the global financial system is earned through disciplined policy and reform, not through regional rivalry or political jibes. As reported in The Nation, the Fund’s treatment of Pakistan as a serious reforming partner rebukes the narrative that only size determines credibility.
India’s economic mockery of Pakistan may make for popular soundbites and political theatrics, but it falls short as serious economic analysis. Both nations face daunting fiscal futures, and both must navigate them with humility, not hubris. Instead of treating debt as a scoreboard for regional one-upmanship, South Asia would be better served by fostering mutual economic respect and cooperation. But for that to happen, India must first drop the megaphone and pick up the mirror.
George Orwell once observed, “The arrogance of assumed superiority is the surest way to blind oneself to the truth.” In the case of India’s debt denial and its scorn for Pakistan’s reforms, this blindness may soon prove costly-not just in terms of regional credibility, but in real economic resilience.

Widows concerned as govt moves to cap family pensions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320685-widows-concerned-as-govt-moves-to-cap-family-pensions,"Islamabad:The pension reforms announced by the finance minister in the federal budget 2025-26 have triggered widespread criticism from pensioners and their families, especially over the controversial decision to limit family pensions to a 10-year period following the death of a pensioner's spouse.
Previously, family pensions were disbursed for the lifetime of the deceased pensioner’s spouse. However, under the new reforms, this duration has been capped at 10 years, a move aimed at reducing the government’s long-term pension liabilities.
Moreover, the government has abolished the provision of drawing multiple pensions, a practice that had contributed to the growing fiscal burden. While the government argues that these measures are essential for streamlining pension expenditures, many retirees and their families see it as a cruel blow to their already fragile financial security.
“If a pensioner dies, and his wife is in her seventies or eighties with no other source of income, how can she survive after 10 years?"" questioned a retired government servant. The sentiment is shared by many who believe the reforms overlook the economic vulnerabilities faced by elderly widows.
A widow whose husband passed away just weeks ago said her husband was the sole breadwinner. ""Now I will receive a family pension only for the next ten years. After that, how am I supposed to live at the age of 70 or 80 without any income?” What will I do after that? I have no income, no savings.""
She urged the government to reconsider ""these inhumane reforms."" Liaquat Ali, a retired officer, argued that while the intention to reduce fiscal pressure may be understandable, the execution of the policy lacked empathy and failed to provide alternative support systems for the elderly dependents of deceased pensioners.
He said that the new rules disproportionately affected elderly widows who were most vulnerable and often lacked employment opportunities, especially in the absence of a proper social safety net.

FAPUASA condemns termination in SMIU,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320686-fapuasa-condemns-termination-in-smiu,"Islamabad:Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA) has strongly condemned the unjust termination of Prof Abdul Majeed Pirzada of Sindh Madressatul Islam University (SMIU), Karachi.
This abrupt and arbitrary action raised serious concerns about the violation of due process and the deliberate bypassing of established disciplinary procedures which threatens the credibility and sanctity of the institution.
In a statement, it said it is deeply alarming that Dr Pirzada’s termination appears to be an act of retaliation directly linked to his efforts to expose corruption and administrative malpractices within the university. Rather than addressing the serious issues highlighted by Dr Pirzada, the university administration chose to suppress dissent by targeting a whistleblower.
This action created an environment of fear, insecurity and intimidation among the faculty severely undermining academic freedom and eroding trust in the university’s governance, it said.
In view of these serious developments, FAPUASA made an earnest appeal to the Chief Minister Sindh Murad Ali Shah, who serves as the Chancellor of SMIU, to take immediate notice of the situation and order a fair, impartial and transparent inquiry into the circumstances surrounding Dr Pirzada’s termination. At the same time, it also appealed to the Governor Sindh to intervene and ensure that the fundamental rights of university faculty are protected and that institutional integrity is upheld.
FAPUASA strongly demanded immediate reinstatement of Dr Pirzada to his position, pending the outcome of the independent inquiry. Furthermore, it urged the university administration and all concerned authorities to guarantee full protection to faculty members against any form of harassment, victimisation or reprisal for exercising their constitutional right to free speech, academic freedom, and professional integrity.

‘No relief for common man in budget’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320687-no-relief-for-common-man-in-budget,"Rawalpindi:Political and social leader Chaudhry Inam Zafar has criticised the recent budget, stating that it fails to provide relief to the common man. Instead, it rewards already privileged ministers while imposing further hardships on ordinary citizens, says a press release.
The small increase in salaries and pensions of government employees is insufficient to keep pace with inflation, which will only worsen the plight of the common man. The budget policies will lead to increased inflation, placing an additional burden on citizens who are already struggling to make ends meet.
Chaudhry Inam Zafar, leader of the Awaam Pakistan Party, expressed disappointment with the budget for the financial year 2025-26. He noted that the 10% increase in salaries and pensions is inadequate, likening it to “a cumin in the mouth of a camel.” The same injustice has been done to pensioners.
The government has made promises to reduce inflation and make electricity cheaper, but these claims are unconvincing. The imposition of a carbon levy on petrol, diesel, and furnace oil will further increase inflation, directly affecting the common man.Chaudhry Inam Zafar emphasized that expensive electricity and additional bills have already made life miserable for ordinary citizens.

Protesters storm Pesco offices in Swabi against loadshedding,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320708-protesters-storm-pesco-offices-in-swabi-against-loadshedding,"SWABI: The protesters on Thursday forcibly entered the offices of Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco) during a demonstration against prolonged loadshedding.
The protest call had been given by the Swabi Action Committee and Da Haq Awaz.The protesters reached district headquarters despite the scorching heat.They were holding placards inscribed with different slogans against Wapda and Pesco while chanting slogans against elected leaders. The protesters opened the main entrance gate of the Pesco office by force and police deployed at the building did not take any action while the staff had already locked their office and moved peacefully aside.
They locked the main entrance gate. The main demand was zero loadshedding. Anoother demand was the provision of electricity at a concessional rate to the consumers in the district.The protesters flayed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ministers belonging to the district, MNAs Asad Qaiser and, Shahram Khan Tarakai and the MPAs from the area after accusing them of doing nothing to resolve the issue.
The speakers said the 18-hour loadshedding experienced by the local people was a cruel act. Just take the example, we were not spared even during the Eid days. Masood Jabar and Javid Iqbal Inqilabi from the Pakistan People’s Party said Tarbela Dam generated power up to 4888 megawatt, but still, Swabi remained deprived of electricity.
It was decided to stage a hunger strike while sitting in the Pesco offices in front of an executive engineer’s (operation) office.  They said the hunger strike would continue in the Pesco office premises till meeting their demands.

Peshawar chamber opposes tax in Malakand,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320709-peshawar-chamber-opposes-tax-in-malakand,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar Chamber of Commerce and Industry has opposed the proposed imposition of sales tax on the terrorism-affected Malakand Division, calling it an unwise and unjust decision that will gravely impact both the business community and the general public.
In a joint statement, President of Peshawar Chamber Shakeel Ahmed Khan Saraf, Senior Vice President Tila Muhammad, Vice President Zohaib Arif, and spokesperson of Tanzeem Tajiran Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Shehzad Ahmed Siddiqui, along with other office-bearers, rejected the federal government’s proposal to impose a 10 percent sales tax in Malakand Division.
They stated that Malakand had endured years of terrorism, which displaced millions of people and crippled the local economy.  The chamber leaders added that imposing a tax on this already struggling region is equivalent to pushing it towards economic collapse.
“The traders of Malakand, who have already suffered immense losses, will now face further hardships due to this unjust policy,” the statement said. The chamber leaders reminded the authorities that even the chief minister had rejected this proposal during the prime minister’s recent visit to Peshawar at a Grand Jirga.
“Despite this, the government’s insistence on taxing the region has raised serious concerns”, said the joint statement. They warned that the entire business community of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would stand shoulder to shoulder with the traders of Malakand and initiate a province-wide protest if the federal government did not withdraw this decision.

PHC restores journalist’s civil suit for damages,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320710-phc-restores-journalist-s-civil-suit-for-damages,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court (PHC) has restored a civil suit for damages filed by a senior journalist, Mehmood Jan (Babar), against the United States of America through its Consulate Office in Peshawar.
The case had previously been dismissed by a lower court due to non-prosecution, a move the PHC now overturned, citing the right to due process.Presiding over a single-member bench, Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan set aside the orders of both the trial court dated 19 July 2021 and the Additional District Judge-XV dated 31 March 2022.
The appeal arose after the trial court dismissed Mehmood Jan’s damages suit for non-appearance, citing procedural delay.Mehmood Jan’s legal counsel had passed away during the pendency of the case due to stomach cancer, which resulted in missed court appearances.
The high court observed that the trial court’s decision to dismiss the case merely due to a short delay was a denial of the appellant’s constitutional right to a fair trial and due process, as enshrined in Article 10-A of the Constitution of Pakistan.Justice Muhammad Ijaz Khan emphasised that courts must look beyond procedural technicalities and adopt a dynamic approach to ensure substantive justice.
“The due process of law also means that no party to a dispute should be deprived of proving their case following legal requirements,” the judgment noted.The ruling also cited the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision in Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Finance v. Another, reinforcing that all citizens have an inalienable right to be treated according to the law.
In light of these considerations, the PHC restored Mehmood Jan’s original suit and directed the trial court to resume proceedings from the stage at which the case was dismissed. Both parties were instructed to appear before the trial court on June 23, 2025.
The suit, filed by the journalist, seeks $20 million in damages for what he terms as “humiliation, physical and mental torture, and financial loss” allegedly inflicted by US authorities.The dispute dates back to October 2020, when Mehmood was barred from boarding a connecting flight to New York at Istanbul Airport, despite possessing a valid five-year US professional visa (Type I) issued in 2016.
He had planned to cover the US presidential elections for his media outlets. After verifying his visa and travel documents in Islamabad, he was allowed to board a Turkish Airlines flight, but was stopped in Istanbul and forced to return to Pakistan “in an undignified and insulting manner.” Upon inquiry, Turkish Airlines informed him that the US Embassy had revoked his visa.
The US Embassy later confirmed the revocation under Section 221(i) of the US Immigration and Nationality Act, but gave no reasons.The journalist claimed he was not informed in advance, nor provided any explanation during or after the incident.
His counsel, Fida Gul, argued that all relevant agencies, including the airline, immigration officials, and the US Embassy, failed in their respective duties to inform his client of the visa status and prevent unnecessary travel and public embarrassment.
The journalist later served a fresh legal notice on the US Embassy through Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to which the embassy responded, expressing regret for the inconvenience but reiterating that it was the US Department of State - not the consulate - that had declared him ineligible for travel.
On the other hand, the US Embassy took the plea that the legal documents were not sent to them through proper channels, “[the plaintiff] did not provide sixty days’ notice and did not include sufficient information about the case, the manner and timing of service were defective.” Besides, it argued that under customary international law, a foreign sovereign was not required to file a responsive pleading or appear before the courts or other tribunals of another state, unless proper service of process is provided.The PHC, however, found these procedural defences insufficient to override a citizen’s right to a fair trial, and has now reopened the case for regular proceedings.

Jirga seeks early action on merged districts issues,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320711-jirga-seeks-early-action-on-merged-districts-issues,"PESHAWAR: A tribal elders’ delegation called on the divisional administration to seek urgent resolution of key issues in the merged districts and requested an early meeting with the provincial leadership.
The demand follows a recent federal announcement about the formation of a high-level committee to address post-merger challenges, with elders urging swift implementation and consultation.
During the meeting with Commissioner Peshawar Division Riaz Khan Mahsud, the jirga held a detailed discussion on governance, development, and administrative bottlenecks in the merged areas.
The elders referred to the Grand Tribal Jirga held in Peshawar after the launch of Operation Azm-e-Istehkam, chaired by the prime minister and the chief of the army staff, during which the prime minister had announced the formation of a provincial committee to address merger-related grievances.
The proposed committee is to be headed by the KP chief minister and include senior civil and military officials. The jirga urged the divisional administration to expedite the process and ensure meaningful engagement with tribal representatives. In response, the commissioner contacted the provincial leadership, which assured that a meeting with the jirga would be arranged next week to deliberate on key concerns directly with the elders. The jirga also lauded the provincial leadership for what they termed a principled and proactive stance on tribal rights.
The elders noted that consistent advocacy and coordination at the provincial and federal levels had helped bring longstanding tribal issues back into national focus. The delegation included elders from all tribal districts and Frontier Regions, with representation from Waziristan, Khyber, Mohmand, Orakzai, Bajaur, and Kurram, as well as former MNAs and retired officials.

Swatis set deadline for restoration of DHQ Hospital,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320713-swatis-set-deadline-for-restoration-of-dhq-hospital,"MINGORA: The Swat Action Committee on Thursday set a one-week deadline for the immediate restoration of the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital in Swat and asked the government to meet the demand.
The decision was made at a meeting of the committee held at Tehsil Municipal Administration Hall Mingora to protest against the conversion of Saidu Teaching Hospital into a Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) and to demand the full restoration of the DHQ Hospital, Swat.
The meeting was convened under the umbrella of an all-parties conference and was attended by a large number of political leaders, representatives from the Traders Federation, lawyers, the Health Employees Coordination Council, and members of civil society.
It was presided over by President of the Malakand Division Traders Federation, Abdul Rahim. Key attendees included JUI’s General Secretary Ijaz Khan, PPP District President Saleem Khan, Iqbal Hussain Bale of Jamaat-e-Islami, Muhammad Iqbal of Qaumi Watan Party, former ANP Tehsil Nazim Ikram Khan, former District Bar Association General Secretary Dunya Zaid, social activist Iftikhar Afzal, Azizul Haq, President of the Hotels Association Al-Haj Zahid Khan, spokesperson of the Traders Federation Dr. Khalid Mahmood, YDA District President Dr. Shehzad Khan, Dr. Khawaja Irfan, Tariq Khan, and General Secretary of the Swat Press Club Muhammad Shafiullah.
The participants criticized the provincial government and elected representatives for an allegedly indifferent attitude.They expressed disappointment that despite the success of an earlier jirga, no public representative had contacted the committee or attended the latest meeting, which, they said,  was clear evidence of their lack of commitment to the region and its people.
The meeting declared that the imposition of the MTI system and the potential privatization of Saidu Teaching Hospital would not be tolerated under any circumstances.The committee warned of strong resistance if the government attempted to enforce this decision unilaterally.
The committee demanded the immediate restoration of the DHQ Hospital in Swat and gave the government a one-week deadline to meet their demands.Failing this, the committee announced a series of protests, sit-ins, and strikes, for which they said the government and elected representatives would be held entirely responsible.

JI slams budget as ‘anti-people’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320714-ji-slams-budget-as-anti-people,"PESHAWAR: Jamaat-e-Islami Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Central) chief, Abdul Wasi, has criticized the federal budget 2025-26 as a brutal assault on the salaried class and a manifestation of economic injustice.
In a press statement issued here on Thursday, he expressed concern over what he described as the federal government’s clear preference for the wealthy elite over the working population. “The budget revolves around the interests of the rich and powerful,” he said, adding that imposing further taxes on the salaried class instead of industrialists and capitalists is sheer oppression, he added.
The JI leader criticized the allocation of a massive Rs8,207 billion for interest payments on loans and called it a moment of deep concern, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling against interest-based economic systems. “Despite the court’s decision, the continuation of a riba-based budget is lamentable,” he remarked.
Regarding the funds earmarked for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the merged tribal districts, Wasi said they were grossly insufficient and likened them to sprinkling salt on the wounds of the people. He said the funds allocated for the tribal districts were nothing more than a drop in the ocean.
“The federal government has deliberately ignored Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the budget,” he claimed, adding that despite producing electricity, the province continues to suffer from severe load-shedding.

LG reps urge govt to solve water crisis in Mansehra city,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320715-lg-reps-urge-govt-to-solve-water-crisis-in-mansehra-city,"MANSEHRA: The chairmen of the neighbourhood councils on Thursday demanded the government to ensure the supply of potable water to the city and its suburbs, warning that they would take to the streets in protest if their demand was not met.
“We have already met with the deputy commissioner and local lawmakers, seeking their intervention for the provision of drinking water, but to no avail,” Israr Khan alias Pool, chairman of neighbourhood council-I, told reporters.
He said that the chairmen from nearly all 11 neighbourhood councils in Mansehra and surrounding areas had agreed to launch a protest campaign against the worsening water crisis before Eidul Azha.
“We have been planning to convene a grand jirga within the next few days to finalise a strategy for a sit-in outside the deputy commissioner’s office and to block major roads,” Israr Khan said.
He added that the water crisis had worsened with the onset of summer, but civic authorities had failed to operationalise existing or new water schemes that could meet the growing demand.
“Neither the federal nor the provincial governments have taken the water shortage seriously. Despite the approval of funds, the mega gravity water supply scheme has yet to be inaugurated,” he added.
He said the Thanda Bala water supply scheme, completed with assistance from a non-governmental organisation, still hasn’t been made operational.He also expressed concern over the misuse of the Ichar Nullah water scheme, which was originally designed to provide clean drinking water to residents of the city and surrounding areas.

FPCCI urges govt to roll back ‘anti-business’ tax measures,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320587-fpcci-urges-govt-to-roll-back-anti-business-tax-measures,"KARACHI: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has called on the government to withdraw what it terms harsh and anti-business tax measures proposed in the Finance Bill before its passage through parliament.
“What the country needs is a pro-business, investment-friendly and growth-oriented fiscal policy framework, especially now that the economy has stabilised and is poised for recovery,” said FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh.
Sheikh added that the government’s tax collection targets can only be met if industrialists and exporters are engaged through a comprehensive consultative process. However, he lamented that the budget lacks the necessary measures to help the business community realise the prime minister’s vision of export-led growth.
He warned that the sweeping discretionary powers granted to tax officials would undermine investor confidence, saying such provisions would lead to harassment, corruption and maladministration.
The FPCCI chief emphasised that globally, it is well established that the more a tax collector is allowed to directly interact with a taxpayer, the more likely it is to erode fairness, transparency and impartiality. “Human-to-human interaction introduces unnecessary subjectivity and becomes a nuisance. We do not need to reinvent the wheel in this regard,” he added.
Sheikh welcomed the reduction in super tax, the rationalisation of tax slabs for salaried individuals, and the simplification of income tax return forms for both salaried individuals and SMEs -- longstanding demands of the FPCCI. He also appreciated the much-needed increase in defence spending to safeguard Pakistan’s geoeconomic interests, trade routes and strategic integrity.
Senior Vice President of FPCCI Saquib Fayyaz Magoon urged the restoration of the fixed tax regime (FTR) for exporters in its original form and for a long-term duration. “Only through clarity, certainty and consistency in tax policy can we attract foreign direct investment and encourage domestic investment,” he said.
Magoon criticised the imposition of 18 per cent sales tax on raw materials, saying that instead of expanding the scope of the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) to include local manufacturers -- as recommended by all major sectors via the FPCCI -- the government has taken a regressive step. “This will increase production costs, disrupt supply chains, and hurt the competitiveness of Pakistani products in regional and global markets,” he warned.
He also expressed disappointment that the FPCCI’s proposals to offer special incentive packages for the IT & ITeS, mining and minerals, and fisheries sectors were ignored in the Federal Budget 2025-26. “These are high-growth areas with the potential for exponential expansion,” he added.

SBP to keep rates steady on Monday: report,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320588-sbp-to-keep-rates-steady-on-monday-report,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) is expected to keep its key interest rate unchanged next week, following a reduction in May, a brokerage report and a poll showed on Thursday.
Fifty-six per cent of market participants in the Topline Securities poll forecast the SBP would hold its policy rate steady at 11 per cent at its upcoming meeting on Monday. However, 44 per cent anticipate a rate cut of at least 50bps.
The SBP lowered its policy rate by 1 percentage point last month, continuing a trend of rate cuts that have lowered the rate from a record high of 22 per cent following a brief pause in March. Since June 2024, interest rates have fallen by 11 percentage points.
“In our view, the central bank has further room for around a 100bps cut, as we expect FY26 inflation to average between 6 and 7 per cent, translating into a real rate of 400-500bps (policy rate: 11 per cent), higher than the historical real rate of 200-300bps,” wrote Topline Securities in a note. “However, we expect the status quo in upcoming monetary policy,” it added.
The same report expects interest rates to fall to and bottom out at 10 per cent by the end of December this year.International crude oil prices have rebounded to $68-70 per barrel amid rising tensions in the Middle East and an expected US-China deal. “This warrants a cautious approach from policymakers, in our view, as oil prices’ movement has remained a major driver of inflation in the past,” it noted.
Some of the major notifications are also expected before the start of the next fiscal year, such as gas and electricity price notifications, among others. “The inflationary impact of these measures is yet to be assessed and absorbed, in our view.”
Pakistan’s Consumer Price Index increased by 3.5 per cent YoY in May, above the finance ministry’s prediction of 1.5-2 per cent. In April, annual inflation decreased to 0.3 per cent, the lowest rate in nearly a decade, a significant decline from 11.8 per cent in May 2024 and a record high of nearly 40 per cent a year earlier. The finance ministry's monthly report said that inflation is projected to rise to between 3.0 per cent and 4.0 per cent in June. The government has set a target of 7.5 per cent for the next fiscal year, staring in July, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects 7.7 per cent average inflation for FY26.In the last monetary policy committee meeting held on May 5, out of nine members, eight voted for a 100bps cut.

Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan and IT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja led a high-level meeting on Wednesday to address regulatory hurdles in the country’s fast-growing digital marketplace.
As part of the government’s upcoming eCommerce Policy 2.0, the ministers announced the formation of a joint working group to develop targeted recommendations on vendor taxation, compliance protocols, and digital payment mechanisms. The group’s findings will be submitted to the prime minister for final review.
“The revised policy is undergoing internal review and will soon be placed before the cabinet for formal approval,” Khan said.Pakistan’s e-commerce market reached $7.7 billion in 2024 and is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 17 per cent through 2027, driven by rising digital adoption and increased mobile penetration.
The ministers said they are committed to building a competitive, inclusive and digitally empowered trade ecosystem, adding that challenges faced by the sector will be addressed at the highest policy level.

Trump says again he’ll set unilateral tariffs in two weeks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320590-trump-says-again-he-ll-set-unilateral-tariffs-in-two-weeks,"US President Donald Trump said he intended to send letters to trading partners in the next one to two weeks setting unilateral tariff rates, ahead of a July 9 deadline to reimpose higher duties on dozens of economies, reports Bloomberg .
“We are going to be sending letters out in about a week and a half, two weeks, to countries, telling them what the deal is,” Trump told reporters on Wednesday at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington where he was attending a performance.“At a certain point, we’re just going to send letters out. And I think you understand that, saying this is the deal, you can take it or leave it,” he added. It’s unclear if Trump will follow through with his pledge. The president has often set two-week deadlines for actions, only for them to come later or not at all. The president on May 16 said he would be setting tariff rates for US trading partners “over the next two to three weeks.”
Trump in April announced higher tariffs on dozens of trading partners only to pause them for 90 days as markets swooned and investors feared the levies would spark a global downturn. Yet despite the ongoing negotiations, the only trade framework the US has reached is with the UK, along with a tariff truce with China.
But even the truce with China was threatened after Washington and Beijing accused each other of reneging on the terms, leading to marathon talks earlier this week in London on how to implement their agreement.
Trump earlier Wednesday said the trade framework with China had been completed and would have Beijing supply rare earths and magnets, with the US allowing Chinese students to study at American colleges and universities.
Asked Wednesday at the performance if he would extend the deadline for nations to cut deals with his administration before higher levies take effect, Trump said he would be open to it. “But I don’t think we’re gonna have that necessity,” he added.
Trump had initially suggested he would engage in talks with each partner but has moved away from that idea, prioritizing talks with some key economic partners and acknowledging that the administration lacks the capacity to negotiate dozens of individual deals. Trump’s team is also working to secure bilateral deals with India, Japan, South Korea as well as the European Union.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said earlier Wednesday that the European Union is likely to be among the last deals that the US completed, expressing frustration with conducting talks with a 27-nation bloc.

KSE-100 down 259.56 points amid profit-taking,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320592-kse-100-down-2-328-points-amid-profit-taking,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a slight decline on Thursday, as the benchmark KSE-100 index decreased by 260 points amid profit-taking in overbought stocks.
The index dropped by 259.56 points, or 0.21 per cent, to 124,093.12 points, down from 124,352.68 points recorded in the last session. The highest index of the day remained at 126,718.28 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 123,846.56 points.
Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said, “Stocks closed under pressure on geopolitical uncertainty and post-budget profit taking in overbought scrips.”He said rout in global equities on Middle East tensions and geopolitical risk; a slump in global crude oil prices; and a weak rupee on contracting exports played a catalytic role in the bearish close.
The KSE-30 index decreased by 95.15 points or 0.25 per cent to 37,536.69 points from 37,631.84 points.Traded shares decreased by 17 million shares to 1,024.633 million shares from 1,041.129 million shares. The trading value increased to Rs50.539 billion from Rs46.707 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs14.951 trillion against Rs14.994 trillion. Of the 474 companies active in the session, 170 closed in green, 270 in red and 34 remained unchanged.
Naveed Nadeem, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the Pakistan stock market ended the session on a negative note, weighed down by cautious investor sentiment and profit-taking activity. The benchmark index moved within range, recording an intraday high of 2,365 points and a low of 501 points, before closing at 124,093.12, down 260 points or 0.21 per cent.
Downward pressure was largely attributed to declines in ENGROH, FFC, PPL, OGDC, and BAFL, which collectively eroded 401 points from the index. In contrast, support came from PKGP, UBL, BAHL, LUCK, and DGKC, which together added 347 points.
The highest increase was recorded in Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited, which rose by Rs204.47 to Rs23,310.33 per share, followed by Hoechst Pakistan Limited, which increased by Rs122.44 to Rs3,429.51 per share. A significant decline was noted in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which fell by Rs2,331.99 to Rs20,987.89 per share; Khyber Textile Mills Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs221.55 to Rs1,993.94 per share.
Analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala at JS Global said healthy volumes were seen, especially in the cement sector. “This dip appears to be short-term profit-taking after a strong multi-session rally,” he said. “Investors are advised to watch key support levels and use dips to accumulate. Focus remains on fertiliser, cement, and banking sectors for near-term opportunities.”
Sui South Gas remained the volume leader with 55.899 million shares, which closed higher by 78 paisas to Rs41.92 per share. Fauji Cement, with 50.597 million shares, followed it, which closed higher by 49 paisas to Rs47.36 per share.

Rupee falls for third day,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320593-rupee-falls-for-third-day,"KARACHI: The rupee continued to decline for a third consecutive session against the dollar in the interbank market on Thursday.
The rupee closed at 282.67 per dollar, down 0.07 per cent from the previous close of 282.47.In the open market, the rupee also declined, trading at 284.82 versus the dollar, compared with 284.64 on Wednesday.
Dealers said the local unit continued to depreciate, weighed down by fiscal-year-end dollar demand from importers.Dollar demand from importers usually increases in June due to import and other payments pressure, according to dealers.
Data from the State Bank of Pakistan showed on Wednesday that the country received $3.7 billion in remittances in May, reflecting a 16 per cent increase from the previous month and a 13.7 per cent rise compared with the same month last year. These inflows brought total remittances for the 11 months of the fiscal year 2025 to $34.9 billion, representing a 28.8 per cent rise from $27.1 billion during the same period last year. Remittances have been on the rise and peaked at a record-breaking $4.1 billion in March, the highest single-month inflow ever recorded.

Passenger car sales surge 31% YoY in May,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320594-passenger-car-sales-surge-31pc-yoy-in-may,"KARACHI: Passenger car sales by members of the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) rose 31 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in May 2025, reaching 11,119 units compared to 8,487 units in May 2024.
According to data released by PAMA on Thursday, a total of 94,388 passenger cars were sold during the first 11 months of FY25, up 32 per cent from 71,451 units sold in the same period of FY24.
On a month-on-month basis, car sales in May 2025 grew by 39 per cent compared to 8,004 units sold in April 2025.Mashood Ali Khan, an auto expert and former chairperson of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers (PAAPAM) noted that except for tractors, all other segments have shown strong performance.
“Two-wheeler sales have increased steadily throughout the year. This trend continues because four-wheelers have become too expensive, prompting lower-middle-income consumers to shift to motorcycles,” he said.
He added that the car industry has recovered after a prolonged crisis over the past couple of years. However, the small car segment could face challenges if GST is increased in the upcoming budget.
“The tractor industry is still suffering from last year’s budget impact. It has not recovered despite 11 months having passed,” he said.He emphasised that government policies should be designed in consultation with industry stakeholders. “A GST hike on cars will make things difficult for both the industry and consumers,” he warned.
""Industrialisation is essential for Pakistan’s economic growth. Localisation of parts and production is crucial, and a clear policy is needed to support this. Otherwise, the industry will continue to face challenges,” he added.
Sales of 1300cc and above cars stood at 6,778 units in May 2025, marking a 94 percent increase compared to 3,496 units in May 2024.The 1,000cc segment recorded sales of just 476 units -- 252 units of Suzuki Cultus and 224 of Suzuki WagonR -- down slightly from 482 units in the same month last year.
Sales in the below-1,000cc category declined 14 per cent YoY to 3,865 units, compared to 4,509 units in May 2024. Suzuki Alto sold 3,409 units in May 2025, down from 4,062 units in the same month last year.
Dewan’s electric vehicle, Honri-Ve, which had not recorded any sales in recent months, sold 24 units in May.Sales of buses and trucks more than doubled to 610 units in May 2025, up from 247 units in the same month last year.
Jeep and pick-up sales increased to 3,643 units from 2,462 units in May 2024.Tractor sales, however, dropped sharply to 1,569 units from 3,078 units a year earlier.Rickshaw and motorcycle sales rose to 150,175 units in May 2025, up from 118,811 units in May 2024.
According to Myesha Sohail of Topline Securities, the month-on-month (MoM) rise in sales was mainly due to a lower base in April 2025, when road closures in Sindh, caused by protests over canal issues, delayed deliveries and depressed sales.
She added that year-on-year growth was driven by a more stable macroeconomic environment, lower interest rates, easing inflation, and improving consumer sentiment.
Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd (SAZEW) posted the highest month-on-month growth at 67 per cent and an 18 per cent year-on-year increase, supported by the launch of a new facelift model of HAVAL and a low sales base in April.
Indus Motor Company (INDU) reported a 2.4x year-on-year and 48 per cent month-on-month increase in sales, reaching 4,829 units, its highest monthly sales in nearly three years. This was driven by strong sales of Corolla, Yaris and Cross models.
Honda Atlas Cars (HCAR) recorded a 69 per cent YoY and 17 per cent MoM increase in sales, reaching 2,005 units in May 2025.
Pak Suzuki Motor Company (PSMC) reported an 8.0 per cent YoY decline, but a 38 per cent MoM increase in sales. Hyundai Nishat Motors saw a 58 per cent YoY and 45 per cent MoM increase.
“We expect the momentum in auto sales to continue into FY26, driven by lower interest rates and a pipeline of new model launches, including hybrids and plug-in hybrids,” Myesha Sohail said.

China found world’s pain point on trade – and will use it again,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320595-china-found-world-s-pain-point-on-trade-and-will-use-it-again,"For months Donald Trump pushed tariffs and trade restrictions on China to unprecedented levels, part of a strategy to force Xi Jinping into talks the US president expected would help cut the trade deficit and boost American manufacturing, according to Bloomberg.
With US tariffs soaring to 145 per cent and the Trump administration boasting that it had the upper hand with China, Beijing turned the tables, essentially shutting down exports of one thing the modern world can’t function without: rare earth magnets.
As slowing deliveries of products with obscure elements like dysprosium and terbium began to pinch industries from autos to defence, the US and other nations quickly hit their pain threshold. Ford Motor Co and Suzuki Motor Corp idled some production, Elon Musk said shortages were hurting his robotics business and governments rushed to secure the few suppliers outside of China. A two-way trade spat became a global crisis.
“It’s just created an urgency,” said Rowena Smith, chief executive officer of Australian Strategic Materials Ltd, which produces alloys for magnets at a plant in South Korea. “The phones are running hot, and they are not just running hot from the US. Everyone is impacted by it.”
That pressure, along with prohibitive tariffs, prompted the US and China to agree to a truce in Geneva last month. Duties on trade came down and the US thought it was getting a supply of rare earth magnets. Yet Beijing still required companies to get licenses to purchase the critical materials, leading to delays that again raised tensions.
The US went back on the offensive, ratcheting up curbs on chip design software, jet engine parts and even threatening student visas. Eventually, Trump got what he long wanted: A call with Xi to get the relationship back on track. Then late Tuesday, US and Chinese trade negotiators announced a breakthrough following a second day of talks in London. Though critical details remain vague, there was little doubt over what was at the heart of the negotiations.
“FULL MAGNETS, AND ANY NECESSARY RARE EARTHS, WILL BE SUPPLIED, UP FRONT, BY CHINA,” Trump said in a social media post announcing his acceptance of the deal on Wednesday. “RELATIONSHIP IS EXCELLENT!”
Major questions remain. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said he thinks the London deal will be approved within days and that he didn’t expect a written version of the pact to be released, meaning it could be tough to know exactly what both sides agreed to beyond general outlines.
Hours after the agreement was announced, a major Chinese manufacturer of rare-earth magnets, JL Mag Rare-Earth Co, said it received export permits to countries including the US. Its Hong Kong-listed shares surged as much as 12 per cent. But confusion remained about a backlog of requests, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that Beijing is putting a six-month limit on licenses for rare earth exports. And China is unlikely to allow companies to build up inventories, especially in the defence industry.
“They might well be restarting enough of the export licenses so that the commercial buyers can get what they need,” said Arthur Kroeber, partner and head of research at Gavekal, an independent research firm, who has written about China for more than three decades. “But they are not going to issue enough licenses so that people can stockpile. They are not going to give up their leverage.” For all the US bluster, company executives and analysts said the latest episode demonstrated how quickly China’s advantage in the rare earths trade can be deployed to secure concessions from countries whenever tensions rise, as they almost surely will.
“While the US appeared to take the lead in reviving trade talks, China may have quietly secured the upper hand,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at Vantage Markets in Melbourne. China “weaponized its dominance in rare earths to shift the negotiating balance,” she added.
That’s in part because the new permitting China established around exporting rare earths and other critical minerals is so detailed that Beijing is building up a sophisticated understanding of where every kilogram that it produces is ending up and why, according to two people familiar with the process, who asked not to be identified citing the sensitivity of the issue. In the latest flare-up, bottlenecks emerged when China slowed approvals for products -- mainly magnets -- containing even miniscule amounts of seven rare earths, in addition to limiting sales of the raw elements. That insight will be a “sword of Damocles” hanging over all kinds of negotiations for years to come, one of the people said. And not just with the US.
“By slow-rolling the approval of licenses for the past few months, China has sent an unambiguous message to Europe: we can hurt you if we feel the need to,” said Noah Barkin, a senior adviser at the Rhodium Group.
China’s Xinhua News Agency said before Tuesday’s deal that export controls on rare earths aren’t trade countermeasures and don’t target any single country. Commerce Ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said last week that the “obvious dual-use attributes” of rare earths also justified export controls.
The new export permit process may have contributed to delays, but the repercussions were clear and the country’s leverage isn’t going away soon. Rare earths aren’t technically rare, but they aren’t often found in significant concentrations, making it hard to build up economically-viable businesses. The process of extraction and processing is technical, energy intensive and polluting -- and most Western nations lack the technology and skilled workforce to do it.
That’s left China and its state-driven economy with a large and long-term advantage, the supplier to the world on metals used not just in LED lights and medical lasers but in the tiny yet powerful “permanent magnets” essential in F-35 jets, wind turbines and electric vehicles.
“China played the card of the rare earths very well,” Steve Brice, global chief investment officer at Standard Chartered, said at the Bloomberg Invest Conference in Hong Kong this week.
Permanent magnets make up by far the biggest value of China’s rare earth-related products. In 2024, the country exported magnets worth about $2.9 billion, or more than 90 per cent of all downstream rare-earth related products, and more than five times the value of all rare earths in rawer form.
WTO fight
China’s grip on rare earths isn’t new. Beijing introduced quotas for its exporters in the early 2000s, but first deployed the elements as a trade weapon in 2010, when shipments to Japan were stalled amid a maritime dispute. That kickstarted Tokyo’s efforts to wean itself from China, a process that ended up taking longer and costing more than the government expected. China eased its export quotas in 2015 after losing a case at the World Trade Organization, but demand has only soared since then.
One lesson from Japan -- which has proposed greater cooperation on rare earths with the US in its latest talks over tariffs -- is that while processing can be sped up and permitting simplified, even with robust financial support any new mine is several years away.
So, facing an onslaught of trade restrictions following Trump’s return, China found a way to respond that had a global impact. The auto industry, from the US to Europe to India, was particularly hard hit.
Along with Ford and Suzuki’s production slowdowns, Volkswagen AG began asking suppliers to use components with fewer rare earths and to find alternatives for certain parts, according to a person familiar with management's thinking who asked not to be identified. The company hasn’t dialled back production because of shortages, but management is on alert for that risk and the supply chain is fragile, the person said.
German auto supplier ZF Friedrichshafen AG warned it could pause or suspend production without additional licenses from Beijing.
“With the currently existing export licenses, we have the situation under control,” a ZF spokesperson said via email. “However, we need additional licenses from the Chinese Ministry of Commerce to avoid short-term production stoppages.” Even the battlefields of Ukraine were feeling the crunch. The curb of magnets to Western nations was beginning to impact the delivery of drones and drone parts to Ukraine, Bloomberg reported last month. European officials linked that to China’s export restrictions on drone components, including magnets, while noting that deliveries of drones and drone parts continued to Russia.
Another technology hit by the shortage of magnets was the still-nascent market for humanoid robots. That market could grow from about $20 billion in 2030 to $1.2 trillion in 2040, Morgan Stanley said in a May 21 note. Demand at that level will make the market for rare earths even tighter if new supplies or faster processing isn’t brought online.
Musk raised an alarm about that on Tesla Inc’s quarterly earnings call in April, when asked for an update on the company’s Optimus robots.
“Optimus was affected by the magnet issue from China, because the Optimus actuators in the arm do use permanent magnets,” Musk said, explaining that the magnets “were affected by the supply chain, by basically China requiring export licenses to send out any rare earth magnets.”
Nicolaus Radford, CEO of Houston-based Personal AI, said relying less on China is an issue for the entire robotics industry. His company, which has a partnership with Korea’s HD Hyundai Robotics and HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering to build humanoid robots that can do dangerous and complex welding work in shipyards, has sought alternative supplies with little success.
“When you get to the heart of it, those magnets are sourced in China,” Radford said in an interview.
Not all industries which need rare earths were hit equally. Siemens Healthineers AG said that while it buys small amounts of rare earths for use in its health care equipment, it found a way to wean its MRI scanners from the metals a decade ago. The company now uses superconducting magnets made from copper, titanium and niobium — all more easily sourced. Some consumer tech products that require magnets avoided a hit because they are manufactured in China and exported as finished products, said Michael Deng, a geoeconomics technology analyst at Bloomberg Economics.
Tuesday’s detente in London doesn’t resolve all the trade measures the US has placed on China, some dating back to the Biden administration. It mostly rolls tensions back to where they were earlier this year, before the surge in tariffs and the responding tit-for-tat moves between the two countries took effect. But it comes after Trump and his aides insisted for months that China couldn’t withstand Washington’s onslaught.
“The ball is in China’s court: China needs to make a deal with us, we don’t have to make a deal with them,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in April.
The reality was always more complicated. Despite years of controls on high-tech chip imports, Beijing has focused on self-reliance and consistently managed to find workarounds. Under Xi, China has made steady progress in positioning his nation to dominate the industries of the future, including artificial intelligence, drones, semiconductors and electric vehicles. Washington’s measures have looked more like road bumps, not barriers.
Though the near-term outlook for rare earths is still a China story, Beijing’s lead won’t last forever. The latest crisis will likely be enough to spur the investment needed to get rare earths supply chains developing elsewhere, even if it takes a decade or more.
“The pain the industry is going to go through, it’s going through today and will go through in the months to come, is what is going to incentivize people to actually start putting the investment” into new rare earths projects, said Smith, the Australian Strategic Materials CEO. That pain “has unfortunately been a necessity to trigger this movement.”

PCMA urges policy overhaul to support $16bn chemical sector,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320596-pcma-urges-policy-overhaul-to-support-16bn-chemical-sector,"LAHORE: The Pakistan Chemical Manufacturers Association (PCMA) has expressed serious concerns over the Federal Budget 2025-26, calling for structural reforms and a forward-looking policy to support the $16 billion chemical sector -- a vital contributor to manufacturing industries including textiles, leather, plastics, pharmaceuticals, agriculture and packaging.
In an official statement, PCMA Chairperson Haroon Ali Khan welcomed positive budgetary steps such as the intent to revive large-scale manufacturing, addressing the misuse of tax incentives in Fata/Pata, and the elimination of additional customs duties (ACDs).
However, he criticised the absence of a coherent policy framework for the chemical industry.He noted that high energy costs, delayed GST refunds, excessive tax burdens on compliant businesses, unpredictable policy changes, and the misuse of export facilitation schemes continue to hinder the growth of domestic industries supplying raw materials to key export sectors such as textile and leather chemicals.
Haroon warned that the planned elimination of the 5th Schedule by 2030 could severely damage the local chemical industry.The association also voiced concern over the expanded discretionary powers granted to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Khan stressed the need for digital reforms and taxpayer facilitation before implementing coercive measures that may erode business confidence.
The PCMA further demanded the government declare the chemical sector ‘strategic’, granting it priority access to land and utilities, streamlining environmental and licensing approvals through a one-window operation, and supporting the sector through national R&D programmes.

"Transporters reject budget over tax hike, threaten nationwide strike",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320597-transporters-reject-budget-over-tax-hike-threaten-nationwide-strike,"KARACHI: Goods transporters have strongly rejected the federal budget following the hike in the withholding tax rate on the services sector, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the move. They have warned the government that a nationwide wheel-jam strike could be launched if their concerns are not addressed promptly.
An emergency meeting of goods transporters was held in Karachi, with representatives from transport associations across the country participating via Zoom. During the meeting, it was unanimously decided that a delegation would meet with the finance minister and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials to convey the serious challenges resulting from the increased tax burden.
Speaking at the meeting, transport leader Imdad Naqvi said: “We are already paying 4.0 per cent withholding tax, which is a significant burden on the transport community. Now the government has raised it by another 2.0 per cent in the budget, taking it to 6.0 per cent -- which is simply unbearable.” He warned that if the government does not withdraw the recent increase, the transport sector would be compelled to go on a wheel-jam strike. Such a move, he stressed, would not only harm the economy but also disrupt the nationwide supply of essential food items.
Transporters added that, during this period of economic hardship, they cannot absorb any further tax increases and urged the government to reconsider its decision. Failure to do so, they cautioned, could lead to a serious escalation of the crisis.

"Gold prices surge by Rs4,000 per tola",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320598-gold-prices-surge-by-rs4-000-per-tola,"KARACHI: Gold prices climbed sharply by Rs4,000 per tola in the local market on Thursday, driven by a rebound in international rates as global investors returned to the yellow metal amid economic uncertainties.
According to the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), local gold prices reached Rs356,900 per tola, up from Rs352,900 a day earlier. The price of 10-gram gold also surged by Rs3,430, bringing it to Rs305,984. In the international market, gold prices rose by $30, closing at $3,375 per ounce. The rally was attributed to renewed concerns over inflationary pressures in major economies and weak macroeconomic indicators from the US and Europe. As is typical, local gold prices in Pakistan were adjusted with a $20 premium over the global market price.
Traders noted increased demand in the local bullion market following the global uptick. “Whenever there is uncertainty in the global economic outlook, investors move towards gold as a safe-haven asset,” said a jeweller. “The international momentum directly influenced local buying activity today.”
Despite the rise in gold, silver prices remained unchanged. The APSGJA reported that silver held steady at Rs3,745 per tola, while the 10-gram silver rate also remained flat at Rs3,210.
Market watchers expect further fluctuations in gold prices in the coming days, depending on the global economic data and any updates regarding monetary policy decisions by major central banks.

Poland coach quits after Lewandowski boycott and World Cup qualifier loss,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320619-poland-coach-quits-after-lewandowski-boycott-and-world-cup-qualifier-loss,"Warsaw: Poland coach Michal Probierz, who had been feuding with star striker Robert Lewandowski, has resigned for “the good of the national team”, the country´s football federation said on Thursday.
“I have come to the conclusion that in the current situation the best decision for the good of the national team will be my resignation from the position of selector. Performing this function was the fulfilment of my professional dreams and the greatest honour in my life,” Probierz said in a statement from the Polish Football Federation (PZPN).
Lewandowski´s announcement on Sunday that he would boycott the team while Probierz remained coach was followed by a 2-1 loss at Finland that knocked Poland off the top of their European World Cup qualifying group.
The striker was not part of the Polish squad in the recent international window. According to Polish news agency PAP, the Barcelona player had asked to be excused to rest. Lewandowski was unhappy he had been stripped of the captain´s armband by Probierz.
“Taking into account the circumstances and a loss of trust in the coach, I have decided to resign from playing for the Poland national team for as long as he remains in charge,” Lewandowski wrote on social media.
“I hope I will still have another chance to play again for the best fans in the world,” he added. The 36-year-old Lewandowski made his Poland debut in 2008 and had been captain since 2014. He holds the Polish record for caps, with 158, and goals, with 85 -- 37 more than the country´s next highest scorer Wlodzimierz Lubanski.
Probierz had been coach since September 2023. He led Poland to the Euro 2024 finals where they failed to win a game and were eliminated in the group stage. In his 21 matches in charge he won nine, drew five and lost seven.
“Thank you, of course, to all the footballers I have had the pleasure of meeting along the way,” he wrote in the PZPN post. “I will keep my fingers crossed for all of you, because the national team is our common national asset.”

Mehidy Hasan Miraz to lead Bangladesh in ODIs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320620-mehidy-hasan-miraz-to-lead-bangladesh-in-odis,"DHAKA: Bangladesh on Thursday named Mehidy Hasan Miraz as the new captain of the ODI team, with the 27-year-old all-rounder succeeding Najmul Hossain Shanto in white ball cricket.
Off-spinner Miraz will take up his post during Bangladesh´s three-match ODI series in Sri Lanka, which begins in July, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said. “Captaining the national team is a dream come true... this is a proud moment for me and my family,” he said, according to a statement quoted by the International Cricket Council (ICC).
“I believe in this group -- we have the skills and the mindset to play fearless cricket.” Miraz, who has been skipper before for four ODIs as a stand in for Shanto, is ranked fourth in the world for ODI all-rounders, according to ICC rankings.
Bangladesh will also play two Tests in Sri Lanka, with the first beginning in Galle on June 17 and the second in Colombo from June 25. Miraz will be the vice-captain for the Tests -- with Shanto leading the team -- as the next World Test Championship cycle begins.

Real Madrid ‘only’ team I’d have left Liverpool for: Alexander-Arnold,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320621-real-madrid-only-team-i-d-have-left-liverpool-for-alexander-arnold,"MADRID: New Real Madrid signing Trent Alexander-Arnold said he joined the “only” team he would have considered leaving Liverpool for, at his presentation on Thursday.
Reds fans jeered Alexander-Arnold after the academy graduate revealed he would leave this summer, but eventually gave him a warm farewell on the last day of the Premier League season.
“It was never a question of where, it was whether to go or not to go,” the 26-year-old defender told a news conference. “I always knew... if I was to ever leave Liverpool, it would only be to go to Real Madrid, that would be the only club for me...
“I´m not going to say it was easy because I´d been there so long, been a part of it, but eventually, you have to make a decision. “In my mind, I´ve made the right one and it´s one that I´m very excited about.”
The right-back said the record 15-time European Cup winners´ history had to be “respected” and he wanted to add to it. “A big reason why I joined is to be a part of that amazing history that club´s got,” he said.
“Be a part of the success going forward, joining an exciting, young team with a lot of potential.” Alexander-Arnold, who moved for a fee even though his contract was expiring this summer, to speed up his arrival ahead of the Club World Cup, signed a deal until 2031. He joins former Liverpool midfielder and new Madrid coach Xabi Alonso´s project after winning a second Premier League title with Arne Slot´s Reds.

Verstappen seeks record fourth Canada win and trouble-free weekend,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320622-verstappen-seeks-record-fourth-canada-win-and-trouble-free-weekend,"Montreal: Max Verstappen will be seeking a record fourth consecutive Canadian Grand Prix triumph this weekend and a trouble-free race that helps him banish the threat of a suspension following his “rash” moment in Spain.
The four-time world champion goes into Sunday´s race knowing that, if he collects one more penalty point on his racing license, he will automatically miss the Austrian Grand Prix later this month.
That, according to his great mentor, Red Bull consultant Helmut Marko, “would be a catastrophe”. “He mustn´t do anything wrong over the next two weekends and, of course, he will be told not to do anything rash,” the Austrian told speedweek.com.
The 27-year-old, who lies third in the drivers´ championship with 137 points, behind leader Oscar Piastri on 186 and his McLaren team-mate Lando Norris on 176, was penalised at the Spanish Grand Prix for ramming into George Russell´s Mercedes.
“He admitted it was a deliberate action that “should not have happened” following the race, won with supreme self-control by Piastri, but now must survive two Grands Prix without incident before the points total on his license is reduced.
“Barcelona was disappointing for us,” admitted Verstappen. “Although we gave it everything, it was not the way we would have liked the race to turn out... “We are looking forward to Canada -- the track is unique, has some old school kerbs and plenty of opportunities for overtaking.” For Verstappen, the return to a high-speed circuit where brakes are tested to the limit may be welcome as he and Red Bull seek to slow runaway leaders McLaren in the title race.

New PFF leadership sets inclusive vision for game’s revival,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320623-new-pff-leadership-sets-inclusive-vision-for-game-s-revival,"LAHORE: With a decade of instability plagued the past of the game, the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF), under newly elected President Mohsen Gilani, is signaling a decisive move toward long-term reform and grassroots revival.
Joined by vice presidents Hafiz Zakaullah, Naveed Aslam Lodhi, and Dr. Muhammad Ali, the leadership has laid out a roadmap focused on collaboration, inclusivity, and national cohesion. In remarks following their assumption of office, Zakaullah stressed the importance of engaging players, coaches,
technical experts, and regional associations to rebuild Pakistan’s footballing structure from the ground up. “Progress won’t come from the top alone,” he emphasized. “We are determined to work inclusively and collaboratively to build a football structure that lasts.”
Acknowledging nearly a decade lost to administrative paralysis, the new leadership views this juncture as a reset—one centered on equal provincial representation and strategic reinvestment in underserved regions. The significant inclusion of Balochistan—with three executive and three congress members—reflects that commitment to equitable representation.

Pacers bounce back to down Thunder to take 2-1 NBA Finals lead,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320625-pacers-bounce-back-to-down-thunder-to-take-2-1-nba-finals-lead,"Los Angeles, United States: The Indiana Pacers, fueled by a near triple-double from Tyrese Haliburton, out-dueled the Oklahoma City Thunder 116-107 on Wednesday to take a 2-1 lead in the NBA Finals.
Haliburton scored 22 points with nine rebounds and 11 assists to spearhead a tremendous collective effort that included a career playoff high 27 points from reserve Bennedict Mathurin. The Pacers bench out-scored Oklahoma City´s reserves 49-18 and Indiana wore down NBA Most Valuable Player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, whose 24 points included just three in the fourth quarter.
“So many different guys chipped in,” Haliburton told broadcaster ABC. “Ben Mathurin was amazing off the bench tonight. He just stuck with it. We just had guys make plays after plays.”
Pascal Siakam scored 21 points for Indiana and TJ McConnell added 10 points and five steals off the bench to help the Pacers improve to 10-0 since March 11 in games immediately after a defeat.
They´ll try to stretch their lead in the best-of-seven championship series when they host game four on Friday before the series heads back to Oklahoma City for game five on Monday. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle lauded the contributions of Mathurin and McConnell.
“Those guys were tremendous,” Carlisle said. “T.J. just brought a will, competitive will, to the game. Mathurin jumped in there and immediately was aggressive and got the ball in the basket.
“This is the kind of team that we are,” Carlisle added. “It´s not always going to be exactly the same guys that are stepping up with scoring and stuff like that. But this is how we´ve got to do it, and we got to do it as a team.”
Added Mathurin: “The main thing is you have to be resilient. You have to be the aggressor in order to win games.” The Pacers, down by five going into the fourth quarter, took the lead for good on a three-pointer by Haliburton with 6:42 remaining.
Obi Toppin threw down a dunk that made it 107-100 then blocked a Jalen Williams layup as the Pacers gained control in a game that was close throughout. The Thunder struck early to quiet the enthusiastic crowd at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis, seizing a 15-6 lead in less than five minutes.
The Pacers closed within two points on a three-pointer from Haliburton but the Thunder responded and led by eight at the end of the first quarter.  Indiana fans, who haven´t seen their team in the Finals since the Pacers fell to the Lakers in the 2000 title series, weren´t disappointed for long as a second-half surge fueled by Indiana´s reserves saw the Pacers seize the lead.
McConnell made a pair of free-throws to put the Pacers up 37-36 and when Mathurin made a running layup to make it 46-42 Indiana had their biggest lead of the series. They stretched the lead to seven points only for Oklahoma City to tie it up at 51-51. It was knotted at 55-55 when Haliburton drilled a three-pointer and McConnell´s fadeaway jump shot sent Indiana into halftime with a 64-60 lead.
The back-and-forth battle continued in the third, Oklahoma City opening the second half on an 8-0 run, only for the Pacers to charge back. After five more lead changes the Thunder took an 89-84 lead into the final period, but they couldn´t bring it home.
Williams finished with 26 points and Chet Holmgren added 20 points and 10 rebounds for Oklahoma City, but the Thunder coughed up 19 turnovers leading to 21 Pacers points. “In the fourth quarter, I just thought they really outplayed us on both ends,” Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said afterwards.
“I thought they were in character in terms of their physicality, their pressure on defense. Then they were in character in terms of their pace on offense. They just stacked way more quality possessions in the fourth quarter than we did.”

World Test Championship final: Cummins rips through SA before Rabada strikes again,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320626-world-test-championship-final-cummins-rips-through-sa-before-rabada-strikes-again,"LONDON: Australia captain Pat Cummins produced a sensational spell of four wickets for just one run in the World Test Championship final before Kagiso Rabada struck twice to keep South Africa in the game on Thursday.
South Africa were bowled out for 138 in reply to Australia´s first innings total of 212 on the second day at Lord´s. Cummins finished with figures of 6-28 as he reached 300 career Test wickets.
South Africa lost their last five wickets for 12 runs, with a farcical run out not helping their cause, as Cummins ripped through the lower order on his way to a 14th five-wicket haul in 68 Tests and first at Lord´s.
Only South Africa captain Temba Bavuma (36) and David Bedingham (45) offered meaningful resistance during a fifth-wicket stand of 64. But fast bowler Rabada, who had taken an impressive 5-51 in the first innings on Wednesday, stuck twice in the 11th over of Australia´s second innings.
He had opener Usman Khawaja caught behind for six and, two balls later, he removed Cameron Green for a duck as Australia wobbled. Green´s exit meant the number three had faced just five balls in the match for a total of four runs.
At tea, Australia were 32-2 -- an overall lead of 106 -- with Marnus Labuschagne, in his first Test as an opener, 16 not out and Steve Smith unbeaten on four. The dominance of bowlers on both sides was reflected in a second session when the teams managed a combined total of just 49 runs for the loss of seven wickets between them.
After lunch, Australian skipper Cummins struck four times in just 17 balls of devastating pace bowling. South Africa had resumed on Thursday at 43-4, battling to put enough runs on the board.
Bavuma, who had 37 balls for his overnight three not out, changed gears as he struck a superb lofted cover-drive off left-arm quick Mitchell Starc for four and later pulled Cummins for a six.
Cummins had his revenge when Bavuma´s checked drive was brilliantly caught at cover by a diving Labuschagne. In the last over before lunch, Bedingham struck two fours off Beau Webster to take South Africa to 121-5.
Wickets tumbled early in the second session, with Cummins claiming two scalps in an over in the third over after lunch. Cummins had Kyle Verreynne lbw for 13 and, three balls later, he held a simple return catch as Marco Jansen fell for a duck, with South Africa reduced 126-7.
Cummins then had Bedingham caught behind by Alex Carey to end a 111-ball innings before Keshav Maharaj was needlessly run out. Cummins ended the innings with his 300th Test wicket, Rabada well caught low down at deep square leg by Webster.
The bowler received a standing ovation as he led his side off the field. That reception was a marked contrast to the boos that echoed round Lord´s two years ago after Cummins refused to withdraw an appeal following Alex Carey´s controversial stumping of Jonny Bairstow during an Ashes Test when the England batsman thought the ball was dead. His five-wicket haul on Thursday means Cummins will have a coveted place on the Lord´s honours board in he famous Pavilion.

Alonso’s new-look Real Madrid aiming for Club World Cup glory,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320627-alonso-s-new-look-real-madrid-aiming-for-club-world-cup-glory,"MADRID: After Real Madrid´s hopes of major silverware this season faded the Club World Cup took on far greater importance for them and it will provide an insight into new coach Xabi Alonso´s strategy.
The 43-year-old Spaniard, who replaced Carlo Ancelotti at the helm, along with new arrivals Trent Alexander-Arnold and Dean Huijsen add a fresh look to a team that emerged battered and bruised from a domestic season dominated by bitter rivals Barcelona.
Former Bayer Leverkusen coach Alonso may deploy his favoured 3-4-3 formation which would give England international Alexander-Arnold an important role on the right flank. Recent Spain debutant Huijsen also bolsters a back-line which has been badly hit by injuries this season.
Madrid still have several players sidelined, including Dani Carvajal, Eder Militao and Eduardo Camavinga, but some may be able to make their return during the tournament. Midfielder Jude Bellingham is expected to have shoulder surgery after Real´s participation ends which they hope is after they have been crowned champions.
Their title ambitions is why they paid a reported Â£10 million ($13.5 million) to sign Alexander-Arnold early, his Liverpool contract was due to end on June 30. In Group H Real Madrid´s campaign begins against Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal on June 18 in Miami, before facing Mexican outfit Pachuca in Charlotte on June 22.
Alonso´s team then face Austria´s RB Salzburg in Philadelphia on June 26 in their final group game. Al-Hilal may be a tougher proposition than many expect, having recently appointed Simone Inzaghi as coach after he guided Inter Milan to the Champions League final.
With a squad full of well-known names, including Aleksandar Mitrovic, Joao Cancelo and Kalidou Koulibaly, Al-Hilal will believe in their chances of causing an upset. Pachuca have former Newcastle striker Salomon Rondon leading the line but are seen as the weakest team in the group.
Madrid beat them 3-0 in the Intercontinental Cup last December, with Kylian Mbappe, Rodrygo Goes and Vinicius Junior all on target. Real also thrashed Salzburg 5-1 in January in the Champions League group phase, although the record 15-time winners were dumped out by Arsenal in the quarter-finals.

Wimbledon prize pot increases as players push for greater profit share,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320628-wimbledon-prize-pot-increases-as-players-push-for-greater-profit-share,"LONDON: Wimbledon prize money will increase by seven percent to a record pot of Â£53.5 million ($72.6 million) for this year´s championships as pressure grows from players for a greater slice of Grand Slam profits.
The winners of the men´s and women´s singles titles will each receive Â£3 million, an increase of more than 11 per cent on 2024, while a main draw spot is worth a minimum of Â£66,000, up 10 percent.
The All England Club´s announcement comes after growing player demands for a bigger share of revenue from the four majors. In April, 20 leading players sent a letter to the heads of the Grand Slams calling for greater contributions and discussions were held during the French Open.
All England Club chairwoman Debbie Jevans said at Wimbledon´s pre-tournament media briefing on Thursday the club was “absolutely committed to continuing our longstanding commitment to player compensation”.
“We´re immensely proud of the fact that if you look back 10 years, you can see the increase over that period (of 100 percent) and seven per cent this year,” she said. “We have listened to the players, we have engaged with the players. Of course we will always listen and discuss with them but the focus on just the prize money at four events, the Grand Slams, does not get to the heart of what the challenge is with tennis.
“The challenge with tennis is the fact that the players don´t have an off-season, which they want, they have increasing injuries that they´re speaking about and we´ve always said that we as Wimbledon are willing to engage and talk with the tours to try and find solutions and that door remains open.
“As yet, there hasn´t been any proposal to us as to how the tour is able to change its structure. “There´s a bigger picture here but, as a tennis player, they´re always going to, I think, ask for more money.”
In a major change at Wimbledon this year, line judges are being replaced by a live electronic calling system. The All England club follows the Australian Open and the US Open in implementing the change, though the French Open still uses human officials.

Usama Mir among new nominees for BBL draft,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320629-usama-mir-among-new-nominees-for-bbl-draft,"LAHORE: Cricket Australia has announced additional nominations for the upcoming W/BBL Player Draft, scheduled for June 19, adding more exciting talent to an already extensive pool of over 600 international cricketers.
Among the latest players to be nominated are England’s Laurie Evans, Pakistan’s Usama Mir and Mohammad Hasnain, India’s Yastika Bhatia and Afghanistan’s Waqar Salamkheil. These new additions further enhance the competitiveness of this year’s draft, with the full list of nominations expected to be revealed closer to the draft date.
Pakistan’s internationally capped leg-spinner Usama Mir is poised to continue his association with the Big Bash League (BBL) after being confirmed as one of the latest Pakistani entrants in this year’s draft. He joins a growing number of Pakistani players who are available for selection, with more names anticipated to be added to the list soon.
Despite a relatively quiet BBL campaign last season, where he took 11 wickets at an economy rate of 7.70 in 8 matches, Usama Mir remains a highly valued wrist-spinner with a proven track record in white-ball cricket. His significant advantage lies in his full availability for the entire season, including the finals, making him an attractive prospect for teams seeking diverse spin options, especially given the format’s increasing reliance on specialist bowlers capable of controlling the middle overs.
Usama Mir’s return to the Melbourne Stars, or his move to a new BBL franchise, will hinge on the league’s retention rules. The Stars have the option to retain him using a retention pick, but this can only be exercised if another team attempts to draft him in the same round.
Each BBL team is permitted one retention pick per draft, requiring strategic decision-making as picking a player earlier in a round forfeits that retention right.

Pakistan’s Akram praises his statue amid social media flak,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320630-pakistan-s-akram-praises-his-statue-amid-social-media-flak,"KARACHI: Legendary Pakistan cricketer Wasim Akram saluted on Thursday the “effort” of the artist who created a statue of him that has spawned scorn on social media.
The statue of Akram -- one of the greatest left-arm fast bowlers to play the game -- was installed outside the southwestern city of Hyderabad´s Niaz Stadium in April. Akram is shown bowling wearing the kit of the 1999 World Cup team, when Pakistan were runners-up.
Nearby is a statue of a tiger. One fan mocked the statue, saying: “The only thing that looks real is the ball,” adding the face looked more like Hollywood hero Sylvester Stallone. The affable Akram, however, took to social media to praise the effort.
“Lots of talk about my sculpture being erected at Niaz Stadium, Hyderabad. Mine is definitely better than the tiger,” he posted on X. “It´s the idea that matters. Credit to the creators, full marks for the effort and thanks to everyone involved.”
Australia has a history of placing statues of their iconic players outside their stadiums, while India unveiled one of master batter Sachin Tendulkar outside a stadium in Mumbai in 2023. Niaz stadium chief Shiraz Leghari told AFP: “The artist did his best effort, but accepts it doesn´t resemble (Akram) a hundred percent.”
Akram is one of the country´s most celebrated cricketers, having represented Pakistan in 104 Tests and 356 ODIs with 414 and 502 wickets respectively. He was the leading wicket-taker in the 1992 World Cup when Pakistan claimed the trophy.

Pakistan near finalising squad for coming tours,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320631-pakistan-near-finalising-squad-for-coming-tours,"LAHORE: As the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) nears toward finalising its squad for the upcoming white-ball tours of Bangladesh and the West Indies, several big names are set to miss out.
According to sources, a preliminary 25-player squad has been drawn up following consultations between the selection committee and head coach Mike Hesson and notably excludes Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afridi.
Babar has reportedly already been informed of his omission, while Rizwan and Shaheen’s T20I futures remain uncertain. The final squad announcement hinges on ongoing talks with Cricket West Indies (CWI) regarding a proposal to replace the three-match ODI series with T20Is, aligning with preparations for the Asia Cup 2025 and T20 World Cup 2026. Should the shift be approved, a joint T20I squad for both tours will be unveiled.
Sources add that players have been assured that future selection remains performance-based, and comebacks for experienced figures like Babar, Rizwan, and Shaheen are very much possible, depending on form in domestic and franchise leagues.

Sana Mir rings Lord’s bell,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320632-sana-mir-rings-lord-s-bell,"LAHORE: Former Pakistan women’s cricket team captain and recent ICC Hall of Fame inductee, Sana Mir, was accorded a distinguished honour on Thursday as she rang the iconic Lord’s bell, marking the official start of play on day two of the World Test Championship (WTC) final between Australia and South Africa.
The ceremonial bell ringing, a cherished tradition at the ‘Home of Cricket’ since 2007, is performed by a notable former player to signal the commencement of daily play in a Test match. Mir’s presence at the hallowed venue was met with warm applause from cricketers, officials, and spectators alike, symbolizing not only her personal cricketing excellence but also the growing recognition of women’s influence in the sport.
Just days after becoming the first Pakistani woman cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame, Mir’s latest honour at Lord’s further cemented her legacy. Her induction celebrated an outstanding career spanning nearly 15 years, during which she represented Pakistan in 226 matches and captained the side in over a hundred fixtures, establishing herself as a true trailblazer for women’s cricket in the country. She is only the 14th female cricketer globally and the eighth Pakistani overall to join this elite list, placing her alongside legends like Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, and Javed Miandad.

"PMYDP, Qalandars join hands to hunt sports talent",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320633-pmydp-qalandars-join-hands-to-hunt-sports-talent,"ISLAMABAD: The Prime Minister Youth Development Programme (PMYDP) has stepped up its efforts to spot talent. Lahore Qalandars have been selected to take the initiative on the cricket field, starting the talent hunt selection process from Balochistan.
Rana Mashhood Khan, the PM Advisor on Youth and Sports, during media talk at the PID Thursday, said that efforts were on to make real difference through the PM Youth Initiative Sports Programme.
“We have targeted 23 sports, and cricket is the first, as we have selected Qalandars to carry out the groundwork. Qalandars have won three of the last four PSL titles and are famous for their talent hunt programmes. They are selected ahead of the others to conduct trials and select the best talent for future Pakistan cricket.”
Mashhood said the programme was aimed at producing future Shaheen Afridi, Sana Mir and Haris Rauf. “We not only aimed at producing elite cricketers but also Olympic medalist -- future world beaters like Arshad Nadeem.”
The PM Advisor praised PSL X organisers for completing the task despite war threats. “We are a peaceful nation, but we know well how to protect our rights and defend our country by teaching a lesson to the aggressors.”
Shaheen Afridi, one of Pakistan’s most celebrated fast bowlers and a product of the Lahore Qalandars’ famed talent hunt programme, expressed high hopes for the initiative. “Over the past ten years, Qalandars have mastered the art of talent identification and development. I believe this programme will pave the way for Pakistan’s next generation of cricket legends.”
When asked about the national team’s recent inconsistency, Afridi remained optimistic: “These things take time. The team is evolving, and I am confident that better days are ahead. We have the potential, just need nurturing.”
Adding a global touch to their celebrations, Atif Rana, CEO of Qalandars, announced that the PSL trophy -- recently claimed by the franchise -- will be touring the UK and USA. “This is a moment of pride not just for us, but for all Pakistanis. We want to share our joy with the Pakistani diaspora across the world, showcasing our triumph and the talent that made it possible.”
With a powerful synergy between national vision and sports excellence, the PM Youth Sports Programme -- anchored by Lahore Qalandars -- promises to be a game-changing initiative that could redefine the future of Pakistani sports, inspire a new generation of athletes, and forge a legacy of global competitiveness.
Atif Rana highlighted the franchise’s decade-long commitment to grassroots development, describing the partnership with PMYP as a historic opportunity to expand their successful model nationwide.
The PMYP in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission has partnered with Qalandars to officially launch the Prime Minister’s Cricket Talent Hunt Programme -- a nationwide initiative aimed at identifying and nurturing the next generation of cricket stars.
The signing ceremony and the official launch were held at the PID Islamabad, in the presence of PMYP Chairman Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan, HEC Chairman Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed, Lahore Qalandars CEO Atif Rana, and team captain Shaheen Shah Afridi. The initiative marks a significant step forward in the government’s broader mission to promote youth inclusion in sports, alongside efforts in education, employment, and digital access.
Afridi’s brother, Riaz Afridi, will be looking after the selection process during the Talent Hunt Programme on the following dates: Balochistan: June 27-30.
Sindh: July 2 to 15.
Punjab: July 21 to August 11.
August 11, Azadi Day, will also be observed at the Pindi Stadium.
KPK: From August 29 onward.
Gilgit-Baltistan: September 1 to 14.

Migrants hid in wardrobes to flee N Ireland unrest: police,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320726-migrants-hid-in-wardrobes-to-flee-n-ireland-unrest-police,"BALLYMENA, United Kingdom: Foreign nationals hid in wardrobes and attics to escape a wave of unrest which has rocked a Northern Ireland town, police said on Thursday, calling for the protests to end and warning rioters they would face arrest.
“Stop this violence,” said Northern Ireland police chief Jon Boutcher. “We will come after you. We will arrest you. We will prosecute you successfully.” He was speaking after three nights of unrest in the town of Ballymena, some 48-kms northwest of Belfast.
The clashes erupted on Monday night after two teenagers were arrested for the alleged attempted rape of a young girl at the weekend. Police have not confirmed the ethnicity of the teenagers, who remain in custody and had asked for a Romanian interpreter in court.
After another barrage of petrol bombs, bricks and bottles, the crowds eventually dispersed late Wednesday without a repeat of the chaotic scenes seen on Monday and Tuesday when houses and businesses in areas where Romanian families live were torched. A total of 13 people have now been arrested, and 41 police officers injured, though most of the injuries are not severe.

French teenager charged with murder over school stabbing,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320727-french-teenager-charged-with-murder-over-school-stabbing,"NOGENT, France: A 14-year-old schoolboy was charged with the murder of a teaching assistant stabbed to death earlier this week, prosecutors said on Thursday, as schools across France held a minute of silence.
The secondary school pupil was arrested on Tuesday after allegedly stabbing to death a school monitor -- a 31-year-old mother of a young boy -- during a bag search in the eastern town of Nogent.
Quentin G. was charged with the “murder of a person in a position of authority”, which under French law is an aggravating circumstance, and was ordered to be held in custody. This latest school attack has caused widespread shock in France, with President Emmanuel Macron denouncing what he said was a rise in violence.

Panama urges US not to involve it in disputes with China,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320728-panama-urges-us-not-to-involve-it-in-disputes-with-china,"PANAMA CITY: Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday asked the United States to refrain from dragging the Central American country into its “geopolitical conflict” with China.
The appeal came after the US embassy in Panama City announced a project to replace communications tower equipment made by Chinese company Huawei with “secure US technology.” An embassy statement said on Wednesday that under President Donald Trump´s leadership, “the United States is working to counter China´s malign influence in our hemisphere, making the Americas stronger and safer.”
Mulino warned the diplomatic mission against trying “to draw Panama into a geopolitical conflict between China and the United States.” “Let them fight their problem in Washington or Beijing, but not in Panama´s backyard,” the right-wing leader said at his weekly news conference.
Tensions have flared between Panama and the United States in recent months, notably over Trump´s threats to “take back” the Panama Canal, which he alleges has come under Chinese influence.
Panamanian Security Minister Frank Abrego said that the telecommunications project at the centre of the latest spat had been in development for almost a decade. Panama installed several communication towers in 2017 in the eastern province of Darien using its own funds. The United States later offered to fund the $8 million project but asked to modify it because the equipment did not meet its military security requirements, Abrego said.

US senator forcibly removed from Trump official’s press conference,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320729-us-senator-forcibly-removed-from-trump-official-s-press-conference,"LOS ANGELES, United States: A US senator from California was forcibly removed after interrupting a news conference being held by the US homeland security chief on Thursday.
“I´m Senator Alex Padilla. I have questions for the secretary,” he said as two men pushed and shoved him from the room where Kristi Noem was speaking about controversial immigration arrests that have rocked America´s second-biggest city.
Footage of the incident showed security agents forcing the senator to the floor and handcuffing him.
Padilla, one of two Democratic senators representing California in the upper chamber of Congress, can be heard trying to ask Noem about the targeting of immigrants.
Response to the incident was rapid. California Governor Gavin Newsom said Padilla “is one of the most decent people I know.” “This is outrageous, dictatorial and shameful. Trump and his shock troops are out of control. This must end now,” he wrote on social media. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the episode “absolutely abhorrent and outrageous.” “He is a sitting United States Senator. This administration´s violent attacks on our city must end.”

"Disasters loom over South Asia with forecast of a hotter, wetter monsoon",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320730-disasters-loom-over-south-asia-with-forecast-of-a-hotter-wetter-monsoon,"KATHMANDU: Communities across Asia´s Himalayan Hindu Kush region face heightened disaster risks this monsoon season with temperatures and rainfall expected to exceed normal levels, experts warned on Thursday.
Temperatures are expected to be up to two degrees Celsius hotter than average across the region, with forecasts for above-average rains, according to a monsoon outlook released by Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) on Wednesday.
“Rising temperatures and more extreme rain raise the risk of water-induced disasters such as floods, landslides, and debris flows, and have longer-term impacts on glaciers, snow reserves, and permafrost,” Arun Bhakta Shrestha, a senior adviser at ICIMOD, said in a statement.
The summer monsoon, which brings South Asia 70-80 percent of its annual rainfall, is vital for agriculture and therefore for the livelihoods of millions of farmers and for food security in a region that is home to around two billion people.
However, it also brings destruction through landslides and floods every year. Melting glaciers add to the volume of water, while unregulated construction in flood-prone areas exacerbates the damage.

Air India disaster is first fatal Boeing 787 accident,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320731-air-india-disaster-is-first-fatal-boeing-787-accident,"NEW DELHI:  More than 200 people were killed when an Air India Boeing 787 bound for London with 242 people on board crashed minutes after taking off from India’s western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday.
Here are some details on the wide-body intercontinental jet: The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is one of the most advanced jets in service and experts say it has a generally strong safety record, with no previous fatal accidents. Boeing said it was aware of initial reports and working to gather more information.* The 787-8 aircraft involved in Thursday’s accident was delivered in 2014 and is the smallest of three variants.
* The 787-8 typically holds 248 passengers and the larger and longer-range 787-9 carries 296 people. The largest variant, the 787-10, which also has the smallest range, has 336 seats, according to Boeing data.
* The twin-engined 787 comes with a choice of two types of engine, supplied by GE Aerospace GE.N or Britain’s Rolls-Royce RR.L. The engines on the crashed plane were supplied by GE, which said it would support the investigation.
* Boeing has sold more than 2,500 787s, including 47 to Air India. It has delivered 1,189 jets to airlines or lessors, but has been beset in recent years by production delays, adding to a broader corporate crisis at America’s largest exporter.
* The 787 first flew in 2011 and entered service in the same year after development delays.
* Its creation marked a breakthrough in design, promising 20 per cent greater fuel efficiency through the use of durable, lightweight composite materials and more electrical systems.
* Its size, range and efficiency made it ideal for opening new routes, bypassing hubs served by jumbos such as the Boeing 747 and Airbus A380 and helping drive both jets out of production.
* Airbus followed suit by developing the A350 composite jet.
* The 787 also pioneered a new way of building planes, outsourcing much of the structure and components to companies around the world and assembling the pieces in Everett, Washington, and later North Charleston, South Carolina.
But the shake-up led to problems in the supply chain and Boeing later acknowledged it had gone too far with outsourcing.
Previous incidents :
* In July 2013, an empty Ethiopian Airlines 787 caught fire on the ground at Heathrow airport in London in an incident later linked to a short-circuit in an Emergency Locator Transmitter.
* Also in 2013, regulators temporarily grounded the global 787 fleet following the overheating of lithium batteries on two Japanese planes in Tokyo and Boston, resulting in design changes to better contain the risk of thermal runaway.
* In March last year, at least 50 people were hurt when a 787 operated by LATAM Airlines dropped abruptly in mid-flight from Sydney to Auckland. Investigators focused on an involuntary forward movement in the pilot seat.

Sri Lanka counts seven million crop-busting monkeys,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320733-sri-lanka-counts-seven-million-crop-busting-monkeys,"COLOMBO: Sri Lanka counted more than seven million monkeys during a census of crop-destroying wildlife, authorities said on Thursday, after a government minister called the figure “unbelievable”.
Agrarian Research and Training Institute (ARTI) Chief Executive A. L. Sandika said that the refined data was in line with a previous survey “a few years ago”, but did not elaborate. “Initially, we had some issues with the data on monkeys. We had to check again to arrive at the final result,” Sandika told reporters in Colombo.
Deputy Environment Minister Anton Jayakodi announced last week that the census conducted on 15 March -- the first of its kind -- had turned up “unbelievable” data that required verification.
Authorities suggested that some enraged farmers might have exaggerated the numbers to suggest that the problem was even bigger in the nation of 21 million people. Residents across the island were asked to count wild boar, peacocks, monkeys, and lorises-a small, largely nocturnal primate-spotted near farms and homes during a five-minute period.
The move was aimed at drawing up a national plan to deal with nuisance wildlife. Opposition legislator Nalin Bandara had said the survey was “a complete failure, a waste of money”. Officials say more than a third of crops are destroyed by wild animals, including elephants,which are protected by law because they are considered sacred.
While elephants are major raiders of rice farms and fruit plantations, but they were not included in the March count. The then-agricultural minister proposed in 2023 exporting some 100,000 macaques to Chinese zoos, but the plan was abandoned following protests from environmentalists.

Archaeologists find France’s deepest shipwreck,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320734-archaeologists-find-france-s-deepest-shipwreck,"NICE, France: Archaeologists have discovered what they say are the remains of a 16th-century merchant ship more than 2.5 kilometres underwater off southern France, the deepest such find in its section of the Mediterranean or any other French waters.
Archaeologists believe the ship was sailing from northern Italy loaded with ceramics and metal bars before it sunk. Despite a little modern household waste dotting its sunken cargo at 2,567 metres below sea level, they were excited about the potential of an archaeological site largely preserved intact.
“It´s the deepest shipwreck ever found in French territorial waters,” Arnaud Schaumasse, the head of the culture ministry´s underwater archaeology department, said late on Wednesday. An underwater drone stumbled upon the sunken ship by chance in early March in waters near Saint-Tropez in southeastern France, deputy maritime prefect Thierry de la Burgade said.
“The sonar detected something quite big, so we went back with the device´s camera, then against with an underwater robot to snap high-quality images,” he said. The drone was patrolling the seabed as part of a government project to explore and monitor France´s deep-sea resources, from minerals to deep-sea internet cables.
Archaeologist Marine Sadania said experts discovered 200 jugs with pinched spouts among the wreckage at the site they have dubbed “Camarat 4”. Some of these jugs were marked with the monogram “IHS”, the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus, or covered with plant-inspired or geometric patterns.

Spanish PM says knew ‘nothing’ about corruption case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320735-spanish-pm-says-knew-nothing-about-corruption-case,"MADRID: Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Thursday said that he knew “absolutely nothing” about the corruption case that prompted a top official in his Socialist Party to resign, and rejected calls for his resignation over the affair.
The case adds to mounting legal and political pressure on Sanchez, one of Europe´s longest serving socialist leaders whose inner circle faces several ongoing investigations. Santos Cerdan, the party´s organisation secretary and its third-highest ranked figure, is suspected of being an accomplice in the alleged improper awarding of public contracts, according to a newly published judicial report.
Cerdan, a member of parliament, stepped down from all his positions “to defend” the government and the party, adding in a statement that he “never committed any illegal act”. Shortly afterwards, Sanchez told a news conference he knew “absolutely nothing” about the corruption accusations against his longtime associate, having learned about them in the press earlier on Thursday. “We never should have trusted him,” the premier said, adding that he had demanded that Cerdan step down.

Saudi Crown Prince MBS will not attend G7 Summit in Canada,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320736-saudi-crown-prince-mbs-will-not-attend-g7-summit-in-canada,"DUBAI: Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto leader, will not attend next week’s Group of Seven summit in Canada, a senior diplomat briefed on plans told Reuters on Thursday.
The crown prince, widely known as MBS, did not give a reason for declining Canada’s invitation to the annual gathering, the diplomat said. Saudi Arabia is not a G7 member but can be invited as a guest to its annual gathering, which will be held this year in Kananaskis in the Canadian Rockies, from June 15-17.
MBS has rarely travelled internationally in recent years, and declined an invitation to the G7 Summit in Italy last year. He postponed a planned trip to Japan last year, citing concerns over the health of his father, King Salman.
Saudi Arabia’s government media office did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. Canada’s Globe and Mail newspaper, which first reported that MBS would not join this year’s gathering, said the development may ease tensions within Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberal party, where some members of parliament were upset that an invitation had been extended to MBS.
Leaders from Ukraine, Mexico, India, Australia, South Africa, South Korea and Brazil are expected to join for parts of the G7 Summit. US President Donald Trump will also be in attendance.

Russia covertly targeted Africans with AI-generated posts: France,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320737-russia-covertly-targeted-africans-with-ai-generated-posts-france,"PARIS: A clandestine pro-Russian online operation targeted French speakers in Africa with “deceptive” AI-generated posts in a campaign likely directed by Moscow, a French government agency said on Thursday. Moscow has sought to expand its influence in Africa in recent years, including in former French colonies, with campaigns using grass-roots activists and social media. The Wagner group played a key role but Moscow has apparently moved to centralise control of information operations since the group was disbanded and reorganised following the death of its leader Yevgeny Prigozhin in a 2023 plane crash.

Bangladesh Yunus declines to meet Tulip Siddiq,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320738-bangladesh-yunus-declines-to-meet-tulip-siddiq,"DHAKA: Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus has refused to meet Labour MP Tulip Siddiq to discuss corruption allegations against her during his visit to London.
Yunus told the BBC the allegations were a “court matter” and said he had confidence in Bangladesh’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), which is investigating Siddiq.The ACC has accused Siddiq of illegally receiving land from the regime of her aunt Sheikh Hasina, who was ousted as Bangladesh’s prime minister last year.
In a letter, Siddiq requested a meeting with Yunus, a Nobel-prize winning economist who has led an interim government in Bangladesh since a student-led protest movement toppled Hasina from power.
Siddiq said a meeting “might also help clear up the misunderstanding perpetuated by the Anti-Corruption Commission in Dhaka”.In an interview with the BBC, Yunus was asked whether he would meet Siddiq during his four-day visit to the UK this week.“No I’m not because it’s a legal procedure,” Yunus said. “I don’t want to interrupt a legal procedure. Let the procedure continue.”

Biden-appointed US ambassador to leave Russia ‘soon’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320739-biden-appointed-us-ambassador-to-leave-russia-soon,"MOSCOW: The US ambassador to Russia, Lynne Tracy, who was appointed by ex-president Joe Biden, will end her mission “soon” after around two years in the country, the US embassy in Moscow said on Thursday.
President Donald Trump has ushered in a rapprochement with Russia, speaking regularly to Russian leader Vladimir Putin in a sharp break from Biden´s attempts to isolate the Kremlin chief.
Diplomats from the two countries have also held several rounds of negotiations, including on boosting the work of their respective embassies. In a post on social media, the US embassy in Moscow said Tracy “will soon conclude her mission at the US Embassy in the Russian Federation.” It did not say exactly when she would leave, but said it would broadcast online a farewell ceremony on Friday afternoon.

"Ukraine, Russia say exchanged new group of POWs",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1320740-ukraine-russia-say-exchanged-new-group-of-pows,"CHERNIGIV, REGION, Ukraine: Ukraine and Russia said on Thursday they had swapped a fresh group of prisoners of war, the third exchange this week as part of a deal agreed at peace talks in Turkiye.
In Istanbul last week the two sides agreed to each free more than 1,000 prisoners of war -- all wounded or under the age of 25 -- and return the bodies of killed fighters.
“Today, warriors of our Armed Forces, National Guard, and Border Guard Service are back home,” Ukraine´s President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media. “They all require medical treatment,” as they were “severely wounded and seriously ill,” he added. Russia´s defence ministry also confirmed the swap, saying in a Telegram post that “a group of Russian servicemen was returned” from Ukraine.
