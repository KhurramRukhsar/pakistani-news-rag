PA passes multiple resolutions amid quorum crisis,"US
The House expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and Iran
The Punjab Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution urging the international community to take immediate steps to end Israel's aggression against Palestine and Iran, drawing parallels with its past role in facilitating ceasefires between Pakistan and India.
The resolution, presented by Pakistan Muslim League-Nawas (PML-N) lawmaker Khawaja Salman Rafique, called on the federal government to mobilize its diplomatic channels to convene an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) aimed at halting Israel's actions and condemning its aggression.
The House expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and Iran and offered prayers for those killed in the recent Iranian attacks, including military leaders Major General Muhammad Baqeri, Major General Hussain Salami, six nuclear scientists, and others.
In another unanimous move, the PA approved a resolution on ineffective tree plantation efforts.
Proposed by Treasury MPA Mansab Ali Dogar, the resolution recommended allocating funds to farmers for targeted plantation based on land and environmental suitability to counter climate change.
Separately, PML-N MPA Imran Javed raised the issue of biogas access, claiming that while milkmen provide buffalo dung for gas production, local communities have not received any gas.
Parliamentary Secretary for Energy Mansoor Azam responded that supply would begin once production capacity improves.
Tensions flared during the session when Opposition MPA Sardar Muhammad Ali Khan objected to the lack of consideration for his resolution on wheat prices, prompting a verbal exchange with PML-N's Rana Muhammad Arshad.

Warholm breaks hurdles world record,"US
The Norwegian ensured hurdles rivalry remains centre stage before Tokyo worlds
Karsten Warholm has ensured his hurdling rivalry with Rai Benjamin and Alison Dos Santos will remain centre stage this season, which culminates with the world championships in Tokyo in September.
Warholm streaked to 32.67 seconds in the 300m hurdles at the Diamond League meet Thursday on his home track at Oslo's Bislett Stadium. It was the fastest time ever clocked over the rarely-run event that has recently been given official status by World Athletics, albeit still without a ratified world record.
The 29-year-old Norwegian's victory over American Benjamin — who succeeded him as Olympic champion in Paris last year — and Dos Santos of Brazil certainly caught the attention of a partisan 15,000 sell-out crowd.
The starting eight racers were introduced over the stadium tannoy to a hushed silence from knowledgeable spectators appreciating the build-up to the last event of a heady evening's fill of track and field.
That stillness was rudely interrupted by the sudden clacking of folding plastic seats clicking upwards as the fans rose to their feet in unison just seconds before starter's orders.
""On your marks. Set,"" and then the gun, the crowd erupting into an ear-shattering crescendo of cheers for their local hero.
Warholm did not disappoint, although he had to work his way back into the race down the home straight as Benjamin threatened to pull away but eventually faltered after clipping the seventh and final hurdle.
""The race went well although I was rather worried with how much Rai was closing on me,"" said Warholm, the reigning world champion and world record holder in the 400m hurdles.
""But I knew I could push on over the last hurdle to home. I usually fade at the end of the 400 so the 300 suits me to some degree.""
Benjamin came in second in 33.22sec, with 2022 world champion Dos Santos rounding out the podium (33.38) in what was the first time the trio had all met in this discipline. They now move on to the 400m hurdles at Sunday's Diamond League meeting in Stockholm.
Warholm said he had been practising over 200m in a bid to sharpen up.
""I was very clean over the hurdles,"" he said.
""The crowd was amazing as ever and the atmosphere was something else and I am just so happy that I could perform at my best in front of the support. It means a lot to me.
""There were some top stars here which is great for Bislett and it was lovely to catch up with Usain (Bolt) and tomorrow we will have lunch and chat properly.""
After Warholm had streaked through the finish line, ripping his top off in delight with a roar, he was enveloped by the Jamaican sprint legend and swarms of children in chaotic scenes, Bolt making his first appearance in Oslo since he retired in 2017.
Warholm kick started the transformation of the world of hurdling when he set a new world record when winning gold at the Covid-delayed 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
The three podium finishers in Oslo then proceeded to redefine the gruelling event.
Until Warholm broke the world record in 2021, nobody had run the 400m hurdles faster than American Kevin Young in three decades.
Four years on, Young's once unbeatable 46.78 is only the 19th-fastest time in history. In the years since, Warholm, Benjamin and Dos Santos have pushed each other to ever greater heights, sharing out the global accolades between them.
Benjamin said he was happy with his 300m hurdles debut.
""I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I'm fairly pleased with how I performed. This is my first race since the Olympics in Paris last August so I can't expect too much right now,"" the American said.
""I want the gold medal in Tokyo at the world championships in September, but it's very early days for me so I have to get back into training and keep on chopping that wood.
""This here in Oslo was such a great opportunity and I'm glad they set that race up for us, it was special having the three of us face off tonight, it's good for the sport and also for our development.""
Dos Santos added: ""We want to do something great and I am just happy to be among the best.""

Probe begins into RDA scam,"US
Panel raises concerns over civic agency's flawed financial management system
A fact-finding committee, constituted by the Punjab Chief Secretary to probe a major financial scandal involving the embezzlement of Rs1.94 billion in public funds and alleged negligence and carelessness by the authorities holding financial signatory powers at the Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA), has officially launched its investigation.
During its first meeting held in Lahore, the committee raised several concerns regarding RDA's flawed financial management system, demanding complete records of the RDA's bank accounts and the transfer of funds through Call Deposit Receipts (CDRs) to other banks.
The next meeting is expected to be held on June 19, during which all Directors of Administration and Finance from the past nine years have been summoned. The decision regarding summoning former Director Generals will be made later.
The matter is already under investigation by two separate forums: the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Punjab Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE), Rawalpindi Region. Simultaneously, the fact-finding committee formed by the Punjab Chief Secretary convened at the office of Mudassar Waheed Malik, Member Taxes, Board of Revenue Punjab, who is also the convener of the inquiry. Other members present included Moazzam Iqbal Supra, MD of the Punjab Government Servants Housing Foundation, and Madiha Tahir Shah, Additional Secretary A&H.
From the RDA, Director-General Kinza Murtaza, Deputy Director Iftikhar Janjua, and Assistant Director Waqar Asghar Raja appeared before the committee.
Ex-DD' death sparks concern
The committee also reviewed the recent mysterious death — possibly a suicide or murder — of Junaid Taj Bhatti, the former Deputy Director Finance of RDA and former DG of PHA Sialkot. Bhatti died under suspicious circumstances in his Sialkot office on May 13. His death has added further complexity to the scandal.
The fact-finding meeting lasted about an hour. The issues raised and the requested records will be thoroughly examined in the upcoming session scheduled for Thursday, June 19, in Lahore.
Systemic oversight, audit failures
This is considered the biggest financial scandal in RDA's history, spanning nearly a decade. Despite the fact that RDA accounts were audited regularly each year, the massive embezzlement went unnoticed.
Shockingly, none of the authorised financial officers, including Director Generals and Directors of Administration and Finance, ever requested or reviewed the bank statements to track fund transfersan act that could have exposed the issue much earlier and led to the establishment of a more secure financial system.
During this period, the Divisional Commissioners of Rawalpindi also served as acting DGs of RDA, including the current Secretary Housing Punjab. Several officers from the DMG groupsome of whom are now retired or serving in other high-ranking positionsalso held the RDA DG post during this time.
Contractors' payments suspended
Contractors and their families faced hardships during the Eidul Azha holidays as no payments were made for the past month or so.
Routine operations at the RDA have been severely disrupted following the exposure of a financial scandal in government funds about a month ago. Since the scandal emerged, all payments to contractors have been suspended.
When contacted through the RDA spokesperson, Director General Kinza Murtaza said that payments would be made to the contractors soon. However, no explanation was provided as to why payments had been delayed so far or why the contractors had been left in distress.

""Lawyers are not legislators, our mandate is to defend the constitutional structure not to hold protest marches against legislation,"" Gilani said. Two parliamentarians from your party, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Senator Ali Zafar, were present during its [26th Amendment] passage.""
He further said that IHCBA would convene a Jurist Conference for an open debate on the advantages and disadvantages of the 26th Amendment, adding that eminent jurists from all political parties would be invited. ""You should nominate two jurists from your party to participate in the Jurist Conference.""

The PMD said that a fresh system of westerly winds was likely to enter the upper parts of Pakistan from Friday, bringing rain accompanied by gusty winds and thunderstorms, which would continue intermittently until June 16.
The rain is expected in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mianwali, and Sargodha. The forecast further extends to central Punjab, where cities like Lahore, Faisalabad, Jhang, and Toba Tek Singh may experience scattered rainfall over the next few days.
In upper Sindh, all districts are expected to receive thunderstorm-related rainfall, bringing much-needed relief from the extreme temperatures that have gripped the region, the PMD said, advising citizens to take necessary precautions in areas prone to urban flooding or strong winds.

PSX tumbles on heightened Mideast tensions,"US
KSE-100 drops 1,950 points, driven by risk-off sentiment
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a significant downturn on Friday as the KSE-100 index plunged nearly 2,000 points over rising geopolitical tensions following Israeli military strikes on Iran.
The broad-based sell-off reflected heightened investor anxiety as fears of regional escalation dampened sentiment across global and local markets. Heavyweight sectors such as fertiliser, cement, banking and technology suffered steep losses with blue chips bearing the brunt. Market participants shifted to a risk-off mode, offloading positions in response to the global uncertainty and Pakistani rupee weakness.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti observed that stocks fell across the board after Israeli strikes on Iran and as investors eyed an escalation in the conflict. Additionally, a slump in global equities on geopolitical risks and the weakening rupee also contributed to panic selling, he said.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a substantial fall of 1,949.56 points, or 1.57%, and settled at 122,143.57.
Topline Securities wrote in its review that stocks largely traded in the negative zone, which was in line with international and regional trends, following Israel's attack on Iran.
Top negative contribution to the index came from fertiliser, cement, bank and oil stocks. In terms of traded value, DG Khan Cement ($6.4 million), Maple Leaf Cement ($5.92 million), Lucky Cement ($4 million), OGDC ($3.72 million), Pakistan State Oil ($3.65 million) and Mari Petroleum ($3.15 million) dominated trading activity, Topline said.
KTrade Securities stated that the KSE-100 index ended the session in the negative territory, pressured by escalating geopolitical tensions in the region, particularly between Iran and Israel.
Despite that, market activity remained robust, with trading volumes exceeding 966 million shares. Sideboard stocks were the most actively traded, which included Pervez Ahmed Consultancy (116 million shares), WorldCall Telecom (100 million) and First Capital Securities (85 million).
Notable declines were recorded in Engro Corporation, Lucky Cement, Fauji Fertiliser, Bank AL Habib and Systems Limited. In light of prevailing regional uncertainties, KTrade advised investors to maintain a cautious approach in the near term.
Arif Habib Limited (AHL) Deputy Head of Trading Ali Najib mentioned that the market witnessed a sharp correction as it reacted to heightened geopolitical tensions following Israeli strikes on military and nuclear facilities inside Iran.
The benchmark index opened in the red and quickly extended losses, hitting the intra-day low of 121,605 points, down 2,489 points, amid broad-based selling pressure. Heavyweight blue-chip stocks in fertiliser, cement, banking and technology sectors bore the brunt of the sell-off, Najib added.
According to JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala, the market opened on a negative note in line with regional equities and it experienced a highly volatile session. Sentiment received a blow from escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, fuelling investor caution.
The index touched the low of 121,605 and closed at 122,144, down 1,950 points. Volatility persisted throughout the day amid uncertain global cues. He advised investors to adopt a cautious stance and avoid aggressive positions in the near term with focus on risk management and tracking geopolitical developments.
Overall trading volumes decreased to 968.3 million shares compared with Thursday's tally of 1.02 billion. The value of shares traded was Rs29.6 billion. Shares of 469 companies were traded. Of these, 130 stocks closed higher, 304 fell and 35 remained unchanged.
Pervez Ahmed Consultancy was the volume leader with trading in 116.7 million shares, rising Rs1 to close at Rs2.93. It was followed by WorldCall Telecom with 100.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.08 to close at Rs1.45 and First Capital Securities with 85.3 million shares, higher by Rs0.94 to close at Rs3.06. Foreign investors bought shares worth Rs179 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

Israel vs Iran,"US
.
The inevitable is in the making and Iran is an existential crisis after Israel's dare-devil aggression. Tel Aviv has struck hard and precisely targeted Iran's military and nuclear facilities, besides eliminating its top army leadership, including the Revolutionary Guards chief and six nuclear scientists.
Natanz, the uranium enrichment site near Tehran, was the major target as the Jewish state went on to strike missile installations across the country, amidst reports of taking down Tabriz airbase. Shockingly muted is the response from the Islamic Republic which appears seeking refuge in diplomacy by seeking UNSC intervention and reiterating its right to self-defence under the UN Charter. The sole response it came up with was flying more than 100 drones on the Zionist state that Israel claims were checkmated.
The trajectory of destruction is horrible, as civilian casualties have already run into hundreds. Israeli security sources claim Mossad has permeated deep inside the clergy regime through covert operations, and complicity from Iranian black sheep cannot be ruled out. While Supreme Leader Syed Ali Khamenei is still posturing defiance and has nominated new military leadership to fight on, there seems to be confusion in strategic pushback that should have come in instant retaliation.
Coupled with this is the euphoria exhibited by President Donald Trump who went on to warn more ""death and destruction"", calling upon Tehran to enter into a ""deal under a second chance"". The failure to strike a deal in 60 days, despite the first round of feasible talks between Iran and the US over enrichment profile, had led to the D-day, and confirms the calculated indispensability of taking down Iran by the US-Israel combine.
Benjamin Netanyahu's thrust that this is a ""prolonged operation"" will surely galvanise widespread geopolitical ramifications. The tit-for-tat alignment with Iran is yet to showcase, and the role of subdued pro-Iran proxies, as well as Russia and China, must be watched out. Israel has crossed the red line by attacking Iran. Now the region and beyond must be braced for escalation.

Blacklisted firm declared eligible for NGC tender,"US
Incident raises question mark on the transparency in the NGC tender process
The National Grid Company (NGC) has declared a blacklisted firm eligible to participate in a tender for a 135-kilometre transmission line project.
According to details, NGC issued a tender for laying a 135-km transmission line. Four companies were declared eligible after a technical evaluation.
A company previously blacklisted by the Asian Development Bank for indulging in fraudulent practice and furnishing fake documents was also declared eligible after the technical evaluation. Interestingly, a blacklisted firm cannot be declared eligible for participating in any tender.
In a letter sent to NGC managing director, a Saudi investment company said the firm came to Pakistan for making investment over the invitation of the government but the blacklisted company was declared eligible, which amounts to irregularity.
The incident raised the question mark on the transparency in the NGC tender process.
The Saudi company demanded that investigation be conducted into the matter for restoring the confidence of foreign investors.
Sources said some NGC officials are changing rules to declare the blacklisted company eligible. When Express News contacted NTDC MD Engineer Shahid Nazeer over the matter, he said the letter of Saudi company was forwarded to procurement and contract management department.

Bilawal warns of water war risk,"US
Pakistan urges global intervention as Indus Waters Treaty faces collapse
The head of the Pakistan parliamentary delegation and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari called on the international community Friday to engage with India and emphasise that military confrontation was not a solution to the Kashmir dispute or terrorism, stressing that dialogue was the only way forward.
Speaking to the European think tanks and international media representatives in Brussels, Bilawal warned that India's aggressive posture, including threats to revoke the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), could escalate tensions to dangerous levels.
""We are here to present Pakistan's stance on recent tensions with India and expose New Delhi's anti-Pakistan agenda,"" he said.
He emphasised that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be resolved in line with United Nations Security Council resolutions.
Bilawal criticised India's ""new abnormal"" policy of blaming Pakistan for any terrorist attack in India or Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir without evidence, leading to immediate threats of war.
He recalled that Pakistan had proposed an impartial international investigation into the recent Pahalgam incident, but India rejected the offer. He condemned India's suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, calling it a violation of international law and a ""war crime"" that threatens water access for 240 million Pakistanis. ""If India weaponises water, we may have no choice but to retaliate, risking a full-blown water war,"" he warned.
Bilawal reiterated that Pakistan had shown restraint, offered dialogue, and adhered to international law, urging the same standards be applied in South Asia as in Europe. ""If the world ignores this crisis, it could become a nuclear flashpoint,"" he cautioned.
On the Pahalgam attack, Bilawal stated that India had failed to provide evidence linking Pakistan to the incident. ""To this day, India hasn't revealed the identities of the attackers or how they crossed the heavily militarised border,"" he said.

Melting poles,"US
.
The recent revelation that Greenland's ice sheet melted 17 times faster than average during May's Arctic heatwave is a reminder of the global nature of the climate change crisis. Thousands of miles away in Pakistan, we were also seeing record temperatures, as the mercury crossed 50 degrees Celsius in several cities. In Iceland, which is also in the subarctic region, temperatures hit a record 26 degrees Celsius in mid-May.
While that may not seem like much without context, it is almost twice the average daily temperature for the same month in previous years and enough of an extreme to have a catastrophic impact on flora and fauna. Even slight shifts can have dramatic environmental and human consequences, as we have become all too familiar over the past several years.
Underscoring how these events do not occur in a vacuum, the massive amounts of meltwater being released by Greenland will directly contribute to rising sea levels, which is a serious problem for Pakistan. Cities along the low-lying coastal belt, including Karachi and Gwadar, are already facing inundation. Saltwater intrusion has already swallowed 4.3 million acres of land in Sindh, displacing over 1 million people.
In Gwadar, homes now flood from groundwater seepage, turning courtyards into saline swamps. Coastal fishermen in all areas are also feeling the pinch due to changing fish behaviours. Meanwhile, the government's revenue-generating moves have caused quiet consternation because of the additional pressure it puts on many families.
Pakistan emits less than 1% of global greenhouse gases but ranks among the top 10 climate-vulnerable nations. Meanwhile, the US, China, Russia and Germany historically contributed over 50% of carbon dioxide emissions. Arctic melting — driven primarily by industrialised nations — exposes this brutal asymmetry. Those least responsible drown first.

King Tut treasures to be moved to Grand Egyptian Museum,"US
They will leave Cairo Museum after 100 years
After nearly a century in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, King Tutankhamun's iconic gold mask and remaining treasures are set to move to the new Grand Egyptian Museum near the Giza Pyramids, as reported by AFP.
The boy king's world-famous gold funerary mask will join more than 5,000 artefacts from his tomb at the GEM, a $1-billion megaproject opening on July 3.
""Only 26 objects from the Tutankhamun collection, including the golden mask and two coffins, remain here in Tahrir,"" said museum director Ali Abdel Halim.
""All are set to be moved soon,"" he told AFP, without confirming a specific date for the transfer or plan of relocation.
Still on display are the innermost gold coffin, a gilded coffin, a gold dagger, cosmetic box, miniature coffins, royal diadem and pectorals.
Tutankhamun's treasures, registered at the Egyptian Museum on Cairo's Tahrir square in 1934, have long been its crown jewels.
But the neoclassical building — with faded cases, no climate control and ageing infrastructure — now contrasts with the high-tech GEM.
Once open, the GEM is believed to be the largest in the world devoted to a single civilisation, housing more than 100,000 artefacts – with over half on public display.
In a dedicated wing, most of King Tut's treasures will be exhibited together for the first time in history since British archeologist Howard Carter discovered the young pharaoh's intact tomb in 1922.
His mummy will remain in its original resting place in Luxor's Valley of the Kings as it is ""a vital part of the archeological site"", Egyptian officials have said.
A virtual replica, however, will be displayed at the GEM using virtual reality technology.
The Egyptian Museum in Tahrir, long the historic heart of Egyptology, has lost in 2021 other star exhibits: 22 royal mummies including Ramses II and Queen Hatshepsut that were relocated in a widely watched state procession to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Old Cairo.
Still, it is home to around 170,000 artefacts, according to the museum director, including treasures from Yuya and Thuya — Tutankhamun's ancestors — and items from ancient Tanis, such as the golden funerary mask of King Amenemope.
A total of 32,000 artefacts have already been relocated from storage and display halls at the Tahrir museum to the GEM.
The museum's director said the space left behind will eventually be filled by a new exhibition ""on par with the significance of Tut's treasures"".

7 convicted in UK's latest 'grooming' scandal,"US
.
Seven men who sexually exploited two vulnerable girls in northern England were convicted on Friday in the latest trial over a decades-old ""grooming gangs"" scandal,
The Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the men were convicted after a trial involving a total of 50 offences, including rape and indecency with a child, which occurred between 2001 and 2006.
Prosecutor Rossano Scamardella told jurors at the start of the trial at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court that the group's two victims were ""passed around for sex, abused, degraded and then discarded"".
Scarmardella also said the two girls were known to social services and that it was ""no secret"" they were having sex with older South Asian men such as the defendants.
The men had all denied the charges, but were unanimously convicted by the jury after three weeks of deliberations.

Iran's missiles rain down on Israel,"US
Israel targets Iran's nuclear facilities, military leadership; 78 Iranians killed, 34 Israelis injured
Iran fired a barrage of ballistic missiles at Israel in a counter-strike on Friday after an unprecedented onslaught hammered the country's top military brass and targeted its nuclear facilities and bases, killing top generals and nuclear scientists.
Iranian officials confirmed the death of 78 people, including top military generals and senior scientists and injuries to more than 320 others in strikes which began early in the morning, and continued throughout the day. Media reports said 34 people were wounded in Israel in the Iranian missiles salvo.
Air raids sirens and explosions rang out across Israel after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to the airways to issue a word of caution, saying he expected ""several waves of Iranian attacks"" in response to his country's strikes.
Iran's Revolutionary Guard said it attacked dozens of targets in Israel. The salvo came hours after Israel said its wide-spread air raids had hit about 200 targets, including nuclear facilities and killed several top-ranking Iranian generals.
""Iran comes under attack,"" said Iran's state-run IRNA news agency. ""Various locations in Iran, including in the capital, Tehran, have come under attack by the Israeli regime, and a number of top military commanders have been assassinated in targeted strikes,"" it said, terming the strikes a major escalation.
Iranians woke up to the sounds of large explosions in and near Tehran. In the first round of strikes, IRNA said the Israeli regime targeted residential buildings in Tehran in the wee hours of the day as people were asleep in their homes.
Images quickly emerged of the capital's skyline, showing plumes of smoke rising from several locations. At least one image showed the lifeless body of a child under the rubble in a Tehran neighbourhood in the immediate aftermath of the strikes.
IRNA said Major General Mohammad Baqeri, chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of Iran's Armed Forces and Major General Hossein Salami, chief commander of the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) were assassinated in targeted strikes against Iran's top military brass in Tehran.
It further said that Commander of the Aerospace Force of the IRGC Brigadier General Amirali Hajizadeh and Commander of Khatam al-Anbia Headquarters Major General Gholamali Rashid were also among the dead. All of them were veterans of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War.
Unconfirmed reports said Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei and a former secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, had also been severely wounded in a targeted strike.
A number of top nuclear scientists were also targeted. Mohammad-Mehdi Tehranchi, president of the Islamic Azad University, and Fereydoun Abbasi, former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, were among the dead. Tehranchi and Abbasi were reportedly targeted at their homes in the capital.
Khamenei immediacy appointed new top military commanders. He appointed Major General Pakpour to head the IRGC, who promised to open gates of hell to the Israeli regime.
Several rounds of strikes targeted Iran's Natanz nuclear plant in Bushehr. A spokesperson for the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran said that preliminary assessment had revealed only limited damage. Israel began rounds of strikes in and near Tehran, as well as Natanz, Tabriz, Isfahan, Arak, and Shiraz.
Khamenei issued a message to the nation shortly after the strikes began. ""To the Great Iranian Nation!"" the message said, ""with this crime, the Zionist regime sealed for itself a bitter and painful destiny and will definitely see that [destiny] brought upon it"".
As the night fell, Iran launched retaliatory airstrikes at Israel, with explosions heard in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Missiles were seen over Tel Aviv's skyline, with the military saying Iran had fired two salvos. The US military helped shoot down Iranian missiles that were headed toward Israel, two US officials said.
Smoke could later be seen billowing above the skyscrapers in downtown Tel Aviv, according to an AFP journalist. Israel's firefighting service said its teams were responding to several ""major"" incidents, including efforts to rescue people trapped in a high-rise building.
""Firefighting crews are handling several major incidents, mainly in the Dan region"" around Tel Aviv, a statement said, adding that ""firefighters are working in a high-rise building to rescue trapped individuals and extinguish a fire, as well as responding to two additional destruction sites.""
After Israel targeted military and nuclear sites across Iran, Tehran sent a fleet of drones, followed by two salvoes of missiles. ""In both series, less than 100 missiles were fired, most of which were intercepted by air defence systems or did not reach them"", Israel's military said in a statement.
""There are a limited number of hits on buildings, some from shrapnel from the interception"", a military spokesperson said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel struck at the ""heart of Iran's nuclear programme"", taking aim at scientists and the main uranium enrichment facility in Natanz.
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Rafael Grossi told the UN Security Council that Iran had reported that a key aboveground component of its uranium enrichment facility in Natanz was destroyed.
The US underlined that it was not involved in the Israeli action and warned Iran not to attack its interests, but Tehran said Washington would be ""responsible for consequences"". Its envoy told UN that Washington was informed of the Israeli strikes ""ahead of time, but was not militarily involved"".
Iran's UN envoy said US was complicit ""by aiding and enabling these crimes"" and shared responsibility for the consequences"". Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi rejected ""calls for Iran to show restraint in the face of Israeli aggression"", according to a statement.
Iran's atomic energy agency said there was limited damage to the Fordo nuclear site south of Tehran and another site. ""The damage was limited to areas that did not cause any urban damage in the case of Fordo,"" it said.
""In Isfahan, there were also attacks on several points, which were related to warehouses that caught fire,"" said agency spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi, adding that ""the damage was not extensive and there is no cause for concern in terms of contamination"".

Women's rights and freedom,"US
.
The question of women's freedom has remained a subject of controversy throughout history. The root cause lies in male dominance and centuries-old patriarchal traditions that have sustained women's dependence on men. There is no doubt that, like men, women have equal rights in society to live a life of their choice, pursue education, access healthcare, share in property, choose a life partner and contribute to social responsibilities for the betterment of institutions and economic progress of the country.
However, a few distractions have compromised the core issues. Slogans such as mera jism, meri marzi (My body, my choice) and humein azadi chahiye, na ki izzat (We want freedom, not respect) have conveyed a misleading message, raising concerns about the nature of the freedom being demanded. This shift in focus has diverted attention from critical issues such as limited access to education, employment discrimination and gender-based violence.
Freedom of expression is a fundamental right of women. They should be valued equally alongside men, enjoying the same recognition and standing as members of society.
What is needed most in these testing times is to grant women their rights by raising voices for practical solutions — improved access to education, equal job opportunities, no to dowry, stricter laws against gang rape, and social parity for women across all regions.
The real purpose of Aurat Azadi (Women's Freedom) lies in advocating for rural girls' education, eradicating child marriages and eliminating oppressive customs in underdeveloped areas. Unfortunately, the misrepresentation of the Aurat March in recent years has diverted attention from these critical issues faced by women.
The dignity and status of women are non-negotiable. A strong argument lies in her revered roles as a mother, sister, daughter and wife — she is not only a pillar but also a builder of any truly civilised and progressive society. Women's rights should not be confused with the blind imitation of Western ideologies that may not relate to local socio-cultural values.
Instead, efforts must be directed towards meaningful advocacy so that women in rural areas receive education, access employment and are empowered to contribute to national development. Whether in the armed forces, medical field, engineering, politics or sports, women must have equal opportunities to serve alongside men in a safe and supportive environment.
Women are the architects of society, capable of contributing to socio-economics, politics, health, education and agriculture. History remembers Fatima Jinnah, who supported her brother, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, in the creation of Pakistan and later emerged as a political figure, challenging the status quo. Benazir Bhutto, the lady with democratic principles, set the precedent by becoming the first female Prime Minister of the Muslim world.
In recent times, fearless women like Malala Yousafzai, who advocates for girls' education globally; Justice Ayesha Malik, Pakistan's first female Supreme Court judge; and Nighat Dad, a leading digital rights activist, have been relentless in their fight for human rights and social progress. Their legacies continue to inspire women to step forward, challenge norms and demand their rightful place in society.
The concept of 'Womenomics' redefines gender equality by linking it directly to economic growth. Women in agriculture, education, healthcare and entrepreneurship are actively contributing to Pakistan's development. Women-led startups are on the rise, proving that given the right opportunities, women can be powerful economic drivers. The inclusion of women in the workforce is not just about fairness; it is about progress, prosperity and national strength.
The struggle for gender equality catalyses progress, and every woman who defies the odds becomes an inspiration and a role model for the coming generations. Now is the time to invest in women, protect their rights and create a society where every girl grows up knowing she can achieve anything.

Trump tells Iran to make deal or face 'more brutal' attacks,"US
.
US President Donald Trump urged Iran Friday to make a deal or face ""even more brutal"" attacks by Israel, as Washington said it was helping its key ally defend itself against Iranian retaliation.
But Trump also kept the door open for negotiations on Tehran's nuclear program, as the president who boasted he had ""no wars"" in his first term tries to avoid getting dragged into one in his second.
Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Friday, a White House official told AFP. He said earlier that Israel had let him know in advance about its strikes on Iran's military top brass and nuclear facilities.
After Iran launched barrages of ballistic missiles on Friday, the United States was ""assisting in shooting down missiles targeting Israel,"" two US officials told AFP, without giving detail on the extent of Washington's role.
The US president also spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who both stressed the need for dialogue. He also reportedly spoke to Saudi and Qatari leaders.
Trump attended a National Security Council meeting in the White House Situation Room as his team worked on the crisis. An aide posted a black and white picture of a grim-faced, purse-lipped Trump striding through the West Wing.
But the flurry of meetings and diplomatic calls came as Trump trod a tightrope between backing Israel and seeking the nuclear deal he promised he could reach with Iran.
Israel struck Iran just hours after Trump publicly urged Netanyahu to hold off on an attack, with the first missiles landing as the US president hosted a picnic for lawmakers on the White House South Lawn.
""There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter, with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal, come to an end,"" Trump said on his Truth Social platform on Friday.
""Iran must make a deal, before there is nothing left... JUST DO IT, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE,"" he said.
Trump said that he ""gave Iran chance after chance to make a deal.""
But in a series of calls with US media later, he wavered between backing Israel's ""excellent"" strikes and calling for a return to the negotiating table.

Omar lambasts govt's 'disastrous' policies,"US
Calls budget a pack of fake statistics; questions credibility of figures
The leader of opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, has criticized the PML-N led federal government's economic policies, describing them as a recipe for the complete destruction of the national economy.
In his speech during the National Assembly budget session on Friday, Omar, who belongs to the PTI, labeled the current budget as a document of fake statistics and questioned where the stated GDP figures had come from.
He pointed out that all crop yields have decreased, the agriculture sector is on the decline.
Omar compared the current situation with that of April 2022, when the PTI government was ousted through a vote of no confidence. He stated that unemployment has now reached 22% and 6.2 million educated youth are roaming jobless.
He blamed both ""PDM-1 and PDM-2 governments"" for crushing the poor by imposing indirect taxes amounting to Rs42,500 billion. '
An alliance of opposition parties — the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) — came into power after the ouster of the PTI government in April 2022. The present ruling coalition is also sometimes described as a continuation of the first PDM government, which was also led by Shehbaz Sharif.
The opposition leader accused the government of begging for IMF packages and claimed that $48 billion have been sent abroad through foreign agents.
""The budget deficit of Rs6.5 trillion will be financed by loans from commercial banks, which will reduce lending capacity for the public, ultimately turning Pakistan into an economic graveyard,"" he added.
He stated that large-scale industries have contracted by 1.5%, whereas during the PTI's tenure, industries expanded to the point where workers were not even available in Faisalabad, Omar claimed.
The opposition leader alleged that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi holds more power than even the prime minister and the deputy prime minister.
""Naqvi, while serving as the Punjab caretaker chief minister, imported low-quality wheat from Ukraine, while minting Rs450 billion in the bargain. Naqvi carries out the actions, the government bears the blame,"" he added.
When some government ministers — Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry and Attaullah Tarar — laughed at his remarks, Omar said, ""This laughter proved that Mohsin Naqvi indeed controls them"".
PPP's Raja Pervaiz Ashraf stated that during the recent Pakistan-India conflict, the Pakistan Army and the nation responded decisively, showing India that the Pakistani nation is not divided but united in defense. He praised the military leadership, including Field Marshal Asim Munir, for their commendable actions.
He remarked that while the opposition criticizes the budget, the government highlights its positive aspects. Every government must present a good budget to win public support, but given the circumstances, difficult decisions had to be made.
""The present government made tough choices and sacrificed political popularity to save the country from bankruptcy,"" he added.
Addressing the assembly, PML-N's Aqeel Malik said that instead of giving constructive proposals on the budget, the opposition only demands the release of arrested individuals.

Should men on screen hide their chest hair?,"US
Atiqa Odho's comments divide netizens
Are you appalled by the sight of male chest hair? You may not be, but actor Atiqa Odho certainly is — and the Dhoka actor is not shy about expressing her withering views on the subject.
""Wear disco jackets if you must, but please do not have undone buttons all the way down so you can show off your chest hair,"" pleaded Atiqa during a recent appearance on a local talk show during a conversation on the double standards of men and women are subjected to on screen with regards to modesty with their clothing. ""I just get so put off when I see men with hairy chests. You can wax it off! I can take you to a salon!""
In case any men taking notes had missed the point, the scathing screen veteran reiterated, ""If you must have your buttons undone all the way down, please get it all waxed, because hairy chests are a complete put-off.""
For those still left in suspense about Atiqa's true feelings, she concluded, ""It's yuck.""
Atiqa's comments came in the wake of actor Ali Raza flaunting an unbuttoned shirt in drama serial Dastak, with a full chest of hair on display. Atiqa's definitive verdict vis a vis male body hair and its relative visibility predictably sparked a discussion amongst fans online.
""I don't understand why men in Pakistani dramas often have their shirts unbuttoned halfway down,"" commented a user, evidently in agreement with Atiqa — although the fan did not agree with every point raised by the screen veteran. ""Even if the chest is waxed, it still looks cheap.""
Others, however, were as critical of Atiqa as the latter was of men favouring undone buttons. The logic stands that if women should be free to wear clothing of their choice (see the 'Mera Jism Meri Marzi' movement for reference), so should men.
""She needs to lower her gaze, period!"" wrote one enraged commenter on Instagram. ""We cannot have double standards. If men are told to lower their gazes, so should women.""
Echoing similar sentiments, another user wrote, ""Honestly, if women stand up for their right ""mera jism meri marzi"", then on what basis are these remarks made for men? Waxing for men is a very personal choice and some don't even want to wax.""
Fans (or not, as the case may be) on Reddit were largely aligned with this criticism of Atiqa's no-holds-barred opinions. ""If you don't tolerate body-shaming or age-shaming of women, extend the same towards men. I am not fan of Ali Raza, but this was an unprovoked attack and very distasteful with the way she approached the topic on air.""

Two 'cops' caught using fake currency,"US
As the vendors raised an alarm, the suspects tried to flee toward Chakwal
The circulation of counterfeit currency is reportedly on the rise in Chakwal and surrounding areas. In a recent incident at Nakka Kahut, two suspects attempting to use fake currency were caught by local street vendors and handed over to the Balkasar Police Checkpost.
According to details, two men arrived in a Suzuki Bolan at a roadside shop on Talagang Road, Nakka Kahut. Claiming to be associated with the police department, they bought a bottle of water with a Rs1,000 note, for which change was returned. They then purchased fritters from a nearby vendor and handed over another Rs1,000 note, which was found to be counterfeit. Upon rechecking, the previous note was also confirmed fake.
As the vendors raised an alarm, the suspects tried to flee toward Chakwal. Coincidentally, the in-charge of the Talagang IB unit happened to be nearby. The shopkeepers informed him, and with his help, the suspects were apprehended and taken to Balkasar Checkpost. Upon search, an additional Rs5,000 in counterfeit notes was recovered from the suspects.
When asked about legal action, the Balkasar checkpost in-charge said the investigation is ongoing and it's too early to make a final statement.
However, if proven guilty, strict action will be taken. Eyewitnesses and shopkeepers claim the suspects are relatives (uncle and nephew), with one allegedly working as a driver in Talagang City Police.
If these allegations are confirmed, it remains to be seen how the DPO responds to a potential case of serving police personnel being involved in such a serious offense in broad daylight.

Japan cricket fights obscurity amid threats,"US
The JCA, founded in 1984, has worked hard at the game
Legend has it that death threats from disgruntled samurai warriors were behind Japan's first cricket match in 1863 and the sport has battled for recognition in the baseball-mad country ever since.But Japan's cricket association, which operates out of a disused school near a wooded mountain, says the sport is slowly gaining popularity and hopes next year's home Asian Games and the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics can take it to a new level.
""My whole 11 years here have been about trying to provide people with opportunities to play,"" said Englishman Alan Curr, Japan Cricket Association's chief operations officer. ""That's a lot easier if they know the sport exists. Ultimately, you can't be what you can't see.""
Curr says cricket is growing annually in Japan with more than 5,000 adults and children playing the game regularly and about three times as many having tried it in some form.
A samurai threat to kill all foreigners who refused to leave Japan prompted a group of European residents to seek protection from the British navy in Yokohama.
They had a game of cricket to pass the time, playing with loaded guns tucked into their belts to guard against possible attack. A Scottish tea merchant founded the first cricket club in Japan five years later but it failed to catch on beyond expatriate circles.
The JCA, founded in 1984, has worked hard to introduce cricket to people with no previous experience, concentrating their efforts on selected hubs around the country.
Japan women's Twenty20 captain Mai Yanagida told AFP she ""knew the name but didn't really know what kind of sport it was"" until she took up cricket at Waseda University in Tokyo.
Japan's men qualified for next year's Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe and Namibia. Cricket will feature at next year's Asian Games in Japan before it returns to the Olympic programme for the first time since 1900 at the Los Angeles Games.
Japan's women won bronze at the 2010 Asian Games and the men made their debut at the 2023 edition, finishing with one win and one defeat.

Sindh agriculture gets Rs133b,"US
Province bets on modern farming, irrigation, horticulture clusters
The Sindh government has allocated a total of Rs132.79 billion for the agriculture sector in its 2025-26 budget. This includes Rs46.29 billion for the Agriculture Department, with Rs35.26 billion for service delivery and Rs11.03 billion for development projects. A key focus is the promotion of modern and sustainable farming practices across the province.
The government has earmarked Rs789.5 million to subsidise solar-powered, high-efficiency irrigation systems aimed at improving water use in farming. To support the date farming industry, Rs508 million will go toward setting up processing, packaging, and new plant facilities. An additional Rs634 million will be spent on solarised pulp processing units for fruits and vegetables, while Rs396 million has been allocated to build a new fruit and vegetable market in Meher.
For farm mechanisation, Rs390 million is set aside for modern agricultural implements. Another Rs220.7 million will be used to provide laser levelling equipment to farmers on a rental basis. Rs200 million has been allocated for upgrading laboratory equipment used in pesticide and fertiliser testing.
""These initiatives are designed to revolutionise Sindh's agriculture, foster green transport solutions, and attract private investment in critical sectors,"" said Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah while presenting the Rs3.5 trillion budget for FY2025-26, with a deficit of Rs38.5 billion. This represents a 12.9% increase from the FY2024-25 budget of Rs3.1 trillion.
""Through technology, partnership, and a pro-poor strategy, we are creating an inclusive, productive, and resilient rural economy,"" he added. A significant portion of the Rs132.79 billion allocation will be directed towards Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects to modernise the province's agricultural sector and improve productivity.
One major PPP initiative is the Rice and Wheat Mechanisation Project, focusing on full-cycle mechanisation of rice and wheat farming. This includes techniques like laser levelling and drone spraying. The government launched the Request for Proposal (RFP) for transaction advisors in May 2025, with investor solicitation expected in September 2025. Another PPP project, the Cluster Farming Development Project, aims to map region-wise horticulture clusters in Sindh. It will support modern storage, processing units, and efficient transportation systems to reduce post-harvest losses and increase value addition.
The government also announced tax and non-tax reliefs to simplify the tax system and reduce the financial burden on citizens and businesses. Five levies are proposed for removal: the cotton fee, professional tax on salaried individuals and small businesses, entertainment duty to promote cultural activities, and the local and drainage cesses.
These reforms aim to create a business-friendly environment that supports agricultural and industrial growth.
Agriculture expert Mahmood Nawaz Shah welcomed the increased agriculture budget but raised concerns over key gaps.
He praised the Rs500 million allocation for date processing, calling it a positive step, but stressed such initiatives would be more effective if done through PPPs with a debt-equity model. ""When the government alone funds such projects, they often face governance challenges, making it difficult to operate them on a commercial basis. Various interest groups interfere, risking the viability of the project,"" he warned.
Shah also noted the absence of clear investments in agricultural research and seed development. ""Nothing was mentioned about the Seed Corporation, which owns 6,000 acres. This is a missed opportunity to improve seed quality and innovation,"" he said.
On water scarcity, Shah emphasised the need to increase water productivity through drip and sprinkler irrigation systems. ""Water productivity remains low, and past successful initiatives like watercourse lining have been discontinued. The World Bank-supported drip irrigation programme was shelved, and no alternative strategy has been outlined in the new budget,"" he noted.
In horticulture, Shah said apart from dates, no budgetary focus was given to value addition or processing of crops like mangoes, bananas, green chilies, and onions. ""There should have been a focus on developing processing facilities, improving value chains, and boosting exports of these products. Sadly, the budget remains silent on these fronts,"" he added. Shah concluded that while the funding increase is welcome, the lack of planning in research, water efficiency, and value addition could limit long-term agricultural growth.
For energy
The Sindh government has allocated Rs67 billion for the energy sector in FY2025-26, focusing on renewable energy, rural electrification, and power infrastructure.
A major portion, Rs13 billion, has been set aside for special projects aimed at expanding renewable energy sources in the province. Another Rs11.9 billion will provide Solar Home Systems (SHS) to low-income households in remote areas, improving access and reducing reliance on the national grid.
The Village Electrification Programme in Sindh will receive Rs834 million, intended to enhance rural power connectivity.
To promote localised power generation, the government has allocated Rs4 billion as subsidies for the establishment of new Captive Power Plants.

Rs1.4b earmarked for Sindh PITP Phase-II,"US
Experts cautiously welcome new IT initiative aiming to train 35,000 youth
Tech experts have expressed mixed views about Sindh's new IT initiative, agreeing that ""something is better than nothing"" while urging stronger implementation and industry involvement.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah presented the annual provincial budget for 2025-26 in the Sindh Assembly on Friday and announced Phase-II of the People's Information Technology Programme (PITP).
""Building on this momentum, I am excited to launch PITP Phase-II with an expanded vision. With a budget of Rs1.4 billion, this phase aims to skill 35,000 students in 12 high-demand IT domains — from data science and AI to cybersecurity and full-stack development,"" the CM said during his budget speech.
Tech analyst Muhammad Yasir said the government should allocate a larger budget to promote IT education and digitise governance. He said PITP's scope must be expanded to underserved cities. The provincial government should not only increase IT seats in universities but also fund specialised IT universities in Karachi, Hyderabad, and Sukkur.
He also stressed the need to digitise various public departments, including vehicle and property registration systems.
Mehboob Shar, CEO of iCreativez Technologies and leading tech expert, said it bode well that the government was working on IT training, but added that while the current budget may not be enough for high-quality technical education, ""Something is better than nothing,"" he said, adding that ""The real challenge is ensuring transparency and strict monitoring by universities so the allocated funds utilised solely for their intended purpose,"" he said.
Shar pointed out that training is often conducted by academic instructors instead of industry experts. This gap needs to be closed to improve job readiness. ""If industry professionals conduct hands-on training, 55-70% of graduates can realistically secure jobs,"" he noted.
He said if the CM refers to Rs60,000 as a probation salary, it's fair, but added that practical, industry-aligned training is essential to help graduates eventually earn over Rs100,000 per month.
""We must significantly scale up the IT budget and involve private-sector professionals. I appreciate the CM's appointment of a capable and visionary secretary, whose leadership is starting to yield progress. This gives hope for long-term IT development,"" he said.
Shar added that the IT sector is the only industry that can bring billions in foreign remittances ""without shipping goods, just by exporting the brilliance of our youth.""
Syed Azfar Hussain, Project Director at the National Incubation Centre (NIC) Karachi, called the move encouraging.
""The fact that they are investing in 12 high-demand IT domains shows that they are serious about building a digital future for the province. Now, of course, when you look at global training costs in areas like AI or cybersecurity, you will see that budgets can vary widely depending on how deep and hands-on the programmes are.
But I believe it's not just about the amount — it's about how the budget is utilised. If the training includes real projects, mentors from the tech industry, internships, and connections with startups or companies, this funding can go a long way.
Programmes like DigiSkills, we have seen how practical, focused training can turn fresh graduates into professionals or even founders of startups.""
Analysing the Sindh CM's budget speech, he called it a positive step, noting Pakistan's youth bulge is only an asset if properly invested in. He welcomed the IT training focus but urged more support for startups, women in tech, and rural students.
He stressed the need for long-term infrastructure like tech hubs, university innovation labs, and better internet. ""Sindh has immense talent. With mentorship, access, and strong public-private partnerships, it can lead Pakistan's digital and startup economy,"" he said.

Health budget up by eight per cent,"US
CM says govt transformed JPMC, NICH, NICVD, into world-class facilities
As part of the Rs3.45 trillion provincial budget for FY 2025-26, the government has allocated Rs326.5 billion to the health sector, marking an 8 per cent increase from the previous year's Rs302.2 billion. A significant portion of Rs146.9 billion is to be disbursed as grants-in-aid to public health institutions and medical units across the province.
Key allocations include Rs19 billion for the Sindh Institute of Urology & Transplantation (SIUT), Rs16.5 billion for the Peoples Primary Health Initiative (PPHI), and Rs10 billion for the construction of a new hospital in Larkana.
Further, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah announced that the government has transformed three major public healthcare institutions, including Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), the National Institute of Child Health (NICH), and the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), into world-class facilities over the past 13 years.
Delivering his budget speech in the Sindh Assembly, Shah highlighted that the combined bed capacity of the institutions has increased from 2,092 to 4,041, reflecting a significant expansion in public healthcare services. He also revealed that the construction of a new 12-storey medical tower, and a seven-storey officers' ward, is nearing completion at JPMC, stating ""this will make JPMC not only the largest healthcare facility in the country but also among the largest in the world."" Further, the CM stated that patient visits to the three institutions have surged from 1.6 million in 2011 to over four million in the current year.

Gender gap crisis,"US
.
Pakistan's rock-bottom ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Report 2025 is a damning indictment of the government's claims regarding women's empowerment. Pakistan fared even lower than Iran, which has several social restrictions on women, and war-torn Sudan, where a large share of the women are internally displaced and unable to access proper healthcare or work, while enduring high rates of sexual violence.
Among the most telling gaps in the report is that women still account for only 22.8% of the labour force, almost all of which is in agriculture or 'women's work', such as maids and other domestic work for those with less education, or teaching, and occasionally medicine, for educated women. Even here, it is worth noting that women who study medicine are often referred to as ""lady doctors"", rather than just doctors, in a manner that often comes across as pejorative. Women are also chronically underpaid, with many employers intentionally underpaying white-collar workers because they probably are not their families' breadwinners.
As for political participation, the only reason we have any significant political representation for women is because of reserved seats. Currently, only 12 women members of the National Assembly are directly elected, and almost all of them are from political families. While many women in politics have proven themselves to be competent, the fact that they are only allowed into the field if a male relative opens the door is emblematic of problems across society and in all walks of life.
Meanwhile, even data for education — which on the face suggests slight improvements in women's enrolment — is skewed by the fact that male enrolment declined, artificially inflating the improvement for girls.
Experts believe that improving women's workforce participation alone could increase GDP by 60%. Female participation in politics and society could also improve professional, educational and health outcomes for women. Bridging the gender gap is, thus, not just a women's issue, but of everyone.

"Pakistan, WHO rally for life-saving blood donation","US
World Blood Donor Day being observed today to honour voluntary donors and raise awareness on safe blood use
The World Health Organization (WHO) and Pakistan's Health Ministry launched a joint appeal on Friday to the general public to ""urgently and voluntarily"" donate blood to address a deficit that was severely limiting hospitals' capacity to save lives.
The appeal came on the eve of World Blood Donor Day, which is being observed on Saturday (today) to acknowledge voluntary, unpaid blood donors and raise awareness about the importance of safe blood and blood products. The year's theme is ""Give blood, give hope – together we save lives"".
In the connection, nearly 150 volunteers participated in a blood donation drive organised by the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) in collaboration with WHO. One of the first volunteers to donate blood was WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo.
Voluntary blood donations can save lives and give hope to those in need. With a single donation, each of us can save up to three lives,"" said Dr Luo, speaking on the occasion. ""Every patient who needs blood should be able to receive it,"" Luo added.
He said that WHO would continue to work with Pakistan to strengthen a blood service.

"Sadiq, Gilani deny role in salary hike","US
""Any increment in our salary can be reversed by the government if it wishes,"" NA Speaker says
National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Friday clarified he had no role in the phenomenal raise in the salaries of the custodians of the upper and lower house of parliament, and that those who had given that raise could also withdraw it.
Sadiq was responding to a comment of the leader of opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, who during the budget session on Friday, said the government speaks of austerity but is committing ""financial obscenity"".
The phrase — financial obscenity — was earlier used by the defense minister, Khawaja Asif, to describe a 500% raise in the salaries of the NA speaker and deputy speaker and the Senate chairman and deputy chairman.
A report citing sources had claimed that Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani, who belongs to the PPP, presided over a meeting of the House Finance Committee a few months back to approve the raise in his own salary as well as that of the deputy chairman, Sardar Syedaal Khan Nasar of the PML-N
It also claimed that NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq of the PML-N chaired a similar meeting of the NA's House Finance Committee to ""quietly"" greenlight a raise in his own salary and that of the NA deputy speaker, a post held by PPP's Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah.
Responding to Omar's comment on Friday, Ayaz Sadiq said that neither the finance committees nor they themselves raised their salaries. ""Those who have raised our salaries can also withdraw that raise. Any increment in our salary can be reversed by the government if it wishes,"" he added.
Meanwhile, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani on Friday also reportedly distanced himself from the massive hike in the salaries of senior parliamentarians including himself, saying he was not consulted before the raise was approved.
A May 29 notification revealed that the Senate chairman and NA speaker's salaries had been raised from Rs205,000 to Rs1.3m, besides 50% of the revised salary (Rs650,000) as the sumptuary allowance. The hike took effect from January 2025.

Consumers demand audit before tariff hike,"US
NEPRA holds public hearing on DISCOs' revenue requirement of Rs455b
Consumers have called for an audit of power distribution companies (DISCOs), following the latter's request to the regulator to approve the collection of Rs455 billion through an increase in electricity rates.
The regulator — the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) — conducted a public hearing on Friday to consider the interim tariff applications of eight DISCOs. They have asked for approval of a total revenue of Rs455 billion for the next financial year, to be recovered from electricity consumers.
""Before giving the go-ahead to the interim tariff increase, the regulator should conduct an audit of these companies,"" the interveners said during the hearing.
Tanveer Bari, a representative of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI), stressed that the companies should present their investment plans. He noted that DISCOs were incurring higher losses compared to the targets set by Nepra, adding that the government was going to impose a surcharge for five years to reduce circular debt.
The petitions, under the multiyear tariff (MYT) regime covering the period from financial year 2025-26 to 2029-30, have been filed by the Gujranwala Electric Power Company (Gepco), Multan Electric Power Company (Mepco), Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco), Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco), Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco), Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco), Tribal Areas Electric Supply Company (Tesco) and Hazara Electric Supply Company (Hazeco).
The revenue requirements of DISCOs show a significant financial burden in the upcoming fiscal year, which may be passed on to consumers. Mepco has cited the highest interim revenue requirement of Rs139.1 billion, followed by Pesco at Rs81.4 billion, Gepco Rs67.8 billion, Sepco Rs58 billion, Qesco Rs50.1 billion, Hesco Rs39.4 billion, Hazeco Rs12.3 billion and Tesco Rs7.3 billion.
Mepco has also made a higher demand on account of operation and maintenance (O&M) cost at Rs63.1 billion, largely driven by staff pay and allowances of Rs22.3 billion, post-retirement benefits of Rs29 billion and repair and maintenance expenses of Rs7.8 billion.
Gepco has estimated O&M cost at Rs35.3 billion, including Rs16.6 billion for pay and allowances and Rs13.8 billion for retirement benefits. Pesco has put its O&M cost at Rs37 billion, with Rs32.7 billion for salaries.
Other companies have also quoted sizeable O&M allocations. Hesco has mentioned Rs25.1 billion, Sepco Rs22.2 billion, Qesco Rs17 billion, Tesco Rs3.8 billion and Hazeco Rs7.8 billion.
Depreciation and the return on rate base (RORB) form another significant part of the cost buildup. Mepco has again topped the list with Rs8.9 billion worth of depreciation and Rs16.3 billion in RORB. Gepco follows with Rs4.8 billion in depreciation and Rs8.8 billion in RORB.
Pesco has sought Rs5.6 billion and Rs12.3 billion under the same heads while Hesco has demanded Rs3.2 billion in depreciation and Rs6.8 billion in RORB. Qesco's RORB is estimated at Rs15.7 billion alongside Rs297 million for depreciation.
Some DISCOs have sought adjustments for prior years as well, which results in an increase in their revenue requirements. Mepco has claimed Rs59.5 billion, Pesco Rs29.3 billion, Gepco Rs24.4 billion and Sepco Rs25.6 billion. Qesco and Hesco have requested Rs16.3 billion and Rs5.8 billion, respectively, while Tesco and Hazeco have not included prior year adjustments.
Tesco and Sepco have also factored in bad debt provisions, with Rs1.6 billion and Rs5.6 billion, respectively. Sepco has estimated Rs1.6 billion in finance costs.

'May their families find strength',"US
Pakistani stars share their sorrow after deadly Air India crash
As thick black smoke billowed in the wake of the devastating Air India crash of Thursday afternoon, killing at least 265 people on board and on the ground, a global outpouring of grief and condolences has flooded the internet — with Pakistani celebrities also taking to social media to express their sadness.
The London-bound aircraft plummeted from the skies in a residential area 90 seconds after takeoff in Ahmedabad, becoming engulfed in flames as it ploughed a hostel for medical staff from a nearby hospital. One passenger was able to escape from the aircraft door, but the remaining 241 passengers and crew have been confirmed dead, as per the BBC. A distressing video of the aircraft's doomed final final flight has gone viral, jolting netizens into penning prayers from the heart for all those affected by the aviation disaster.
Condolences and sorrow
Taking to Instagram Stories, A-lister Saba Qamar posted the now infamous video and wrote, ""Heartfelt prayers for all the lives lost in the Air India tragedy, may their families find strength in this time of sorrow.""
In a similar vein but across a black backdrop as a homage to the lives lost, Love Guru star Mahira Khan kept her message succinct, stripped of excess emotion as her words honed in on the sadness engulfing all those whose lives have been forever changed. ""Saddened by the crash of Air India. Tragic condolences to all who are grieving such a big loss.""
Composing a similarly sober message on IG Stories, also amid a plain black background, Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum star Fahad Mustafa wrote, ""Deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of the victims of the Air India plane crash in Ahmedabad, India. May the departed souls rest in peace.""
Fahad's Kabhi Main Kabhi Tum co-star and fellow A-lister Hania Aamir had a similar message of sorrow to share on Stories. Like Fahad and Mahira, Hania, too, opted for a black backdrop as a mark of grief and posted on Thursday, ""Deeply saddened by the tragic Air India crash near Ahmedabad today. My thoughts and prayers are with all those affected. May the victims rest in peace and their families find strength.""
Actor Maya Khan, too, shared her shock online as she posted a picture of the destroyed aircraft and simply wrote, ""Prayers for the departed souls.""
With understandably little variation in the tributes online that inevitably fill the vacuum left by lives lost in any such catastrophe, Zard Patton Ka Bunn star Sajal Ali also turned to Stories to show her solidarity with all those who left grieving amidst the tragedy.
""Extremely heartbreaking news of the air crash today,"" posted the actor on Instagram on Thursday. Adding a broken heart emoji to sign off her message, Sajal finished, ""Praying for the souls lost and strength for their families. May they find peace.""
A journey unfinished
Meanwhile, Kattar Karachi actor Kinza Shah posted a short message underscoring the horror of a flight that would never reach its destination.
""Air India tragedy. Some journeys never reach their destination"" With the broken heart emoji proving to be the most apt after the horror of Thursday, Kinza continued, ""Prayers for the family and the lone survivor.""
Posting a similar screenshot of the news, Tan Man o Neel actor Nadia Afgan, like so many others, offered prayers for all those who perished and wished strength for those they left behind. ""So very tragic,"" penned Nadia. ""Praying for the departed souls.
Also praying for the families mourning the victims of the crash, Jafaa star Mawra Hocane wrote of her devastation on Stories. ""Devastating news about the Air India plane crash. Countless lives lost,"" expressed the actor. ""Can't imagine the state of their loved ones heartbreaking! Deepest condolences to the affected families. Praying for sabr [patience].""
Sadness without borders
Actor Armeena Khan, meanwhile, hinted in her post that geopolitical tensions lose their meaning in the face of a disaster claiming so many lives. Posting a screenshot of a news story relating to the crash, Armeena wrote, ""As a human being, I'm so sorry this has happened. I never rejoice in death.""
Finally, model-turned-actor Saheefa Jabbar Khattak spun a harrowing, poetic note as a tribute to all those who had died and the loved ones grieving their loss.
""Devastated by the tragic plane crash in Ahmedabad, India. So many lives lost, dreams shattered mid-air, families forever changed."" Painting a haunting picture of the horror the passengers must have felt in their final moments, and the chasm left behind for their loved ones, Saheefa added, ""No words feel enough in the face of such pain. Praying for every soul abroad and every loved one left behind. May they rest in peace, and may we never take a single goodbye for granted.""
Saheefa also had an answer ready for those who questioned her allegiance after in the wake of her empathetic post. ""I have nothing against the people of India,"" maintained Saheefa in a separate post as a reply to someone who questioned why she would support a country banning Pakistani artists.
""I deeply mourn the innocent lives lost,"" continued the actor. ""I can be against false propaganda, twisted narratives, and baseless accusations, but it takes someone truly cruel to not grieve the loss of innocent human lives.""
Saheefa's words, as well as the posts shared by the Pakistani showbiz community, prove that regardless of the military tensions between the neighbouring countries in May, few things unite people more than a single instant that wipes out so many lives.

Judge declares mistrial on Weinstein rape charge,"US
Decision came after jurors couldn't reach verdict
The judge in the Harvey Weinstein sex crimes retrial declared a mistrial on the outstanding rape charge against the movie producer Thursday, after the jury foreperson refused to return to deliberate the case amid a jury room feud.
In front of packed press and public benches in the 13th-floor New York courtroom, Judge Curtis Farber dismissed jurors who had been unable to reach a verdict on the charge that Weinstein raped Jessica Mann.
""Deliberations became heated to such a degree I am obligated to declare a mistrial on the one count on which you didn't reach a verdict,"" Farber declared from the wood-paneled bench, wearing a robe and reading glasses.
Weinstein's lawyer Arthur Aidala had forcefully argued that a crime had been committed against one of the jurors, but the judge dismissed the claim.
On Wednesday, the jury convicted Weinstein for sexual assault on Miriam Haley, and acquitted the fallen movie mogul for allegedly sexually assaulting Kaja Sokola. The defense vowed to appeal.
The prosecutor brushed off the defense's claim that a retrial on the charge of raping Mann would exert unfair pressure on the alleged victim. ""We will proceed to trial and that is what justice would be in this case,"" Nicole Blumberg said.
Outside court, Aidala alleged that two jurors had indicated to his team that the panel had considered the cases of rapper Sean 'P Diddy' Combs and convicted child sex abuser R Kelly in their discussions.
""(If) they say, 'Well, look at R Kelly. Look what's going on across the street with P Diddy'... That's not what you can do, and that's what we just heard happen,"" said the sharp-suited attorney.
Combs is on trial at a nearby courthouse for alleged racketeering and other crimes, and the publicity of that case has largely eclipsed Weinstein's retrial.
Weinstein, 73 and wheelchair-bound by ill-health, is already in jail for a 16-year term after he was convicted in a separate California case of raping a European actress more than a decade ago.
Proceedings in New York have been dogged by personal issues between jurors, two of whom have privately complained to the judge about fellow panelists.
The foreman had told judge Farber he could not continue after facing threats.
""One other juror made comments to the effect 'I'll meet you outside one day',"" the judge said Wednesday quoting the foreman, adding there was yelling between jurors.
After Weinstein's lawyer demanded a mistrial over the jury rupture, Weinstein himself addressed the court Wednesday, deploying a commanding voice reminiscent of his Hollywood heyday.
'Intimidation'
""We've heard threats, violence, intimidation - this is not right for me... the person who is on trial here,"" he said.
The Oscar-winner's conviction on the Haley charge is a vindication for Haley whose complaint in part led to the initial guilty verdict in 2020.
That landmark case helped spur the 'MeToo' movement that saw an outpouring of allegations from prominent women who were abused by men.
Weinstein underwent a spectacular fall from his position at the top of the world of Hollywood and show business in 2017 when allegations against him exploded into public.
The movement upended the film industry, exposing systemic exploitation of young women seeking to work in entertainment, and provoking a reckoning on how to end the toxic culture.
More than 80 women accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct in the wake of the global backlash against men abusing positions of power.
Weinstein's original 2020 conviction, and the resulting 23-year prison term, was thrown out last year after an appeals court found irregularities in the way witnesses were presented. afp

Achakzai warns of proxy war fallout,"US
Achakzai laments Pakistan's long-standing constitutional challenges
Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mahmood Khan Achakzai has raised alarm over rising tensions in the Middle East, particularly between Iran and Israel, warning of serious repercussions for Pakistan.
Speaking at a press conference in Quetta, the veteran politician and head of the Movement for the Protection of the Constitution of Pakistan urged the nation to avoid becoming entangled in external conflicts, stating, ""Proxy wars are returning to our region - and we must wake up before it's too late.""
Achakzai lamented Pakistan's long-standing constitutional challenges, recalling how there were initially deliberate delays in drafting a constitution. Once established, he said, the constitution was systematically undermined. He painted a grim picture of the country's present state, describing it as mired in a deep political, constitutional, and economic crisis.
The remarks came following a two-day meeting of the PkMAP's Central Executive and Working Committees. Achakzai accused the current government of lacking legitimacy, stating that the public mandate had been stolen and that the Constitution was being openly violated. ""If this government remains in power, it will inflict irreparable damage on the country,"" he warned.
Citing a recent World Bank report, Achakzai noted that more than 45 percent of Pakistan's population now lives below the poverty line. He criticized the disproportionate allocation of the national budget towards debt servicing and defense, at the expense of public welfare. The PkMAP chief further denounced the judiciary, media, and ruling elites for failing to safeguard democratic principles, and proposed the seizure of illegal assets from public officials to help offset national debt.
Achakzai reiterated his demand for the immediate release of PTI founder Imran Khan and other political detainees.

Budget unveiled amid standoff,"US
CM invokes Article 109 after governor delays session summoning
A political standoff erupted on Friday over the convening of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly session to present the provincial budget for the fiscal year 2025-26.
The dispute began when the Governor refused to summon the assembly session scheduled for June 13, prompting the government to take independent action.
In response to the governor's refusal, the ruling party submitted a requisition signed by 40 members of the Assembly to the acting Secretary of the Assembly, Syed Muhammad Mair.
Acting swiftly, the Speaker summoned the assembly session within two hours, and the budget along with the Finance Bill for the next fiscal year was tabled at 3pm.
The provincial government had sent a formal summary to the Governor a day earlier, requesting him to convene the Assembly session on June 13. Initially, the Governor House even issued details confirming receipt of the summary. However, on Friday, the Governor House issued a revised statement, indicating a standoff between Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
The new statement declared that the Governor had decided not to return the summary but also would not sign it immediately. He emphasized that, under the Constitution, he has 14 days to act on such a summary and is not obligated to sign it on the same day.
Governor Kundi stated, ""I have received the summary to convene the Assembly session and I am reviewing it. I am not bound to sign it today. I will do so only after fulfilling all constitutional and legal requirements. No one can force me to sign it immediately — neither the Chief Minister nor anyone else through threats or pressure.""
The Governor further remarked, ""I will not be intimidated by groups that attack the state or those who fuel corruption in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. The Chief Minister should refrain from his hollow threats.""

Illegal gun trade escapes crackdown,"US
Weapons smuggled from K-P are circulated across cities with the complicity of local agencies
In Punjab, illegal arms smuggling has become a norm, raising serious concerns over the efficiency of law enforcement agencies regarding their ability to curb this activity. Even though large numbers of illegal arms are seized, many are later declared legal on paper.
Furthermore, serial numbers are also changed to mask the origins of these weapons. The lack of strict enforcement has contributed to the growing scale of this business, prompting many citizens to keep weapons for their own protection.
A resident of Lahore, Muhammad Usman, shared that his line of work required him to regularly collect cash from Shah Alam Market and transport it either to the bank or to his home. ""Due to the security risks involved, I sometimes carry a legally licensed firearm for protection. Thieves and bandits often use smuggled or stolen firearms to carry out crimes. When illegal firearms are seized, the forensic laboratory documents the unique markings of bullets fired from those weapons,"" said Usman.
According to data obtained by The Express Tribune from the police, in the first three months of 2025, 2,535 illegal weapons were seized in Sheikhupura, 2,393 illegal weapons were seized in Lahore, 1,388 illegal weapons were seized in Gujranwala, 897 in Rawalpindi, 1,455 in Sargodha, 1,546 in Faisalabad, 1,027 in Multan, 753 in Sahiwal, 833 in DG Khan, and 561 in Bahawalpur, against which cases have been registered.
Reportedly, weapons are smuggled into Punjab from Dara Adam Khel in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P). AIG Police Monitoring Punjab, Khalid Mahmood, stated that the police had launched a province-wide crackdown against smuggling, with a large-scale arms seizure operation currently underway. ""Whenever the police receive information, weapons are confiscated from the location and formal cases are registered against the accused,"" said Mahmood.
On the other hand, police sources anonymously revealed that many individuals in certain areas were known to possess illegal weapons. ""Law enforcement is aware of who owns these arms or is involved in their illegal trade. However, if they receive pressure from higher authorities, they take action; otherwise, the matter is often settled quietly,"" confessed an official.
It has been revealed that these dealers often collude with others to obtain fake licenses for the weapons. Furthermore, they plan and coordinate the smuggling of illegal arms in vehicles, sometimes hiding them in vegetable or cargo trucks during transportation. Alarmingly, if a customer requests, weapons are even delivered alongside their families to avoid suspicion.
A TikToker known as Bobby Malik was reportedly selling illegal weapons under the name of Al-Islam Arms using forged documents. Similarly, the arms dealership of Haji Zarwali Khan in Bhaati Gate, Lahore was sealed and its license suspended after it was found that a sales agent was illegally operating under the same license. Other suspended arms dealers include, Mian Khalid & Company, Katchehri Bazaar, Faisalabad, Chakwal Armory, Commercial Market, Talagang Road, Chakwal, Sarhad Arms, Marhaba Plaza, District Attock, Javad & Company, Katchehri Bazaar, Faisalabad.
Previously, the Home Department took strict action against 19 fake arms dealers. Punjab Home Secretary Noor-ul-Amin Mengal stated that selling weapons based on bogus licenses was a serious crime, and all those involved will be brought to justice. ""Under the Punjab Arms Rules 2023, the department is re-verifying the licenses of all arms dealers across the province. So far, 386 arms dealers have been issued computerized arms business licenses after verification. A zero-tolerance policy is being implemented against bogus arms licenses and fake dealers,"" said Mengal.
According to a spokesperson for the Punjab Home Department, any arms transactions with these fake dealers are illegal and legal action will be taken against those involved. The department has instructed that these sealed arms dealer shops are to remain closed until further notice.

Debate opens in Senate amid fierce criticism,"US
Shibli accuses govt of data manipulation in 'IMF-dictated budget'
The budget debate in the Senate commenced with a blistering criticism from Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz, who blasted the government's economic policy, calling the budget ""controversial by birth"" and a reflection of incompetence and unprofessionalism.
""This is the fourth budget of this installed regime, and it has broken all previous records of misgovernance,"" Faraz said, accusing the government of fabricating data and manipulating figures.
""The numbers in this budget seem compromised ... it's a statistical deception. In the past, budget figures were never questioned, but this time doubts are widespread,"" he added.
Faraz went on to say the current budget had ""shattered the foundations"" of Pakistan's already fragile economy.
Referring to the controversial February 8 elections, he alleged that just as the government had manipulated numbers, it was playing the same game with the budget.
He lamented that in Punjab, farmers were forced to dump wheat on the roads, calling it a failure of the state to protect agriculture.
""They've destroyed the agriculture sector and stifled industry. How can growth happen when even Letters of Credit (LCs) aren't being opened?"" he said. ""There is no coherent policy for industrial development, only discouragement.""
""This is an IMF-dictated, anti-people budget. We've heard the 'South Asian Tiger' fantasy before. It's time to stop selling old fables,"" said Faraz, while lambasting the planning minister for ""insultingly linking PTI with India"". ""PTI is not an anti-state party,"" he said.
""How can a country progress when people can't even access the internet?"" He denounced the government as a product of ""Form-47 legitimacy"", saying true representatives would never have presented such a budget.
Shibli Faraz said that 61 million people fell below the poverty line post-2022 and that unemployment had surged by 14 million. He noted the lack of foreign direct investment and even remarked that ""the Afghan currency is now stronger than the Pakistani rupee"".
He slammed the imposition of taxes on stationery and questioned the government's understanding of public priorities, citing the number of out-of-school children and deteriorating public services.
Meanwhile, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb briefed the Senate Finance Committee on the budget, pushing back against the opposition's accusations.
He revealed that India's director at the IMF Board had tried to delay Pakistan's recent funding approval, but ""despite Indian objections, $700 million was approved"".
Aurangzeb asserted that Pakistan had met World Bank benchmarks and that the IFC had approved additional financing. ""We expect policy rates to enter single digits this fiscal year,"" he added, saying fiscal and structural reforms, particularly in SOEs and energy, were showing results.
He acknowledged that privatisation targets had not been met this year but expressed optimism for the next fiscal. ""We have tried to reduce the burden on the salaried class and cut transaction taxes in the construction sector,"" Aurangzeb said.
""On agricultural tax, the IMF has agreed to our stance following the prime minister's directive.""

PM orders safe return of zaireen from Iran,"US
Crisis Management Cell established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday instructed all concerned authorities to extend full support to ensure the safety and secure return of Pakistani pilgrims currently in Iran in the wake of Israel's deadly strikes.
In light of PM Shehbaz's directives, a Crisis Management Cell has been established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to monitor the situation and coordinate efforts.
The Pakistani Embassy in Iran has also been instructed to remain vigilant and provide active assistance to the pilgrims.
The PM emphasised that immediate and effective measures must be taken to ensure the safety of all Pakistani nationals in Iran. He further instructed that all available resources be utilised to facilitate their safe and prompt return to Pakistan.
He directed that until the regional situation normalises, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Pakistani diplomatic mission in Iran will remain on high alert, ensuring continued support and communication with the pilgrims.
Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar shared the embassy's hotline number: (0098)-2166941388.
The Foreign Office (FO) also advised all Zaireen from Pakistan to reconsider their travel plans to Iran and Iraq in view of the evolving security situation in the region.
Following the PM's directives, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs activated its Crisis Management Unit to ensure the safety and security of Pakistani nationals and pilgrims in Iran.
""In order to ensure safety & security of our nationals/Zaireens in Iran, we have activated a 24/7 Crisis Management Unit (CMU) at Ministry of Foreign Affairs,"" said Dar on X.

Gulf countries fear Israel-Iran spillover,"US
Escalation could threaten economic interests and security
Gulf countries on Friday unanimously condemned Israel's strikes on Iran, fearing an escalation that could threaten economic interests and security.
""Gulf states are very much caught between a rock and a hard place,"" Sanam Vakil, director of the Chatham House think-tank's Middle East and North Africa Programme told AFP.
While ""they are quietly applauding the further weakening of Iran they face real risks and have to play their cards carefully"", she said.
Their close ties to Israel's protector Washington, which maintains military bases in the region, and their proximity to Iran — and its missiles — pose risks.
Vakil said that ""Saudi diplomats are distancing themselves from Israel and condemning the strikes as a means to stay out of this conflict"". The unfolding situation is playing out against a recent diplomatic rapprochement Riyadh has been building with Tehran ever since China in 2023 brokered an agreement aiming to restore ties.
""This is a notable difference with the situation that prevailed in the region 10 years ago, when Saudi Arabia was sort of inciting the United States to strike Iran, calling it the 'head of the snake',"" said Karim Bitar, a lecturer in Middle Eastern studies at Paris's Sciences Po university.
Indeed, as Tehran reeled from Israel's attacks and planned retaliation, Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan called his Iranian counterpart and ""stressed the importance of dialogue to address disputes"".
""Gulf countries realise that this Israeli attack will jeopardise their economic interests as well as the entire stability"" of the region, Bitar said.
That is a major preoccupation of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has been focusing on economic growth, giga-projects at home and diversification away from oil.
During Donald Trump's first US presidency, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had pushed for a stronger stance against Iran.
Gulf countries supported Trump's decision to pull the United States out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
But Gulf sentiment began to change after the United States failed to provide significant backing following attacks blamed on Tehran, analysts said.
A 2019 attack — claimed by Yemen's Huthis but blamed by Riyadh and Washington on Tehran — hit Saudi Arabia's Abqaiq processing plant and Khurais oil field, temporarily halving the kingdom's crude output. Tehran denied involvement.
The UAE too has been targeted by attacks from the Huthis that hit Abu Dhabi in 2022. Seeking to avert attacks by Iran and its proxies, especially as they host US bases that could become targets in the wake of a broader conflict, Gulf monarchies have pursued a detente.

Global airlines on Friday cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Tehran and other Middle East destinations, or rerouted planes, as airspaces were shut off following Israeli strikes on Iran.
Israel, Iran, Iraq, Jordan and Syria closed their airspaces after Israel hit military and nuclear facilities in Iran. Israel said Tehran launched drones in retaliation.
Air India's New Delhi-Vienna and Mumbai-London flights were about to enter Iranian airspace when Israel launched its attack, forcing the planes to turn back to their origin, according to aircraft tracker Flight Aware.
Its London-New Delhi flight had just entered Iranian airspace and was rerouted over Iraq before arriving in India one hour late, according to Flight Aware.
Air India diverted or called back a total of 16 flights between India and London and cities in Canada and the United States ""due to the emerging situation in Iran"".

Global stocks dived, investors rush to safe havens
Oil prices fell off multi-month highs hit earlier on Friday as Israeli air strikes avoided Iranian oil sites, but prices still up about 6% as investors worried that the tensions could disrupt Middle East oil supplies.
Brent crude futures were up $4.11, or 5.9%, to $73.47 a barrel by 1712 GMT, after earlier soaring over 13% to an intraday high of $78.50, the strongest level since January 27. US West Texas Intermediate crude was up $4.38, or 6.4%, at $72.42, after earlier jumping over 14% to its highest since January 21 at $77.62.
Friday's gains were the largest intraday moves for both contracts since 2022.
The National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company said oil refining and storage facilities had not been damaged and continued to operate.
One primary concern, according to analysts, was whether the latest developments would affect the Strait of Hormuz, said Nikos Tzabouras, senior market analyst at Tradu.com. In other markets, stocks dived and there was a rush to safe havens such as gold and the US dollar and Swiss franc. REUTERS

UNGA demands immediate Gaza ceasefire,"US
Piloted by Spain, resolution co-sponsored by Pakistan
The United Nations General Assembly on Thursday adopted a resolution, by overwhelmingly majority, demanding an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Israel's war in Gaza and aid access, after the United States vetoed a similar effort in the Security Council last week.
Piloted by Spain, the resolution, co-sponsored by Pakistan and 47 other states, garnered 149 votes in favour to 12 against, with 19 abstentions.
Among those opposing the resolution were the United States and Israel, who were joined, among others, by Argentina, Hungary and Paraguay. India, Georgia, Ecuador, Romania and Ethiopia were among the countries abstaining.
Under its terms, the resolution strongly condemns the use of starvation as a weapon of war, demands a full lifting of the Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid, and insists on the protection of civilians under international law.
Although General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, they carry significant political and moral weight.
Meanwhile, famine conditions continue to threaten lives across Gaza, and reports persist of civilians being killed or injured while trying to access food at distribution points operated independently of the UN but supported by Israel and the US.
""We meet here on the 614th day of a full-fledged assault against the Palestinian people,"" underscored the Palestinian Ambassado to the UN Riyad Mansour.
""This illegal, immoral situation cannot continue; it has to stop and stop immediately,"" he said, pointing to Israel's siege against Palestine — ""where over 2 million people have been subjected to relentless bombardments, wanton destruction and engineered starvation"".

Senate passes bill on seminary registration,"US
Standing committee on interior presents multiple reports
The Senate on Friday passed the Societies Registration (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which stipulates Deeni Madaris already registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, or those opting for direct registration with the Directorate General of Religious Education, will be deemed duly registered.
Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, while presenting the bill, informed the Senate that two parallel streams exist for seminary registration: one includes religious seminaries affiliated with the federal government, functioning under a structured system and registered through formal procedures.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, Deeni Madaris have been registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860. However, it is proposed that those Madaris and Wafaqs already registered or desirous to get registered directly with Directorate General of Religious Education, Ministry of Federal Education and Professional training shall be reckoned to have been registered.
Tarar said the second stream emerged after the Army Public School (APS) attack, when the National Action Plan called for reforms to introduce contemporary subjects and government-prepared syllabi in madrassahs to align religious education with modern academic needs.
He said religious boards, including Wafaq-ul-Madaris, agreed to the reforms, and a policy shift later made madrassah registration mandatory, resulting in thousands being registered. Institutions opting to remain under their internal boards could still register under the traditional Societies Registration Act, but must meet standard requirements like clearance from the deputy commissioner and district security committee.
He said, ""In the case of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), it has been ensured that registration takes place under the Societies Registration Act through the Directorate of Religious Education.""
He added that although the earlier registration process was discontinued temporarily, both streams now remain functional in many areas. ""There may be slight differences in the forms, but the main objective is the same: ensuring students at seminaries receive a verified syllabus that includes modern subjects and access to qualified teachers.""
Multiple reports
Senate Standing Committee on Interior and Narcotics Control presented several reports of the committee on various legislative bills in the Upper House on Friday.
On behalf of Chairman committee Faisal Saleem Rehman, Senator Shahdat Awan presented the report of the committee on the National Occupational Health and Safety Bill, 2023, which was introduced by Senator Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur on November 27, 2023.

The bill proposes the insertion of new sections 344B, 344C, 344D, and 344E into the Code.
Shahadat Awan presented another report on a bill to amend the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 [The Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Bill, 2024], moved by Senator Palwasha Mohammed Zai Khan on September 2, 2024.

To enhance facilities across schools, the provincial government has allocated special funds aimed at improving basic infrastructure. These funds will support the renovation of classrooms and the provision of educational materials in 32,500 schools, benefiting approximately 5.9 million students. Additional efforts will be made to promote extracurricular activities.
A sum of Rs1.593 billion has been earmarked for female teachers working in Girls' Community Schools. Furthermore, Rs8.545 billion has been set aside to provide free textbooks to students across the province.
A major development includes the establishment of a Girls Cadet College in Dera Ismail Khan. The government has also allocated Rs855 million for the preservation and restoration of 10 historic schools in the province.
The education plan for the next year sets an ambitious target to enroll 50 per cent of out-of-school children. To address the shortage of teachers, the government will utilize Parent-Teacher Councils (PTCs) with an allocation of Rs1 billion to support staffing needs.
The budget for higher education has also seen a significant boost — increased from Rs36 billion to Rs 50 billion. As part of the reforms, Rs2.772 billion will be used to convert public colleges into applied sciences and technology centers.
Additionally, five new colleges will be established at a cost of Rs3.5 billion. The budget for public universities has been more than tripled, rising from Rs3 billion to Rs10 billion.

This budget reflects the provincial government's commitment to strengthening both school and higher education systems across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Health Sector
The upcoming fiscal year's budget includes several significant initiatives for the healthcare sector in K-P.

K-P proposes Rs157b surplus in Rs2.1tr budget,"US
Opposition parties protest alleged corruption, nepotism
The PTI-led Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government on Friday presented a Rs2,119 billion surplus budget for fiscal year 2025-26, featuring no new taxes, a 10% salary increase, and a 7% pension hike for government employees.
The budget session, presided over by Speaker Babar Salim Swati, began with the recitation of the Holy Quran.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Ameen Gandapur, opposition leader Dr Ebad Khan, PPP parliamentary leader Ahmed Kundi and leaders of all parties were in attendance.
At the outset of the session, opposition members gathered in front of the speaker's desk, carrying placards and banners bearing slogans against alleged corruption and nepotism in the province.
Earlier, Governor Faisal Karim Kundi declined to immediately summon the budget session, stressing that he would not act under political pressure. He emphasized that while he was legally bound to respond within 14 days, there was no obligation to comply instantly, especially under what he termed undue influence from the chief minister or other quarters.
The chief minister has sent a summary to the governor, requesting to convene the assembly's budget session, but the governor has chosen not to return the summary immediately, leading to a delay in scheduling the session.
Presenting the annual budget, Finance Minister Aftab Alam announced that estimated expenditures for the fiscal year 2025-26 would total Rs1,962 billion, with a projected surplus of Rs157 billion.
Providing a breakdown, he said the government expects to receive Rs292.340 billion from the federal government for the merged tribal districts. This includes Rs80 billion in current budget grants, Rs39.600 under the Annual Development Program (ADP), Rs50 billion through the Accelerated Implementation Programme (AIP), Rs42.740 billion as inter-provincial share, and Rs17 billion for Temporarily Displaced Persons (TDPs).
The minister added that the province anticipates Rs3.293 billion from the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), Rs1,506.92 billion in federal transfers, Rs129 billion from provincial own-source revenues and Rs10.250 billion in other receipts, Rs291.340m from merged district receipts, and Rs177.188m in federal project assistance.
He said Rs137.912 billion would be collected through the one percent share of the divisible pool allocated for the war on terror, Rs57.115 billion as straight transfers under gas and oil royalties, Rs58.151 billion from the windfall levy on oil, Rs34.580 billion as net hydel profit for current year, and Rs71.410 billion as net hydel profit arrears.
The finance minister added that no new taxes have been imposed in the budget. Instead, the tax base has been broadened, with projected tax receipts of Rs83.500 billion and non-tax receipts of Rs45.500 billion for the upcoming fiscal year.
Similarly, the other receipts of Rs10.25 billion would include capital receipts of Rs0.250 billion and Rs10 billion other ways and means and Rs1147.761 billion as federal tax assignment.
The minister said the government has estimated Rs1,255 billion current expenditures for settled areas including Rs288.514 billion for provincial salaries, Rs288.609 billion tehsil salaries, Rs190.297 billion for pension, Rs334.028 billion for non-salary expenses, Rs65.657 billion on Medical Teaching Institutions (MTIs), Rs37.545 billion non-salary expenditure for tehsils, Rs40.350 billion capital expenditure and Rs10 billion under the head of ""other ways and means"". Similarly, the current expenditure of merged areas is estimated at Rs160 billion, including Rs56.842 billion for provincial salaries, Rs46.865 billion for tehsil salaries, Rs4.670 billion for pension, Rs24.285 billion for non-salary expenses, Rs17 billion for TDPs and Rs10.339b non-salary tehsil expenditure.

Optical delusions,"US
.
Within the past thirty days, we have witnessed two wars waged to consolidate power and for optics. India tried to invade Pakistan for all the worst reasons imaginable. Shortly after the Pahalgam incident, when India failed to produce a smoking gun — some serious evidence to implicate Pakistan or even apprehend the actual perpetrators who still remain at large -—Indian client analysts in international think tanks, or those appearing on international news channels, tried to present war or strikes deep inside Pakistan as a political imperative.
Modi had to maintain this image of strength, you know. That's why they had to attack Pakistan. And India was confident that, through back-channel pressures, it could compel Pakistan not to retaliate. That plan did not go well, and the overconfident Indian spin masters ended up presenting India as a state that can risk nuclear escalation for one man's image management.
But look at the fallout. Since the early 1990s, India had somehow convinced the West that its cooperation was critical in containing China. As this image grew, it asked for Pakistan's head on a platter. While the West could not do that, it did the next best thing: wealth and unprecedented influence.
India used both to isolate Pakistan. But with one irrational act, it ended up exposing its chinks in the armour. With one strategic blowback, the world now knew India was nowhere near there. It wasn't the West that needed India; it was India that needed the West. Who wants that kind of liability? Everyone will only look at the main asset the country has got: its wealth. All relationships will be transactional from now on. As for Pakistan, three decades of Indian blackmail against the country have ended, and the world is ready to work with Pakistan.
Domestically, Modi's image has been badly shaken. The deep state and the hardliners see him as a liability and are counting the days till they get rid of him. To save face, Modi got the help of Niti Aayog (the body that replaced the Planning Commission), and through some numerical voodoo, the body declared that India's economy had beaten Japan to become the world's fourth-largest economy. Japan has been India's main benefactor. Imagine how these reports played out within the country. The world now knows that the Indian deep state knows that Modi has no value to contribute. Some optics.
The second case is that of Israel's Netanyahu, who has been using political radicalism to offset three major corruption cases against him. As a result, the Israeli polity has constantly radicalised. In the aftermath of October 7's ghastly attacks, instead of prioritising the rescue of the hostages, he declared a forever war, which has exposed the sheer brutality of the regime. Meanwhile, he has used all elements to regularly manipulate political outcomes in the US and other Western democracies. This policy has been the law of diminishing returns.
Only a day ago, Israel carried out a massive attack on Iran. Purpose? Optics again. The global outrage against Israel's genocide in Gaza is growing. In any case, the blood of the Gazans is not enough to indefinitely feed the tiger of political hate he rides. So, why not expand the war? I hold no brief for Iran, but this is too transparent to go unnoticed. Israel called these attacks 'pre-emptive strikes', and the US called them a unilateral action. Remember the days when the US used to carry out ""pre-emptive strikes"" on Israel's behalf? The law of diminishing returns, indeed. Meanwhile, the cases against Netanyahu are where they were. As Ta-Nehisi Coates once said: Your oppression will not save you.
History has some lessons for these politicians.
Four days after Pearl Harbour, Adolf Hitler made perhaps the most catastrophic decision in modern warfare - declaring war on the United States purely to maintain his image as a loyal ally to Japan. Despite having no treaty obligation and every strategic reason to avoid a two-front war, Hitler couldn't bear appearing weak or unreliable to his Axis partners.
The declaration was born entirely from ego and optics, not strategy. In one impulsive moment, driven by his need to project strength, Hitler handed Roosevelt the perfect gift - a declaration that galvanised American support for the very strategy planners had envisioned: an enormous two-front commitment that would treat Germany as the principal threat. You know what happened next.
Jimmy Carter was drowning in the polls when Iranian revolutionaries seized American hostages, and the pressure to look presidential became unbearable. Despite military advisers warning about the mission's complexity, Carter greenlit Operation Eagle Claw — not primarily to save the hostages, but to save his presidency. The mission was always more about optics than operations, a desperate attempt to project strength in an election year.
When helicopters collided in the Iranian desert, killing eight servicemen and leaving classified documents behind, the rescue attempt became a symbol of American impotence. Carter, seeking to appear decisive and strong, instead looked more helpless than ever. The failed mission sealed his electoral fate, and Ronald Reagan rode the backlash all the way to the White House.
Douglas MacArthur was a genuine American hero, a brilliant tactician who had saved countless lives through his strategic genius in the Pacific. But even great men can fall victim to the siren call of complete victory. After his masterful Inchon landing, MacArthur faced a choice that would define his legacy: stop at the 38th parallel or push for total triumph in North Korea.
The general, having tasted success and facing pressure from Washington not to settle for half-measures, chose to cross the line. It was an understandable decision from a commander who had delivered miracle after miracle. Yet history had one more lesson to teach: China entered the war, forcing the longest retreat in American military history. The general who had never known defeat watched his forces flee south, and President Truman ultimately relieved him of command. MacArthur's pursuit of total victory cost him everything he had built.
General Leopoldo Galtieri was a desperate man leading a desperate government when he ordered the invasion of the Falkland Islands. With Argentina's economy collapsing and massive protests filling the streets, the military junta needed a patriotic victory to survive. The Falklands seemed perfect — a beloved national cause that would unite the country behind its leaders.
""We need this,"" Galtieri reportedly told his cabinet, and for a brief moment, it worked. Massive crowds celebrated in Buenos Aires as Argentine flags flew over Port Stanley. But history cared nothing for Galtieri's political survival. Margaret Thatcher dispatched a task force 8,000 miles across the Atlantic, and within weeks, Argentina's military was in shambles.
From Delhi to Tel Aviv, from Berlin to Buenos Aires, history keeps repeating its lesson: optics may win headlines, but strategy decides legacies.

President meet splits PPP's Pindi chapter,"US
Many sidelined party officials and workers have expressed strong dissatisfaction
Internal divisions within the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Rawalpindi chapter have intensified, with growing factionalism and deepening rifts among party workers and groups after a select-group of activists managed to meet President Asif Ali Zardari.
The already simmering tensions among PPP loyalists have been further aggravated by a recent meeting at Aiwan-e-Sadr, where only select party activists were invited to meet the President of Pakistan.
Many sidelined party officials and workers have expressed strong dissatisfaction and anger over being excluded from the meeting.
The gathering, arranged on the occasion of Eidul Azha, was authorised by the Aiwan-e-Sadr and organised by former presidential spokesperson and ex-Managing Director of Baitul Mal, Aamir Fida Paracha.
According to local PPP workers, the Eid meeting was kept entirely under wraps, with no prior notice or communication to the wider party leadership.
Only a small number of individualsbelonging to a specific factionwere granted access to the President, while many senior party workers, long-time office bearers, and elected local representatives were completely overlooked.

Piastri sees 'cooler' stats ahead of Canada GP,"US
The Australian leads teammate Norris by 10 points in championship
Oscar Piastri could stand alone after Sunday's Canadian Grand Prix as the only Australian to win six or more races in a single Formula One season, but the 24-year-old has bigger and better statistics in his sights.
Only Jack Brabham and Alan Jones, world champions both, won five in the same year although their tallies reflect the fact that there were far fewer races then to a campaign than the current record 24.
Piastri, who leads McLaren teammate Lando Norris by 10 points in the championship, has won five of the nine so far and been on the podium in the last eight.
It will surprise nobody if the remarkably calm driver is back on the top step at Montreal's Circuit Gilles Villeneuve on Sunday.
""It's a nice stat to have,"" he said of matching the maximum season haul of 1980 champion Jones and late triple title-winner Brabham.
""I'd be happier with the stat of joining them as world champion.
""To have five wins in nine races is beyond what I expected really, even with a very competitive car,"" he added, saying there had also been a few other moments he wished he could rerun.
""Whilst those stats are cool, that's ultimately not why I'm here,"" he said. ""I'm here to try and win even more races and fight for a championship. So I think there's some cooler statistics to come hopefully.""
Piastri said he expected Montreal to be a continuation of how the season has gone so far, with champions McLaren winning seven of the nine and Red Bull's reigning champion Max Verstappen the other two, and also good for him.
""Max will probably be competitive again. This was a very competitive race for Mercedes last year and I expect them to be quick again here,"" he added.
""But you never quite know whether that's going to be matching us or challenging in qualifying especially, or a tenth or two back. Hopefully it's not a tenth or two ahead but you just never quite know exactly where the challenge is going to come from.
""Monaco was a strong race for Ferrari and there's some similarities to here but we said that 12 months ago and it wasn't a great race for them.""

Labour bodies slam 'anti-worker budget',"US
Submit charter of demands to labour dept, threaten protests
Labour leaders and worker organisations have submitted a charter of demands to the Director Labour (East and West), calling on the Punjab government to set the minimum wage at Rs70,000 per month and to implement a 100% wage increase for power loom workers.
The demand was led by Chairman of the Pakistan Labour Qaumi Movement and President of the Haqooq-e-Khalq Party Punjab Baba Latif Ansari, who criticised the federal budget as a ""pro-capitalist, IMF-driven"" document that neglects the working class.
The delegation included leaders and representatives from the powerloom, hosiery and garment sectors.
Speaking at the gathering, Ansari said, ""This budget has been drafted under IMF diktats. It benefits both domestic and foreign capitalist interests while worsening inflation, inequality, and unemployment for working people.""
He slammed the government's move to reduce the super tax on corporations, increase defence spending by 16%, and allocate the largest share of the budget to debt servicing — while offering only a 10% raise to government workers, including grade-1 labourers and grade-22 officers alike.
He also criticised the meagre 7% pension increase, which he argued is entirely inadequate in the face of rising inflation.
""Meanwhile, parliamentarians enjoy massive pay hikes — Senate and National Assembly heads saw their salaries skyrocket from Rs200,000 to Rs1.3 million
— while workers are thrown crumbs.""
The charter of demands also criticised the lack of taxation on the agricultural elite and the promotion of corporate farming, warning that the latter would give rise to a new class of feudal lords.
""This is an anti-worker, anti-farmer, and anti-people budget,"" said Ansari.
""We reject it completely and demand that the government prioritise the real backbone of the economy: the workers.""
Shabbir Kalyyar, Director Labour (West), said that determining minimum wages for workers in industrial and commercial establishments falls under the mandate of the Punjab Minimum Wages Board.
He added that the board comprises representatives of both employers and workers, ensuring all stakeholder perspectives are considered.
""We have received charters of demands from various labour unions across multiple sectors,"" he said. ""These will be forwarded to the higher offices of the Punjab government, which holds the final authority to approve any increase.""
Sheikh Nisar Ahmad, President of the Powerlooms Sector in Sadhar, expressed concern that out of approximately 5,700 workers employed in 300 powerloom factories in the Sadhar Industrial Estate, none are formally registered with the Social Security Department. He alleged that factory owners deposit contributions for only a few workers, and social security cards are not being issued.

Liverpool bank on 'world-class' Wirtz,"US
They made the club-record deal worth up to £116 million
The golden boy of German football is set to become the new prince of the Premier League as Florian Wirtz prepares to join Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a club-record fee.
Fresh from winning a 20th English top-flight title, Arne Slot's Reds have broken the bank to land a rising star already labelled as one of the world's best by former Reds midfielder and Wirtz's former coach Xabi Alonso.
British media reported on Friday that the Premier League champions had agreed a club-record deal worth up to £116 million ($157 million) to secure the services of the attacking midfielder.
Liverpool can now agree personal terms with a player coveted by a number of top European clubs.
Wirtz's abundant potential as a teenager sparked a row between his hometown club Cologne and Leverkusen five years ago when Leverkusen, who are backed by pharmaceutical giants Bayer, swooped to sign him at 17.
Cologne argued that a gentleman's agreement not to poach youth team players had been violated, but Leverkusen said Wirtz was a first-team signing and within months he had made his Bundesliga debut.
His rise was interrupted by a cruciate knee ligament injury in March 2022 that forced him to miss the next 10 months.
By the time he returned, Alonso had been installed as Leverkusen boss and together they would spearhead the club's greatest days.
Leverkusen ended Bayern Munich's grip on the Bundesliga in stunning fashion, romping to the title and the German Cup without losing a single match in the 2023/24 season.
Wirtz netted his first career hat-trick on the day the title was sealed against Werder Bremen, on his way to being crowned Bundesliga player of the year.
""Flo is one of the top players in the world, he's world class,"" said Alonso, who compared his protege to Lionel Messi in terms of his understanding of the game.
""Why is Messi so good? Because he knows how and when to play simple passes. Messi says: 'You're in a better position? Here, there you have the ball',"" said Alonso, a hero of Liverpool's 2005 Champions League triumph.
""It's not always about making the most brilliant move, but the best and smartest. Florian can do that. That's why he's so good.""

Bayern eye Club World Cup treasures,"US
Kane is on receiving end of jibes for not winning a team trophy in his 15-year career
Fresh from lifting a first team title of his career, Harry Kane and Bayern Munich head to the Club World Cup in the United States eyeing more than just another shot at silverware.
Long on the receiving end of jibes about not winning a team trophy in his 15-year career despite a glittering array of individual honours, the 31-year-old striker finally broke through when Bayern won the Bundesliga this season.
Besides adding another title to Bayern's bulging trophy cabinet, a Club World Cup win would be incredibly lucrative for the German giants.
In a bid to boost club buy-in for the expanded tournament, FIFA has put together a whopping $1 billion prize money pool, with the winner expected to pocket $125 million.
As with most of the big European sides competing in the tournament, Bayern have been handed a relatively simple task in the group stages.
Bayern face Auckland City in Cincinnati on Sunday, before rounding out the group stage with matches against Boca Juniors in Miami and Benfica in Charlotte.
Member-run Bayern may dwarf all but a handful of European rivals financially, but the Club World Cup money could make an important difference at an uncertain time.
Despite winning back the Bundesliga title this season after Bayer Leverkusen broke an 11-year Bavarian streak last term, Bayern are facing a rebuild this summer.
Normally the one and only destination for top German talent, in-demand midfielder Florian Wirtz spurned their advances and looks set for a move to Premier League side Liverpool.
With veteran Thomas Mueller leaving after the Club World Cup and wingers Leroy Sane and Kingsley Coman also reportedly headed for the exit, Bayern will need to bring in more attacking talent this transfer window.
In defence, Eric Dier has left while Kim Min-jae, Dayot Upamecano and Hiroki Ito have all nursed long-term injury complaints of late.
The free-agent signings of Germany duo Jonathan Tah, a centre-back, and midfielder Tom Bischof have however helped tackle two problem areas for the German giants -- and at a fraction of the cost.
Both players were released early by former clubs Leverkusen and Hoffenheim respectively, with Bayern paying nominal fees to allow them to make the trip to the US.
After recently scoring two goals in two games for England against Andorra and Senegal, Kane heads to the US optimistic of a further taste of silverware.
""We're certainly one of the favourites. I think this season has shown what kind of a team we are,"" Kane told Germany's TZ newspaper on Wednesday.
""On a good day, we can beat any opponent in the world.""
Kane said the players were ""taking the tournament seriously and preparing well"", despite the long season behind them.
""It's a new format with the best teams in the world competing. I'm happy to be part of it because it's an exciting opportunity.""
While Kane may now have just a solitary team title, his strike partner Mueller is bidding to become the most decorated German footballer ever.
Mueller is equal on 34 team trophies with retired Real Madrid midfielder Toni Kroos, but can inch past his former team-mate by lifting what would be his third Club World Cup.
The veteran's two previous victories, in 2014 and 2021, came in the previous scaled back version of the competition.
Mueller, 35, made clear he wanted to stay at Bayern after 25 years with the club. In April, he said the decision to part ways was made by the club and the club alone, but has not allowed the issue to spoil his farewell.
In a social media video as Bayern took off for the United States, Mueller said: ""Of course we want to win this thing.
""Ready to rumble. Full throttle for the title. Let's go, FC Bayern.""

Water crisis hits twin cities,"US
Scorching heat speeds up evaporation, lowering water levels in dams
The twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad continue to face a looming water crisis as all three major dams supplying water to the region are experiencing critically low levels due to prolonged drought and 44% below-average rainfall over the past 12 months.
With scorching heat and rising temperatures accelerating evaporation, water levels in Rawal, Khanpur, and Simly Dams have dropped alarmingly. If heavy pre-monsoon rains do not occur by June 30, the water shortage could escalate into a severe crisis for both cities.
Rawal Dam, constructed in 1960, has a total storage capacity of 1,752 acre-feet. It currently holds 1,737 acre-feet of waterbarely enough to meet the twin cities' needs for two months. Khanpur Dam, with a capacity of 1,982 acre-feet, now holds just 1,921 acre-feet, sufficient for only one month of supply. Simly Dam, which solely supplies Islamabad, has a storage capacity of 2,315 acre-feet, but currently contains 2,249 acre-feetenough for roughly two months.
Rawalpindi receives 23 million gallons of water daily from Rawal Dam, and an additional six million gallons from Khanpur via the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA). Due to the lack of rainfall, underground water levels have also dropped drasticallybetween 750 and 800 feet in Rawalpindiwith similar conditions in Islamabad. Most wells and tube wells installed between 1990 and 2000 in Rawalpindi have now dried up, cutting off water supply from those sources.
WASA spokesperson and Director of Administration Umar Farooq confirmed that the drop in dam water levels is due to the ongoing drought. However, he assured the public there is no cause for panic. ""The pre-monsoon season is expected to begin within two days, followed by the main monsoon season, which should bring heavy rainfall and help replenish the dams,"" he said.
While acknowledging the current water shortage, he ruled out the possibility of a major crisis and noted that in areas facing low water supply or malfunctioning tube wells, the Agency has initiated water delivery through tankers. He urged residents to conserve water by avoiding wasteful practices such as washing cars and watering lawns with hoses.

WB approves $700m Reko Diq loan,"US
Despite Indian opposition, IFC to coordinate $6.6b mining project financing
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb said on Friday that the World Bank Group had approved a $700 million loan for the Reko Diq mining project, despite strong opposition from India, which attempted to block the investment required to meet the project's overall $3 billion financing needs.
The World Bank Group approved the concessional package by rejecting Indian objections, Aurangzeb said while speaking during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance.
Of the total, $300 million will be provided by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and $400 million will be extended by the International Development Association (IDA), both part of the World Bank Group. This marks the third instance in the past month where India has failed to block lending.
India attempted to block the board meeting of the World Bank Group from approving the $700 million loan for the Reko Diq project but was once again unsuccessful, he added.
The minister further said that India was lobbying against Pakistan in international financial institutions but had failed to create any problems.
All three major global lenders — the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank Group, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) — have refused to pay heed to Indian propaganda against Pakistan and have approved separate lending packages since May 9.
The IFC is also acting as the lenders' coordinator for the $6.6 billion Reko Diq gold and copper mining project. Of the total cost, $3.7 billion will be arranged by the three shareholders: Barrick Gold, the federal government, and the provincial government of Balochistan.
The IFC's lending will help lay the foundation for further investment in the mining sector and support resilience in an economically fragile region like Balochistan. The IFC will provide $300 million from its own account, while another $400 million will be issued as a blended finance loan under the World Bank Group's IDA-20 package.
The World Bank stated that the project is expected to generate a peak of up to 10,000 jobs during the construction stage, with the Reko Diq Mining Company's local recruitment policy prioritising residents of Balochistan for both skilled and low-skilled positions. This will provide a stable source of income for households, which is expected to include a substantial number of women.
The mining company plans to contribute 1% of construction costs and 0.4% of annual revenue to projects identified by local Community Development Committees throughout the project's life. Additionally, through blended finance loans structured as sustainability-linked financing, the IDA will set key performance indicators focused on efficiency in water abstraction, female employment, local jobs, and local procurement.
In March this year, Pakistan revised upward the total cost of the first phase of the Reko Diq copper and gold mine project to $6.6 billion — a 56% increaseby expanding the scope of the strategically important scheme and accounting for inflationary impact and higher production requirements.
Pakistan's three government-owned companies — Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and Government Holdings (Private) Limited (GHPL) — each hold 8.33%, making up a collective 25% federal government stake.
Of the remaining Pakistani share, 25% is held by the government of Balochistan, and 50% is held by Barrick Gold Corporation, which operates the project.
The project is on track to begin production by the end of 2028, starting with 200,000 tonnes of copper annually in its first phase, which is expected to cost $5.7 billion. Completion of this phase is projected by 2029.
In Phase II, expected to be completed by 2034, another $3.3 billion will be invested to increase production capacity to 90 million tonnes per annum. This will bring the total project cost to nearly $9 billion.
The Reko Diq deposit is one of the largest untapped copper deposits in the world. The IFC loan represents its first mining investment in Pakistan, helping to lay the foundation for further investment in mining and to support resilience in a fragile economic region.
Global demand for metals is rising due to growth in energy, digital technologies, and infrastructure. Copper is a critical mineral essential for renewable energy technologies, electric vehicles, and efficient electrical grids. However, existing supply will not meet growing demand, and new mines such as Reko Diq must come online to bridge the gap.
Once fully developed, Reko Diq will be one of the world's largest copper mines. Pakistan's mining industry has the potential to play a key role in meeting rising global copper demand.
The project will also generate export and foreign currency earnings, with 100% of its revenue in foreign currency.
The World Bank Group has estimated that, depending on copper and gold prices, the project could contribute a gross value added of around $2 billion annually to Pakistan's economy.
The WBG is currently working on a scoping study expected to further demonstrate the benefits of developing a mining district around Reko Diq. The area is home to other prospective copper deposits. Once the project is successfully developed, it could pave the way for additional mining ventures in the region, positively impacting local economic development.

Sana Mir takes centre-stage with bell-ringing at Lord's,"US
Ex-Pak skipper handed the honour to perform cherished tradition
Sana Mir, former captain of Pakistan's women's cricket team and a newly inducted ICC Hall of Famer, was given the honour of ringing the bell at Lord's on Thursday, marking the start of day two of the World Test Championship (WTC) final between Australia and South Africa.
The ceremonial bell ringing, a cherished tradition at the 'Home of Cricket' since 2007, is performed by a notable former player to signal the commencement of daily play in a Test match.
Sana took centre stage to perform the ritual ahead of the second day's play, symbolising the beginning of another action-packed day.
Her appearance was met with warm applause from fellow cricketers, officials and spectators present at Lord's.
The WTC final, contested between Australia and South Africa, continued under clear skies as Sana's symbolic gesture set the tone for another riveting day of red-ball cricket at the historic ground.
Sana's bell-ringing honour came shortly after her induction into the ICC Hall of Fame, recognising her exceptional international career.
She represented Pakistan in 226 matches and captained the side in over a hundred fixtures, becoming a trailblazer for women's cricket in the country.
It is pertinent to mention that Sana was inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame just days earlier, becoming the first woman cricketer from Pakistan to receive this honour.
The former off-spinner, who served Pakistan cricket for nearly 15 years, is also only the 14th female cricketer globally to be included in the elite list.
Overall, she is the eighth Pakistani cricketer to be inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame, joining the ranks of legends such as Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Javed Miandad, Abdul Qadir, Zaheer Abbas, Waqar Younis, and Hanif Mohammad.
Mohammad Yousuf resigns from coaching duties
Former Pakistan captain and renowned batter, Mohammad Yousuf, has stepped down from his coaching duties at the National Cricket Academy (NCA), concluding his latest association with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
Sources confirmed that Yousuf submitted his resignation to the PCB earlier this week, citing personal commitments as the primary reason for his decision to leave.
The 50-year-old, who was previously involved with the men's national team, had served as the batting coach during Pakistan's recent tour of New Zealand.
Yousuf's appointment as NCA batting coach was aimed at nurturing the next generation of Pakistan's batters.
Though the PCB has yet to release an official statement, insiders suggest Yousuf's departure was amicable, with the possibility of future collaboration left open.
As the PCB continues to refine its coaching structure in light of upcoming international assignments, Yousuf's exit is expected to prompt further reshuffling within the development pathways at the NCA.

South Africa 92 for 2 at tea as they chase 282 set by Aussies
Mitchell Starc starred with bat and ball to leave Australia well-placed in their World Test Championship final against South Africa at Lord's on Friday.
The tailender made 58 not out in Australia's second-innings total of 207 all out on the third day, to leave South Africa chasing 282 for victory in the London sunshine.
Starc then struck an early blow in his primary role when the left-arm fast bowler had Ryan Rickelton caught behind edging a wide yorker to leave South Africa 9-1.
He also removed Wiaan Mulder when the number three fell for 27 after his checked drive was caught low down at cover by Marnus Labuschagne to end a second-wicket partnership of 61.
Starc almost had a third wicket when South Africa captain Temba Bavuma, on two, got a thick edge only for Steve Smith, in a helmet at an advanced slip position, to drop a fast-travelling catch and leave the field with a finger injury.
South Africa, 76-2 when the chance went down, were 94-2 at tea, still 188 runs shy of their target. Aiden Markram was 49 not out and Bavuma, hobbling after on-field treatment for a longstanding hamstring problem, unbeaten on 11.
Starc had previously made South Africa pay for a dropped catch with a vital fifty.
When Australia resumed their second innings on Friday on 144-8, already 218 runs ahead, it looked as if the match might finish inside three days.
South Africa enjoyed an early breakthrough when Kagiso Rabada had Nathan Lyon plumb lbw to leave Pat Cummins' men 148-9.
But tailender Starc, dropped in the gully on 14 by Marco Jansen late on the second day, kept the Proteas at bay, ably assisted by Josh Hazlewood on an increasingly flat pitch.
With any early moisture in the surface long gone, conditions for batting were now as good as at any time in the match.
Starc completed the 11th fifty of his 97-Test career when he slashed towering left-arm quick Jansen over the cordon for his fourth four in 131 balls faced.
Part-time spinner Markram eventually succeeded where the frontline bowlers had failed when Hazlewood tried to slap a dragged-down delivery over cover, only for his mistimed shot to be caught at cover to end a 59-run partnership for the last wicket.
Paceman Rabada took 4-59 to finish with nine wickets in the match.
The scale of the task confronting South Africa is stark.
If they win they will have achieved the second-highest victorious run-chase in a Test at Lord's, just above the 281 England needed to beat New Zealand in 2004.
While Australia are serial winners of major cricket titles, the only piece of International Cricket Council silverware South Africa have to their credit is the 1998 ICC Knockout, a forerunner of the Champions Trophy.
Bowler-dominated WTC final a 'good Test': Cummins
Australia captain Pat Cummins said the World Test Championship final against South Africa was a good advertisement for Test cricket despite hurtling towards a likely finish within three days.
An astounding 28 wickets fell across the first two days at Lord's.
""It's set up pretty well,"" Cummins told reporters. ""The mood in the changing room is pretty positive. It was a great partnership and a good way to end the day.""
Asked whether the bowlers' dominance detracted from the occasion of a championship final, Cummins replied: ""After two days it's pretty close to 50-50.
""It's a pretty good Test match. Some blokes have got themselves in and looked comfortable out there, but a lot of other guys haven't.""
Cummins said the rapid progress of the match was down to a combination of a tricky pitch and good bowling. ""Both teams have bowled really well, really disciplined,"" he said. ""There haven't been many half-volleys.""
The 32-year-old, appearing in his 68th Test, added: ""The trend of the game is that the runs are coming down. It's still pretty difficult out there, but we will have to bowl well tomorrow (Friday).""

CM Shah presents Rs3.45 trillion deficit budget
The PPP's Sindh government on Friday unveiled a Rs3,451.87 billion budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026 — representing a 12.9% increase compared to the previous year's budget of Rs3,056.3 billion and a deficit of Rs38.458 billion.
Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, who also holds the portfolio of provincial finance minister, presented the proposed budget in the Sindh Assembly, where the PPP holds a two-thirds majority.
Shah announced a salary increase of 12% for government employees from grades-1 to grade-16 and a 10% raise for officers of grade-17 through grade-22. He also announced an 8% increase in pensions.
""We are introducing a finance bill to abolish and decrease some taxes/levies/cess instead of increasing them,"" the CM stated amid a round of applause.
""The budget emphasizes increased allocations for education, health, infrastructure, and social welfare, along with strategic initiatives to modernize governance and stimulate economic growth,"" he said.
The province's receipts for FY 2025-26 are projected at Rs3,411.5 billion, marking an 11.6% rise compared to the current year.
Federal divisible pool transfers, which constitute 75% of total revenue, are estimated at Rs1,927.3 billion, a 10.2% increase, despite a 5.5% shortfall in the current year's revised estimates.
Additional federal transfers, including straight transfers and grants to offset losses from the abolition of the Octroi and Zila Tax (OZT), are also set to increase, bringing total federal transfers to Rs2,095.6 billion.
The Current Revenue Expenditure (CRE) is set at Rs2,149.4 billion, reflecting a 12.4% increase from Rs1,912.36 billion in FY 2024-25.
This rise is due to inflationary pressures, increased grants to non-financial institutions such as hospitals and universities, salary relief allowances for government employees, and higher pension payments.
Total expenditure is expected to increase by 12.9% to Rs3,450 billion.
Current revenue expenditure will grow by 12.4% to Rs2,150 billion, driven by salary and pension hikes (6%), grants to local bodies (3%), and substantial increases in key sectors.
The police department has been allocated Rs189.75 billion, reflecting an increase of 15.7%. The health sector has been allocated Rs336.46 billion, with an 11.3% increase, while Rs518.05 billion has been allocated for the education sector, showing an 18% increase.
Additionally, Rs20 billion has been allocated for Pro-Poor Social Protection and Economic Sustainability Initiatives, highlighting the government's focus on inclusive growth. To improve transparency and efficiency, education-related funds will be directly disbursed to schools.
Grants-in-aid totaling Rs702 billion have been allocated for various government and non-financial institutions, based on directives from the Chief Minister's Secretariat and the Finance Department.

SBP pumps Rs13.5tr,"US
Rupee on downward trajectory; gold soars as Israel strikes Iran
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Friday injected a total liquidity of Rs13.514 trillion into the cash-hungry banking system through open market operations (OMO).
According to official data, the central bank provided Rs12.8 trillion under a seven-day reverse repo and an additional Rs453 billion through a 14-day reverse repo.
In addition to conventional OMOs, the SBP also conducted a Shariah-compliant modaraba-based OMO, injecting Rs411 billion into the Islamic banking system.
The total liquidity injection across both conventional and Islamic windows amounted to Rs13.5 trillion, reflecting the SBP's active role in financing the government's fiscal needs indirectly amid prevailing IMF conditions.
Moreover, the Pakistani rupee continued its downward trajectory against the US dollar, slipping 0.10%. By the end of trading session, the local currency stood at 282.96/$, down 29 paisa compared to the previous day's close at 282.67.
In global markets, the US dollar strengthened along with traditional safe-haven currencies like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, following reports of Israeli airstrikes on Iran, which caused a sudden shift in currency market sentiment.
Meanwhile, gold prices in Pakistan rose sharply, mirroring gains in the international market where the yellow metal surged as investors sought safe-haven assets amid renewed tensions in the Middle East. In the domestic market, the price of gold per tola climbed Rs4,600 to reach Rs361,500.

The central bank is expected to hold its policy rate on Monday, a Reuters' poll showed, as many analysts shifted their previous view of a cut in the wake of Israel's military strike on Iran, citing inflation risks from rising global commodity prices.
Israel said on Friday it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders in a ""pre-emptive strike"" to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.
Several brokerages had initially expected a cut but revised their forecasts after the Israeli strikes sparked fears of a broader conflict. The escalating hostilities triggered a sharp spike in oil prices – a worry for Pakistan given the broader impact on imported inflation from a potentially prolonged conflict and tightening of crude supplies.
Eleven of 14 respondents in a snap poll expected the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to leave the benchmark rate unchanged at 11%. Two forecast a 100-basis-point cut and one predicted a 50bps cut.
""There remains an upside risk of a rise in global commodity prices in light of geopolitical tensions, which could mark a return to inflationary pressures,"" said Ahmad Mobeen, Senior Economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""The resultant higher import bill could also threaten external sector performance and bring pressure to the exchange rate.""
Inflation in Pakistan has been declining for several months after it soared to around 40% in May 2023. Last month, however, it picked up to 3.5%, above the finance ministry's projection of up to 2%, partly due to the fading of the year-go base effects. The SBP expects average inflation between 5.5% and 7.5% for the fiscal year ending June.
The central bank paused its easing cycle in March after cumulative cuts of 1,000 basis points from a record high of 22% and resumed it with a 100-basis-point reduction in May.
The policy meeting follows the release of a tight annual budget, which saw the government raise defence spending by 20% but overall expenditure was reduced by 7%, with GDP growth forecast at 4.2%.

Viral Japanese 'Insta-gran' photographer dies aged 97,"US
Kimiko Nishimoto was known for goofy self-portraits
A Japanese great-grandmother with 400,000 Instagram followers who shot to fame for her goofy self-portraits after taking up photography aged 72 has died, her son said on Thursday, as reported by AFP.
Kimiko Nishimoto, who died this week at the age of 97, told AFP in a 2018 interview that ""you can take photos no matter how old you get"".
""Wherever it is, in your house, outside, or in your bed, you can do it. That is the nice thing about a camera,"" she said.
Dubbed the 'selfie queen' by Japanese media, Nishimoto's posts showed her in various candid poses — from riding a broom like Harry Potter to imitating an off-duty sumo wrestler on their fifth beer of the night.
""Our mother always created her work with a smile,"" a post from her son Kazutami Nishimoto said on her Instagram account.
""We are deeply grateful to everyone who visited her photography exhibitions held across the country, to those who shared warm words of encouragement through Instagram... and to all who supported her warmly throughout her journey.""
Nishimoto's son teaches photography classes, which his mother started taking in retirement.
""Though she began photography at the age of 72, she was blessed with countless encounters, which enriched this third chapter of her life tremendously,"" he said.
Nishimoto appeared on national television as her online following grew and was interviewed by major news outlets.
But her more out-there visual scenarios were also the cause of some confusion over the years.
One snap — showing her wrapped in a garbage bag, as if she had been discarded — drew criticism from people who didn't know she was involved in its set-up.
""It's not like ideas just suddenly pop into my head but wherever I go I think about what it would be fun to dress up as in that place,"" she said in 2018.

Non-development spending outpaces development growth,"US
Eight per cent increase is proposed in pensions in the budget
Sindh's non-development expenditures are projected to increase by 12.4 per cent in the fiscal year 2025-26, primarily due to rising salaries, pensions, and other operational costs within the government. In contrast, development expenditures are expected to grow by a more modest 6.1 per cent.
The development budget, which stood at Rs959 billion in the current fiscal year, will rise to Rs1,018 billion for the upcoming year. Meanwhile, non-development spending is set to see a more substantial increase — from Rs1,912 billion to Rs2,150 billion.
The Sindh government announced a 10 to 12 per cent salary increase for government employees while an eight per cent increase is proposed in pensions in the budget 2025-26. The Sindh Chief Minister, in the budget speech at Sindh Assembly on Friday, announced adhoc relief allowance at the rate of 12% for employees in grades BS-1 to BS-16 and a 10 per cent raise for those in grades BS-17 to BS-22, along with an 8 per cent increase in pensions, in order to equip them to bear the impact of inflation.
The government has proposed to continue with the provision of Personal Pay to 163,701 employees between BPS-1 to BPS-6 in the new financial year, he said. The government has also proposed to enhance the monthly rate of Special Conveyance Allowance from Rs4,000 to Rs6,000 to the differently abled employees for providing meaningful support to the underprivileged segment of society.
The CM, at the occasion, claimed that the Sindh government has fully cleared all outstanding pension dues of civil servants who retired on or before June 30th 2025 with the financial impact of Rs35 billion during the CFY.
This year, the education and transport sectors have received the largest increases in budget allocations. However, funding for housing, social protection, and culture has been reduced compared to the previous year.
According to budget documents, the allocation for the housing sector has been cut from Rs42 billion to Rs35 billion. Similarly, funding for social protection has decreased from Rs381 billion to Rs362 billion. Cultural and recreational spending will also decline, dropping from Rs11 billion to Rsnine billion - a reduction of Rstwo billion.

Sharjeel slams MQM-PTI alliance,"US
Says PPP unfazed by theatrics of opposition
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon has said that the alliance between the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has become evident, as both parties that once contested elections against each other now stand united on the assembly floor.
Speaking to the media at the Sindh Assembly's media corner, Memon remarked that this alliance might send a new political message, but it holds no consequence for the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP). ""The MQM's politics is well known - it has consistently avoided local government elections due to its lack of public support,"" he said.
Memon asserted that the people of Sindh have always given their mandate to the PPP. He claimed that the PPP had eradicated the politics of violence, body bags, extortion, and forced animal hide collections from Karachi. Commenting on MQM's recent conduct in the provincial assembly, he said it stemmed from a sense of political irrelevance.
Referring to the opposition's walkout, Memon stated, ""The drama staged under the pretext of condemning the attack on Iran has been exposed. The Chief Minister began his speech by strongly condemning the cowardly attack on Iran, yet the opposition still chose to play politics.""

'Cross-examination can't be denied',"PK
Apex court upholds fair trial rights in civil service case
The Supreme Court has ruled that denying the opportunity of cross-examination to a witness constitutes a violation of Article 10-A of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to a fair trial.
A five-page judgment authored by Justice Salahuddin Panwar, while setting aside the order of the Federal Service Tribunal, noted that the cross-examination was the highest and most indispensable test known to the law for the discovery of truth.
The top court said that the reliability of evidence can only be judged through cross-examination, which is essential to reveal the truth and test the credibility of allegations.
This is especially important when the possibility cannot be ruled out in the inquiry that a witness may raise untrue and dishonest allegations due to some animosity against the accused, which cannot be accepted unless he undergoes the test of cross-examination, which indeed helps to expose the truth and veracity of allegations.
The petitioner, who was serving as a superintendent of police (PSP-BS-18), was denied the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.
He was issued a charge sheet and a statement of allegations for committing acts of omission, thereby constituting inefficiency, misconduct and corruption in terms of Rule 3(a)(b) and (c) of the government servants (E&D) Rules, 1973.
The proceedings against the petitioner were initiated pursuant to an order dated December 23,2015, passed by the Supreme Court, and the Sindh government forwarded the names of other PSP officers, including the petitioner, for initiation of disciplinary proceedings.
However, during the inquiry proceedings, the petitioner was summoned, heard in person, and his statement/reply was recorded against the said charge sheet. The statements of 138 witnesses were recorded, but he was not allowed to cross-examine any of them.
After completion of the inquiry, the report was submitted on 12.11.2018 to the authorised officer, who forwarded it to the Secretary (Establishment) with the recommendation to impose the major penalty of ""Reduction to Lower Stage in Time Scale for Three Years"" under Rule-4(b)(ii) of the government servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 1973.
The Federal Service Tribunal (FST) upheld the punishment. The petitioner later approached the Supreme Court.
The order notes that the main objective of cross-examination is to rigorously scrutinise the witness's testimony, reveal any inconsistencies, uncover potential biases, and critically assess the reliability of the evidence presented.

Salaried class to pay Rs535b despite minor relief,"PK
Tax cut called a 'joke' by National Assembly panel
A National Assembly panel on Friday termed a nominal reduction in the salaried class income tax rates a ""joke"", as discussions revealed that the salaried individuals would still pay around Rs535 billion in next fiscal year due to a paltry relief of Rs56 billion.
According to details shared by Federal Board of Revenue Chairman Rashid Langrial with the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, 981,051 individuals would get a direct benefit of 2% to 4% reduction in their tax rates. This translated into Rs56 billion in relief against the estimated Rs540 billion income tax collection in this fiscal year.
However, due to the proposed 10% increase in salaries and nominal economic growth, the FBR has estimated again receiving over Rs535 billion from the salaried class in the next fiscal year, according to the tax authorities.
""The proposed reduction in the income tax rates is a joke with the salaried persons,"" remarked Syed Naveed Qamar, chairman of the standing committee and former finance minister.
The FBR chairman agreed that the reduction was lower than desired but repeated that the government did not have much fiscal space to give any major relief.
In the last budget, the government disproportionately increased the salaried class burden, which pushed their contributions from Rs368 billion of the previous year to around Rs540 billion this year.
From Prime Minister to the Finance Minister everyone had acknowledged the undue burden put on the salaried persons but they did very little.
However, the height of insensitivity was that despite agreeing with the IMF to reduce the income tax rate on up to Rs1.2 million annual incomes from 5% to 1%, the federal cabinet set the rate at 2.5% to pay higher salaries to the federal government employees.
In the slab of up to Rs1.2 million annual earnings, there are 431,206 individuals who have been forced to pay 1.5% income tax over and above the threshold agreed with the IMF to pay higher salaries to the government employees.
To a question, the newly appointed Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that due to the federal cabinet's decision to increase the proposed salaries from 6% to 10%, the income tax rates were also increased. However, Bilal remarked that the standing committee may suggest reducing the proposed increase in salaries.
Hardly one million individuals will get direct benefit of Rs56 billion reductions. Out of the five slabs, the government reduced the rates for the first three slabs while leaving it unchanged for the last two slabs of 30% and 35% income tax rates.
About 387,345 individuals earning up to Rs2.2 million annually have been offered a 4% reduction in their income tax rates compared to the current 15% rate. Another 162,000 persons earning up to Rs3.2 million would receive a mere 2% reduction in the rates.
Langrial said that individuals falling in the two higher slabs of 30% and 35% will also get indirect benefit of reduction in the lower slab rates due to reduction in their effective income tax rates. According to the presentation, there are about 235,391 individuals falling in these two higher slabs.
The government also marginally reduced the income tax surcharge rate from 10% to 9% due to lack of fiscal space. Langrial said that the super tax rate for the medium sized firms is reduced by half percentage, admitting it was just aimed at giving signals rather than any relief. The estimated benefit is mere Rs2 billion.
The FBR chairman finally admitted that imposing 3% federal excise duty on immovable property in the last fiscal year was a ""theoretical mistake and unjust"". The government has proposed to abolish the duty in the budget. But those who proposed it and defended it till recently were still sitting in the same room with him.
In a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance that is also discussing the budget, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb backed a proposal to increase the retirement age of the federal government employees.
Senator Farooq H Naek advocated raising the retirement age of bureaucrats to save pension costs and said that a bureaucrat is fit and experienced at 60; instead of benefiting from experience, we retire them prematurely.
Senator Anusha Rahman pointed out that retired officers instantly join semi-government institutions and increasing the retirement age makes practical sense. The Finance Minister said that in the HBL the retirement age was 65 years and after the budget, he will evaluate this proposal seriously.
The finance minister made a surprising claim that the government has not imposed any new tax in the budget. However, contrary to the Finance Minister's claim that the government has slapped 5% new income tax on pensioners, Rs2.5 per liter carbon levy on petroleum products and car engine levy.
The finance minister said that the government proposed new tax measures worth Rs312 billion through compliance and enforcement.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance also showed its dissatisfaction over the government's budget proposal to slap taxes on the digital economy, particularly cash on delivery.
""Our youth is already angry with us and you have put more burden on them"", said Syed Naveed Qamar.
The Member Policy FBR Dr Najeeb Ahmad claimed that the 2% withholding tax on cash on delivery will be part of the cost of the product ordered online a stance that does not appear true.
To which Naveed Qamar said that if the claim was true, the committee would not object to the proposal. The committee members were of the view that the 2% cost would be paid by the purchaser, not by the seller.
The standing committee also asked the FBR to increase the cash withdrawal limit for collecting 0.8% tax from Rs50,000 to above Rs75,000. The Chairman FBR promised to look into the proposal. The committee also suggested that instead of charging an increased 20% income tax on interest earned on banking deposits, the FBR should introduce a new slab to charge 15% rate from the pensioners and small-income earners. The FBR did not oppose the proposal.

Nuclear arms spending up 11% in 2024,"US
.
Spending on nuclear weapons by the world's nine nuclear-armed nations rose by 11% in 2024, a report by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) said on Friday.
The $10 billion annual increase to $100.2 billion went towards modernising and in some cases expanding nuclear arsenals, according to ICAN, a global civil society coalition that seeks the total elimination of atomic weapons.
""Nuclear-armed countries could have paid the United Nations' budget 28 times with what they spent to build and maintain nuclear weapons in 2024,"" the report said. The US recorded the largest annual increase in nuclear spending in 2024, rising by $5.3 billion, the report said.
Its total expenditure of $56.8 billion exceeded the combined spending of all other nuclear-armed states, it said. China spent $12.5 billion, followed by Britain at $10.4 billion, which was an increase of $2.2 billion, ICAN said. The other nuclear states were France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan and Russia.
""In terms of kind of the increase in spending in the UK and France, I think we certainly have seen, at least in the rhetoric of political leaders, a reference to the ongoing war in Ukraine, to the tensions, and that could be playing a role,"" Alicia Sanders-Zakre, a policy and research coordinator at ICAN, said.
Britain and other allies in NATO now regard Russia as the main security threat to Europe and some have rolled out plans to devote a higher percentage of GDP to defence spending.
However, Sanders-Zakre told reporters at a briefing in Geneva that the increase in nuclear expenditure has been more driven by the costs of servicing long-term contracts and the growing expense of developing nuclear delivery systems than by current security concerns.

Carbon levy feared to eat into industry finances,"US
Oil sector hits out at govt for plans to slap carbon, petroleum levies on furnace oil
The oil industry has criticised the government's plan to impose carbon and petroleum levies on furnace oil, warning that the move — aimed at meeting IMF's conditions — could further strain finances as the sector is already facing the issue of sales tax exemption on petroleum products.
""We will not be able to sell a litre of furnace oil locally. The government will lose all the sales tax currently being collected on local sales,"" industry officials told The Express Tribune, adding that there would be zero collection of petroleum levy on furnace oil.
The government had committed to removing the sales tax exemption on petroleum products in the Finance Bill 2025 to rescue refineries and oil marketing companies. However, it did not fulfil the commitment, sparking concerns among industry players.
Now, the government has agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that it will impose a carbon levy on furnace oil in addition to slapping it on petrol and diesel.
The Petroleum Division, in a summary submitted to the cabinet, said that the government would charge a carbon levy at the rate of Rs2.5 per litre on motor spirit (petrol) and high-speed diesel in fiscal year 2025-26, which would be enhanced to Rs5 per litre in FY 2026-27.
It said that the carbon levy on furnace oil would be Rs2.5 per litre (Rs2,665 per metric ton) for FY26, which would be increased to Rs5 per litre in FY27. This will be in addition to the petroleum levy notified by the federal government.
During negotiations with the IMF, the petroleum ministry informed the cabinet that it had been agreed that petroleum levy at the rate of Rs77 per litre (Rs82,077 per ton) would be imposed on furnace oil with effect from July 2025, following enactment of amendments to the Petroleum Levy Ordinance 1961 through the Finance Act 2025.
Under the amended ordinance, the federal government has been authorised to determine and notify petroleum levy rates.
As part of the ongoing IMF's Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), Pakistan's government has agreed to impose carbon levy on petrol, diesel and furnace oil along with petroleum levy on furnace oil.
The relevant extract says: ""RM 3 (end-June 2025) Carbon Levy. This will include supplementary carbon levy levied through the PDL (PL) on gasoline and diesel of Rs5 per litre, which will be phased in over two years. As part of this reform, fuel oil will be added to the PDL, with the base and supplementary rate applicable to it. The scope, phasing and level of the supplementary carbon levy will be legislated through the FY26 Finance Act. Future Finance Acts will be able to raise the carbon levy beyond this initial rate as required.""

From forerunner to far-runner,"US
.
As Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) marks 75 years of service with a ceremonial celebration at the Karachi Golf Club on 17 June 2025, it is not only a time to recognise longevity, but to reflect critically on what sustains corporate institutions — and what imperils them.
Corporate history is filled with tales of giants that faltered. The East India Company, established in 1600, grew to dominate trade across Asia. For over two centuries, it enjoyed extraordinary power — military, economic and political. But in the aftermath of the Indian Mutiny of 1857, it was dissolved by the British Crown. A potent symbol of unchecked expansion, its fate remains a cautionary tale of what happens when institutions outgrow accountability.
A more recent and instructive example is the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) of Canada. Founded in 1670, HBC was one of the oldest and most iconic companies in North America. Originally created as a fur trading business, it evolved into a vast retail empire, owning department stores, land holdings and financial interests.
For over three and a half centuries, it adapted to changing markets and consumer needs. But cracks began to show in the early 21st century. Faced with mounting digital competition, shifting shopping behaviours and strategic indecision, HBC failed to reinvent itself fast enough. After years of losses and restructuring, the company filed for creditor protection in March 2025 and officially ceased operations in June.
The fall of HBC underscores a central truth: legacy cannot be taken for granted. Even the most enduring companies must remain rooted in operational logic and responsive to change.
This brings us to a decision that is currently casting a shadow over PPL's otherwise commendable milestone — the reported plan to relocate its head office from Karachi to Islamabad. This move raises serious concerns not only about efficiency but also about motive.
PPL's operational backbone lies in Sindh and Balochistan. Its major gas fields - Sui, Kandhkot, Mazarani and many others - are located in these provinces. The company's ventures in lead, zinc and iron ore are Balochistan-based. Bolan Mining Enterprises, a 50:50 joint venture with the Government of Balochistan, produces barite from Khuzdar and is headquartered in Quetta.
Most technical and operational coordination, along with joint ventures and field logistics, are centred in the southern region of the country. Above all, PPL's 8.33% share in Reko Diq gold mine, a game changer for the Company, is also situated in Balochistan.
Thus, a shift to Islamabad appears neither administratively necessary nor economically sound. Rather, it seems to reflect parochial considerations, disconnected from ground realities. Such a move risks weakening the company's alignment with its core operations and alienating the very regions that support its business.
Strategically, it would place management further away from operational hubs, complicate coordination and increase costs — without any clear upside. Symbolically, it risks diminishing Karachi's historic role as a corporate and industrial hub, and more critically, sending the wrong message about national cohesion and balanced development.
At a time when PPL should be consolidating its position, investing in exploration and preparing for energy transition challenges, such a move seems both untimely and unwise. It is hoped that the Petroleum Minister, known for his energy and intellect, will examine this matter closely. Pragmatism, not symbolism, must guide policy.
The story of corporate survival is rarely about grandeur — it is about good judgment. Hudson's Bay did not fall overnight. It fell by drifting away from its strengths and delaying key decisions. PPL has the experience and legacy to endure — but only if it avoids complacency and stays connected to its operational roots.
Longevity in business is not just about staying alive — it is about staying relevant. Let us hope PPL chooses wisely as it steps into its next quarter century. My thoughts are best reflected in these verses by Iftikhar Arif:
Yeh kya keh khaak huwai hum jahan wahin kay nahin;
Jo hum yahan kay nahin hain to phir kahin kay nahin
Wafa sarisht mai hoti to samnay aati;
Woh kya falak sai nibhain gai jo zameen kay nahin

"Woman dies, three daughters injured in alleged police raid","KE
60-year-old Irshad Bibi reportedly stepped forward to protect her husband
A 60-year-old woman died and her three daughters were injured during an alleged act of police violence during a raid in Kamoke.
The incident occurred at the Dera Ameer Afzal on Toliki Road, in the jurisdiction of Saddar Kamoke Police Station, when Police, led by ASI Rao Inam, conducted a raid to arrest suspects involved in a dispute.
The victim's husband, Arif, stated that at around 11:30 pm, ASI Rao Inamullah, along with six of his colleagues, entered their home forcibly without the presence of female police officers, assaulted his wife and daughters, and even took an Umrah ticket, Rs90,000 cash, and a motorbike belonging to his son when they left.
He further claimed the raid was unjustified as the family had already secured interim bail in the related case, which was a domestic dispute with relatives.
During the raid, 60-year-old Irshad Bibi reportedly stepped forward to protect her husband, at which point ASI Rao Inam allegedly punched her in the chest, causing her to collapse. When her daughters, Zainab, Misbah, and Urooj intervened, they were also allegedly beaten and dragged by their hair. Irshad Bibi was taken to the hospital with the help of neighbors, where she succumbed to her injuries.
Following the media report, CPO Rana Ayaz Saleem ordered SSP Operations Rizwan Tariq to investigate. CPO said that it was found that ASI Rao Inam conducted the raid without informing his SHO and was initially held responsible.

Is Donald Trump the present day manifestation of the ancient Chinese businessman who enjoyed the least of respect in society? A direct comparison may sound unfair to the president, but his fixation on tariffs – seemingly rooted in arrogant nationalism – has prompted many in China to recall how ancient Chinese emperors and philosophers viewed businessmen. The falling out of Trump and Elon Musk – two powerful businessmen – also perhaps offers the latest illustration of that Chinese wisdom on businessmen's propensity to be self-righteous, arrogant and self-serving when the situation so demands.
When Trump, a businessman turned politician, intensified his pursuit of increased tax revenues by imposing customs duties on a wide range of US imports from various global sources, he elicited a reaction from even the most esteemed traditional partners, such as the European Union and India. While Trump's intentions to revitalise the US economy and achieve 'Make-America-Great-Again' resonated with many, his actions evoked a comparison in China to the behaviour of ancient Chinese businessmen. These individuals were renowned for their unwavering pursuit of personal gain, often disregarding societal norms and values. This is how businessmen were viewed in general.
Within the traditional Chinese cultural hierarchy, the Emperor of course stood above everybody else, with the absolute authority. All others – the citizens of the empire – however, were divided into four distinct classes. While businessmen were respected for their wealth and success, their primary focus on profit was perceived as less noble than their contributions to society through learning or government service.
The most esteemed members of this class were the wisemen, scholars, advisors and officials. Their invaluable contributions to the Emperor's governance were recognised through their knowledge, virtue and intellectual pursuits. Their writings and intellectual endeavours were highly valued and contributed to the state's development.
The second most respected class consisted of farmers, who were responsible for cultivating crops and providing food for the population. They were regarded as the foundation of the economy, ensuring the sustenance of the entire population.
Artisans, technicians, engineers and construction experts, who possessed specialised skills, were the third most esteemed class. Their contributions were instrumental in developing technical tools and facilitating daily life.
The business community, comprising merchants, held a lowly position in society, regarded as the least respected class. The Emperor held a disdain for businessmen, believing they prioritised money over morality and would resort to any means, ethical or immoral, to achieve financial gain. Consequently, few businessmen sought proximity to the Emperor.
While there were methods to evade the Emperor's disdain, businessmen were generally the least welcomed and least respected members of the royal court due to their perceived greed for wealth.
However, this perception has shifted over time, not only in China but also in other parts of the world. Businessmen have played a pivotal role in the country's economic growth, exemplified by the billionaire founder of Ali Baba, Jack Ma.
The concept of 'Chinese businessman wisdom' has emerged, referring to the practical, astute, and often pragmatic approach to business that is highly esteemed by both Chinese and international audiences.
The traditional hierarchical structure has undergone a gradual softening, and various professions, including business, are now recognised for their unique contributions to society. The contemporary emphasis on economic development has fostered a more positive attitude towards business and entrepreneurship. The government actively encourages entrepreneurship and private enterprise, acknowledging the indispensable role of businesses in the nation's development.
Nevertheless, certain actions are considered unacceptable and should not be crossed. Jack Ma's conduct a few years ago prompted many to draw upon ancient wisdom and draw parallels between the past and the present. His interactions with the central bank invariably drew comparisons to the past and often served as an example of a businessman attempting to exert control over the central bank.
The context involved technical difficulties experienced by Ali-Pay, a digital payment system, in conjunction with the central bank.
Upon making his public complaint, Jack Ma faced significant repercussions from the Chinese authorities. His passing remark about China's finance system was interpreted as a mockery by the Beijing authorities, leading to questions about his intentions. They expressed concern that Jack Ma might intend to control the finance system through Ali-Pay.
As a result, Jack Ma encountered substantial opposition from the authorities. They argued that the Central Bank is a trusted institution – in fact a public Trust – that efficiently manages and looks after the interests of the people. If allowed to operate like a Western capital institution, entities such as Ali-Pay could potentially disrupt the system and harm the interests of the Chinese people.
The official backlash compelled Jack Ma to take a break from business – a sort of sabbatical. However, he recently resurfaced with more empathetic views on China's financial system – more aligned with the national ethos as projected by the leadership. A Chinese friend described him as helpful and engaged in significant philanthropic activities – something expected of every affluent Chinese who are expected to pay back after benefitting under the system, which rests on a national spirit and ethos that keep citizens at the centre. The citizen, says the ancient Chinese philosophy, is central to a state's stability, and hence his/her welfare is paramount for the political economy.
All indicators suggest the Chinese Communist Party continues to follow that golden philosophy. It's yet to be seen how much the Trump-Musk acrimony hurts the people. There couldn't have been a better validation of the Chinese definition of a businessman than the mutual public trolling both Trump and Musk indulged in following the implosion of their alliance.

Confusion reigns as PPP sends mixed signals on budget protest,"US
Punjab chapter stirs protest talk as central leadership plays it close to the chest
Confusion continues to swirl within the PPP over its purported plans to stage a nationwide protest against the federal budget, as conflicting voices emerge from within the party's ranks.
While some insiders deny any such plan, others maintain that a strategy was indeed in the works, but mainly being driven by the party's Punjab wing, as the central party has not been fully engaged in the decision.
The Pakistan Peoples Party, whose senior leader Chaudhary Manzoor announced a countrywide protest against the budget draft, remains a key coalition partner in the federal government.
Without its backing, the PML-N-led government would be left out on a limb. Any official protest call by the party's central leadership would signal a withdrawal of support for the finance bill, throwing the budget's passage into serious doubt.
However, party leaders The Express Tribune spoke to suggested that Manzoor's call was more of a solo flight than a coordinated party line. While some leaders in central Punjab are rallying behind it, the move has not received a formal green light from the party's top brass.
According to insiders, the protest plan was being shaped as an attempt to tap into the growing discontent among farmers and labourers who were being left high and dry by the government's policies.
The party, by reaching out to farmers and labourers, would try to gather support before embarking on any protest plan, as it lacks sufficient muscle in Punjab to hit the roads without them.
Senior Vice President Central Punjab Rana Farooq Saeed said they had not been informed by the party about any protest plan. He questioned under whose authority Manzoor had made the call.
However, he added that the party does not approve of the budget, as it offered nothing for farmers and labourers. ""It would be wrong to even call it a budget,"" he said. However, despite these reservations, the party has yet to take a formal decision.
""Given that we are allies in the centre, we cannot give out impulsive statements against the budget,"" he said.
Central Party General Secretary Hasan Murtaza avoided giving a direct answer regarding any party plans to hold a protest demonstration throughout the country.
He said they were allies of the government and would try to knock some sense into the PML-N over the glaring discrepancies in the budget. If dialogue failed, he added, they would ultimately hit the roads.
When asked if the central party had rejected the budget, which would mean the PPP would withhold support, he said that decision would be taken by the central leadership. However, he clarified that the party would not ""stand in for PML-N's mistakes"".
""They will not carry their weight while they suck the life out of poor people and line their own pockets,"" he said.
He listed several grievances, from the failure to renegotiate capacity payments to the taxation of solar panels.
When asked about senior leader Naveed Qamar's acknowledgement of thorough consultation sessions with the PML-N on the budget, he responded that ""consultation does not mean that their inputs are being incorporated"".
On Thursday, several media outlets reported that the PPP had rejected the federal budget for the upcoming fiscal year and announced a nationwide protest campaign against it.
The impression was formed after Chaudhary Manzoor Ahmad, who heads the PPP's People's Labour Bureau, lambasted the federal government at a press conference in Islamabad for presenting a budget that favours the wealthy and ignores the miseries of the working class and poor.
The PPP leader said the party had started contacting trade unions across the country to mobilise support for protest demonstrations. He stated that demonstrations would be held in all provinces before the passage of the federal budget in the National Assembly.
When senior PPP leader Naveed Qamar was asked to comment on the budget, he said the party recognised that the government was walking a tightrope under the IMF programme.
However, he also said the government's policies were misaligned and that if the PPP were designing the budget, it would have been vastly different.
At no point during the programme did he outright reject the budget or announce plans for protest rallies.

Delay in road project irks Jhelum residents,"US
The painfully slow pace of work has created hazardous living conditions.
Construction of the dual carriageway in Pind Dadan Khan, District Jhelum, has been dragging on for four years with little visible progress, leaving local residents mired in dust, pollution, and frustration.
The painfully slow pace of work has created hazardous living conditions. Clouds of dust blanket the area, contributing to respiratory illnesses such as asthma and other breathing problems.
Locals say the incomplete road has not only disrupted their daily lives but also severely affected public health and environmental conditions.
""There's hardly any progress. Not even ten percent of the work is done,"" lamented a resident while talking to The Express Tribune. ""We feel abandoned. What wrong have we done to deserve this ongoing misery?""
Despite the allocation of funds and the presence of several government representatives from the region, including federal minister Bilal Azhar Kiyani, the project remains stalled.
The delay has turned nearby villages into dust-filled zones, causing a decline in the quality of life and economic activity.

Haute hats hover at UK horse racing event,"US
Royal Ascot is every milliner's Oscars
At her London studio, Merve Bayindir carefully glues dried flowers onto a pale pink saucer hat. Nearby, an array of other colourful headpieces are on display.
The Turkish-born milliner has been busy making hats for guests attending the annual Royal Ascot racing event, where headwear is a must.
""It is the biggest runway. It's the Oscars. It's the Golden Globes...that is what it is for us...milliners, because you can't see that many amazing hats in one spot at the same time for a week,"" she told Reuters.
The horse-racing event, held in Ascot just outside London, kicks off on June 17 for five days. It has become as much known for the colourful fashion as for the sport.
Its various enclosures have different dress codes — the strictest is for the royal enclosure.
""You have to have a minimum ten centimetres of diameter on a hat,"" Bayindir said.
""So (for) the ladies in the royal enclosure, we always say make sure that your hat is not a fascinator,"" she added, referring to elaborate, decorative headpieces, often fixed on a band or clip.
For the Queen Anne and village enclosures, hats, headpieces or fascinators are allowed.
In terms of colours, Bayindir said designs in pale pink and blue were annual staples, with fuchsia, sage green and lilac also proving popular lately. As for size, the bigger the better.
""It doesn't matter who you are, you can be the star and take that chance and be outrageous,"" she said.
""Royal Ascot itself has a very big personality. So you need to sort of support that big personality and be part of it if you want to be really enjoying the environment.""

Punjab unveils security plan for Muharram observances,"US
Digital portal launched, army and Rangers deployment sought
The Punjab government has launched an extensive security plan for the upcoming Muharram, combining digital surveillance, inter-agency coordination, and infrastructure safety measures to ensure peaceful religious observances across the province.
According to the Home Department, the month of Muharram is expected to begin on June 26 or 27, subject to moon sighting.
A digital monitoring portal has been activated to oversee majalis, procession routes, and sensitive locations.
All deputy commissioners have been directed to upload related data within five days. The system will be managed by Kamran Taj, Network Engineer from the Home Department's MIS section.
In anticipation of heightened security needs, the department has formally requested the Inspector General of Police to coordinate the deployment of Pakistan Army and Punjab Rangers.
Officials have been asked to provide details on locations and deployment duration within a week. The request also includes mobile signal jamming in select sensitive zones.
To prevent sectarian tensions, the government has issued guidelines mandating that non-Shia congregations remain separate from Ahl-e-Tashee events.
The directive emphasizes the need for inclusive security arrangements across all sects.
As part of infrastructure safety, electricity companies have been instructed to address loose or hanging wires along procession routes.
District officials will conduct reconnaissance to identify risk-prone areas, with technical teams on standby.
Loudspeaker use will be monitored under the Punjab Sound Systems (Regulation) Act, 2015, with daily field reports and strict enforcement measures.
District Intelligence Committees are to finalize contingency plans and update lists of speakers under restrictions.
The Auqaf and Religious Affairs Department will coordinate Ittehad Bain-ul-Muslimeen committee meetings at divisional levels to maintain sectarian harmony.
Unauthorised processions or gatherings will not be permitted, with all activities to be conducted within approved parameters.
The provincial government stated that these measures are part of a broader commitment to peaceful Muharram commemorations while managing long-standing security challenges.

US Marines deployed to LA,"US
Rare move comes as more protests expected
US Marines were deployed to Los Angeles on Friday, the military said, in a rare domestic use of its forces after days of protests over immigration raids and as nationwide demonstrations were expected on Saturday, in the biggest backlash since President Donald Trump returned to power.
About 200 Marines will protect a federal building in Los Angeles, Army Major General Scott Sherman said on Friday. The administration has authorized a total of 700 Marines to be deployed in the city. Neither the Marines nor National Guard troops in the city have temporarily detained anyone, he added.
""I would like to emphasize that the soldiers will not participate in law enforcement activities,"" he said during a briefing. It is uncommon for active-duty troops to be used domestically during civil disturbances.
The last time the military was used for direct police action was in 1992, when the California governor at the time asked then President George HW Bush to invoke the Insurrection Act to help respond to Los Angeles riots over the acquittal of police officers who beat Black motorist Rodney King. A court decided on Thursday that Trump can keep his deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles for now.
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals' decision temporarily paused a lower court ruling that blocked the mobilization, although it does not mean the court will ultimately side with him.
""We saved LA. Thank you for the Decision!!!"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. The Trump administration ""far overreached its authority,"" the California Attorney General's office said, adding that it remained confident in its case ahead of making arguments to court on Tuesday.
