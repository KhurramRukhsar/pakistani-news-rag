"ASI booked for harassment, bribery","US
During the investigation, ASI Liaqat summoned Alishbah and her husband to the police station.
An assistant sub-inspector has been detained and a case registered against him on charges of misuse of authority, bribery, and harassment of a woman.
The action was taken following initial investigations into a complaint.
According to the complainant, Alishbah, her mother had lodged a case at the Pattoki City Police Station a few weeks ago, claiming that she had been abducted. The complainant stated that she had not been abducted but had married Muhammad Kashif. Her mother later filed a petition under Section 491 of the CrPC, seeking her recovery.
During the investigation, ASI Liaqat summoned Alishbah and her husband to the police station. He asked the husband to leave, assuring him that the police would present his wife in court. Once alone with her, the ASI allegedly subjected her to verbal abuse, physical assault and threats, the complainant alleged, adding that he had harassed her and extorted Rs50,000 from her.
Kasur DPO Muhammad Essa Khan initiated an inquiry into the matter. During the investigation, the ASI failed to provide a satisfactory explanation in response to the allegations. The probe confirmed that the ASI had acted unlawfully by interrogating the woman in a room without the presence of a female constable, abusing and threatening her, and forcibly taking money, thereby misusing his official powers.
Following the confirmation of the allegations, ASI Liaqat was charged and detained.

Govt to challenge KE tariff decision,"US
Leghari says profits must come from efficiency, not subsidies that hit masses
Minister for Power Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari on Thursday announced that the government would challenge the decision of the power-sector regulator and would file a review petition with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) for reassessing K-Electric’s (KE) tariff structure.
He stressed that power companies must earn profits through operational efficiency rather than relying on subsidies or charitable assistance.
Speaking to the media after addressing a workshop on “Reforms in the Power Sector,” Leghari announced “we are working to ensure that neither the federal government nor the power consumers are overburdened.”
He emphasised the need for performance-based profits in the power sector. “We are moving towards privatisation. K-Electric and other investors should earn profits based on efficiency, not subsidies.” He called for the enforcement of regulatory frameworks in distribution companies (DISCOs).
“We will approach Nepra to ensure that consumers get electricity at reasonable prices,” the minister said, adding that K-Electric’s tariff burden was indirectly shared by the consumers of other DISCOs through taxes. “We expect Nepra to take decisions that benefit both the nation and the consumers.”
Regarding net metering, Leghari said that consultations with stakeholders had been completed and a revised policy had been prepared. “If the new net metering policy is approved, it will be implemented within a month,” he said.
The minister also noted that climate change has reduced hydropower generation, forcing the country to rely on more expensive sources of electricity. “The fuel cost adjustment (FCA) varies monthly due to fluctuations in generation costs,” he said.
The power minister highlighted reductions in electricity costs, saying “prices have decreased by 31% for the industrial sector and by 50% for 18 million household consumers.” However, he acknowledged that climate change has led to a drop in hydropower generation, forcing reliance on more expensive sources. “The FCA varies monthly, but overall, electricity prices have declined.”
Regarding the circular debt, Leghari revealed that the government was planning to borrow from banks to eliminate the mounting debt.He stressed that there was ample electricity for grid supply over the next three years, adding that in the past one year, the government implemented key reforms to provide relief to power consumers.
The minister strongly denied reports of any increase in electricity prices, stating that the government has not raised tariffs in any form.“In the last year alone, industrial tariffs have been reduced by 30%. The government is committed to bringing long-term, sustainable reductions in power tariffs,” he said.
Leghari stated that Pakistan was undergoing a revolution in renewable energy. “For the past year, we have been conducting research and analysis in the energy sector and are also reviewing agreements with the independent power producers (IPPs). As a result, electricity prices have started to decline.”
He further said solar energy was a remarkable and promising source. In recent years, solar power production has increased significantly.
The minister criticised past planning in the energy sector, saying the projections made in previous years were not realistic. He reaffirmed the government’s intention to reduce tariffs sustainably and highlighted the exponential progress in alternative energy sources.
“During the Covid-19 pandemic, energy demand increased. We are now working on separating the government from future electricity procurement,” he added. He also emphasised that the inclusion of Bhasha Dam into the power system would be a significant development.
Leghari assured that the government was making efforts to shield consumers from the consequences of poor planning in the power system. Reforms are underway in the transmission sector, although the country currently lacks modern technology to assess load pressure on transformers and feeders.
Regarding thermal plants, he said the government is trying to ensure that coal- and gas-fired power plants do not adversely impact the environment.
In response to a question, the federal minister said that the cabinet has ordered a review of the net metering policy. Stakeholder consultations will be held and feedback will be sought. After the cabinet’s approval, the revised policy will be implemented.

Weightlifter Sybil to create history for Pak,"IE
The CW champion will be first Pak woman to compete in Asian Weightlifting
The 2024 Commonwealth Powerlifting champion Sybil Sohail will make history as the first Pakistani woman to compete at the Asian Masters Weightlifting Championship in Doha, Qatar, on Friday.
""I just want to ask for prayers and best wishes from the entire nation as I'm going to make history here,"" Sybil, who has won at least 20 international medals and 36 national medals in her career, told this correspondent from Doha. ""I will be aiming for the medal-winning performance. But, I badly need support and prayers. I want to make Pakistan like I always have tried to on the international level.""
She will be competing in the W-30 59 Kg in Doha as her event will start at 1900 PST on Friday.
The championship will feature athletes from 26 countries and Sybil is expecting a tough competition in the sweltering summer in Doha.
Pakistan is also fielding Neelum Riaz and Nadia Maqsood in 76kg and 87 kg events, along with four male weightlifters to compete in various categories.
The Lahore-based athlete has been one of the pioneering powerlifters and weightlifters in Pakistan, as she hails from a family of extremely empowered women that has won numerous accolades on the international stage.
Her younger sisters include Twinkle Sohail, Veronika Sohail, and Mariam Sohail, all of whom have also been the Commonwealth Classic and Equipped Bench Press and Powerlifting Champions. They made the unique world record of winning 15 gold medals, three silver, and one bronze medal in October.
Sybil alone won six of those medals.
The sisters have been playing a crucial role in pushing the envelope for what Pakistani women can achieve in sports. Still, they have also been a shining example for the Christian community of the country, where athletes from minorities are becoming a rare sight progressively.
For Sybil, the eldest of the quartet, competing at the Asian Weightlifting Championship is a dream come true.
""The Asian Championship is extremely important to me, it is about making history, I will become the first woman from Pakistan to lift the weights for the country at this stage,"" said the 31-year-old.
""I'm excited beyond words, and I must credit my coach Rashed Malik for this, without whose guidance and training I wouldn't have reached this stage. After God, I thank him for all that my sisters and I have achieved so far.""
'Determined to succeed for my family'
She added that she trained at Punjab University Sports Complex in Lahore.
""I have been training for this event for at least two hours in the morning and then four in the evening. But You know that we still struggle to have quality gyms and equipment in Pakistan,"" explained Sybil, who is also planning to start her MPhil next year as she is done with her Bachelor in Sports Science from Punjab University.
However, comparing the conditions in Doha to Lahore she added that the facilities are world-class and have training camps for athletes that help them succeed in the competitions too.
""You can't beat athletes that get proper facilities, infrastructure, and support and training with these resources. I belong to a middle-class family, but training and carrying on in limited resources, and managing a career in a sport that is male-dominated is difficult.
""Grooming one wrestler is difficult in these economic conditions, but in our home, there are four of us, so it is not difficult.
""I have seen times when my father would drink water for himself but make sure that all of us would get milkshakes so we grow strong, so when we saw all of these difficult times and how my parents have sacrificed for us, all four of us decided and make it our aim that we win medals, it is a blessing for us. No one has won 15 gold medals like we did at the Commonwealth and Asian level.""
Switching from Powerlifting to Weightlifting
Now Sybil is aiming for the weightlifting medal.
""Weightlifting is definitely a more technical sport, and in my career since 2013, it has not been easy to switch quickly because techniques are there, we get injured too, but my eyes are always on the prize,"" said Sybil.
However, she made an appeal to the government of Pakistan,"" I just want the government to support us, we can only do so much on an individual level. We need institutional support like even now I am competing courtesy Arshad Khan Turk, who agreed to sponsor me.""

Night traffic patrolling plan rolled out for Eid,"US
Cattle markets to be allowed only at authorised sites
In a bid to ensure public safety and manage rising traffic during Eidul Azha, Lahore's Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Dr Athar Waheed has announced round-the-clock patrolling across all 44 sectors of the city.
Special focus will be placed on areas near major cattle markets, where dedicated traffic police camps have been established.
These camps are equipped with public address systems and water facilities to assist commuters and buyers.
""E-Challan defaulters will face immediate action. All violators will be dealt with strictly,"" said Dr Waheed. ""We aim to ensure a smooth and secure experience for citizens during Eid.""
The announcement comes as part of a broader province-wide security and traffic plan rolled out by the Punjab Home Department.
Amid increased public movement and security concerns during the festive season, authorities are implementing strict protocols at Eidgahs, mosques, markets, and other public venues.
Only organisations registered with the Punjab Charity Commission will be permitted to collect sacrificial animal hides. The Home Department reiterated that banned outfits will face a zero-tolerance policy.
""All districts have been directed to formulate special security plans, including surveillance and screening measures,"" said a spokesperson for the Home Department.
The deputy commissioners have been empowered to impose Section 144 wherever necessary to maintain peace and order.
Entry and exit points across the province will be closely monitored, with divisional and district intelligence committees instructed to finalize security arrangements immediately. Cattle markets are to be established strictly at designated locations outside city limits, with a ban on animal sales elsewhere.
Security around sensitive locations will be reinforced through coordinated, intelligence-based search operations.
Major Eid congregations will feature walk-through gates, CCTV cameras, and on-ground screening teams. The Punjab Sound Systems (Regulations) Act 2015 will be strictly enforced to prevent sectarian or inflammatory speech, with violators facing swift legal action.
Hospitals have been placed on high alert and instructed to ensure adequate medical supplies and full staff availability.

Tirah Valley tribes cobble up peace force,"US
The initiative reflects a growing resolve among local communities to restore peace
A joint tribal peace force locally known as Aman Lashker has been established in the Tirah Valley of Khyber tribal district, comprising members from the Zakhakhel, Malik Deen Khel, and Shalobar clans, according to an official statement.
The declaration urges local residents to actively support the administration in combating terrorism and emphasizes that facilitation or support of terrorists will not be tolerated.
Citizens are also advised to keep their children away from extremist elements and refrain from providing shelter or food to terrorists.
The initiative reflects a growing resolve among local communities to restore peace and resist militant influence in the region.
It may be recalled that on May 23, three young men were abducted and brutally executed by suspected terrorists on charges of espionage in the volatile Tirah Valley.
The victims – identified as Ibrahim, son of Masoor, Samad, son of Piyo Khan, and Naveed, son of Sher Ghulam – belonged to the local Malik Din Khel tribe.
The three were abducted by suspected terrorists on Thursday, according to sources. Their bodies were found dumped in an open field early Friday morning. They were apparently shot execution style.
The bodies were found by local tribesmen.
The grisly discovery whipped up fear and panic among local tribesmen who called on the government and security forces to take immediate action and restore law and order in the scenic Tirah Valley, where the Mangal Bagh-led banned Lashkar-e-Islam (LeI) terrorist group once held sway.
Bagh, along with his loyalists, had fled to the Afghan province of Nangarhar, which borders Tirah Valley, in 2010 after a series of military operations and growing resentment among local population against his vigilantism.
Bagh's LeI has since established a symbiotic relationship with other terrorist groups sheltering in Afghanistan to carry out hit-an-run attacks in Pakistan.
Last week, the military claimed that 22 terrorists were killed and 18 others injured in a series of intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Tirah valley during the past month.
The raids were carried out following an uptick in terrorist violence targeting civilians and security personnel in the area.

Inflation risks mount despite macro stability,"US
Finance ministry economic report flags inflation spike; FX rise by $70m to $16.6b
The latest monthly economic outlook report has raised concerns about a potential increase in inflation ahead of the upcoming budget. Inflation for the current month is expected to remain between 1.5% and 2%, with a possible rise to 3-4% next month. In April, the annual inflation rate stood at a low 0.3%.
The report highlights continued growth in exports and remittances, along with a gradual recovery in large-scale manufacturing. Production of vehicles and imports of raw materials have increased, although large-scale manufacturing recorded a 1.47% decline between July and March. Favourable weather conditions and additional water supply are expected to boost agricultural output, which should contribute positively to overall economic growth.
Remittances grew by 30.9% over ten months, reaching $31.21 billion, while exports increased by 6.8%, totalling $27.27 billion between July and April. The current account remained in surplus at $188 million. Imports rose by 11.8% to $48.61 billion. However, foreign direct investment dropped by 2.8% to $178 million. Tax revenue increased by 26.3% to Rs930 billion, and non-tax revenue surged by 69.9% to Rs409.9 billion. Meanwhile, the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) foreign exchange reserves rose to $11.4 billion.
Overall, the report signals cautious optimism for economic growth amid inflationary pressures.
The SBP's foreign exchange reserves increased by $70 million during the week ended May 23, 2025, reaching $11.516 billion, according to data released on Thursday, according to the SBP's latest data.
The country's total liquid foreign reserves stood at $16.637 billion. Of this, $5.121 billion was held by commercial banks, while the SBP accounted for the remaining $11.516 billion.
Rupee records slight gain
Meanwhile, the Pakistani rupee regained slightly against the US dollar, gaining 0.04% in the interbank market on Thursday.
By the end of trading, the rupee closed at 282.07, improving by Rs0.10 against the dollar.
The interbank market remained closed on Wednesday due to the Yaum-e-Takbeer holiday.
On Tuesday, the rupee had ended at 282.17.
The US dollar strengthened sharply on Thursday after a court struck down former President Donald Trump's proposed Liberation Day import tariffs, posting strong gains against the euro, yen, and Swiss franc.
Gold remains steady
Moreover, gold prices in Pakistan remained steady on Thursday, mirroring the international market where prices edged higher amid volatile trading, supported by weaker US jobs data and a court decision blocking key tariffs imposed during former President Donald Trump's term. Locally, the price of gold per tola held firm at Rs349,300, while the rate for 10 grams also remained unchanged at Rs299,468, as reported by the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA).
On Wednesday, the per tola price had climbed by Rs1,400 to reach Rs349,300.
Commenting on market trends, Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, said the market hit a low of $3,250 and a high of $3,320 before settling at $3,300. He noted that the market did rebound from its low, but a close above the $3,330-$3,340 range is crucial to maintain stability. If it falls below the $3,270-$3,260 mark, prices could slide further to $3,220 or even $3,200, he warned.
Globally, gold prices rose in volatile trading on Thursday, aided by softer jobs data, while market participants also digested a court ruling that blocked most of US President Donald Trump's tariffs, according to Reuters.
Spot gold reversed course to rise 0.9% to $3,319.22 an ounce, as of 1337 GMT, after hitting its lowest since May 20 earlier in the session.

Balochistan opposition stages walkout,"DE
Lawmakers protest B-Area conversion into A-Area
The Balochistan Assembly session on Thursday was marked by heightened political tensions, as opposition lawmakers staged a walkout in protest against the provincial government's decision to convert B-Area into A-Area.
The opposition denounced the move as unilateral and criticized the lack of consultation or parliamentary debate.
Opposition legislators accused the government of bypassing democratic procedures and excluding elected representatives from critical administrative decisions. They argued that a change of such magnitude, affecting the province's governance structure, warranted consensus rather than executive imposition.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti rejected the opposition's concerns, labeling the walkout as a politically motivated attempt to apply pressure ahead of the forthcoming provincial budget. He defended the decision, stating it aimed to enhance governance and improve law and order across the province.
Supporting the chief minister's stance, treasury members Zarak Mandokhail and Ali Madad Jatak emphasized that the B-Area to A-Area transition was a provincial prerogative rooted in public interest.
While acknowledging that input from the federal government would be welcomed, they maintained that the decision was made independently by the provincial leadership.
Opposition Leader Younas Aziz Zehri delivered a pointed rebuttal, asserting that the provincial budget belongs to the people and must reflect their priorities. He warned that while the government might navigate the current fiscal cycle, its overall five-year performance would remain under scrutiny.
Zehri reaffirmed the opposition's commitment to playing its constitutional and democratic role, ensuring that budgetary decisions serve the public good rather than partisan interests.

Exhibit showcases German artist's mesmerising art,"US
Her work celebrates shared cultural heritage, drawing in local and foreign enthusiasts
Pakistan National Council of the Arts, National Art Gallery, Islamabad hosted the highly anticipated solo exhibition titled: ""Intention vs Convention: Fluid Presence"" by renowned German artist Dagmar Rauwald which will go on till June 3.
The event included an immersive workshop and presented a vibrant celebration of shared cultural heritage and creative exchange between Pakistan and Germany. The event was graced by Pakistan's Ambassador to Germany, Ambassador Shahid Kamal.
During the event, Dagmar Rauwald, a dynamic artist based in Hamburg, presented a captivating body of work that thrives on emotional expressiveness and conceptual depth. Her paintings, applied to transparent film with bold, sweeping gestures, evoke a tension between fluidity and solidity, lightness and opacity. By embracing transparent foils — either layered or singular — Rauwald immerses viewers in the immediacy of the present, abstracting real-world events influenced by media imagery and socio-political narratives.
Her exploration of hybridity and evolving visual codes invites a profound dialogue that bridges Western and Eastern traditions, drawing inspiration from the fluid rhythm of Urdu calligraphy. Through her concept of ""fluid presence,"" Rauwald's art created a multilayered hermeneutic experience, resonating with contemporary discourses on gender, identity and the autonomy of artistic expression. Her mastery of technique and her commitment to fostering transcultural exchange have earned her national and international recognition.
Central to the event's success was the visionary curatorship of Farrah Mehmood, an esteemed Pakistani visual artist and educator. Farrah's dedication to nurturing cultural dialogue and artistic excellence elevated the exhibition, illuminating a path for future collaborations between Pakistan and Germany.
The event was further supported by Dr Carsten Brosda, Senator for Culture and Media, Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, whose message of congratulations reflected his vision for sustained artistic exchanges between Hamburg and Islamabad. His emphasis on the importance of intercultural dialogue — particularly during these complex global times — resonated deeply with the event's purpose.
In its entirety, this landmark event demonstrated that art is not merely an aesthetic pursuit but a bridge that connects cultures, fosters mutual understanding, and builds a more harmonious world. The collective efforts of Shahid Kamal's inspiring leadership, Farrah Mehmood's curatorial brilliance, Mariam Ahmed's direction and Dagmar Rauwald's bold artistic expression stand as a testament to the transformative power of creativity, diplomacy and vision.
As this exhibition concludes, it leaves behind not just beautiful works and inspired minds but also a blueprint for future collaborations that will continue to strengthen the cultural, artistic, and educational ties between Pakistan and Germany.
The opening drew a diverse audience from the arts, media, diplomatic community, and development sectors. It was well-attended and warmly received, with visitors appreciating the variety of perspectives and the shared message that photography speaks across languages and backgrounds. The exhibition will remain open to the public until June 3, 2025, and can be visited during official PNCA gallery hours. PNCA has also announced a painting workshop by Dagmar.

On being an art historian and a theorist,"US
.
Dear Dr Mussarrat Hassan,
To a masoomana question: Why am I more interested in art history and theory than in making art? My straightforward answer was that right after my graduation from NCA, I was given a class to teach History of Culture and Visual Arts and not painting. Can't say if it was Mrs Hashmi's foresight or mere fate.
The fact is that I was among the few who could connect with Prof Iqbal Hassan, our Western Art History instructor, his pace and pedagogy. While others would avoid attending his lectures, finding them taxing or somewhat unimportant for studio practice, we, a group of enthusiasts, would ask for extra time and discussions.
However, it was not until I met you during my PhD coursework that I truly realised the importance of theoretical aspects of artmaking without which contemporary art would be a meaningless activity. You taught the History of South Asian Art, introducing us to local art forms.
Learning about indigenous art gave a clearer insight into Dr Durre's question: Who Am I? Since then, you have been the greatest source of inspiration and a true mentor who encouraged me to be consistent in writing. I have been told that I am good at storytelling which is, frankly, the ultimate constant in my equation.
Quoting from my grade six scrapbook: ""I chase stories like fireflies on summer nights, capturing their essence in jars of imagination, where they dance and shimmer, lighting the path ahead,"" Only if I remember being so romantic.
But it is romantic to devote oneself to a cause and be hopeful that it shall bear fruit. If so, you are the most romantic person I ever came across. And I am not just referring to your love story with Sir Ijaz-ul Hassan, to whom you have been a muse, a partner and a support system. Mashallah.
Your story as an art educationist and historian is worth sharing. Towards the end of the 20th century, academics worldwide were eager to decolonise the canon of art history. The discipline grew presence in educational institutions within Pakistan, too.
Universities launched degree programmes with a focus on producing and preparing scholars to add to the global voices. There was a need to sensitise the students to local art. It required more focus on genuine pedagogies, relevant to this region. Such an approach demanded surveys and anthologies of art history compiled by unbiased writers who could highlight the South Asian aesthetic sensibilities.
Though the scarcity of such writers is felt even today, you stand out amongst the few who opted to combat the situation and concentrated on research and writing as early as the 1990s. Producing five books with limited resources, a gap in research literacy and a lack of recognition for the expertise is a great feat indeed.
In the pre-digital era, these books on art are, as you say, ""the 2nd best alternative to living works of art. It is another way of exhibiting and displaying art, especially in the absence of permanent art galleries in various districts and cities of Pakistan."" Your books are a treat for the layman, a treasure for the art students and a model for the new generation of art historians that you have trained over the period.
Qadeem Insaan Aur Fan-e Musawwari, published in 1996, is amongst the very few art history surveys written in Urdu. Providing Urdu explanations for frequently used English terminology makes it somewhat bilingual. It typically traces the art through the ages and is surely an alternative to the most popular survey book in English with the same title.
The second book, Painting in Punjab Plains, is based on your doctoral research. It documents and analyses the works of 200 artists from Punjab, active between 1849 and 1947. The history of South Asian art, as a modern genre, mainly relied upon the court chronicles of the emperors and British State gazetteers. The authenticity of both sources is tainted with political motives and personal bias. Contrary to such narratives, your commentary is based on facts and common sense.
With due respect and all the regards, I shall write again to discuss other books.
Bano

"No, Mawra Hocane has not chopped off her hair","IE
Actor surprises IG followers with wispy bangs
Rest assured, anxious fans, Mawra Hocane has no plans of getting rid of her long hair. She confirmed the news, which might come as a relief to some, in a recent Instagram Story: ""Clearly never getting a bob cut.""
It seems it was a lighthearted prank on the Jafaa actor's part when she teased fans with the idea of a hair transformation in an earlier post. ""Will you forgive me if I told you I got a bob?"" she wrote on Monday, below photos of her hair pinned to the side and set to give the false impression of a shoulder-length cut.
Long-hair lovers were quick to comment their disapproval under the post, including fellow actor Minal Khan who declared with a laughing emoji, ""Never.""
Devoted fans, on the other hand, were confident that Mawra wouldn't test the waters when it comes to her hair. ""You and bob? Never. The infinite love you have for your long, healthy, and pretty hair is proof that this will not happen anytime soon, Mawra,"" a user wrote.
But given how the actor glowed in her photos, some even approved the false look. ""Pretty, little stunner. The short hair isn't just a look, it's a whole vibe on you. Masha Allah,"" a netizen said.
Mawra couldn't keep up the facade for too long, as in the very next pose she flaunted her silky hair in its full length and glory. The only addition were the short strands falling over her forehead because bangs are as far as the Sabaat actor can go when it comes to cutting her hair. Donning an elegant white sari, she wrote, ""In my 'I'd die for you' glam era.""
Fans rushed to offer their compliments for both the hair and the sari. ""Loving the bangs!"" a user gushed, while another pointed out, ""The way she glows ten times brighter in a white sari!""

FIA arrests Italy-bound fake resident card holders,"US
Six passengers belong to various parts of K-P, Rawalpindi
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Immigration Unit at New Islamabad International Airport detained seven passengers attempting to travel to Italy using fake resident cards.
An agent allegedly facilitating their journey was also arrested on the premises.
According to officials, the incident occurred during the briefing for flight J2144 bound for Baku, Azerbaijan.
Six passengers from various parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Rawalpindi, along with their facilitator, Muhammad Haroon, approached the immigration counter.
Upon inspection, their travel documents were found to be counterfeit.
The detained passengers were identified as Muhammad Sher, Salman Khan, Muhammad Haris Khan, Waliullah, Ehtesham Sharafat, and Sameenullah.
During initial questioning, they were unable to explain the purpose of their trip to Baku.
Authorities later discovered that all seven individuals were related and had been provided with fake Italian resident cards by an agent named Shakirullah, who was also present at the airport.
An FIA team conducted a raid inside the concourse hall and arrested Shakirullah. During searches, counterfeit Italian resident cards and Turkish visas were recovered from the passengers.
Muhammad Haroon had arranged the Azeri and Turkish visas, intending for the group to use them as a stepping stone to enter Europe.

'I want to win World Cup for Pak',"US
Hasan Ali was impressive on his return in national colours
Pakistan pacer Hasan Ali on Thursday expressed his strong desire to help Pakistan win the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2026, calling every match an opportunity to prove himself after a tough battle with injury and rehabilitation.
Speaking on the Pakistan Cricket Board's podcast, Hasan reflected on his journey back to the national side and the emotional weight of returning to form.
""If you ask me, I want to play for Pakistan in the World Cup and win it for my country. For me, every match is now an opportunity, and I will give my 100 percent,"" he said.
The 30-year-old made a stunning comeback on Wednesday in the first T20I against Bangladesh at Gaddafi Stadium, taking a five-wicket haul and becoming only the fourth Pakistani bowler to achieve this feat in T20Is.
Hasan emphasised that while a player's performance can fluctuate, consistent effort is non-negotiable.
""Performance may vary, but your effort on the field should always be visible. At the end of the day, I want to leave the field with the satisfaction that I gave my all,"" he said.
Reflecting on his injury and the rehab phase, Hasan said the journey back was filled with challenges.
""Coming back from injury is never easy. There is a unique pressure to it. I am grateful and proud that I managed to get fit again. A lot of hard work went into it, and I am finally seeing the results,"" Hasan said.
He described his return to the Pakistan team as a dream come true and reaffirmed his determination to perform at the highest level.
""It feels like a dream has come true. I am very excited and committed to performing well for the team. There is no substitute for hard work,"" he concluded.
Nawaz wants to win
Pakistan's aggressive batter Hasan Nawaz on Thursday expressed his strong determination to deliver top performances for the national team.
He revealed that he has now been assigned a middle-order role, which he is fully committed to fulfilling.
Hasan played a blistering innings of 44 runs off just 22 balls, including four sixes and two fours, in the first T20I against Bangladesh on Wednesday - a knock that played a key role in Pakistan's victory.
The 22-year-old also impressed in the Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10 while playing for Quetta Gladiators, where he finished as the third-highest run-scorer.
Hasan amassed 399 runs in the tournament, including one century and three half-centuries.
Speaking on the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) podcast, Hasan said that although he has primarily opened the batting throughout his career, he is now ready to adapt to his new responsibility in the middle order.
""I have always been an opener. I did not know I could perform this well in the middle order too. But now that I have been given the role, I will try my best to fulfill it,"" he said.
Hasan also shared that he never succumbs to pressure - rather, he thrives under it.
""Whether it's domestic cricket or the PSL, I have never felt pressure. I actually play better under pressure, and that is why my performance remains strong.""
Expressing his ambitions, Hasan said he aims to play and win as many matches as possible for Pakistan. He also dreams of being part of a World Cup-winning squad.
""My goal is to play and win more matches for Pakistan. My dream is to be part of the team whenever Pakistan wins a major trophy,"" he concluded.

"Crypto currencies use is illegal, NA panel told","JP
The development came a day after Bilal Bin Saqib pitched crypto promotion during his US visit.
The federal government and the central bank reiterated on Thursday that the use of crypto currencies was illegal and anyone dealing in these currencies was liable to be investigated by the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).
The statements were made by Federal Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal and State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Executive Director Sohail Jawad during a meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance.
The development also came a day after the newly appointed Special Assistant to Prime Minister on crypto and blockchain, Bilal Bin Saqib, made a pitch for the promotion of cryptocurrencies during his visit to the United States.
Crypto is not a legal currency in Pakistan, said Bosal. He recommended that the committee invite the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) for further briefing. SAPM Bilal Bin Saqib is also the chief executive officer of the PCC.
""The work on the crypto currencies is at a very, very preliminary stage and whenever the government decides to take it further, we would recommend to first have a comprehensive legal and regulatory framework for it,"" Bosal said, adding that so far, there was no such framework.
Sitting on the committee, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) MNA Sharmila Faruqi raised the issue of the contradictory policy statements by the government with regard to the promotion of cryptocurrencies in Pakistan.
""There seems to be no legal framework for the cryptocurrencies despite the fact that Pakistan has recently come out of the Financial Action Task Force [FATF] grey list,"" she said.
In reply, Jawad hoped that the PCC would involve other stakeholders to agree on a robust legal and regulatory framework.
Whereas the finance secretary was telling the National Assembly committee that the use of cryptocurrencies was illegal in Pakistan, his ministry was promoting these new currencies through a different set of announcements, at least two of them coming out this week.
Jawad, the SBP executive director, said that in 2018, the central bank had issued instructions to its regulated entities. ""Under these instructions that are still valid, the trading and holding of the crypto currencies is illegal, and these entities are bound to report such cases to the FMU for ongoing investigation by the FIA"", he said.
Earlier in the day, a finance ministry statement quoted Bilal Bin Saqib as saying that the government of Pakistan has allocated 2,000 megawatts of surplus electricity in Phase 1 for Bitcoin mining and artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.
Bilal Bin Saqib further stated that this would open doors to sovereign miners, tech firms, and clean energy partners worldwide. To harness this momentum, Saqib is also leading the creation of the Pakistan Digital Assets Authority (PDAA), it added.
The PDAA would be a regulatory body designed to empower builders, protect investors, and formalise digital finance frameworks for the future, according to the ministry. However, the committee proceedings revealed a gulf between Pakistan's legal framework and the country's ambitions to go on the path to promoting digital currencies.
The SBP executive director said that there was only one country in the world that declared crypto as legal tender but it too had decided to withdraw the decision. He stated that there were different forms of digital currencies, including bitcoins, stable coins, other coins and non-fungible tokens and all these classes would require a separate set of regulations.
Even if the crypto currencies are banned as legal tenders, it is still being used for sending money overseas, including for buying used cars from Japan, said MNA Usama Mela of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI). There is an impression that the government itself was going to mine coins by using the 2000 megawatts of recently allocated electricity, he added.
The committee also inquired about the legal backing of the council to which the finance secretary said that so far, the council was working under the executive orders of the prime minister but the government was planning to bring a law to give it the legal cover.
The way the crypto currencies are promoted in the media by the government, the people have started heavily investing in it that also caused a rise in the prices, said Mirza Ikhtiar Baig of the PPP.
The Finance Ministry said in its press release that Bilal Bin Saqib spoke in front of an elite audience that included the US Vice President JD Vance, Eric Trump, and Donald Trump Jr, at the Bitcoin Vegas 2025. Delivering a keynote speech, he unveiled the country's first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve - and with it, a radically new vision of Pakistan on the global map, the Finance Ministry added.
""Pakistan is no longer defined by its past. It is being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation - powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen,"" Bilal stated.
""I'm not just here as a minister,"" he continued, ""I'm here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.""
Bilal announced the establishment of a national Bitcoin wallet, holding digital assets already in state custody, not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signaling long-term belief in decentralised finance. He also thanked President Donald Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.

PPPP protests Rs50m grant to Lahore Bar,"JP
Party submits  formal 'Call Attention Notice' in the K-P provincial assembly
The Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) has strongly protested the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister's decision to allocate a grant of Rs50 million to the Lahore High Court Bar Association.
In response, the party has submitted a formal 'Call Attention Notice' in the K-P provincial assembly.
The notice was submitted to the Assembly Secretariat by PPPP Parliamentary Leader, Ahmad Karim Kundi. It states that the provincial government, in its upcoming cabinet meeting, has placed the proposed grant for the Lahore High Court Bar Association as the last item on the agenda.
The notice raises serious concerns, questioning the government's priorities in light of the current challenges faced by K-P.
The province is grappling with deteriorating law and order conditions as well as a worsening economic crisis. Under such circumstances, the notice argues, it is unjustifiable for the provincial leadership to approve such a large sum from K-P's resources for an institution based in another province.
""The Chief Executive of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has no justification for allocating provincial funds to political bodies or institutions outside the province,"" Kundi stated.
The PPPP has demanded a clear explanation from the provincial government regarding its stance and the rationale behind this financial decision.
On the other hand, Senator Wali Khan condemned the move, accusing the K-P government of misusing taxpayers' money by distributing it among 'political friends of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).'

Cancer patients to get instant biopsy reports,"US
JPMC to introduce confocal instant digital pathology system at surgical complex
For the first time in Pakistan, immediate biopsy reports of suspected cancer patients will be possible in a government hospital. Under the development projects for the upcoming fiscal year, the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) will introduce a confocal instant digital pathology system, enabling real-time detection of tumor nature and spread during the surgery.
Suspected cancer patients will now receive immediate biopsy reports even at government hospitals. The JPMC is set to become Pakistan's first public hospital to implement the confocal instant digital pathology system, allowing surgeons to determine tumor type and extent in real-time during surgeries.
Professor Shahid Rasool, Executive Director of Jinnah Hospital Karachi, stated that the technology was previously available in private hospitals only. However, it will now be installed at Jinnah Hospital with the support of Sindh Health Department under the Sindh government's Annual Development Programme.
He said that the technology processes samples and creates slides during surgery, allowing immediate determination whether a tumor is present and, if so, how far it has spread. Patients will no longer have to wait 14 to 15 days for biopsy results.
Two advanced units will be purchased at a cost of Rs366 million. One unit will be installed in the surgical complex, benefiting general surgery, orthopaedics, thoracic, and ENT departments, while the second unit will be set up in the gynaecology ward.
The aim of the project is not only to increase the speed and accuracy of biopsies but also to reduce the time patients remain under anaesthesia. Current methods, such as frozen section and core biopsies, take longer to produce reports, which can endanger patients' lives.
The project also includes training for medical staff and improving technical expertise alongside the procurement of modern machines.
Hospital officials said this system will be particularly beneficial for poor and middle-class patients who cannot afford expensive treatments at private hospitals.

CM orders steps to lower bread price,"JP
Urges close monitoring of the rates of chicken, vegetables and pulses
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif has decided to reduce the price of 'roti' in the province.

Ransom plot foiled in dramatic late-night police operation,"DE
Two of the suspects were arrested following the exchange of fire
Shahrah-e-Noor Jahan Police arrested four alleged kidnappers, including one injured, after an exchange of fire late Wednesday night, recovering weapons, a vehicle, mobile phones, cash. The abducted victim was rescued.
According to a police spokesperson, the suspects were involved in short-term kidnappings for ransom. The operation unfolded near the KDA Chowrangi bridge. Police said the shootout began after officers attempted to intercept the suspects, who responded by opening fire.
The injured suspect, identified as 25-year-old Muhammad Ashar, son of Muhammad Ashfaq, was shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for treatment. The other arrested suspects were identified as Kamran, Irfan, and Danial.
Two of the suspects were arrested following the exchange of fire, while the remaining two were caught shortly afterward by additional police personnel who had surrounded the area.
The police had received intelligence that a man named Muhammad Shakeel had been kidnapped and the suspects were demanding ransom. The kidnappers had instructed Shakeel's brother to bring the ransom to Sakhi Hassan Chowrangi. Acting on this tip, police, dressed in plain clothes, laid a trap at the location.
As the suspects arrived, police attempted to arrest them, but the kidnappers opened fire and tried to flee. A chase ensued, culminating in their capture near KDA Chowrangi bridge. Shakeel was recovered unharmed during the operation.

Tate brothers charged with rape,"US
UK prosecutors say Andrew, Tristan also involved in trafficking
Avowed misogynist and radical social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother have been charged with several counts of rape, assault and trafficking, UK prosecutors said on Wednesday, as per AFP.
he accusations, which date back to between 2012 to 2015, were authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in January 2024, but have only been revealed now.
""We can confirm that we have authorised charges against Andrew and Tristan Tate for offences including rape, human trafficking, controlling prostitution and actual bodily harm against three women,"" prosecutors said in a statement.
Former kickboxer Andrew, 38, faces 10 charges including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution relating to all three women.
Meanwhile, as reported by the Telegraph, Andrew's brother, Tristan, 36, has been charged with 11 offences including rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking charges connected to one alleged victim, who has also accused Andrew.
What prosecutors say
""A European Arrest Warrant was issued in England in 2024, and as a result the Romanian courts ordered the extradition to the UK of Andrew and Tristan Tate,"" said prosecutors. ""However, the domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first.""
Judges in Romania previously ruled both Tate brothers could be sent back to Britain after criminal proceedings in the Eastern European country.
In addition to his most recent charges, Andrew Tate is also being sued by four other women, after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with a criminal case in 2019.
Lawyer Matt Jury, representing those women, said: ""We welcome the clarity from the Crown Prosecution Service that our authorities are working to ensure the Tates face justice here in the UK – they cannot be allowed to escape extradition.""
The lawyer continued, ""At the same time, we ask once more that CPS admit its mistake in failing to prosecute Tate when he lived in the UK and finally charge him for the rape and assault of the other three women, our clients, who originally filed criminal complaints against him as long ago as 2014 but were failed by the system. They deserve justice, too.""
Andrew Tate faces legal action in several countries, including some cases where he is accused alongside his brother.
In Romania, the Tate brothers face separate allegations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.
Both men, who have dual British-US nationality, have denied all charges against them. Andrew Tate hit back with a post on the social network X on Wednesday.
""The UK government accuses the 'innocent' while murderers, violent illegals, and corrupt leaders walk free. This is not justice - it's betrayal!,"" he wrote.
Tate, the figurehead of the online masculinist movement, went to Florida with his brother in February, marking the first time they had left Romania since their 2022 arrest. They travelled to Dubai in April, but returned to Romania a few days ago to report to police as they are required to do.
Justice
In a separate civil case before the UK High Court, four British women have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control.
Tate moved to Romania years ago after first starting a webcam business in Britain. The self-proclaimed misogynist first appeared on UK reality television show Big Brother, but was removed after a controversial video emerged.
However, he then turned to social media platforms to promote his divisive views on how to be successful and reject feminism. He shot to fame on TikTok in 2022, where he regularly informs his followers that women belong in the kitchen and serve their male partners.
Tate is followed by more than 10.7 million people on the social network X, where he shares his vision of masculinity and often homophobic and racist posts. Academics have previously warned that Tate and other ""manosphere"" influencers have increased misogyny among schoolboys, with pupils using them ""to justify harassment or derogation of women"".

Nepal take cricket to new heights with T20 league,"PL
All eight NPL franchises fetch a combined price of around 169 million Nepali rupees
Glamorgan all-rounder Dan Douthwaite was not alone among the foreign players in being unsure what to expect when he headed to the Himalayas to take part in the inaugural Nepal Premier League (NPL) late last year.
Taking up a playing contract in the mountainous nation of 30 million was always going to be a novel challenge for the Englishman, not least because the Twenty20 league was staged at a ground some 1,350 metres above sea level. ""I thought I was going to be constantly out of breath or struggling, but it wasn't actually as bad as I thought it was going to be,"" the 28-year-old recalled of his time playing for the Kathmandu Gurkhas.
""I think I noticed it more so with sixes. When they got the ball it absolutely went miles. A lot of balls ... kept going and going and going. ""When you think you've hit one straight up and it's a 70-metre six.""
Apart from the extra flight of the ball at the Tribhuvan University International Cricket Ground near Kathmandu, Douthwaite's other big takeaway from the experience was the enthusiasm of the Nepali fans.
""Cricket in Nepal is probably like the Premier League in England ... there's a kind of almost Indian cricket feel about the way people appreciate and love the game,"" he told Reuters.
The NPL hopes the passion of the fans, combined with the country's unique geography and society, will carve out a niche in a landscape dominated by the likes of the IPL and Australia's Big Bash League.
""We're rich in terms of nature,"" said Sandesh Katwal, the chief executive of the Gurkhas, one of eight NPL franchises. ""It's a beautiful country and we're a friendly, welcoming people. The weather, the hospitality suits international players."" Former England batting all-rounder and IPL veteran Ravi Bopara, who turned out for Chitwan Rhinos, said it was a great experience, even if he turned down the offer of a helicopter trip to Everest Base Camp.
A modest budget meant the NPL could not attract the really big names in the sport. All eight NPL franchises fetched a combined price of under 169 million Nepali rupees ($1.23 million) at an auction held last September. Prize money for the champions, Janakpur Bolts, was around $81,000.
A rushed first season also made it difficult to recruit international players, Katwal said. Nevertheless, the NPL proved to be an effective proving ground for Nepal's domestic talent. Katwal said he hoped the NPL would provide that valuable competitive experience, as the IPL has done for young Indian talents.

"Authorities on alert for heatwave, downpour","US
PMD issues five-day heat alert for Punjab
Amid a dual threat of extreme heat and an early onset of heavy monsoon rainfall, with temperatures soaring to nearly 50 degrees Celsius and reports of deaths and injuries in rain-related incidents, authorities have issued multiple advisories, calling for emergency preparedness across several regions.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a five-day heatwave alert for Punjab, placing the province under heightened surveillance as temperatures rise across several districts. Alongside the heatwave, officials have also warned of the risk of widespread flooding during the upcoming rain.
Southern Punjab remains under a ""Heatwave Emergency"", with cities including Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Multan experiencing severe heatwave.
Central Punjab — comprising Lodhran, Vehari, Khanewal, Toba Tek Singh, Faisalabad and Jhang — has been issued a ""Hot Day Warning"".
Meanwhile, Lahore, Gujranwala and Sheikhupura in the northeast are under a ""Hot Day Alert"", with prolonged exposure to high temperatures continuing to affect residents.
In its latest daily update, the PMD confirmed that several cities recorded temperatures as high as 48 degrees Celsius in the past 24 hours, including Mohenjo-Daro, Jacobabad and Shaheed Benazirabad in Sindh, and Sibi in Balochistan.
It said that Dera Ghazi Khan in southern Punjab, Dadu and Larkana in Sindh and Turbat in Balochistan followed closely at 47 degrees. ""A persistent high-pressure system has fuelled the extremely dry and hot weather across much of the country's low-lying areas.""
Alongside the heatwave, officials have also warned of the risk of widespread flooding during the upcoming monsoon season. The department's seasonal outlook projects above-average rainfall from July through September, particularly in central and southern regions.
North-eastern Punjab and parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are also likely to receive significantly above-normal rainfall, heightening the threat of urban flooding in major cities such as Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Karachi.
Authorities are closely monitoring the possibility of flash floods in hilly regions, even as areas in northern Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B) and parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P), are forecast to receive below-normal precipitation.
As per weather forecast, a new weather system is expected to bring thunderstorms, strong winds and isolated hail to the upper regions of the country. The latest alert warns of potential damage to infrastructure, particularly to vulnerable assets such as electric poles, solar panels, trees and vehicles.
According to Rescue 1122 officials, a child died in Bahadurgaon in Attock district, where five other children were injured. A girl was injured when a wall collapsed in Jasian village in the same district. Two people went into shock after lightning struck in Rawalpindi.
In Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, four people were killed and 10 were injured in rain-related incidents across different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday, officials said.

Index rises 638 points as global cues, policy hopes boost confidence
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) opened with renewed vigour on Thursday following a day's closure to mark Youm-e-Takbeer, which reflects the nation's nuclear achievements and military strength.
The KSE-100 index gained ground as global equities rallied after a US court blocked the imposition of President Trump's new tariffs. European shares and US stock futures rose, lifting the mood at the PSX.
Additionally, optimism ahead of the presentation of Pakistan Economic Survey and the federal budget on June 9 and 10, respectively, fuelled a buying spree, with expectations of relief for the agriculture sector, a narrowing fiscal deficit and export-friendly US trade measures.
Crude oil gains supported energy stocks while blue chips led the advance of the index, which oscillated between the intra-day high of 119,639 and intra-day low of 118,482.
Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti commented that stocks closed higher amid speculation in the pre-budget session with investors expecting relief for the agri-sector and as Pakistan-India tensions eased.
Expectations of US tariff and trade incentives supporting exports, a falling fiscal deficit and surging global crude oil prices aided the bullish close at the PSX, he added.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index posted a notable rise of 638.50 points, or 0.54%, and settled at 118,971.41.
Topline Securities, in its review, wrote that the local bourse kicked off trading on a strong footing and wrapped up the session with a surge of 638 points (+0.54%) at 118,971.
Intra-day excitement peaked with a high of 1,306 points, reflecting bullish sentiment across the board. Heavyweights stocks of sectors like cement, bank, fertiliser and oil contributed 413 points to the index gains, it said.

""Heading into the week's final session, the KSE-100 is down 0.11% week-on-week, with a sustained move towards 120k likely,"" it added.
KTrade Securities remarked that activity at the PSX remained focused on blue-chip stocks, with cement, bank, fertiliser, communication and oil shares adding a cumulative 450 points to the index.
Despite budget concerns, confidence emerged towards the end of the rollover week and focus was expected to be on blue chips, it predicted.
According to JS Global analyst Muhammad Hasan Ather, stocks witnessed a 0.5% surge, climbing 1,306 points to the intra-day high of 119,639, as investor sentiment strengthened amid expectations of fiscal discipline and IMF loan inflows.

Won't accept India's hegemony: COAS,"US
Field Marshal Munir calls water 'our red line'; Says no longer possible to ignore or silence Kashmiris
Pakistan will never accept Indian hegemony in the South Asian region, said Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir while reiterating his country's stance on sovereignty amid an uneasy ceasefire between the two hostile neighbours following a recent military confrontation that threatened to spiral into a wider conflict.
According to the military's media wing, the field marshal's remarks came during a wide-ranging interaction called 'Hilal Talks' held with vice chancellors, academics, and senior faculty members, where he spoke about the crucial role of educators in shaping the country's future generations. However, his address centered on Pakistan's unwavering stance on Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and growing concerns over India's regional policies.
""Pakistan will never accept Indian hegemony,"" Field Marshal Munir was quoted as saying by the ISPR as he underscored Islamabad's resolve on key disputes, including Kashmir and transboundary water sharing. He listed water security as a national priority. ""Water is Pakistan's red line, and we will not allow any compromise on this basic right of 240 million Pakistanis,"" he added.
The statement should be seen in the backdrop of India's recent decision to ""hold in abeyance"" the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), a 1960 World Bank-mediated agreement governing the distribution of the Indus river system's resources. Under the treaty, Pakistan holds rights to the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers, while India controls the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej rivers.
Islamabad has warned that any attempt by India to divert or obstruct Pakistan's share of water would be treated as ""an act of war,"" with a commitment to employ all elements of national power in response.
The army chief's remarks came days after a military confrontation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, triggered by ""reckless and provocative missile strikes"" by Indian warplanes on civilian infrastructure inside Pakistani territory. However, India was embarrassed in the escalation as six of its fighter jets, including three multibillion-dollar Rafales, were downed by Pakistan Air Force.
In retaliation for the Indian aggression, Pakistan's military launched Operation Bunyanum Marsoos (The Formidable Wall), targeting India's air bases, air fields, ammunition depots, and missile stockpiles in areas along the entire Pakistan border.
Operation Bunyanum Marsoos was part of Marka-e-Haq (The Battle for Truth), the official name given to the broader conflict with India from April 22 to May 10. ""In Marka-e-Haq, Allah Almighty helped Pakistan at every level.
""Marka-e-Haq is clear evidence that when a nation unites and stands like an iron wall, no power in the world can bring it down,"" Field Marshal Munir said in Thursday's interaction with the academia. ""Divine help is granted to those nations that stand firmly for the truth and struggle collectively for their cause,"" he added.
The Pakistan-India military confrontation was triggered by a deadly rampage by gunmen on the meadows of Pahalgam, in the IIOJK, in which 26 tourists were killed. Delhi blamed the incident on Pakistan without a shred of evidence and without investigation and launched the reckless military misadventure disregarding Pakistan's offer for help in impartial probe and global calls for resolving the matter diplomatically.
India's gambit backfired as it brought the global spotlight back on Kashmir, the disputed Himalayan region which India stripped off its autonomous status in August 2019 through a constitutional amendment. ""It is no longer possible to ignore or silence Kashmir on the global stage,"" Field Marshal Munir said, reiterating that Kashmir remains a core national issue that cannot be sidelined.
""India must understand that Pakistan will never abandon Kashmir. There can be no compromise on this,"" he said, adding that India's long-standing efforts to suppress the Kashmir issue have failed.
India – which accuses Pakistan of supporting terrorism – is seeking to externalise its internal problem. ""Terrorism is India's internal problem, stemming from rising oppression and prejudice against minorities, especially Muslims, while Kashmir is an international issue that cannot be equated with internal matters,"" the army chief said.
Gen Munir also spoke about the situation in Balochistan where Baloch groups, officially dubbed Fitna al Hindustan, have unleashed a wave of terror. The terrorist elements active in Balochistan are proxies acting on behalf of foreign interests, particularly India, he said. ""These terrorists are not Baloch. They are agents of disruption sponsored by India.""
The field marshal also called for reinforcing national unity, stressing the importance of institutional integrity and constitutional governance. ""We must build a strong Pakistan where all institutions function according to law, without political pressure, and for the welfare of the people,"" he said and urged rejection of any narrative aimed at weakening the state.
Praising the role of educators, he said, ""Teachers are the greatest asset of Pakistan. The responsibility of character building of future generations rests with you."" He credited his own success to his parents and teachers, saying, ""Whatever I am today is because of them.""
Participants in the session expressed their support for the armed forces, with one saying during the Q&A session: ""This safe homeland exists because of the sacrifices of our armed forces."" The session ended on a note of unity and resolve, with attendees pledging to stand by Pakistan's armed forces in defending the nation's sovereignty and ideals.
Spanning interactive sessions and group discussions on a range of international, regional and national issues, Hilal Talks are intended to act as a forum for perspective sharing among members of Pakistan's academic community, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
During the Q&A session, participants expressed their sentiments, saying: ""This safe homeland is secured by the uniform.""
They added: ""We are proud of Pakistan and our armed forces, and we will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with them.""
The forum concluded with a shared commitment to work together towards a more secure and prosperous Pakistan.

Coffee sector for duty cuts,"US
Stakeholders say removing 28% import duty on bulk instant coffee can unlock investment, lower prices, boost exports
Stakeholders in Pakistan's growing coffee sector are urging the government to eliminate the 28% combined Regulatory Duty (RD) and Additional Customs Duty (ACD) on bulk instant coffee imports, arguing the current levy is stifling industry growth and preventing the development of a domestic coffee market. The duties were imposed in June 2021 under SRO 840(I)/2021 and currently include a 15% RD and 2% ACD, with other charges making up the rest.
Industry sources point to the disparity between coffee and tea imports, which face only a 13% duty. They also note that the tariff on raw instant coffee is disproportionately high compared to finished coffee products, which attract duties between 42% and 53%.
According to industry representatives, this duty regime contradicts Pakistan's National Tariff Policy, which emphasises policy predictability, value addition, and industrial efficiency. They argue that eliminating the duties would significantly lower the landed cost of bulk instant coffee, making local manufacturing more feasible and encouraging investment in domestic processing, blending, and packaging facilities.
With rising demand for coffee — driven by remote work trends and a flourishing café culture — stakeholders believe that lower raw material costs would also help bring down consumer prices and make coffee more accessible across homes and offices nationwide.
They add that reducing duties would streamline the coffee supply chain, cut administrative costs, and offer consumers a wider variety of products at more competitive prices. Industry players see strong potential in exports, saying local producers could create value-added instant coffee and ready-to-drink beverages for international markets.

Can AI agents revamp online shopping?,"US
Digital aides help browse, find deals, buy items
Internet giants are diving deeper into e-commerce with digital aides that know shoppers' likes, let them virtually try clothes on, hunt for deals and even place orders.
The rise of virtual personal shoppers springs from generative artificial intelligence (AI) being put to work in ""agents"" specialising in specific tasks and given autonomy to complete them independently.
""This is basically the next evolution of shopping experiences,"" said CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino.
Google last week unveiled shopping features built into a new ""AI Mode"".
It can take a person's own photo and meld it with that of a skirt, shirt or other piece of clothing spotted online, showing how it will look on them.
The AI adjusts the clothing size to fit, accounting for how fabrics drape, according to Google head of advertising and commerce Vidhya Srinivasan.
Shoppers can then set the price they would pay and leave the AI to relentlessly browse the internet for a deal – alerting the shopper when it finds one, and asking if it should buy using Google's payment platform.
""They're taking on Amazon a little bit,"" Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart said of Google.
The tool is also a way to make money from AI by increasing online traffic and opportunities to show ads, Greengart added.
The Silicon Valley tech titan did not respond to a query regarding whether it is sharing in revenue from shopping transactions.
Analyst Zino does not expect AI shoppers to cause an e-commerce industry upheaval, but he does see the technology benefiting Google and Meta.
""They probably have more information on the consumer than anyone else out there,"" Zino said of Google and Meta.
Trusting a chatbot with one's buying decisions may spook some people, and while the technology might be in place the legal and ethical framework for it is not.
""The agent economy is here,"" said PSE Consulting managing director Chris Jones. ""The next phase of e-commerce will depend on whether we can trust machines to buy on our behalf.""

Kenyan literary icon Ngugi wa Thiong'o dies aged 87,"US
Author was considered east Africa's most influential writer
During his imprisonment, Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o decided he would never write in English again, a defiant move that helped put literature in African languages firmly on the map.
Ngugi died at the age of 87 on Wednesday, his daughter announced on Facebook.
""It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of our dad, Ngugi wa Thiong'o this Wednesday morning,"" wrote Wanjiku Wa Ngugi. ""He lived a full life, fought a good fight.""
Widely regarded as east Africa's most influential writer, Ngugi sought to forge a body of literature reflecting the land and people from which he came, and not follow in the footsteps of Western tradition.
""I believe so much in equality of languages. I am completely horrified by the hierarchy of languages,"" he told AFP in an interview in 2022 from California, where he lived in self-imposed exile.
His decision in the 1970s to abandon English in favour of his native Kikuyu, as well as Kenya's national language Swahili, was met with widespread incomprehension at first.
""We all thought he was mad... and brave at the same time,"" said Kenyan writer David Maillu. ""We asked ourselves who would buy the books.""
Yet the bold choice built his reputation and turned him into an African literary landmark.
The softly-spoken writer also lived a life as dramatic as his novels.
His criticism of post-colonial Kenya – describing the violence of the political class and the newly rich as ""the death of hopes, the death of dreams and the death of beauty"" – brought him into frequent conflict with the authorities.
'Decolonising the mind'
Born James Ngugi into a large peasant family in Kenya's central Limuru region on January 5, 1938, he spent the first 25 years of his life in what was then a British settler colony.
His early works were heavily influenced by his country's battle against colonial rule and the brutal Mau Mau war of 1952-1960.
In his first collection of essays, Homecoming, he described himself as a ""stranger in his home country"".
But his anger would later extend to the inequalities of post-colonial Kenyan society, incurring the wrath of the government.
In 1977, Ngugi and fellow writer Ngugi wa Mirii were jailed without charge after the staging of their play Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want).
It was then that he decided to write his first novel in Kikuyu, Devil on the Cross, which was published in 1980. He had already abandoned his ""English"" name to become Ngugi wa Thiong'o.
""I wrote it on the only paper available to me, which was toilet paper,"" he told US radio broadcaster NPR.
Amnesty International named him a prisoner of conscience, before a global campaign secured his release from Kamiti Maximum Security Prison in December 1978.
As early as 1965, Ngugi's novel The River Between embarked on a critical examination of the role of Christianity in an African setting.
""If the white man's religion made you abandon a custom and then did not give you something else of equal value, you became lost,"" he wrote.
He went into self-imposed exile in 1982 after a ban on theatre groups in Kenya, moving first to Britain then to the United States.
When Ngugi returned home on a visit in 2004, he was mobbed by supporters at Nairobi's airport.
""I have come back with an open mind, an open heart and open arms,"" he declared.
Days later, he and his wife were attacked by armed men: she was raped and he was beaten up. It was not clear whether robbery was the sole motive or whether the assault was politically motivated.
Margaretta wa Gacheru, a sociologist and former student of Ngugi, described him as a national icon.
""To me he's like a Kenyan Tolstoy, in the sense of being a storyteller, in the sense of his love of the language and panoramic view of society, his description of the landscape of social relations, of class and class struggles,"" she said. afp

Rain leaks into new HMC surgical unit,"US
Doctors use buckets while continuing with operation
A major construction flaw has been exposed at the newly built Orthopedic, Spine, and Trauma Unit of Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), which was developed at a cost of billions of rupees.
Just a day after its inauguration, rainwater began leaking from the ceiling of the operation theatre, raising serious concerns about the quality of construction.
A video showing water dripping from the ceiling during surgery went viral on social media, sparking public outrage. In the footage, surgeons can be seen placing buckets to catch the water while continuing with the operation.
According to sources, the operation theatre — part of the recently constructed Orthopedic Surgery and Spine Trauma Unit — resembled a waterfall scene as torrential rains poured in the day after it opened for patient use. The unit was under development for over a decade and had only just been made operational.
The new facility, comprising 110 beds, is described as a state-of-the-art unit offering specialized care in complex cases such as spinal injuries, oncology, arthroplasty, pediatric orthopedics, and infectious diseases. It also serves as a training center for both undergraduate medical students and postgraduate doctors. The unit is considered one of the busiest of its kind across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Sources further revealed that this is not the first instance of poor construction in public hospitals. Similar incidents — such as collapsed ceilings and water seepage — have previously been reported at Khyber Teaching Hospital, Lady Reading Hospital, and hospitals in Bannu.
Medical associations have reacted strongly to the incident. The Provincial Doctors Association (PDA) has termed the situation at HMC ""extremely alarming"" and demanded a transparent investigation. The PDA emphasized the need for accountability and a full audit to identify those responsible for the substandard construction.
The Association also stressed that public funds must be used efficiently, especially in projects related to healthcare infrastructure. The PDA reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining the highest standards of medical care and called for a detailed review of the construction process to prevent such incidents in the future.
Meanwhile, the K-P government has decided to introduce amendments to the Medical Transplantation Regulatory Authority (MTRA) law to curb the illegal trade of human organs, including kidneys, and to regulate organ transplants across the province. Currently, 12 cases of illegal transplants have been referred to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), and investigations are underway.

BCB president likely to step down,"US
Aminul Islam is the frontrunner to succeed Faruque
The president of the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Faruque Ahmed said on Thursday that the government has asked him to step down from his position, as the national authorities no longer wish for him to continue in the role.
Faruque, who assumed the BCB presidency on August 21 following the resignation of longtime chief Nazmul Hasan, was summoned on Wednesday by Asif Mahmud Shojib Bhuiyan, the Youth and Sports Affairs Adviser.
According to a report, Faruque was informed that the government no longer wishes for him to continue in the role.
Speaking to local media on Thursday, Faruque confirmed the development but noted that he has yet to make a final decision.
""The adviser said that they do not want to continue with me. I have not taken any decision yet regarding resignation. Let's see what happens,"" he said.
The situation places Bangladesh cricket in a delicate position. If Faruque is removed without stepping down voluntarily, it could be perceived as government interferencea violation of International Cricket Council (ICC) guidelines.
The ICC has previously suspended cricket boards in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe under similar circumstances.
Amid this uncertainty, former Bangladesh captain and current ICC Development Officer Aminul Islam has emerged as the leading candidate to succeed Faruque.
Aminul has already held discussions with high-ranking government officials in Dhaka about assuming the role of BCB president.
Aminul, who arrived in Dhaka earlier this week, is reportedly seeking a three-month notice period from the ICC before transitioning into the new role.
The next BCB election is scheduled for October, making a leadership change likely before then. Faruque's appointment came after the National Sports Council (NSC) restructured the BCB's board of directors.
Faruque, a former national cricketer with seven ODIs to his name, has held multiple administrative roles within Bangladesh cricket, including two stints as chief selector.

Artists continue to rally for Gaza and Palestine
""When someone comes out of an attack like this, in a war like this, what do you expect a kid to feel?"" Eyad al-Sheikh Khalil said to Al Jazeera, after his six-year-old niece emerged from the flames of a school fire, seemingly unscathed yet mentally charred, knowing that the rest of her family wasn't so fortunate.
A video circulated online recently, capturing Ward Sheikh Khalil's silhouette as she escaped the inferno after the attack on the Fahmi al-Jarjawi School in Gaza City. Her father and brother also survived the aerial attack, though both are hospitalised. But the air strike launched by Israel killed her mother, two of her siblings, and 33 other people as they were seeking refuge in the school.
""I walked in the fire so I could escape. I was in the fire, and the ceiling fell on me. The ceiling fully collapsed. The fire was blazing,"" a distressed Ward recalled, as she flashed her burn injuries to the camera. Sobbing in memory of the deceased, she said, ""They were martyred. May God forgive them.""
Across the world, the little girl's prayer was elevated by Pakistani actor Sarwat Gilani, who penned her own heartfelt prayer for the people of Palestine on Instagram Tuesday.
""O Allah of mercy, hear our cry from the depths of sorrow. In the shattered streets and broken homes, where children weep and mothers mourn, let your presence be a balm to the wounded,"" Sarwat began.
Sarwat prayed for the innocent to find shelter, for the hungry to be fed, and for the broken to be healed in body and spirit. Praying for the guidance of those in power, she continued, ""Let the cries of the oppressed rise to heaven and stir the hearts of those with power to choose peace over war, justice over vengeance, and compassion over cruelty.""
In her prayer, the Mann Pyasa actor envisioned a world where hands would rebuild homes instead of weapons, where despair would turn to hope, and mourning would transform into the courage to rebuild a devastated homeland.
""Grant strength to the peacemakers, wisdom to the leaders, and comfort to the grieving. Let no more blood be spilled. Let no more lives be lost. Let Gaza live. Ameen,"" she said, punctuating her caption with the ever-resonating hashtag #FreePalestine.
Echoes around the world
Sarwat is just one of the many Pakistani artists who have spoken out in inexhaustible favour of Palestine. Recently, playback singer Shuja Haider condemned the genocide in Gaza on social media.
He wrote, ""What's unfolding in Gaza is a devastation of our collective humanity. The unimaginable suffering of those innocent lives is a harsh reminder that the loss of innocent lives can never be justified. Humanity knows no bounds of religion or country. May justice be served to those accountable and may peace ultimately prevail.""
Meanwhile, author Fatima Bhutto's Instagram feed packs information about Israel's atrocities towards Palestine and its people. ""Every day they commit more and more obscene crimes. Speak out now,"" she urged in a new thread post, which contained news about reinforced starvation in Gaza, the United States' funding of the Israeli military, forceful imprisonment of Dr Hussam Abu Sufiya among other health workers detained by Israel, and more.
But that's not all. From Imagine Dragons waving the Palestinian flag at the end of their concert in a clip shared by Palestinian journalist Motaz Azaiza to Saint Levant quoting Nelson Mandela on Instagram Stories to declare that ""no one is free until Palestine is free,"" the cause resonates with artists all over the globe.
In a statement shared by charity Choose Love, Bridgerton star Nicola Coughlan - another avid supporter of the Palestinian cause - announced that she was donating her Peace Lily gown to raise funds for Gaza. ""It was an honour to wear this custom gown from the inimitable Robert Wun. The message behind it is a rallying call for peace. I'm delighted to donate this gown to the prize draw to support Choose Love's work in Gaza.""
Sealed in writing
Writers have also been playing a part in protesting against Israel by signing a joint letter in favour of the ceasefire. As per The Guardian, three hundred and eighty writers and organisations including Zadie Smith, Ian McEwan, Elif Shafak, Russell T Davies, and Hanif Kureishi banded together to put a firm name to Israel's war crimes.
""The use of the words 'genocide' or 'acts of genocide' to describe what is happening in Gaza is no longer debated by international legal experts or human rights organisations,"" stated the letter.
Organisations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the United Nations human rights council condemned the brutality of the Israeli Defense Forces in the letter, adding that the public statements of Israeli ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir ""openly express genocidal intentions"".
The letter further urged the UN to provide immediate unrestricted distribution of food and medical services to the people of Gaza and pushed for a ceasefire to guarantee ""safety and justice for all Palestinians, the release of all Israeli hostages, and the release of the thousands of Palestinian prisoners arbitrarily held in Israeli jails"". The signatories hoped for sanctions to be imposed should Israel not comply with the demands put forth.
The letter stressed that Palestinians ""are not the abstract victims of an abstract war. Too often, words have been used to justify the unjustifiable, deny the undeniable, defend the indefensible. Too often, too, the right words — the ones that mattered — have been eradicated, along with those who might have written them.""
The signatories also voiced their refusal to approve of those standing by as the brutality prolongs. ""This is not only about our common humanity and all human rights; this is about our moral fitness as the writers of our time, which diminishes with every day we refuse to speak out and denounce this crime.""
It concluded on a firm note: ""This genocide implicates us all. We bear witness to the crimes of genocide, and we refuse to approve them by our silence.""

"'In India, hating Pakistan is how you show loyalty'","US
Hina Bayat slams Javed Akhtar's hateful rhetoric
Veteran actor Hina Bayat weighed in on the controversy surrounding Indian poet and lyricist Javed Akhtar, whose recent remarks against Pakistan have sparked outrage across the border. Speaking on a local television show on Wednesday, Bayat criticised Akhtar's ""hateful"" comments, suggesting that his words were less about conviction and more about performance.
""I think he made those hateful comments because he wanted to feel relevant,"" Bayat said during the segment. ""He had to prove somehow that he is 'very Indian' so he used Pakistan for that purpose."" Her remarks come in response to a statement Akhtar made during a press conference in India earlier this month, where he controversially declared: ""If I have to choose between going to hell and going to Pakistan, I would prefer to go to hell.""
Akhtar made his controversial remark during the launch of Narkatla Swarg, a book by Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut, itself a politically loaded event. In such a volatile climate, words carry weight, and Akhtar's were more than just a personal preference.
The Indian lyricist has made several visits to Pakistan in the past, most notably as an honoured guest at the Faiz Festival in Lahore earlier this year, where he was warmly welcomed. In contrast, amid the growing strain in IndiaPakistan relations in recent years, his rhetoric has taken a sharper, more critical turn, one that many in Pakistan interpret as politically driven or opportunistic.
Bayat echoed that sense of betrayal, calling for a reevaluation of who Pakistan offers its legendary hospitality to. ""In India, hating Pakistan is the way you show how loyal you are,"" she said. ""But I request Lahoris: do not host such people in the future. We Pakistanis are hospitable, we'll sit at the knees of elders, but that man does not deserve it.""
Bayat's comments were among the more composed yet cutting responses from Pakistani public figures. Actor Mishi Khan, for instance, slammed Akhtar on Instagram, saying, ""Javed Akhtar has chosen the perfect place for himself. No one in Pakistan will invite him again."" Actor Imran Abbas wrote that Akhtar will ""go to hell regardless,"" sarcastically adding that Pakistan had given him a business class welcome ""though he wasn't even worthy of economy.""
Meanwhile, former MPA Sharmila Farooqui called the remarks ""deeply disrespectful,"" and actors like Asim Mehmood issued subtler but stinging responses of their own.

A Sri Lankan court sentenced on Thursday two former ministers from the government of deposed president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to decades in prison in a landmark corruption case.
Ex-sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage and former trade minister Anil Fernando were found guilty by the Colombo High Court of misappropriating 53 million rupees ($177,000) of state funds.
The pair were also fined $2,000 for using government money to donate board games -- including 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draughts sets -- in an attempt to boost the failed 2015 re-election bid of Gotabaya's elder brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Aluthgamage was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Fernando was sentenced to 25 years. Aluthgamage is now the most senior member of a Rajapaksa-led cabinet to be successfully prosecuted for corruption.
The cases against both men were initiated six years ago, when the Rajapaksa brothers were out of power, but the case had been making slow headway until a new government took office last year. AFP

NEPRA reserves ruling on tariff,"US
Petition highlights increased reliance on costly imported LNG and coal
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday reserved its judgement on a request for increase in electricity rates up to Rs1.27 per unit on account of fuel charges adjustment (FCA) for April 2025.
Nepra held a hearing to consider the tariff hike plea submitted by the Central Power Purchasing Agency Guarantee Limited (CPPA-G). The hearing was chaired by Nepra chairman and attended by the representatives of CPPA-G, officials of the Ministry of Energy, business community members, journalists and members of the public.
According to Nepra, CPPA-G had filed a request for a tariff hike of Rs1.268 per unit under the FCA for April. If approved, the increase will be applicable for one month only.
The proposed adjustment will apply to all consumers of power distribution companies (DISCOs), excluding lifeline consumers, pre-paid meter users and electric vehicle charging stations. Nepra also stated that the adjustment would not be applicable to K-Electric consumers.
The regulator emphasised that it carefully heard the views of all relevant stakeholders. It will now conduct further scrutiny of the data before issuing a detailed decision.
According to the CPPA-G petition, the actual fuel cost borne during April was Rs9.9197 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) while the reference cost – used for billing consumers – was Rs7.6803 per kWh. The difference of Rs1.2685 per unit is now sought to be recovered from consumers.
In its request, CPPA-G stated that a total of 10,513 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity was generated in April, of which 10,196 GWh – nearly 97% – was supplied to DISCOs while the rest was lost in transmission.
Data revealed that power generation in the month under review remained heavily reliant on costly imported fuels. Over 20% of electricity was generated by using imported liquefied natural gas (LNG) at an extremely high cost of Rs24.26 per unit. The electricity produced from imported coal also proved expensive, costing Rs16.60 per unit.
While the share of hydroelectric power was relatively significant at 21.94% and nuclear power contributed 17.91% at a low cost of Rs2.10 per unit, these cheaper sources were unable to offset the impact of expensive fuel-based generation.
Local coal accounted for 14.51% of the generation at Rs11.21 per unit and gas-based power added another 8% at Rs11.82 per unit. Power generation from furnace oil, though minimal at just 0.79%, was the costliest, being recorded at Rs28.77 per unit.
The petition highlighted a small quantity of power  — around 0.31% – imported from Iran, which came at a high cost of Rs25.35 per unit. No generation was recorded from high-speed diesel, which is typically reserved for emergency use due to its high cost.
The proposed tariff increase, if approved, will be reflected in the electricity bills of millions of consumers, excluding lifeline users.

The curse of being Wednesday,"US
Jenna Ortega opens up about acquiring fame
Jenna Ortega might have conquered Netflix, but she didn't come out of Wednesday unscathed.
In a refreshingly candid interview with Harper's Bazaar, Ortega revealed that the massive success of her gothic teen character left her more disoriented than delighted. ""To be quite frank, after the show and trying to figure everything out, I was an unhappy person,"" she admitted. ""The pressure and the attention, as somebody who's quite introverted, was so intense and scary.""
With over 250 million views, Wednesday is Netflix's most-watched English-language show. But for Ortega, its impact has been double-edged. One side is creative opportunity; she's learned to play the cello, embraced a darker personal aesthetic, and landed edgy roles in A24's Death of a Unicorn and Taika Waititi's Klara and the Sun. The other side is the brutal social media surveillance, career typecasting, and the suffocating trap of image maintenance.
""I'm doing a show I'm going to be doing for years where I play a schoolgirl. But I'm also a young woman,"" she said. ""There's just something about it that's very patronising. Also, when you're short, people are already physically looking down on you.""
For Ortega, who's grown up in front of the camera, from Disney darling to Addams icon, the push-pull between public expectation and personal evolution is real. ""You know, it's like how you're dressed in the schoolgirl costume. Girls, if they don't stay as this perfect image of how they were first introduced to you, then it's, 'Ah, something's wrong. She's changed. She sold her soul.'""
She's also experienced the uglier side of online fame. ""I feel like being a bully is very popular right now,"" she said. ""Having been on the wrong side of the rumour mill was incredibly eye-opening."" Fame, for all its perks, can feel more like a trapdoor than a platform.
Still, Ortega isn't abandoning the fans that catapulted her to stardom. ""I want to be able to give back to them. But I also want to do things that are creatively fulfilling to me,"" she explained. ""It's finding that balance. [I want roles that are] older and bolder and different.""
Ortega's career is clearly at a crossroads, and she's steering with intention. Between indie art films and blockbuster sequels, she's carving out space to grow, stumble, evolve. And with Wednesday Season 2 dropping in two parts this August, audiences will once again fall under her spell. But if Ortega has her way, they'll start to see past the pigtails.

Russia says awaiting Ukraine's response,"US
.
Russia on Thursday said it was still waiting for Ukraine to agree to attend talks in Istanbul on Monday, after Kyiv demanded Moscow send its peace terms before pledging to attend the meeting.
Diplomatic efforts to end the three-year conflict have gained pace in recent months, but Moscow has shown no signs of easing its bombardment of Ukraine and has repeatedly rebuffed calls for an immediate ceasefire.
Moscow has offered to hold a second round of direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on June 2, where it wants to present a so-called ""memorandum"" outlining its conditions for a long-term peace settlement.
But Ukraine said the meeting would not yield results unless it saw a copy of the memorandum in advance, a proposal that the Kremlin dismissed.
""As far as I know, no response has been received yet... we need to wait for a response from the Ukrainian side,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. AFP

Airlines return to Pak skies,"US
.
Air traffic has returned to normal following recent disruptions caused by Pakistan-India conflict. All international airlines have resumed operations through Pakistan's airspace – except for Indian carriers, which remain restricted.
Talking to media at the Lahore Press Club, Director of Public Relations for the Pakistan Airport Authority (PAA), Saifullah, said that international airlines had temporarily rerouted flights during the recent escalation but have since returned to their regular routes.
He confirmed that, as per the government's directive, Pakistan's airspace will remain closed to Indian airlines until June 24.
Skardu Airport is being upgraded while a new system is being introduced at Chitral and Gilgit Airport. Under a new system, flight operations will continue regardless of weather conditions, said the PAA director.
He said bird strike incidents had gone down by 15 per cent in Karachi, while 36 such incidents were reported in Lahore.
The PAA official said the authority will run a drive in collaboration with the local governments to dispose of offal during Eidul Azha.
He said that there was a policy to outsource airports.
Meanwhile, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has imposed a ban on flying drones, kites, pigeons, and other objects around Islamabad Airport.
The restriction is placed following bird strike incidents, which cause damage to aircraft, and will remain in effect for a month. The areas around the Noor Khan Airbase and Qasim Airbase will also come under the restriction.
Deputy Commissioner Hasan Waqar Cheema has issued a notification under Section 144. Besides, there is also a ban on aerial firing for a month.

"Two cops held for abduction, extortion","US
Suspects stopped complainant, threatened and forcibly took Rs85,000
Two policemen have been booked in a case, suspended from service and arrested for allegedly getting involved in abduction and extortion. The action has been taken on the orders of Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani.
According to a police spokesperson, the matter came to light when a citizen submitted a formal complaint to the city police chief, alleging that two officials, posted in the Crime Control Department and at Naseerabad Police Station, had extorted money from him.
The officials allegedly stopped the complainant, who was riding a motorcycle, threatened him, and forcibly took Rs85,000. The complainant accused the cops of kidnapping him and receiving money. The Potohar SP led the inquiry, which established the allegations.
Taking notice of the complaint, the CPO ordered an inquiry into the matter. Following the investigation, a case was registered at the Civil Lines Police Station against the accused who were also taken into custody.
Both officers have already been suspended, and departmental disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against them.
CPO Hamdani says abuse of power and corruption will not be tolerated under any circumstances and has advised the Rawalpindi police to correct their conduct and otherwise those involved in crime or its facilitation will no longer remain part of the force.

"Authority abolishes 1,200 teaching posts","US
Following privatisation, over 43,000 teaching positions abolished across Punjab
Implementation has begun on the decision to abolish 43,960 sanctioned government teaching posts from 7,500 public schools that were privatised in the first phase by the Punjab School Education Department.
The Rawalpindi district alone has eliminated 1,200 teaching positions.
District Education Authorities (DEAs) across all 42 districts of Punjab have started issuing notifications regarding the elimination of these positions.
In Rawalpindi Division, the districts of Rawalpindi and Chakwal have already issued notifications to abolish these posts.
The Chakwal District Education Authority has officially eliminated 903 teaching positions from the privatised schools in the district.All government salaries and benefits for the affected teachers have also been discontinued.
At the time of the privatisation, the education department had assured that the schools would only be outsourced, government control would be retained, and public school teachers would continue to perform their duties.
However, the complete termination of these positions contradicts that commitment.
Teachers affected by the post-eliminations will either be transferred to vacant positions elsewhere or moved into the surplus pool.
Meanwhile, the second phase of the school privatisation plan is nearing completion, under which 5,500 additional schools are being privatised. The third phase is set to begin in mid-June, during which 7,000 more schools will be outsourced.DEAs have started issuing district-level notifications to formally eliminate sanctioned government posts from the privatised schools in their respective areas.
Starting from June 1, no government teacher will be serving in the privatised schools.

Nepal after its Maoist revolution,"PL
.
The mountainous, land-locked, never colonised nation of Nepal is getting increased international attention due to the unfolding great power competition in South Asia. Whether Nepal will be able to leverage this newfound external interest to its advantage depends on the ability of its current leftist leaders to transcend personal ambitions and demonstrate greater statesmanship.
Communist ideologies have not had much luck in Bangladesh and Pakistan. While Sri Lanka has seen the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) form a government after the ouster of the Rajapaksa brothers in 2022, the JVP's historic communist leanings have been significantly compromised.
Communist parties yield significant influence in Indian states like Kerala, Tripura and West Bengal, and Maoist rebels are locked in a lingering insurgency against the hegemonic national government as well. Yet, Nepal is the only South Asian country where Maoists managed to take over the reins of power.
Nepal's recent political history has experienced rapid changes. The Shah dynasty unified Nepal during the 18th century, but real power soon shifted to hereditary chief ministers known as the Ranas. The Nepali Congress Liberation Army operating from newly independent India then formed an alliance with the monarchy to undermine the Ranas in 1951.
After sovereignty of the crown was restored, the Nepali Congress Party worked with the monarchy to form a new government, until King Mahendra decided to suspend parliament, and turn the country into an absolute monarchy again in 1960.
Increasing disgruntlement with the Hindu monarchy eventually led communist influences to gain influence. An outright Maoist revolt soon plunged Nepal into a civil war in 1996, which lasted for almost a decade. A Comprehensive Peace Accord was finally signed between the government and Maoists in 2006, which abolished the monarchy. Yet, despite the creation of a multi-party system, the political landscape of the country has remained instable.
There has been significant fragmentation amongst the Maoists, and formation and dissolution of varied coalitions has led to repeated changes in governments, even within a single electoral cycle.
During the last general elections, held in 2022, the Communist Party of Nepal-Maoist Centre (CPN-Maoist) formed a coalition with the Nepali Congress Party to secure power. But this partnership lasted for just over a year, before major differences emerged. A new leftist coalition was formed between the CPN (M) and the United Community Party (Marxist-Leninist), but the political situation remained tenuous.
The CPN (M) has recently formed a new coalition with the Nepali Congress Party. How long this new coalition will survive before tensions erupt between these traditionally competing parties remains to be seen. There is also a relatively small but active group demanding restoration of Nepal's monarchy, which has also been resorting to violent protests to draw attention to their cause.
Amidst all the in-fighting and jostling for power, there is scant attention paid to catering to the basic needs of the citizenry, to creating responsive state institutions, achieving sustainable economic growth and improving the lives of ordinary Nepalis.
Nepal has the chance to leverage its geopolitical location to funnel more Chinese investments into the country to push back against traditional Indian hegemony. The US is also keener to invest in Nepal, primarily to keep the Chinese at bay.
However, Nepali politicians will need to demonstrate much greater maturity and astuteness to balance these contending external influences in a manner which maximise national interests rather than serving their personal ambitions. Thus far, neither the Maoists factions nor the Nepali Congress Party have demonstrated such foresight.

Offensive diplomacy,"US

Having humiliated India in the kinetic domain, scoring an unambiguous military victory in the four-day duel earlier this month, Pakistan is now on a diplomatic offensive – meant to revitalise the existing bonds of cohesion with its staunch allies in the region amid the baseless Indian propaganda, spiked with the outdated allegations of terrorism against its longtime rival.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's four-nation tour – on which he was also accompanied by Field Marshal Asim Munir, apart from other officials – came in the pursuit of the same objective of elevating strategic partnership with the historically allied nations and countering the Indian propaganda campaign, being taken around the world by a multi-party delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor.
From Turkiye to Iran and then to the Central Asian States of Azerbaijan and Tajikistan, the Pakistan delegation was received with stepped-up stately warmth and enthusiasm. All four nations stood by Pakistan, as it responded to India's so-called Operation Sindoor – carried out on the false pretext of Islamabad's involvement in the Pahalgam attack of April 22 in which 26 civilians lost their lives to terrorists – with its Operation Banyan Marsoos, forcing New Delhi to de-escalate and eventually to cease fire.
While Iran ensured peace on its border with Pakistan during the Indian offensive, Turkiye and Azerbaijan were unequivocal in their support for Pakistan. Tajikistan too voiced strong diplomatic support during the recent tensions with India.
A trilateral huddle in the Azeri city of Lachin, held on Wednesday, embodied a powerful display of unity between Pakistan, Turkiye and Azerbaijan, and made a firm call to 'reject conflict' and prioritise peace. The three sides reaffirmed mutual support on longstanding regional disputes including Kashmir, Karabakh and northern Cyprus.
Apart from the PM-led delegation, a multi-party delegation, led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, is all set to embark on a diplomatic mission to the US and Europe – meant to expose India's fabricated narrative build with terrorism-related allegations.

Eroding CIE sanctity,"US
.
The benchmark for academic excellence, the Cambridge International Education (CIE) system is now grappling with an erosion of trust in Pakistan. What was long considered a gold standard for objective, merit-based assessment is being questioned due to cracks in the conduct of its examinations.
Until recently, the British Council maintained exclusive authority over O and A Level exams in Pakistan, ensuring a centralised system with standardised controls. However, a shift over the past two years has allowed over 20 private schools, primarily in Karachi and Islamabad, to independently conduct these high-stakes assessments. With this decentralisation has come an alarming uptick in exam paper leaks and accountability failures.
The recent leak of an AS-level Physics paper has sent shockwaves through the academic community. Whisper networks of leaked material for other subjects now taint what should be a level-playing field. Moreover, the absence of transparent inquiry outcomes or concrete disciplinary actions only compounds the sense of helplessness. Decentralisation, without robust oversight, is a recipe for disorder.
When students sitting the same exam in different venues face radically different levels of security and fairness, the legitimacy of the entire examination process is called into question. The stakes are too high for complacency. Students spend years preparing for these exams, often at significant financial and emotional cost.
For their future to be jeopardised due to administrative lapses or weak accountability is unacceptable. Cambridge International must move swiftly to restore faith by re-evaluating its decentralisation model or enforcing strict audit protocols for participating schools. Anything less would be a disservice.
The credibility of Cambridge assessments has been a source of pride and a pathway to opportunity for thousands of Pakistani students. Let us not allow systemic carelessness to diminish a reputation built over decades.

Rana Tanveer signals openness to PFMA's import-export proposal
Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, met a delegation of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA) to discuss critical issues in the wheat sector.
According to a statement issued Thursday by the ministry, the PFMA formally requested permission for the import-cum-export of wheat products to boost industrial activity, maintain supply chains, and enhance foreign exchange reserves.
The minister assured the delegation that the government is seriously evaluating the proposal. He emphasised that facilitating the trade of wheat-based products could strengthen the local flour milling industry, unlock international market opportunities, and contribute to foreign exchange earnings. ""We are committed to supporting responsible trade policies that aid economic growth without compromising domestic food security,"" he said.
Addressing concerns about the release of strategic wheat reserves, the minister clarified that stocks held by PASSCO are strictly reserved for emergencies and will not be released to the open market.

Tiles industry warns of $400m forex outflow,"PK
Urges govt to maintain existing tax structure in budget
The tiles industry has cautioned the government that the proposed new tariffs could force a shift from domestic manufacturing to an import-based model, potentially leading to annual foreign exchange outflow of $400 million.
Industry stakeholders have urged the government to maintain the existing tax structure in the upcoming budget for 2025-26.
The Ministry of Industries and Production held a second meeting of the committee formed for the development of tiles industry, under the chairmanship of Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Haroon Akhtar Khan, according to a press release.
Khan reviewed the progress reports submitted by the tiles industry and the Engineering Development Board and emphasised that the industry must not be allowed to shut down, highlighting its critical importance for the national economy.
It was noted that before 2018, a 55% regulatory duty was imposed on tiles, which led to annual imports worth $215 million. The industry currently faces acute cost disadvantages compared to the major tile-producing and exporting countries in the region. The production cost has increased 72% primarily due to the rising prices of gas and power.

Climate action could save vanishing glaciers,"US
Study provides clearest picture yet of long-term loss
More than three-quarters of the world's glaciers are set to vanish if climate change continues unchecked, a major new study warned on Thursday, fueling sea-level rise and jeopardizing water supplies for billions.
Published in Science, the international analysis provides the clearest picture yet of long-term glacier loss, revealing that every fraction of a degree in global temperature rise significantly worsens the outlook.
It may sound grim, but co-lead author Harry Zekollari, a glaciologist at Vrije Universiteit Brussel and ETH Zurich, told AFP the findings should be seen as a ""message of hope.""
Under existing climate policies, global temperatures are projected to reach 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9F) above pre-industrial levels by 2100 -- a pathway that would ultimately erase 76 percent of current glacier mass over the coming centuries.
But if warming is held to the Paris Agreement's 1.5C target, 54 percent of glacial mass could be preserved, according to the study, which combined outputs from eight glacier models to simulate ice loss across a range of future climate scenarios.
""What is really special about this study is we can really show how every tenth of a degree of additional warming matters,"" co-lead author Lilian Schuster of the University of Innsbruck told AFP.
The paper's release comes as Swiss authorities monitor flood risks following the collapse of the massive Birch Glacier, which destroyed an evacuated village.
While Swiss glaciers have been heavily impacted by climate change, it remains unclear how much the latest disaster was driven by warming versus natural geological forces.
Glaciers are found on every continent except Australia — from Mount Kilimanjaro to the Austrian Alps and the Karakoram range in Pakistan.
While most are clustered in the polar regions, their presence in mountain ranges across the world makes them vital to local ecosystems, agriculture and human communities.
Vast bodies of snow, ice, rock, and sediment that gain mass in winter and lose it in summer, glaciers formed in the Earth's deep past when conditions were far colder than today.
Their meltwater sustains rivers critical for farming, fisheries, and drinking water.

The problem of evil — and the Quran,"PK
.
If God is omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent and omnibenevolent, how does He allow the existence of 'evil', such as suffering, natural disaster, sin or immorality. This question has challenged theologians and philosophers through the ages.
A classic example is of a baby deer burning in a forest fire, and the question why God did not save it. This is like putting God in man's shoes. The question is, are the life and working of a creator-engineer and the washing machine he creates same? Can a constructed robot designed to follow a code of conduct demand the same code from the scientists who made it.
Certainly, God is capable of creating many worlds free from all evil, corruption, hurt; His own abode and the Heavens He has promised the good-doers are such worlds. But this present world, of the Earthly life and the Universe that bounds it, is specially designed as a 'test' for humanity.
Though it may seem to be boundless in time and space, it is really a speck in God creative space. And it is evident that this design has elements of construction and destruction, of life and death, of systems within systems within systems. And inevitably it has elements of good and evil so that humans may choose between them with their freewill.
The Quran says, ""We will surely test you with things of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient"" Al-Baqarah (2:155). So, for those who have goodness in their hearts, hardships, pain and loss will push them towards the better choices like of patience, perseverance, sacrifice, altruism, and trust in the greater good.
Therefore, man is not in a position to question the morality of God, because He is in a fundamentally different and unknowable matrix: ""Vision perceives Him not, but He perceives the visions; and He is the Intricate-Knower"" Al-Anaam (6:106). Therefore, regarding the baby deer burning in a forest fire, only Allah knows what matter belies between Him and the fawn and how He saves it from undue pain; we are not in a position to ask.
On the other hand, whatever immorality is committed by humans resonates in his/her own life, in his/her community and their generations. Every human act has repercussions. So, the Quran says, ""Whatever affliction befalls you is because of what your own hands have committed. And He pardons much"" Ash-Shura (42:30). An-Nisa (4:79) further clarifies this by saying, ""Whatever good befalls you is from Allah, and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself."" Human perception is finite and prone to misjudgment in the face of Divine Wisdom, Who does not deny justice but has deferred ultimate justice for the final day of judgment.
In Asrar-e-Khudi, poem 5, titled 'Dar Biyan Aynke Asal Nizam-e-Alam Az Khudi Ast', Iqbal elaborates that God is the beholder of the ultimate and absolute khudi (ego), and the material world is the remains of the secret doings of the ultimate khudi. Khudi creates the 'other' or 'evil', to realise itself and its goodness.
Evil emerges from His creative power only so that He can crush it down. As in Al-Anfal (8:8), ""that He may make-true Truth and falsify Falsehood, distasteful though it be to the criminals."" Iqbal says that the design of the universe is extravagant and so much goes through the stages of destruction for the creation of new beginnings and new meanings. And only with the duality of opposing realities is created the copious mural of being and becoming; of self-realisation and self-actualisation; of challenge, agency and action.
The Quran also gives a hint of evil as being part of the grand design of God's creative power, when it talks of the Tree of Zaqqum, ""For We have truly made it a trial for the wrong-doers. Lo! it is a tree that springs in the heart of hell"" As-Saaffat (37:63, 64). And is it possible that it is the same tree that was given an opening in the garden where Adam and Eve were stationed and of which God had ordained Adam not to come close to nor taste of it, yet if Adam would not have tasted from the evil tree, the story of mankind would not have begun.
The purpose of life on Earth would not have commenced, there would be no test, no trial, no tribulation. And mankind would not have been shifted through the sieve that would separate the vain from the humble; the self-loving desirous from the oft-giving altruist; the gluttonous genocide-approvers from the planet-friendly saviors of humanity; the lovers of corruption and malice from the lovers of goodness and piety. Nor would humanity be able to actualise its love or hate for the Creator and source of all goodness, God!
Therefore, instead of judging God, upon the seemingly present physical evil, for which there may be justification hidden to us for reasons, humanity should concentrate upon moral evil of which it may itself be guilty of. And if humanity would indeed believe truly upon God and tread the good path He has identified for us, perhaps then He would defer the present 'evil' and ordain for the present world only copious growth and prosperity, like He promised the people through Noah and said, ""I ask you to seek forgiveness from your Lord, He is the oft-forgiving. He will send rain to you in abundance. And will aid you with wealth and sons, and will make for you gardens and make for you rivers"" Noah (71;12). And even though Noah remained among his people for 'a thousand less fifty years' Al-Ankabut (29: 14) before the flood came, they ridiculed him, scolded him and plotted against him, and in place of the love of God, they said ""forsake not Wadd, nor Suwa', nor Yaghuth and Ya'uq and Nasr"" (71:23).
So, evil is not in the heart of God, it is in the heart of hell; only the hearts of humanity do not shudder of its very thought, rather humanity embraces it in its hearts, in place of the love of God.
""He will not be questioned as to that which He doeth, but they will be questioned"" Al-Anbiya (21:23).

"With AI and more shade, KSA set for a searing Hajj","PK
Authorities have doubled their efforts to mitigate heat-related risks
With artificial intelligence, more shade and misting machines, Saudi authorities are preparing to welcome more than a million Hajj pilgrims amid punishing summer heat.
Saudi Arabia's Hajj minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah told AFP on Thursday that efforts to mitigate the searing desert heat remained a top focus among authorities and organisers ahead of this year's pilgrimage.
""One of the big challenges that we always face is the increasing temperature across the different years and this is an issue that we give top priority,"" he told AFP during an exclusive interview in Riyadh.
The issue is all the more pressing as officials work to prevent a repeat of last year's Hajj, which saw more than 1,300 pilgrims die as temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125.24 degrees Fahrenheit).
This year, Rabiah said authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials and doubled their efforts to mitigate heat-related risks.
Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands more medics will be on hand, and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed for the duration of the hajj, he added.
Such efforts build on the work of previous years that have seen renovations to areas around the Grand Mosque and asphalt areas covered with a special layer to help reduce surface temperatures.
""These new changes will definitely ensure the safety and the better experience of pilgrims when they perform their Hajj,"" said Rabiah.
He said this week that more than a million people from across the globe had already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj, with more still pouring in.
The latest artificial intelligence software will help monitor the deluge of information and footage, including video from a new fleet of drones, from across Makkah.
""We use advanced AI technologies to do this monitoring and get fast feedback,"" the minister said.
Crowd management has proved perilous in the past, notably in 2015 when a stampede caused about 2,300 deaths.
Along with expanding infrastructure and deploying more personnel, Saudi officials have been cracking down to prevent pilgrims without the right paperwork from entering Makkah.
Hajj permits are allocated to countries on a quota system and distributed to individuals by lottery. AFP

Court stops Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs,"US
White House will find a way to impose tariffs even if it loses in court, aide says
A federal court on Wednesday blocked President Donald Trump from imposing sweeping tariffs on imports under an emergency-powers law, swiftly throwing into doubt Trump's signature set of economic policies that have rattled global financial markets, frustrated trade partners and raised broader fears about inflation intensifying and the economy slumping.
The ruling from a three-judge panel at the New York-based U.S. Court of International Trade came after several lawsuits arguing Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariffs exceeded his authority and left the country's trade policy dependent on his whims.
Trump has repeatedly said the tariffs would force manufacturers to bring back factory jobs to the U.S. and generate enough revenue to reduce federal budget deficits. He used the tariffs as a negotiating cudgel in hopes of forcing other nations to negotiate agreements that favored the U.S., suggesting he would simply set the rates himself if the terms were unsatisfactory.
Meanwhile White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Thursday that the Trump administration will seek to enact tariffs through other means if it ultimately loses the court fights over its trade policy.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Navarro said that US tariffs would remain in place for now following a court stay and that the administration is still in talks with other countries to continue trade negotiations. Agencies

Regressive power tariffs,"US
.
In a decision that epitomises regulatory capture and abdication of public interest, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has sanctioned a financial travesty by allowing K-Electric (KE) to embed its operational failures directly into consumer tariffs.
This week's approval of a Rs40 per unit base tariff — almost 40% higher than the national average — institutionalises ""recovery losses"" of up to 6.75%, rewards inefficiency and penalises law-abiding citizens for KE's inability to combat theft and billing failures. The move sets a dangerous precedent for Pakistan's power sector, entrenching corporate welfare at taxpayer expense.
It is KE's responsibility to address power theft and non-payment of bills. The government may facilitate it by helping it liaise with law enforcement, but granting it such a huge benefit — effectively a subsidy — gives it an unfair advantage over government-owned distribution companies, which are required to either make 100% recovery or absorb the losses. The regulator cannot be allowed to give preferential treatment to one distribution company, whether private or public.
Nepra's rationale of ""market realities"" is also comical. Every company in the world faces market realities. KE is welcome to stop supplying power to bill defaulters and pursue legal action against defaulters and pilferers, but forcing honest consumers to cover for dishonest ones is flat-out wrong.
Rewarding failure demoralises performers. If Nepra will not defend consumers, the government must intervene — not just in court, but by reforming a regulator prioritising corporate viability over public good. The power division has already taken a welcome step by ""planning to review"" the new terms, but it should also straight-up ask the parliamentary standing committee on energy to force the Nepra chief to stand in parliament and defend the sweetheart deal, and explain to Karachi why the regulator is actively trying to punish citizens.

US envoy urges Syria-Israel non-aggression pact,"US
.
The United States' new envoy for Syria, Thomas Barrack, on Thursday called for a non-aggression agreement between Syria and Israel, describing their conflict as a ""solvable problem"".
In remarks to Saudi channel Al Arabiya, Barrack said the two sides could ""start with just a non-aggression agreement, talk about boundaries and borders"" to rebuild ties.
Syria and Israel have technically been at war since 1948. Israel seized the Golan Heights from Syria in 1967 and has carried out hundreds of strikes and several incursions since the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in December.
Israel says its strikes aim to stop advanced weapons reaching Syria's new authorities, whom it considers jihadists. It has also warned of further action if they fail to protect the Druze minority.
Barrack made the comments after inaugurating the US ambassador's residence in Damascus, the first such move in more than a decade.
Syria's interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa said earlier this month his administration was holding indirect talks with Israel to calm tensions.
Sharaa, once a jihadist leader wanted in the United States, led the rebel offensive that toppled Assad.
Since coming to power, he has pledged inclusive governance and openness to the world. His administration has re-established diplomatic ties with several powers.
During a Gulf tour this month, US President Donald Trump announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria and voiced hope it would normalise relations with Israel.
""I told him, I hope you're going to join once you're straightened out and he said yes. But they have a lot of work to do,"" he said of Sharaa, calling him a ""young, attractive guy"" and a ""fighter"".
On May 8 in France, Sharaa said Syria was holding ""indirect talks through mediators"" with Israel to ""try to contain the situation so it does not reach the point where it escapes the control of both sides."" AFP

Imran signals readiness to 'give-and-take',"US
Reiterates call for direct talks with establishment
Incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder and former prime minister Imran Khan once again expressed willingness to hold direct talks with the country's powerful stakeholders on Thursday, saying he was ready for a ""give and take"" only in the interest of Pakistan.
Speaking to party leaders at Rawalpindi's Adiala Jail, the PTI founder, while emphasising that he wasn't seeking any personal relief, said that the doors for dialogue with the establishment were open, saying he was ready to talk at any time for the sake of country and national unity.
PTI Senator Ali Zafar, after meeting Khan in jail, told the media that the former premier had made it clear that any settlement would be for the country, not for personal gain. ""There is no personal give and take involved,"" Zafar said before quoting Khan as saying: ""if I wanted concessions for myself, I would have asked for them long ago and wouldn't have spent 600 days in jail.""
To a question about recent remarks by Khan's sister, Aleema Khan, Zafar said that Khan clarified that any notion of a give-and-take approach would be strictly for Pakistan's benefit. ""I am not asking for any relief in my cases,"" Zafar attributed to Khan, adding ""I only want justice, and I want my cases to be heard without delay.""
Reportedly, Aleema recently called for direct talks with the ""unseen forces"" to secure her brother's release through a possible ""give and take"" arrangement.
Speaking to media in Islamabad, she claimed that judges handling Khan's cases were under pressure, pointing out that Khan's cases come on the cause list but are then not taken up.
Khan, who was ousted from office via a no-confidence vote in 2022, has been in jail since August 2023. He faces a range of charges, including corruption and abetting violence, which his party maintains are politically motivated.
To another question, Zafar said that Khan also confirmed that a protest campaign against the ruling PML-N-led coalition had already been announced and that the party would unveil its strategy in the coming days.
Zafar said that Khan has instructed the party leadership to prepare for the movement, warning that he would no longer remain patient if no one comes out. ""No one will be allowed to play from both sides of the fence,"" he said.
Khan's renewed outreach has come at a time when his party hasn't been able to get any relief for him since he was arrested and sent behind bars in August 2023. His party says that the imprisonment is aimed at sidelining him from the national political landscape.
Nevertheless, Khan's continued imprisonment has not only remained a rallying point for PTI leaders and supporters but become a central issue in the party's ongoing standoff with the establishment.
The rift between PTI and powerful stakeholders was evident last Friday as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur had skipped a formal dinner hosted by the newly-elevated Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir – also the Chief of Army Staff.
Surprising as it may seem, PTI leaders were not invited for the dinner to celebrate success in the operation Bunyanum Mursoos. On May 10, 2025, Pakistan had launched a retaliatory response to unprovoked Indian aggression, including missile strikes on Pakistani airbases and civilian areas.

Gaza ceasefire prospects brighten,"BG
US says Israel backs latest truce plan sent to Hamas
The White House said on Thursday that Israel had ""signed off on"" a new Gaza ceasefire proposal submitted to Hamas, as the Palestinian militants confirmed they were studying the deal.
Negotiations to end more than 19 months of war have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough, with Israel resuming operations in Gaza in March after a brief truce.
The White House said President Donald Trump and US envoy Steve Witkoff had ""submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas that Israel backed"".
""Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas,"" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, adding discussions were ""continuing"" with the militants.
Hamas said it had ""received Witkoff's new proposal from the mediators and is currently studying it responsibly"".
The humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire despite aid beginning to trickle back into the territory following a more than two-month Israeli blockade.
Food security experts say starvation is looming for one in five people.
Israel has intensified its offensive in what it says is a renewed push to destroy Hamas, whose October 7, 2023 attack triggered the war.
Gaza's civil defence said 54 people were killed in Israeli attacks on Thursday, including 23 in a strike on a home in Al-Bureij and two by Israeli gunfire near a US-backed aid centre in the Morag axis, in the south.
The centre, run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, is part of a new aid distribution system designed to keep supplies from Hamas. It has drawn criticism from the United Nations and the European Union.
""What is happening to us is degrading. The crowding is humiliating us,"" said Gazan Sobhi Areef, who visited a GHF centre on Thursday.
""We go there and risk our lives just to get a bag of flour to feed our children.""
The Israeli military said it was not aware of the shooting near the aid centre. In Al-Bureij, it said it struck a ""Hamas cell"" and was reviewing reports that civilians were killed.
It said its forces had struck ""dozens of terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip"" over the past day.
In a phone call with EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, Jordanian Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi accused Israel of ""systematic starvation tactics"" that had ""crossed all moral and legal boundaries"".
On Wednesday, thousands of desperate Palestinians stormed a World Food Programme warehouse in central Gaza, the UN agency said, with Israel and the United Nations trading blame over the deepening hunger crisis.
The issue of aid has come sharply into focus amid starvation fears and intense criticism of the GHF, which has bypassed the longstanding UN-led system in the territory.

Govt mulls 1.5% tax on imports,"US
FBR proposal aims to curb under-invoicing, collect revenue at source
In what could become the single largest new revenue source in the budget, the government is considering imposing a 1.5% withholding tax on the value of imports. The tax would be collected by banks at the time of making payments to overseas suppliers.
The measure, still under discussion, will be used as an enforcement tool to curb the widespread under-declaration of import values, a senior government functionary told The Express Tribune. He said that the tax would apply to commercial importers only, who would have the right to claim adjustments against their final tax liabilities.
Currently, commercial importers pay withholding tax when filing goods declarations with the Customs Department. Under the new plan, however, the tax would be deducted when the payment is made to the foreign supplier through banking channels.
Sources said the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has briefed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) about its proposal to tax imports at three key points: upon arrival, during shipment, and at the stage of payment to exporters. While it remains unclear whether the IMF has endorsed the proposal, the plan appears to be the government's biggest attempt in the budget at hitting the next fiscal year's tax target of over Rs14 trillion.
Finance Secretary Imdad Ullah Bosal on Thursday said there were no plans to delay the budget presentation, reiterating thrice that it would be presented on June 10. Meanwhile, the Annual Plan Coordination Committee will meet on June 3, and the National Economic Council will convene on June 6 to approve macroeconomic and development plans for FY25.
The proposed withholding tax would be deducted at the point of sending money abroad through letters of credit, said the sources. Banks would follow a model similar to how they deduct tax on overseas credit card payments.
FBR spokesperson Dr Najeeb Memon and Chairman Rashid Langrial did not respond to queries on the matter for the purposes of this story.
A recent report by the Policy Research Institute of Market Economy (PRIME), titled 'Combating Illicit Trade in Pakistan', estimates that the country is losing a staggering Rs3.4 trillion annually to black market activities. Of this, nearly 30% stems from misuse of the Afghan Transit Trade facility. These losses amount to 26% of the current fiscal year's total tax target.
The report warns that illicit trade is eroding formal businesses, government revenues, and consumer safety. It highlights outdated border controls, minimal customs automation, a lack of risk-based profiling, and poor scanning technologies as key contributors to rampant smuggling.
If passed by Parliament, the new withholding tax could offer the FBR a relatively easy way to collect revenue, especially since it would be implemented through banks. The tax authority has historically underperformed in areas where it must rely on its own enforcement rather than external withholding agents such as banks, provincial bodies, or employers.
The government has previously relied on indirect taxation, including last year's controversial 20% federal excise duty (FED) on the packaged juice industry. The result was a 45% drop in sales, according to Atikah Mir, a representative of the industry. The Fruit Juice Council is lobbying for the FED to be reduced to 15%, arguing that the move would benefit both the industry and revenues.
Meanwhile, another tool used frequently by the FBR is blocking genuine tax refunds to inflate revenues.
On Thursday, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Haroon Akhtar Khan met with a delegation from Utopia Industries to address their pending tax refunds. According to a statement from the Ministry of Industries, Utopia Industries — a leading exporter of mattress covers, pillows, comforters, and plastic products — has been unable to recover more than Rs3 billion (approximately $10 million) despite submitting all required documentation.
The company, which began operations in 2020 with a $50 million investment, now ranks among Pakistan's top 12 exporters by revenue and leads in the number of containers shipped abroad. It is also one of the top two sellers on Amazon, with annual revenues of $170 million. All of its products are branded under its own name and carry Pakistani origin labels, distributed widely across households in the United States, Canada, and the UK.
According to company officials, Rs600 million in sales tax refunds are pending from the April-January period, despite refund payment orders having been generated. An additional Rs700 million in refunds has been deferred for the same period, and Rs350 million in income tax refunds have been stuck since 2022.
Utopia's representatives also met the finance minister in Washington, DC, last October and have filed a complaint with the Federal Tax Ombudsman, but the matter remains unresolved.
The company says it has reached out to multiple stakeholders, including the All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, the Pakistan Textile Council, the commerce and planning ministers, and even the Special Investment Facilitation Council and the Pakistani ambassador to the USyet the issue persists.

Capital gears up to prevent dengue outbreak,"US
Efforts include inspections, fumigation, and public awareness campaigns
The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration has intensified efforts to curb the spread of dengue as early cases begin to appear in the city. While only four cases have been reported so far this season, authorities are focusing on swift, preventive action to avoid a potential outbreak.
Deputy Commissioner Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon, chaired a high-level meeting attended by health officials to review the dengue situation. The meeting included a comparative analysis of case reports from other cities, including Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad, and Rawalpindi, to draw insights from their prevention strategies.
Officials briefed the meeting on ongoing field operations led by Assistant Commissioners in areas where mosquito larvae were detected. These include inspections of homes, commercial properties, and open spacescommon breeding grounds during dengue season.
DC Memon urged residents to fully cooperate with the administration's anti-dengue campaign and adhere strictly to the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for prevention. These include covering water containers, cleaning rooftops and drains, and eliminating stagnant water around properties.
He directed Assistant Commissioners to take strict action against individuals or institutions found violating dengue prevention guidelines, emphasizing that early enforcement is key to containing the disease.
The administration has ramped up public awareness efforts, including door-to-door visits, public announcements, and targeted inspections in high-risk areas. Health workers and volunteers are actively educating the public on how to prevent mosquito bites and eliminate breeding sites.
Surveillance teams are monitoring vulnerable sectors, and fumigation and clean-up operations are being conducted based on larva detection reports. Weekly progress reviews will be held to assess the campaign's effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.
Authorities are also coordinating with local health departments to ensure prompt management of reported cases. With dengue cases rising in other cities, Islamabad's strategy is focused on prevention through early detection, community involvement, and strict implementation of SOPs.
Residents have been urged to report any signs of mosquito breeding to the relevant departments.

Salman Agha praises 'team effort' in win over BD,"US
'With so many quality all-round options, we're in a great position'
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha credited team effort for their comprehensive 37-run victory over Bangladesh in the first T20I of the three-match series here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.
Reflecting on the victory, Agha lauded the batting unit's collective effort to breach the 200-run barrier despite the dismal start before emphasising that a complete all-round performance is what he craves from his team.
""After being 5/2, it was great to see everyone contribute to reach 200-plus,"" said Agha.
""That's exactly the team effort we want - performing well in all three departments. We encourage players to back themselves and take the initiative,"" he added.
Agha specifically praised Ali for his five-wicket haul, revealing that people are saying that he was bowling like he used to in 2017, the year Pakistan won the ICC Men's Champions Trophy.
""Hasan Ali has been phenomenal — people are saying he's bowling like it's 2017 again. His hard work is paying off, first in the PSL and now tonight,"" Agha stated.
While responding to a question regarding plenty of all-rounders in the team, Agha, an all-rounder himself, termed it a real luxury, asserting that it provides him with a handful of quality options.
""Our all-rounders are a real luxury. Even Saim Ayub can bowl his full four overs. With so many quality all-round options, we're in a great position. We'll rest tomorrow and regroup for the second game.""

'Inspired' Swiatek outplays Raducanu,"US
Alcaraz overcomes stiff challenge from Marozsan in third round
Reigning French Open champion Iga Swiatek gave an ""inspired"" display of clay-court tennis against outclassed former US Open winner Emma Raducanu to book her ticket to the third round of Roland Garros on Wednesday.
Poland's Swiatek swept to a 6-1, 6-2 win in 79 minutes on Court Philippe Chatrier where she has lifted the trophy four timesincluding for the last three editions.
""Honestly, I just love playing here. This place inspires me and that makes me work harder,"" she enthused.
For 22-year-old Raducanu it was her first time on the main court at Roland Garros and she could not pull off the hoped-for upset.
""It's a surrounding that she's obviously very comfortable with and she's played in it a lot of times,"" said Raducanu.
""I think that did emphasise me feeling a bit uncomfortable.""
By contrast, Swiatek was in her element as she continues her bid to become the first woman to win four consecutive French Open titles since Suzanne Lenglen 102 years ago.
""From the beginning, I knew what I wanted to do, so I just did it,"" said the Pole.
""I had a good time on the court, and I felt the game pretty well, so I just went for it,"" continued Swiatek, who wrapped up victory on her second match point.
After early exits in Stuttgart, Madrid and Rome, Swiatek had looked to have lost her feet on clay, slipping to fifth in the world rankings.
But Wednesday's dominant performance now brings the 23-year-old's tally to 23 wins in a row at Roland Garros.
Meanwhile, in the mens competition, reigning French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz booked his spot in the third round at Roland Garros on Wednesday with a 6-1, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2 win over Fabian Marozsan, but admitted at times he ""couldn't handle"" his 56th-ranked opponent.
The Spaniard started imperiously as he raced into a one-set lead before his Hungarian rival broke him in the very first game of the second frame and served out to level matters.
""I think today was a really good match for me. I played great. But yeah, in the second set, at the beginning he broke my serve,"" Alcaraz told his post-match press conference.
""I think he started to play better and better, and he reached a level that I couldn't handle it.
""So it was great level from him.""
However, the world number two swiftly refound his excellent clay court form, which saw him win at Monte Carlo and Rome before Roland Garros, to storm through in four sets.
""(I am) just really proud about refresh my mind and I started the third set really, really well and ended up playing really great two last sets,"" Alcaraz added.
""I didn't feel like I lost the focus at all. He just played much better. So I just think today was I maintain my level during the whole match.
""But in the second set, he reached just much better level than I did.""
Next Alcaraz will face home hope Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard or Bosnian Damir Dzumhur in the round of 32.
Despite being through to the third round, Alcaraz refused to look forward to a potential final against Italian world number one Jannik Sinner.
""(The) final is too far away right now to think about,"" he said. ""Here in the last four matches against him (Sinner), it's great having wins against him, but I don't know if in case I'm gonna face him sooner or later.""
The 22-year-old beat Sinner in the semi-finals of the French Open last year and most recently defeated him in the Italian Open final earlier in May.
Alcaraz has won his last four matches against Sinner on all surfaces, with his only defeat against his rival on clay coming at the Umag final three years ago.

An armed robbery occurred on Range Road in the jurisdiction of Westridge Police Station in Rawalpindi where robbers snatched expensive mobile phones.
The robbers returned one of the phones to its owner, reportedly because it did not meet their preferences.
CCTV footage of the incident has surfaced, showing a vehicle parked on the roadside as two motorcycle-riding suspects pass by.
The footage revealed that the masked suspects return moments later, stop near the vehicle and confront several individuals standing nearby.
One of the suspects remains on the motorcycle while the other approaches the group, brandishing a pistol.
The armed suspect can be seen forcibly taking mobile phones from a young man and the vehicle's driver.
However, in a surprising move, the suspect tosses one of the snatched phones back to the driver, apparently dissatisfied with its quality.
Despite the presence of four people at the scene, the robbers fled easily with several high-end mobile phones.
One of the bystanders was seen making a phone call immediately after the assailants fled.

NA panel reviews PTV performance,"HK
Urges timely payments to employees of state-run channel
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting met on Thursday at PTV Headquarters under the chairmanship of MNA Pullain Baloch to discuss matters related to Pakistan Television (PTV).
The committee was informed that PTV earned Rs7.5 billion in advertising revenue in FY 202324, surpassing its target of Rs6.2 billion. The revenue target for the current year is also expected to be met.
Despite this, PTV continues to face financial challenges. A major portion of the Rs10 billion collected through the TV licence fee in electricity bills is reportedly used for salaries and pensions. The management attributed delays in salary payments to diverted funds for international financial obligations and the purchase of international media rights.
The committee was also briefed on increased viewership resulting from programming enhancements and new on-screen talent, as well as ongoing efforts to upgrade the pension management system in collaboration with the Punjab Information Technology Board.
Details of non-performing and politically appointed employees laid off during the current restructuring process were also shared.
Addressing the delayed allotment of plots to journalists in Islamabad's Sectors F-14, F-15, and Bhara Kahu, the committee directed the Ministry to complete application scrutiny and resolve related grievances within two months.
On the PEMRA (Amendment) Bill 2025, moved by MNA Asia Naz Tanoli, the committee reviewed the report submitted by its sub-committee headed by MNA Mehtab Akbar Rashdi. PEMRA was directed to provide its feedback on the recommendations.
The committee instructed PTV, Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), and Shalimar Recording and Broadcasting Company (SRBC) to ensure disbursement of salaries and pensions to all employees before the upcoming Eid.
Earlier, the committee unanimously passed a resolution praising the professionalism of Pakistan's armed forces in defending national sovereignty against Indian aggression.

Afghan FM to visit Pakistan soon,"CA
Highlights growing high-level exchanges between two neighbours in recent weeks
The Afghan Interim foreign minister is expected to travel to Islamabad soon on a first visit in two years, highlighting the growing high-level exchanges between the two neighbours in recent weeks.
""He (Amir Khan Muttaqi) will visit Pakistan soon. Dates are being worked out,"" said a diplomatic source on Thursday. The source said the Afghan side has already accepted the invitation.
According to a source, this will not be a daylong trip but a three-day trip where a whole gamut of relations would be discussed.
In April Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Kabul in a first visit by any Pakistani top diplomat in three years. The visit helped ease tensions between the two countries.
The sources said Muttaqi's visit was part of efforts to increase high level exchanges. The two sides drew up a roadmap envisaging a series of visits by officials and ministers from both sides when a Pakistani delegation led by its special envoy Ambassador Muhammad Sadiq visited Kabul in the third week of March.
The Afghan Taliban government's recent actions against groups posing a threat to Pakistan played a key role in the increased interaction between the two sides.
Pakistan had long been urging Kabul to tackle the threat posed by the banned Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and other outfits. But Kabul publicly denied their presence and privately expressed their inability to deal with them.
However, Pakistan finally managed to convince the Kabul regime as it undertook certain steps including crackdown on Afghan nationals who were part of the TTP. The Afghan government also proceeded against Afghan nationals who were facilitating their fellow citizens to join the TTP. Those steps helped ease tensions between the two sides.
In another major sign suggesting shift in its approach was a statement by Senior Afghan Taliban commander Saeedullah Saeed who, on Wednesday, warned militant factions against unauthorised jihad, particularly in Pakistan, saying such actions were against Shariah and the orders of the Islamic Emirate's leadership.
Speaking at a police passing-out ceremony, Saeed said that fighting in any country, including Pakistan, without the explicit command of the Amir is not permissible.
""Joining various groups to wage jihad abroad does not make one a true mujahid,"" he stated. ""Only the Amir of the state has the authority to declare jihad — not individuals or groups.""
Saeed emphasized that those carrying out attacks independently or moving between regions to conduct operations cannot be classified as legitimate fighters under Islamic law. ""Jihad based on personal ego or group loyalty is considered 'fasad' (corruption), not legitimate resistance,"" he added.
He further stated that the Afghan leadership prohibited unauthorised entry into Pakistan, and any such act constitutes disobedience. ""Groups attacking in the name of jihad are defying both Shariah and the authority of the Afghan Emirate,"" he warned.
His public statement is seen as a result of recent efforts both by Pakistan and China urging the Kabul administration to change its approach towards these groups.
Sources said Pakistan would continue to encourage the Taliban government to carry out such measures. In return for these steps, Pakistan and China are willing to support Kabul both economically and diplomatically.
Pakistan already indicated that it was ready to upgrade ties with Afghanistan by exchanging Ambassadors in a major diplomatic win for the Afghan Taliban government.

Wheat target falls short by 4m metric tons,"US
Minister reveals Rs1b corruption in PASSCO
Federal Minister for Food Rana Tanveer Hussain on Thursday revealed alleged corruption in the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco), amounting to around Rs1 billion.
During a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on National Food Security, held under the chairmanship of Masroor Ahsan, Hussain confirmed that corruption did indeed occur in Passco.
""This is why the government is considering establishing a Commodity Wing as an alternative institution,"" he added. The minister further stated that wheat production this year reached 29 million metric tons, falling short of the target of 33 million metric tons.
He expressed concerns that the open market wheat policy might benefit middlemen, and if farmers do not receive fair compensation for their crops, wheat cultivation could be adversely affected next year.
Senator Danesh Kumar from Balochistan voiced concern over the deteriorating state of wheat, warning that if the crop is wasted, it could turn into a major scandal.
The federal minister clarified that although a portion of the crop was affected, the majority of the wheat was still safe.
Hussain also mentioned ongoing efforts to improve seed quality. He said action has been taken against those involved in the sale of fake seeds.
He said hybrid seeds are being imported, while local seed production is also underway.
The minister admitted that there is a severe shortage of manpower in the Ministry of Food with available resources operating at less than 50% capacity. He said Pakistan's agriculture sector still relies on outdated systems, while neighboring countries have made significant progress.
The meeting also discussed the appointment of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) chairman, internal politics within the institution, and Pakistan's position in smart agriculture.

Transfer case first of its kind: CB head,"US
Justice Mazhar said the case involves interpretation of constitutional and legal points.
The head of a constitutional bench (CB) hearing petitions filed against the transfer of three judges to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and a subsequent change in the judges' seniority list has noted that the case under review is first of its kind.
During hearing of the case, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar agreed with counsel for one of the petitioners, Barrister Salahuddin, that there is no precedent in the past for a permanent transfer of a judge from one high court to another. ""This is the first case of its kind involving such a transfer,"" he said.
Earlier, Barrister Salahuddin argued that a judge's seat cannot be vacated through a transfer, and a permanent transfer would render Article 175-A of the Constitution ineffective.
Article 175A establishes the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), which is responsible for appointing judges of the Supreme Court, high courts, and the Federal Shariat Court.
He stated that under Article 200, only temporary transfers are permissible, and permanent appointments can only be made by the JCP.
Justice Mazhar noted that under Article 175-A, new appointments can be made, adding that ""appointment"" and ""transfer"" have different meanings.
Salahuddin said a meaningful consultation is essential in any judge's transfer, and without it, the entire process is a mere formality. He alleged that information was concealed and inaccurate details were provided during the transfer of three judges to the IHC in February this year.
Justice Mazhar said the case involves interpretation of constitutional and legal points. He noted that three chief justices were involved in the transfer process and not everything was in the hands of the executive. Consent of the transferred judge is also obtained, he added.
Salahuddin referred to civil service rules, stating that when two individuals are appointed on the same day, seniority is determined by date of birtha principle the SC has upheld in a previous reference.
He also cited the Aslam Awan case, which called for clear rules on judicial seniority. Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan stated that once the SC defines a principle, the rules will follow.
Salahuddin requested that the Supreme Court decide the case based on civil service rules, past precedents, and the principle of equality.
Justice Mazhar asked what becomes of a judge's previous service if he takes a new oath after his transfer from one high court to the another. ""In India, even if a judge takes five oaths upon transfer, their determined seniority remains unaffected"" but Pakistan does not have an ""All Pakistan Cadre"".
He said the court is raising questions for the sake of clarity and informed judgment, noting that when a high court judge is elevated to the SC, their final pay certificate reflects 11 or 12 years of service.
Salahuddin responded that while benefits and pension would be retained, the judge's seniority would be reset. He urged the court to consider the impact on the sitting judges of the court receiving the transferred judge.
It would be unjust, he said, for a judge ranked 16th in one court to become the senior-most judge in another, ahead of those who were previously more senior. IHC Acting Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, one of the judges transferred to the IHC in February, ranked 16th in the Lahore High Court.
Justice Mazhar reiterated that no such objections were raised by judges of the Lahore High Court and instructed the lawyer to stick to issues related to IHC. He added that if arguments conclude by June 16, the court may issue a short order after consultation with judges on the same day.
Barrister Salahuddin requested the case be heard until the next day. Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan noted that some judges on the bench would not be available. Justice Salahuddin Panhwar commented that rebuttal arguments can include questions. The hearing was adjourned until 9:30am on June 16.

CAREC states invited to join Pakistan's SEZs,"NL
Minister asks Central Asian countries to explore potential of industrial clusters
Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal on Thursday invited member states of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (Carec) to integrate their value chains with Pakistan's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and explore opportunities for cross-border industrial clusters by leveraging Pakistan's preferential trade agreements with China, Asean and the Middle East.
He extended the invitation while speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the fifth annual Carec Institute Research Conference, held in collaboration with the University of Sargodha.
Themed ""Carec Connectivity: Promoting Trade and Trade Facilitation,"" the conference brought together a diverse group of national and international stakeholders.
""Today, intra-regional trade among Carec countries (excluding China) accounts for only 7% of total trade. In contrast, Asean bloc member countries have over 22% of total trade among themselves,"" he said.
The Carec region, with a population of nearly two billion and vast reserves of energy, minerals and talent, was not short on potential, Iqbal said and stressed the need for a unified development strategy backed by collective action.
Sharing the new development vision called Uraan Pakistan, the minister said it was based on five strategic pillars including exports, equity and empowerment, e-Pakistan, environment, energy and infrastructure. This strategy is not isolated from regional ambitions; rather it is aligned fully with the Carec Vision 2030.
He pointed out that Pakistan was expanding high-value exports like IT, halal food and engineering goods. Pakistan's IT exports, for instance, have crossed $3.5 billion and are growing at an annual pace of 20%, empowering youth through digital skills.

Four servicemen martyred in Waziristan,"PK
12 terrorists killed in K-P, Balochistan
Four servicemen have been martyred fending off a terrorist attack on a security check post in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa that also left six attackers dead, the military announced on Thursday – the day five terrorists were also eliminated in two separate engagements in Balochistan.
""On the night between May 28 and 29, Indian-sponsored khwarij attempted to attack a security forces check-post in general area Shawal, North Waziristan District. The attempt was effectively thwarted by own troops and in ensuing fire exchange, six Indian-sponsored Khwarij were sent to hell,"" the military's media wing said in a statement.
However, four servicemen, including a young lieutenant, embraced martyrdom during the intense fire exchange with the attackers.
Lieutenant Daniyal Ismail, 24, resident of Mardan district, a brave young officer who was leading his troops from front, fought gallantly and embraced Shahadat along with his three men, the ISPR added.
The three other martyred soldiers have been identified by the ISPR as Naib Subedar Kashif Raza, 42, resident of Chakwal district; Lance Naik Fiaqat Ali, 35, resident of Haripur district; and Sepoy Muhammad Hameed, 26, resident of Abbottabad district.
Meanwhile, security forces neutralised one Indian-sponsored kharji in another encounter in Chitral district.
""Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country,"" the ISPR said, adding that such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve.
Separately, security forces killed five India-backed terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations in Balochistan on Wednesday, the military's media wing said on Thursday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), in the first operation conducted in Loralai district, four terrorists linked to the India-sponsored group Fitna al Hindustan were killed during an intense exchange of fire.
The operation was launched on confirmed intelligence regarding the presence of terrorists in the area, ISPR said. The terrorists were effectively engaged by the troops, and weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from their possession, it added.
The statement shared that the slain individuals were actively involved in several acts of terrorism, including two major attacks on the N-70 highway near Rarasham on August 26, 2024, and February 18, 2025, which resulted in the martyrdom fo of 30 innocent civilians.
Security officials said the Indian-sponsored terrorists had long been on the radar of law enforcement agencies and was being relentlessly pursued, it added.
In a separate engagement in Kech district, another terrorist was killed during a brief encounter with security forces, ISPR said. The military reiterated its resolve to root out Indian-sponsored terrorism from Pakistani soil, vowing to bring all perpetrators and their facilitators to justice.

Iqbal faults state pillars for past crises,"US
.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Thursday that the political crises in the country were created either by one pillar of the state or the other, as he called for all sides to work for making the country economically strong.
Addressing an event in connection with Youm-e-Takbeer — the anniversary of Pakistan's nuclear blasts — at the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), the minister emphasised that judiciary should not be used in any political confrontation.
""All crises in Pakistan were artificial and created by one of the pillars of the state. Political crises were sometimes created by the establishment and sometimes by the judiciary. The 26th Constitutional Amendment was enacted because the judiciary was used for political purposes,"" he said.
""The decision to disqualify Nawaz Sharif in 2017 pushed the country towards a political crisis. But now even our establishment is saying that they are not interested in creating any new political party. Now they are saying that they will keep themselves away from politics.""
Speaking about Pakistan's nuclear blasts in 1998, he said that the six explosions on May 28 were a befitting reply to India five explosions. ""The credit for laying the foundation of the nuclear programme goes to late prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and nuclear scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan,"" he said.
""All the succeeding governments carried this programme forward and Nawaz Sharif rejected the international pressure and carried out the explosions,"" he continued. ""Youm-e-Takbeer is not only a celebration of past successes but also a day of our firm resolve for the future.""
This year's Youm-e-Takbeer celebrations came just weeks after Pakistan-India military confrontation. Iqbal said that when India challenged Pakistan, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) proved its superiority by shooting down six Indian warplanes that included three Rafales.
""The latest technology, of which India was proud, was crushed by the PAF. India then cried to Washington and requested for a ceasefire, which we accepted because we want peace,"" the minister said. ""Technology played a very important role in the success against India on May 10.""
The minister stressed the need for a strong economy for strong defence. He called for a national resolve to beat the enemy in the field of economy. ""We have a lot of tax evasion. We are among the countries having low tax collection,"" he added.

Protest staged outside school over assault on female teachers,"US
Protesters carried placards with slogans such as ""We want justice""
A large demonstration was staged outside a private girls' school on Thursday as students, teachers, parents, and civil society members demanded justice following an alleged violent assault on female teachers. A heavy police contingent was deployed to maintain order as the protest disrupted vehicular traffic in the area.
Protesters carried placards with slogans such as ""We want justice,"" ""Ensure protection of teachers,"" and ""Arrest the accused."" The demonstration was triggered by a May 26 incident at Al-Badar School, where a student, Eshal Shahid, arrived accompanied by her parents and her maternal uncle, Abdul Hafeez - a police official posted at Kalakot police station in Lyari.
According to protesters, Hafeez entered the school premises brandishing a handgun, physically assaulted female teachers, used abusive language, and harassed staff. The incident reportedly caused distress among teachers and students.
Protesters criticised the school administration for its alleged inaction during the altercation, questioning how a school that promotes Islamic values failed to protect its staff. They also expressed concerns over the safety of students in an environment where such incidents occur unchecked.
The SHO of Jamshed Quarters police station arrived at the scene to negotiate with demonstrators, while additional police personnel were deployed to prevent escalation. Protesters demanded a.) the immediate arrest of Abdul Hafeez; b.) legal action against those involved; and c.) accountability for the school administration's failure to intervene.

Two minors found murdered in Hafizabad,"HK
Despite a desperate overnight search by their families, the children remained untraceable until 7:30am the next day.
The bodies of two young cousins were discovered in a locked metal trunk inside a relative's home.
Eight-year-old Ahmed Ali and seven-year-old Arshman Ali went missing on the evening of May 28 after leaving home to play.
Despite a desperate overnight search by their families, the children remained untraceable until 7:30am the next day.
A foul odour led relatives to a locked trunk in the house of Arshman's uncle, Inzimam Ali.
Upon opening it, the lifeless bodies of the two boys were found inside, sparking shock and outrage throughout the village. Police arrived promptly at the scene, secured the area, and sent the bodies for post-mortem examination.
Although the exact cause of death is pending medical confirmation, preliminary signs suggest the boys may have been strangled or otherwise violently killed.
An FIR has been registered at Kassoki Police Station on the complaint of the victims' families. The case has been filed under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, including 302 (murder), 363 (kidnapping), 147 (rioting), and 149 (unlawful assembly).
Inzimam Ali and another accused, Zain Ali, are in police custody, while efforts are ongoing to apprehend three other unidentified suspects.
The fact that one of the suspects is a close family member of the deceased has added a chilling dimension to the tragedy. Investigators are questioning the arrested individuals and say further arrests are likely.Grief and outrage have gripped the local community, where residents are demanding swift and exemplary justice.

Preparing for the next round,"PK
.
Three things stand out from the four-day war: one, it began on a conventional note but quickly progressed to what is increasingly likely to constitute warfare in the modern age where perceptually a full conventional war is replaced with something more digestible, even if equally devastative; second, elements constituting modern warfare, missiles, Kamikaze Drones, loitering munitions were incrementally added to the menu to avoid the attribution of a full-scale war while still retaining an offensive intent – both sides mimicked each other in a mirror image and in reflex; third, there was a noise of multi-domain application as a part of conventional kinetic operations – these were impactful in a short war – and as a stand-alone resort as weapons of economic degradation to exhibit their potential for long-term pain.
There is another telling observation that is escaping attention; these were gentlemanly applications in sequence rather than as a combined force 'parallel' application in one solid punch meant to knock the opponent out. And while the ceasefire is a temporary pause, and not cessation of hostilities, Indians cannot stop overemphasising the point – one must be careful in enunciating what may help evil get stronger.
In the same vein, the plethora of experts that have emerged in the last two weeks neither do good to themselves nor to the country at large by pontificating on half-baked knowledge of modern warfare. It will help to cease such 'expert' haberdash.
Drones have a specific but limited role. A lot is made of their intelligence function and foot-printing the electro-magnetic spectrum and fixing locations but as warriors on both sides know there are enough resources to do so in peace time and war through what is now known parallel domains and satellite monitoring.
Drones do however instill a psychological irritation of an impending disaster especially when these are mixed with explosive payloads – the type extensively used in the Azerbaijan-Armenia war where from multiple faulty lessons were derived. The sheen and the surprise are both long-lost. They however do have a function with current capabilities in unique, permissive employment against forces which are irregular and dispersed in inaccessible regions.
As Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles (UCAV) they may in the future have a touted role of wingman to a manned fighter but that is highly uncertain and a long way out. In the four-day war, drones were used as gap-fillers in long pauses as warring sides pined for an intervention to help climb out of the morass.
Missile warfare that eventually spurred war in the wrong direction has however left a lot to ponder. For all these years since the two sides went nuclear missiles were a huge no-no for their inherent risk of escalation and erroneous assumption of the possible payload. During the Cold War, missiles on either side were kept on the ready in silos as weapons of first choice if a nuclear attack 'seemed' imminent. That brought about the concept of 'Star Wars' in the Reagan era which subsequently was shelved as the Cold War petered out. But then came the era of Rockets and Missiles, and Domes meant to protect from them.
The war in the Middle East turned them into a weapon of choice because the weaker side did not possess or could not match the capacity of conventional warfare with the adversary. These were thus anger weapons meant to disrupt and deter than destroy. It helped that those firing were a non-nuclear entity and hence the risk involved in using these weapons between nuclear nations was non-existent. Similarly, Iran too was a relatively weaker force vis a vis Israel when it had to respond with missiles against Israel's unprovoked attacks.
South Asia has learnt a wrong lesson from the recent spread of missile warfare without realising its determining construct. We need to go back to the playbook of the Cold War era if we wish to remain hostile as two nuclear nations. How we escaped mutually assured destruction in the four-day war is a miracle. Proliferation of missiles, nuclear or others, enjoins another imperative – defence against them.
This is where nations can go broke, even the US and Russia. They were smart, instead beginning a process of Arms Limitations and over time engaging the other in trade ties. Currently these may be in a hiccup but the interdependent nature of the world which largely now is woven into a labyrinth of supply chains makes it incumbent for adversaries to learn to coexist. Both the US and Russia have thus avoided falling into the trap of Domes for protection. Only lately Trump has floated his grand scheme of a Gold Dome, whatever that means.
Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Israel have learnt to live under the threat of an odd missile or rocket or a UAV attack with limited and confined effect. That though doesn't take away the need for a detailed, integrated, networked and centrally controlled air defence system using assets both in the air and on the ground woven into a synchronous automation – a 'system of systems' for defence against all threats using air as the medium of attack. Defence, just as offence, is part of warfare and cannot be neglected. Offence incurs a cost on the enemy, defence saves from enemy's offence and its cost.
A huge amount of jargon is bandied about in modern warfare which has roots in systems integration enabled by revolution in instant and coded communication of data. This is not new. What began in the 1980s and refined in the early 2000s has been enabled over the decades with advances in IT and data fusion.
Huge steps in capability induction and datalinks have brought about a revolution in force application. Doctrine is in essence the definition of mindset that details employment preferences. This is followed by acquisition plans to fill gaps and training cycles to perfect doctrinal employment till these turn into set-piece events. That is the epitome of perfection. It all must, though, begin with a thought and a single-minded focus to make it happen. It explains how excellence is achieved.
Multi-domain, parallel operations will exact another requirement and structure. As AI refines and becomes widely integrated it will become an essential partner to a warfighting commander. That is the next level of man and machine fusion into a single decision-making entity.
As multiple domains become active simultaneously a human mind will be saturated to the point of paralysis. That is when the machine will come handy. It shall be a struggle to keep out some fields of play from machine's domain. Where though a line will be drawn to keep Armageddon out will be the next big test for humanity. Real multi-domain will exact real painstaking price off human ingenuity. The race is on either to go under or remain collaboratively afloat in the manner of the USA and Russia.

Chelsea aim high after Conference League win,"PL
The Premier League team beat Real Betis 4-1 on Wednesday
The UEFA Conference League was not where Chelsea wanted to be, but their triumph in Wroclaw could prove to be a turning point for a club that had lost their trophy-winning habit.
The Premier League team beat Real Betis 4-1 on Wednesday, recovering strongly from being outplayed in the first half by their Spanish opponents.
Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca's second-half substitutions lifted his team but an inspired Cole Palmer was the catalyst for victory, producing two pinpoint crosses for Enzo Fernandez and Nicolas Jackson.
Jadon Sancho's fine finish made it 3-1 and Moises Caicedo added a fourth in stoppage time to give Chelsea their first silverware since Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital acquired the club in May 2022 from Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich.
During the past three years the owners have spent more than £1 billion ($1.3 billion) on promising young talent, but until now have had little to show for it.
Chelsea had been clear favourites to win Europe's third-tier club competition from the start, enabling Maresca to field youth and fringe players.They rampaged through the group phase, outclassing teams with a fraction of their resources such as Noah, Astana and Shamrock Rovers.
Maresca spoke on the eve of the final in Poland about how he had stressed the importance of the Conference League to his players.
He will not need to persuade them next season as they are back where they feel they belong, the Champions League, following a fourth-place finish in the Premier League.
'Winning mentality'
Maresca, in his first season at Stamford Bridge, said he hoped winning the Conference League would be a launchpad for bigger and better.
""Hopefully, it can be a starting point to build a winning mentality,"" he said. ""You need to win games. You need to win competitions. ""And for sure, the trophy we won tonight is going to make us better.
But also, I'm very proud about the path or the journey we have done in the Premier League.
""For me, it's the most difficult competition in the world. You have to be consistent in 38 games. And these players, they showed it."" Maresca had a rollercoaster first season after replacing Mauricio Pochettino.
His team were within touching distance of eventual Premier League champions Liverpool in mid-December before stumbling badly.
But they found an extra gear towards the end of the campaign, negotiating a tricky run-in to finish in the Champions League spots.
""For sure, we have improved a lot since we started,"" said former Leicester boss Maresca. ""We also start to win games in an ugly way. ""That is something with a young squad that you struggle to do that.""
The Italian has been keen to highlight the extreme youth of his expensively assembled squad.
The average age of his starting side was the youngest in a single Premier League campaign.
It is too early to predict whether they will return to those heady heights but the Conference League is a start.
Next on the agenda is a trip to the Club World Cup in the United States, for which Chelsea qualified by winning the 2021 Champions League.
""Now we have 10 days off, 10 days where we need to recover energy, and then we're going to start the Club World Cup,"" said Maresca.
""The target is to go game by game, try to go step by step, but at this moment we don't have any target for the Club World Cup.
""Now the only target is to recover energy, because the season has been very long.""

Slim chances of CB upholding July 12 ruling,"PK
Some lawyers ask why CJP Isa did not list the review petition against his order for hearing to clear up the ambiguity
Contrary to the majority opinion of a full bench of the Supreme Court, which on July 12, 2024 ordered allocation of reserved seats to the PTI, a constitutional bench (CB) reviewing the order states that the PTI is itself to blame for not getting reserved seats after the Feb 2024 general elections.
While hearing review petitions in the reserved seats case, the judges are wondering as to why the PTI did not challenge the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) orders to declare its candidates independent despite the fact that eminent lawyers were contesting elections on the PTI ticket.
The judges are also consistently defending the January 13, 2024, order of the Supreme Court to declare PTI's intra-party election illegal. The order had resulted in stripping the party of its election symbol
Even the judge, who himself raised serious questions on the conduct of the ECP in his minority view, is criticizing the PTIs' ""poor legal strategy"" to get reserved seats and the decision of the PTI backed candidates to join the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC), which had not contested in the general elections.
A three-member bench led by former Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa announced the verdict in the PTI intra-party election case on the night of January 13, 2024, the last date for submission of party symbols in the general elections.
Since May 9, 2023, PTI leadership has been accusing the government of using coercive tactics to pressure its leaders into leaving the party. Even during the elections, PTI-backed candidates were not allowed to run any campaign. Even nomination papers of some candidates were snatched before their submission.
The bench led by Justice Qazi Faez Isa had compelled the ECP to announce the date for the general elections in consultation with the president. However, there was a serious clash between the former CJP and the PTI as the latter had filed a presidential reference for his removal during its rule.
After January 13, 2024 order, the PTI had lost hope that it could get any relief from the Supreme Court led by CJP Isa and after the intra-party election case order, PTI counsel Latif Khosa had withdrawn the contempt petition filed against the ECP for not complying with the SC decision to provide level playing field to the PTI to contest the elections.
Some lawyers ask why CJP Isa did not list the review petition against his order for hearing to clear up the ambiguity, if the ECP was misinterpreting the order by declaring PTI candidates independent.
They note that if the SC could issue two clarifications in the Mubarak Sani case, then why could it not take notice of the misinterpretation of its important ruling by the ECP, which is a constitutional body.
Constitutional benches (CBs) have also been created in the Supreme Court and high courts in view of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the PTI, was passed using coercive tactics.
The CB hearing review petitions against the SC's July 12, 2024 order in the seats case also comprises judges who are selected by the executive members in the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) after passage of the 26th amendment.
No explanation is given as to why the CB committee did not give a recommendation to the JCP for the inclusion of the six judges who were part of the original bench that heard the reserved seats case.
Currently, no one on the bench is backing the majority decision in the reserved seats case. Even two signatories of the majority judgement are not passing any remark in favour of the July 12 verdict.
Justice Ali Baqar Najfi has given a surprise by using the term ""biased"" for the majority decision. Only Justice Salahuddin Panwar is showing interest in reading the majority judgement.
Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar said they, being junior judges, should defend the judgement under review. He, however, urged the SIC counsel Faisal Siddiqi to highlight important points for the determination at this stage.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, who is leading the bench, is consistent in his approach. He has been consistently raising questions about the relief given to the PTI by the majority judges on July 12, 2024.
Justice Mussarat Hilali, who was a member of the bench which had given January 13, 2024 order in the intra-party election case, is expressing concern that the majority judgement discussed the PTI intra-party election case judgement, which was not challenged before them.
Faisal Siddiqi said the majority judges criticized the ECP's conduct but they did not question the January 13 order. Siddiqi is trying to read the important portions of the July 12 judgement before the bench.
There are very slim chances that majority judgment will be upheld by this bench.
There is a criticism that the majority judges had done judicial overreach in this case. On the other hand, PTI lawyers are saying that majority judges had tried to restore democracy which is the salient feature of the Constitution. The hearing of the case is adjourned until June 16.
If the PTI could not get reserved seats, then the situation may not change but if the ruling parties get reserved seats then they will be easily in a position to get two-thirds majority in parliament, enabling them to amend the Constitution.
PPP through Farooq H Naek and Asad Abbasi have filed written replies in the reserved seats case. The PPP said the order under review contravenes established principles of constitutional interpretation.
By devising a procedure not contemplated under the Constitution, the order ventures into legislative territory, contrary to this honorable court's consistent jurisprudence that ""the function of the court is interpretation, not legislation.""
The reply states that it is a settled principle of this court that when the law prescribes a specific manner and procedure for doing something, it must be followed strictly without deviation. This principle alone warrants the recall of the order under review, it added.
