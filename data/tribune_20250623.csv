Iran-Israel conflict: what it means for Pakistan,"PL
The group is headed by Assa bin Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki, who posted a chilling video
The ongoing conflict between Iran and Israel has taken a heavy human toll in Iran and some in the Israel. How could this conflict affect Pakistan? Iran, after all, is one of the four neighbors of Pakistan. The other three are Afghanistan, China and India. It is only with China that Pakistan has good relations. It is cooperating with Beijing in several areas, including defence production. Pakistan is also partnering with China to build a regional communication network. That Israel was well informed about the targets that it hit resulted in the deaths of Mohammad Bagheri, the chief Iranian military staff and three other top military generals. Israel has also assassinated two top nuclear scientists.
It is obvious that the Jewish state was helped by those Iranian who oppose the clerics' regime in their country. As one observer put it, when the senior people in Tehran meet, you can't be sure whether the person sitting next to you works as a spy for Israel. When the Israelis began their campaign against Tehran on June 13, it was obvious that the targets hit were well selected, with information coming from those who worked as spies for the Jewish state. Video footage from Tehran confirmed the precision of the attacks – showing one floor of an apartment building hit, for example, but not others. The hit apartment housed the person the Israelis wished to kill.
Even after the devastating attacks in Lebanon on Hezbollah – a Tehran ally that had a large supply of armaments meant to be used against Israel – Tehran has not lost all of its allies. The Al-Qaeda affiliate in Yemen may pose a special danger for those who are supporting Israel and the latter's activities in the Middle East. It is likely to pose a special danger to Israeli supporters.
The group is headed by Assa bin Saad bin Atef al-Awlaki, who posted a chilling video. The video named several people who should be targeted for assassination. These included President Donald Trump, Vic President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and former DOGE chief Elon Musk. ""There are no red lines after all that has been happening to our people in Gaza,"" he said in the message. According to The Jerusalem Post, an Israeli newspaper, Awlaki urged all Muslims in America and Europe to make sure there is ""not a single safe place in the world for Jews"".
David Ignatius, who contributes to The Washington Post, wrote in his column published by the newspaper on June 14, 2025, ""Israel's tactical mastery is unquestionable. But in this latest assault on Iran – as in earlier campaigns in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen – Israel appears to have given relatively little thought to 'its day after' ambitions. Does Israel seek regime change in Iran, to permanently bend Iran away from its revolutionary course? That appears to be Netanyahu's message in a June 13, 2025, televised pitch to the Iranian people. 'This is your opportunity to stand and let your voices be heard,' he said. But there is a danger of overreach. Netanyahu may have to settle for a strike that will neuter the Iranian nuclear threat for a few more years but set up a future conflagration.""
Gerry Shih and Susannah George, who also cover the Middle East for the Post, wrote that ""the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear and military sites, along with the targeted killing of at least a dozen senior military officials and scientists, represents the latest sign of Israel's shift away from a decades-old policy favoring containment, restraint and short wars.""
They continued with their analysis by highlighting that ""in the past 20 months, the Israeli Defense Force has occupied territory and carried out frequent airstrikes in neighboring Lebanon and Syria, reflecting what Israeli military officials say is a new border security doctrine. Netanyahu has vowed not to cease the military campaign in Gaza until he achieves total victory over Hamas, displaying tolerance for prolonged conflicts that runs against traditional Israeli strategic thinking.""
Aaron David Miller, who has advised seven US secretaries of state on the Middle East, said there has been a shift within the Israeli security establishment which now appears comfortable with leading Israel as a ""regional hegemon"".
In 2020, for instance, Netanyahu declined to participate in a US operation that resulted in the assassination of Maj Gen Qasem Soleimani, Iran's top military commander. Netanyahu ""was very risk averse, very reluctant to use force,"" said Miller who dealt with Netanyahu over a long career at the State Department. ""He was always one step forward, two steps to the side, one step back. Now he's become risk ready.""
Since Netanyahu lunched the operation known as the 'Rising Lion', he is not in favour of the Trump administration and Iran to return to the negotiating table. After carrying out operations in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel has blocked the new government in Syria which assumed control in December 2024 from establishing itself as a military power. It has launched hundreds of airstrikes on strategic stockpiles and demanded that Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa demilitarise an entire region running south of Damascus to the Israeli border.
According to Danny Citrinowicz, a former military Israeli military intelligence official who specialises in Iran and the regional allies, ""when you don't have Syria, when Hamas is nonexistent, and without Hezbollah, you can do almost whatever you want."" But he warned that Israel had not done enough long-term planning beyond the immediate use of force. ""So we expand attacks into Iran's energy sector, so we fight a war of attrition that never ends. And then what?"" Miller, the former State Department official, said that Netanyahu had demonstrated Israel's military superiority and his willingness to use it, but his Arab neighbours wanted to see him turn that into lasting stability. ""The more Netanyahu is on a course in which he's not going to translate his escalation dominance into more stable arrangements or peace deals, the more wary the neighbors will become.""
China is working with Pakistan to develop plans to expand CPEC, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, into Afghanistan and Iran. Eventually the road network would extend to the countries of Central Asia that were once part of the dissolved Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the USSR. This would make it possible for China to tap and transport minerals from the area to feed its rapidly expanding industrial system. With the possible participation of the United States in the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict, these plans would be disrupted.

Timely energy projects 'top priority',"US
The Secretary added that timely completion of these projects within the stipulated timeframe is a major challenge.
Under the Good Governance Roadmap Program, ensuring merit and transparency in institutional matters remains the top priority. The biggest challenge in this regard is completing ongoing energy projects within the stipulated timeframe. In line with the Chief Secretary's directive, all officials must play their part in operationalizing e-tendering, e-payment, and one-window service platform.
These views were expressed by Secretary Energy and Power Muhammad Zubair Khan in a meeting attended by the heads of PEDO, K-P Oil and Gas Company, Electric Inspectorate and Energy Planning Directorate regarding the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Good Governance Roadmap. Additional Secretary Admin Shoaib Khan, Additional Secretary Power Anwar Khan Sherani and other senior officers also attended the meeting.
Meanwhile, the Secretary while emphasizing the strict implementation of the guidelines set for ongoing energy projects, said that currently work is progressing rapidly on Balakot, Lawi, Gorkin Matiltan, Gabral Kalam, and Madyen Hydropower projects.
The Secretary added that timely completion of these projects within the stipulated timeframe is a major challenge.

18 Pakistani universities are now globally recognised for their quality education and environment
The QS World University Rankings is a prestigious international ranking of the world's top universities, released annually by UK-based higher education analytics firm Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Last year, 10 Pakistani universities made the cut among approximately 1,500 universities from more than 100 countries. Impressively, this year, 18 Pakistani universities have joined the ranks of globally acknowledged and celebrated varsities – almost double the number. The inclusion of our universities in this list is a moment of pride for the higher education sector and its continued efforts towards producing the educated cream of the country.
Among the 18 Pakistani universities included in the rankings, Quaid e Azam University, Islamabad, ranks highest at 354 globally, whereas The Islamia University of Bahawalpur falls within the 1,401-1500 range. Without doubt, their placement is a noteworthy achievement. However, it does raise important questions about the shortcomings in our higher education system that deters these universities from breaking into the top 100.
The universities in the QS list are ranked according to several indicators including academic reputation, employer reputation, citations per faculty and faculty presence. While Pakistani universities do their best to prepare their students for a well-rounded segue into the real world, they often fall short of advancing original research and publications in high-impact journals.
The country's field of academia is no stranger to corruption at the top and hassle-free publication sometimes restricts itself to upper class circles, making academia inaccessible for a lot of academics. Moreover, universities often lack government funding crucial for modern facilities and advancements. This delay is complemented with outdated curriculums that do not always reflect what the future demands.
Despite these gaps and roadblocks, 18 Pakistani universities are now globally recognised for their quality education and environment, and they will hopefully pave the way for even stronger performance in the future.

Bublik produces masterclass to win Halle final,"US
He was in superb form to beat former world number one Medvedev
Kazakhstan's Alexander Bublik beat Daniil Medvedev for the first time in his career to claim the Halle title on Sunday, winning 6-3 7-6(4) to continue his resurgence.
Bublik had lost his previous six meetings against Russian Medvedev, winning only one set in the process, but produced a superb exhibition of grass-court tennis to end that streak.
Former world number one Medvedev has now lost his last six Tour-level finals. So often the showman, Bublik showed his new maturity with a calm display in the final as he continued the form that saw him beat world number one Jannik Sinner in the last 16 this week.
He broke the Medvedev serve in the eighth game of the first set and then held his own with ease to move ahead. Medvedev had a set point when Bublik served at 4-5 in the second set but could do nothing as his wily opponent feathered a delicate drop shot from behind the baseline. Third seed Medvedev then led 4-1 in the tiebreaker but the unseeded Bublik stormed back to complete a memorable week.
Vondrousova beats qualifier Wang to win Berlin Open
Former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova needed three sets to subdue Chinese qualifier Wang Xinyu on Sunday and win the Berlin Open title, completing an improbable run to her first trophy since her London triumph two years ago.
The 25-year-old Czech, who had dropped to 164th in the world after an injury-plagued 12 months, was playing her first final since winning Wimbledon in 2023.
She was made to work hard for a 7-6(10) 4-6 6-2 victory and even had to save six set points in the tight first-set tiebreak. Her win comes a week before the start of Wimbledon where Vondrousova will now be a force to be reckoned with.
""Nice to see a full crowd. I really enjoyed the tennis week and the support,"" the Czech said after winning her third career title. ""Congrats on a great week, you played an amazing match,"" she said, addressing Wang.
""It was an amazing week we had everything we needed. ""I feel like it could not have been better for us here. We were all working really hard. We came here to try and win the first match. So very happy,"" Vondrousova added.
Wang, who had to battle through the qualifying process and then beat four top-20 players to reach her first-ever tour final, kept causing problems with her pinpoint accuracy as she fired repeated baseline winners.
Vondrousova's serve looked unbreakable until Wang earned her first break point in the seventh game, breaking Vondrousova who slipped and hurt her ankle on that point.
But the Czech came back to snatch the tie-break after the 23-year-old Wang had wasted six set points.
The 23-year-old showed few nerves in her maiden singles tour final and levelled after breaking her opponent once in the second set. But Vondrousova, who beat Australian Open champion Madison Keys in the first round and world number one Aryna Sabalenka in the semi-finals in Berlin, raced back with two breaks of her own to go 4-1 up in the decider.
She then played a perfect service game at 5-2, with a superb dropshot, a crosscourt backhand winner and a powerful forehand that forced an error by Wang on matchpoint number one.

Iran-Israel conflict could impact Pakistan: Masood,"US
Former AJK president fears war may trigger refugee influx into Pakistan
Former president of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and senior diplomat Masood Khan has warned that the escalating Iran-Israel conflict could have grave and far-reaching implications for Pakistan's national security and stability.
In a series of media interviews, Khan expressed deep concern over the widening scope of hostilities between Iran and Israel, cautioning that a prolonged war could trigger a new wave of refugee influx into Pakistan, similar to the aftermath of the Afghan conflict.
""If the war drags on, there is a strong possibility of a mass exodus of Iranian refugees towards Pakistan,"" he stated, noting that such a scenario would strain Pakistan's resources and social fabric.
Khan emphasized that a potentially more dangerous outcome would be the weakening of the Pakistan-Iran border, making it vulnerable to exploitation by anti-state elements.
""Groups backed by hostile foreign powers, especially Indiasuch as BLA, BLF, and other proxies — could infiltrate into Pakistan unchecked, posing a serious threat to our internal security,"" he warned. Touching on the strategic motives behind Israel's military actions, Khan pointed out that Tel Aviv has made targeting Iran's nuclear infrastructure.
""Israel has already attacked nuclear facilities in Natanz, Isfahan, Fordow, and other key locations where uranium enrichment and missile programmes are believed to be based,"" he said. ""They claim to have neutralized nearly 40 percent of Iran's air defense systems.""
Khan asserted that Israel is pressuring the United States to either intervene directly in the conflict or allow Israel to use tactical nuclear weapons against Iran.
""Israel is lobbying for the use of bunker-buster bombs or subterranean nuclear strikes that, according to them, would limit radioactive fallout to underground areas,"" he explained.

Pro-Palestinian activist set free on US judge's orders,"US
Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil faces possible deportation
A federal judge ordered the Trump administration on Friday to release Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student who became a leader of pro-Palestinian campus protests, reported AFP.
Khalil, a legal permanent US resident who is married to a US citizen and has a US-born son, has been in custody since March facing potential deportation.
District Judge Michael Farbiarz ordered Khalil's release on bail during a hearing on Friday and he will be allowed to return to New York while his deportation case proceeds.
""After more than three months, we can finally breathe a sigh of relief and know that Mahmoud is on his way home,"" his wife, Michigan-born dentist Noor Abdalla, said in a statement.
""We know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon our family and so many others the government is trying to silence for speaking out against Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians,"" added Abdalla, who gave birth to the couple's first child while her husband was in detention.
Amol Sinha, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, which is among the groups representing Khalil, welcomed the release order.
""This is an important step in vindicating Mr Khalil's rights as he continues to be unlawfully targeted by the federal government for his advocacy in support of Palestinian rights,"" Sinha said. ""We're confident he will ultimately prevail in the fight for his freedom.""
Since his March 8 arrest by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Khalil has become a symbol of President Donald Trump's campaign to stifle pro-Palestinian student activism against the Gaza war, in the name of curbing anti-Semitism.
At the time a graduate student at Columbia University in New York, Khalil was one of the most visible leaders of nationwide campus protests against Israel's war in Gaza.
Following his arrest, US authorities transferred Khalil, who was born in Syria to Palestinian parents, nearly 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) from his home in New York to a detention centre in Louisiana, pending deportation.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio has invoked a law approved during the 1950s Red Scare that allows the United States to remove foreigners seen as adverse to US foreign policy.
Rubio argues that US constitutional protections of free speech do not apply to foreigners and that he alone can make decisions without judicial review.
Hundreds of students have seen their visas revoked, with some saying they were targeted for everything from writing opinion articles to minor arrest records.

Man City squad must be trimmed: Guardiola,"PK
The Premier League side brought in several players ahead of the Club World Cup
Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola said Saturday his club will have to sell players this summer for the stars' own good.
The Premier League side brought in several players ahead of the Club World Cup, leaving Guardiola with a large squad.
Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan has been linked with a move to Turkish side Galatasaray in recent days.
Guardiola said he did not know anything about it, but said several players would have to be sold following the purchases of Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan Cherki and Rayan Ait-Nouri.
""I will love to have the players we have right now all season,"" Guardiola told reporters in Atlanta.
""The problem is they will be unhappy during the season, they will be sad, they will be disappointed.
""I don't want that. I do it for them, not for me. For them. We have to see what happens, it's a long time until the transfer window will be closed, we have to see step by step.""
Guardiola has said in the past he prefers a squad size of around 20 senior players, whereas City have more than 30 at present.
Before trimming the squad City are hoping to win the Club World Cup in the United States with their new arrivals providing fresh energy.
They beat Wydad AC in their first match and face Al Ain on Sunday at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium where they can seal qualification to the last 16.
Guardiola said Spanish defensive midfielder Rodri was not able to start the game as he continues his comeback from injury.
""He's getting better. He can play 20 minutes, 30 minutes at a time. He wants to play to help but we want to protect his knee,"" said the coach.
Guardiola said he was keen to take City far in the Club World Cup and it was a ""privilege to be here"".
The coach dismissed some of the complaints about the competition and pointed towards the attitude of the South American clubs as an example of follow.
""I love when I see Botafogo, all the Brazilian teams, Argentinian teams, how they celebrate, how they are together, I love them,"" said Guardiola.
""I'm pretty sure for the South American teams, for the Brazilian teams, for Argentinean teams, this competition is maybe the maximum...
""I like how all the games are tight, except one or two, and people are surprised, European teams lose. Welcome to the real world. Welcome to the real world my friends.""

Moot urges child-focused climate action,"US
Environmental degradation linked to human rights
Youth took centre stage at the Youth Convention: Climate Change and Role of Youth, where Obun2, in partnership with Terre des Hommes and civil society allies, unveiled its landmark report ""The Impact of Climate Change on Children in Pakistan."" The two-day convention, held at Beach Luxury Hotel, brought together youth leaders, climate activists, policymakers, and researchers from across the country.
Organised by the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF), in collaboration with An Association for Rural Development (DevCon), the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Child (SPARC), and the Gender and Empowerment Organisation (GEO), the event underscored the urgent need for child-focused climate action, with a central theme highlighting the critical role of youth in climate resilience and advocacy.
Alarming impact on Pakistan's children
The report, authored by researcher Javeria Khan, paints a stark picture of how climate change is disproportionately affecting Pakistan's children and most vulnerable; with 33 million people affected by 2022 floods, half of them children; 26,600 schools destroyed, disrupting education for over two million students; 154,000 child deaths in 2019 linked to air pollution; 119 per cent increase in child marriages in flood-hit regions; 11 million children exposed to toxic smog in 2024; only three per cent of children have access to disaster preparedness education.
""These numbers are not just statistics. They represent lives disrupted, futures derailed, and rights denied,"" said Executive Director of Obun2, Qindeel Shujaat. ""We must act now to build a future where every child is safe, educated, and empowered to fight climate change.""
Voices for a sustainable tomorrow
Speakers across sectors called for urgent, youth-led climate action. ""We are proud to stand with Pakistan's youth,"" said Country Head of Terre des Hommes, Salam Dharejo. ""They have the ideas, energy, and vision to lead the climate movement. Let's empower them with the tools and support they need.""
Chairman of Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum, Mehran Ali Shah,, echoed this, stating ""we trust in our youth. They are already facing the consequences of climate inaction. It's time they lead the solutions.""
Meanwhile, Chairman of Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC), Iqbal Detho, connected environmental degradation to human rights, noting that ""climate change is not just an ecological issue; it is a matter of justice, survival, and dignity, especially for children.""
Representing the Sindh Directorate of Climate Change, Ayhan Mustafa Bhutto, stressed the need for innovation. ""We encourage young people to come forward with solutions. The government must become an enabler, not a bystander.""
Key policy recommendations
To address the growing crisis, the report recommends bold action, including the establishment of a Child Climate Fund for local adaptation and mitigation; investing in climate-resilient schools and infrastructure; integrating climate education into national curricula; expanding mental health and psychosocial support in disaster zones; and partnering with private sector and global organisations for child-focused resilience programmes
Convention highlights
The convention featured youth-led panels, interactive exhibits, storytelling sessions, and policy dialogues. Young participants shared innovative ideas ranging from clean energy solutions to community-based climate adaptation.
""This is not just a convention,"" said one youth participant. ""It's a movement. We are the generation that will live through the worst of climate change, if we don't change course now.""
The event concluded with a call for immediate government action, with attendees demanding the incorporation of the report's recommendations into Pakistan's national climate policies and education strategies.
Obun2 distributed printed and digital copies of the report to policymakers, media, and civil society actors, with support from the stateofchildren.com portal.
Obun2 is a Pakistan-based organisation dedicated to advancing child rights, human rights, and climate justice through evidence-based research, advocacy, and partnerships with public institutions.

An ideal five-year economic policy,"PK
Fiscal consolidation must be paired with inclusive growth, structural reforms
Navigating a complex domestic and global landscape, Pakistan stands at a critical juncture. The recently unveiled budget for fiscal year 2025-26, while a step towards fiscal consolidation, underscores the nation's pressing need for a comprehensive and sustained five-year economic policy. Such a policy must not only address immediate crises but also lay the groundwork for long-term, inclusive, and sustainable growth.
This article outlines an ideal economic roadmap for Pakistan for the next five years, predicated on the latest budget, the nation's current economic structure, and the prevailing global political economy.
The 2025-26 budget signals a clear intent to stabilise the economy, largely in alignment with the stringent conditions of a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme. Key features include a significant increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio through new levies on salaried individuals, real estate, and retail sectors, a hike in the petroleum development levy, and a substantial allocation for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP). While these measures are crucial for fiscal discipline and revenue generation, they must be embedded within a broader, more strategic economic vision for the nation.
The global political and economic landscape presents a myriad of complexities. As a nation heavily reliant on imports for essential commodities and on exports to a few key markets like the European Union and the United States, Pakistan is susceptible to global economic slowdowns and trade protectionism. Geopolitical tensions in the region, including the fragile situation in Afghanistan and the perennially strained relationship with India, create an environment of uncertainty that deters foreign investment.
The strategic partnership with China, embodied by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), offers significant opportunities for infrastructure development but also brings with it debt obligations and the need for careful management to ensure its benefits are widely distributed.
In this context, an ideal five-year economic policy for Pakistan should be anchored in a bold vision of achieving economic sovereignty through sustainable and inclusive growth. The government's own ""Uraan Pakistan"" five-year plan, with its focus on the ""Five Es"" – Exports, E-Pakistan, Equity and Empowerment, Environment, and Energy – provides a solid framework.
The immediate priority must be to continue on the path of fiscal consolidation outlined in the latest budget, but with a greater emphasis on equity and efficiency. Instead of repeatedly squeezing the existing narrow base of taxpayers, the focus must shift to bringing untaxed and undertaxed sectors, such as real estate and agriculture, into the tax net. A progressive taxation system where the wealthy contribute their fair share is essential for social cohesion and sustainable revenue generation.
A comprehensive review of government expenditures is necessary to cut non-essential spending. However, austerity measures should not come at the expense of critical social sectors like health and education.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) must be given full autonomy to function independently to effectively manage inflation and maintain a stable exchange rate. A market-driven exchange rate is crucial for export competitiveness. The perennial drain on the national exchequer from loss-making SOEs must be plugged through a transparent and strategic privatisation process.
Pakistan's long-term prosperity hinges on its ability to transition from an import-dependent to an export-led growth model. A five-year strategy should focus on:
i) Moving beyond the traditional reliance on textiles, Pakistan must actively promote and incentivise exports in sectors with high growth potential, such as information technology, pharmaceuticals, and high-value agricultural products.
ii) Addressing the high cost of doing business by ensuring a reliable and affordable energy supply, improving infrastructure, and streamlining regulatory processes is paramount. CPEC projects should be leveraged to enhance regional connectivity and reduce logistical costs.
iii) Proactively seeking new markets and strengthening trade relationships with existing partners through strategic trade agreements will be crucial.
The global digital economy presents a massive opportunity for Pakistan's youthful and tech-savvy population. A dedicated focus on ""E-Pakistan"" should involve:
i) Ensuring widespread access to high-speed and affordable internet is the foundation upon which a digital economy is built.
ii) Providing a conducive ecosystem for IT companies and freelancers through tax incentives, skill development programmes, and access to international payment gateways can significantly boost foreign exchange earnings.
iii) Leveraging technology to improve governance, enhance transparency, and reduce corruption will have a far-reaching positive impact on the overall economic environment.
No economic policy can be successful without investing in the country's greatest asset: its people. This requires:
i) A radical overhaul of the education system is needed to produce a workforce equipped with the skills required for the 21st-century economy. A focus on vocational training and technical education is essential.
ii) Increasing female labour force participation is not just a matter of social justice but also a critical economic imperative.
iii) Providing a safe and supportive environment for women in the workplace can unlock immense economic potential.
iv) Increased allocation for the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) in the latest budget is a welcome step. These programmes must be further strengthened and expanded to protect the most vulnerable segments of the population from economic shocks.
Pakistan's long-term economic viability is intrinsically linked to its ability to manage its energy and environmental challenges. A forward-looking policy should prioritise:
i) Tackling the circular debt through a combination of tariff rationalisation, improved governance in distribution companies, and a crackdown on electricity theft is non-negotiable.
ii) A strategic shift towards indigenous and renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, will not only reduce the import bill but also contribute to a cleaner environment.
iii) Investing in climate-resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable agricultural practices are essential to mitigate the economic impact of future climate-related disasters.
The next five years present a window of opportunity for Pakistan to break free from the shackles of its past economic struggles. The path is arduous and requires difficult choices and sustained commitment. By embracing a holistic and forward-looking economic policy that balances fiscal discipline with pro-growth reforms, invests in its people, and adapts to the realities of the global political economy, Pakistan can forge a path towards a more prosperous and resilient future.
The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and for Pakistan, that first step must be a resolute commitment to a new economic paradigm.

US airlines at risk as global carriers bypass Middle East,"US
Airlines continued to avoid large parts of the Middle East due to missile exchanges between Israel and Iran
US strikes on Iran's nuclear sites could heighten the threat to American operators in the region, an organisation that monitors flight risks warned on Sunday, as some airlines cancelled flights to and from Dubai and Doha.
Airlines continued to avoid large parts of the Middle East due to missile exchanges between Israel and Iran, the latest upheaval to travel in the region.
Singapore Airlines said it cancelled flights from Singapore to Dubai following a security assessment and British Airways cancelled flights to and from Dubai and Doha.
Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, said the US attacks on Iran may increase risks to US operators in the region.
""While there have been no specific threats made against civil aviation, Iran has previously warned it would retaliate by attacking US military interests in the Middle East – either directly or via proxies such as Hezbollah,"" Safe Airspace said.
Meanwhile, flight tracking website FlightRadar24, said airlines maintained flight diversions around the region. Its website showed airlines were not flying over Iran, Iraq, Syria and Israel.
They have chosen routings such as north via the Caspian Sea or south via Egypt and Saudi Arabia, even if these mean higher fuel and crew costs and longer flight times.
Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic.
In the nine days since Israel attacked Iran, carriers have suspended flights to destinations in the affected countries.
With Russian and Ukrainian airspace also closed due to war, the Middle East has become a more important route for flights between Europe and Asia.
Airlines are also concerned about a potential spike in oil prices following the US attacks, which will increase the cost of jet fuel.
In the days before the US strikes, American Airlines suspended flights to Qatar and United Airlines did the same with flights to Dubai.

"AI gamble must be smart, not just fast","US
No matter how lucrative AI-driven public sector may be, these models must be thoroughly tested before being deployed
The future of data sharing changed drastically when the US realised that 9/11 was a failure of intelligence agencies to act in concert on then-available data and hence called the incident a ""data fusion"" crisis. The US Department of Homeland Security began setting up a robust network of ""fusion centres"" – state and locally run organisations that allow real-time sharing of critical intelligence and datasets between two or more government units for identifying red flags.
Fast forward to 2025, and now Artificial Intelligence (AI) is taking over such ""fusion centres"" worldwide – with possibilities that are endless. AI agents are replacing humans, and language models are generating insights that were previously unheard of. However, as is the case with every technology, the use of AI, especially in the public sector and in legal matters, remains a double-edged sword and must be handled with a pinch of salt.
For instance, in June 2023, Schwartz, an attorney with Levidow, Levidow & Oberman in New York, used ChatGPT for legal case research and was fined by the judge for citing false precedents with bogus names in his brief. The large language model (LLM) was apparently hallucinating – a problem where these chatbots make up fictitious data on their own.
Similarly, in March 2024, the Microsoft-powered chatbot MyCity gave incorrect legal information that could have led prospective businessmen to break the law. It falsely claimed that landlords could openly discriminate based on the income of tenants and that restaurant owners could take a share of their workers' tips.
Hence, when it comes to using AI, public institutions are now faced with a tough choice: should they rely on public AI models hosted by third parties such as ChatGPT, adopt open-source models such as LLaMA, or train their own proprietary AI models in the long run? Choosing the right AI strategy is crucial here.
In 2024, Air Canada's virtual assistant was found to be giving factually incorrect information about discounts to a customer who then took the matter to court and was awarded damages.
Similarly, when Denmark rolled out AI algorithms in its social security system, the system was found to have an inherent bias against marginalised groups such as the elderly, low-income families, migrants, and foreigners. Ninety per cent of the cases that AI marked as fraud later turned out to be genuine, and the whole episode is now taught as a classic case study in discrimination and breach of the European Union's (EU) AI Act's regulations on social scoring systems.
Therefore, if any public sector organisation chooses to use a third-party model trained by OpenAI in its operations, there is a risk of bias against people of colour and disadvantaged groups – as the training data scraped from the internet, social media and discussion forums is usually biased itself.
A good AI strategy involves thoughtful and controlled phased deployments with well-planned use cases. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began with publicly available AI tools to improve employee productivity but also rolled out its AI vision and development roadmap. In the meantime, it focused on developing specialised AI applications – such as one to train officers dealing with asylum applications and conducting security investigations.
By December 2024, DHS had launched DHSChat on its internal secure network – a cutting-edge algorithm that can draft reports, streamline tasks, develop software, and, unlike other large language models, ensures employee data is protected and not used to train external models. In fact, as a best practice and as mandated by the Trump administration's executive order, DHS actively maintains its AI inventory, which includes a list of use cases related to AI in its operations.
For countries like Pakistan, our institutions could use a mix of public, open-source and proprietary models – depending on the nature of the task at hand. When it comes to using AI as the new Google, public models are usually fine, but for drafting memos and summarising reports, it is not advisable to use a public model. For that, the Ministry of IT or other institutions can host their own open-source AI models in their data centres or fine-tune them to develop proprietary models.
For critical systems, it is always recommended not to entirely replace existing automation with AI. There is a need to install a supervisor for fact-checking and verifying the output of AI models for hallucinations and bias. No matter how lucrative the idea of an AI-driven public sector may be, it is important to thoroughly test and check the behaviour of these models before deploying them.
The AI-based transformation project currently being executed at the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will serve as a test case for other AI-aspiring public agencies.

A case to abolish capital gains tax,"US
This tax has many unfair features; its withdrawal will increase incentives for more capital investment
Virtually all economists agree that capital formation is essential for economic growth and job creation by increasing the pool of risk capital available for new entrepreneurial startups. Capital includes machinery, equipment, plants, computers and physical tools that workers use on the job in order to enhance productivity and generate more output.
Capital also increasingly applies to intangibles like patents, inventions, computer software and information technology, which are more important than ever for the production of goods and services in the modern economy. Almost everything you own and use for personal or investment purposes is capital asset. Examples include a home, moveable and immovable property and stocks or bonds held as investments.
A capital gains tax is the tax when you sell a capital asset. Capital gain is the income derived from the sale of investment capital. This capital investment can be a home, plot of land, farm, purchase of stocks or bonds and other assets. Capital gain is the difference between the money received from selling the asset and the price paid for it.
The capital gains tax is different from almost all other forms of taxation in that it is a voluntary tax. Since the tax is paid only when an asset is sold, taxpayers can legally avoid payment by holding on to their assets – a phenomenon known as the ""lock-in effect"".
No single tax issue has been the cause of more controversy than the capital gains tax. Tax rates on investment income have steadily climbed over the years with short-term capital gains tax rates or long-term gains; those held for a longer period. Tax rates on dividends, estates and high-income wages and salaries have also climbed with negative repercussions for the economy.
There is another large inequity in the capital gains tax. It represents a form of double taxation on capital formation. A government can choose to tax either the value of an asset or its yield, but it should not tax both. Capital gains are literally the appreciation of the value of an existing asset. Any appreciation reflects merely an increase in the after-tax rate of return on the asset. The taxes implicit in the asset's after-tax earnings are already reflected in the asset price or the change in price. Any additional tax is strictly double taxation.
One of the least fair features of the capital gains tax is that it taxes gains that may be attributable only to price changes, not real gains. This is because the capital gains tax is not indexed for inflation. The lack of indexing can have major distortion effects on what an individual pays in capital gains tax. In fact, in some cases, the effective tax on inflation overwhelmingly exceeds any tax on real inflation-adjusted capital gain.
That is why many tax analysts argue that the most equitable rate of tax on capital gains is zero – a strong case to abolish the capital gains tax from the tax code.
There are many unfair features embedded in tax treatment of capital gains. One is that individuals are permitted to deduct only a portion of the capital losses incurred per year, whereas they must pay taxes on all the gains, introducing an unfriendly bias in the tax code against risk taking.
When taxpayers undertake risky investments, the government taxes fully any gain that they realise if the investment has a positive return, but the government allows only a partial tax deduction against the earned income if taxpayers incur a capital loss.
Capital gain is also a double tax on corporate earnings. For example, corporations are taxed at the corporate level through the corporate income tax, but then shareholders have to pay a tax on the future value of those distributed earnings reflected in the share price through the capital gains tax. Thus, both the future income stream and the capitalisation of the future income stream are taxed.
Having a ""lock-in effect"", a high capital gains tax is avoided by delaying the sale of an asset. Therefore, eliminating the tax will lead to what is called an ""unlocking effect"" on asset sales. This ""unlocking effect"", in a well-functioning capital market, will want investors to sell their ""old"" assets to free up money so they can provide seed capital for potentially higher-returning assets – a pro-growth initiative.
Given that the impact of the capital gains tax on total federal revenue collection vis-a-vis corporate income taxes, individual income taxes, sales taxes, excise taxes, etc is minimal, it is nevertheless a high cost of monitoring to the tax collector and a high cost of compliance to the taxpayer. It also coincides with low-economic growth and below-average capital investment.
Abolishing the capital gains tax would deliver an immediate boost to the economy in addition to long-term benefits. It would also increase incentives for more capital investment in existing firms, promote entrepreneurship, business creation, competitiveness, new jobs and higher wages, benefitting all income groups and last but not the least – raising stock market valuation in real terms!

IOC chief Coventry ready for the office,"PK
With Los Angeles hosting the 2028 Olympics, Trump will feature often on her agenda
First impressions can be deceptive but Kirsty Coventry showed that behind a sunny disposition she will have the mettle to deal with the trickiest of people and situations when she succeeds Thomas Bach as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday.
Looming large on the horizon of the 41-year-old Zimbabwean -- the first woman and African to occupy the post of the most powerful single figure in sport -- is US President Donald Trump.
With Los Angeles hosting the 2028 Olympics, Trump will feature often on Coventry's agenda.
Trump has not been shy in giving public dressing downs to world leaders — notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa.
Judging by Coventry's initial response, after a crushing first-round victory in the presidential election in March, she may have Trump's measure.
""I have been dealing with, let's say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old,"" she said, adding ""communication will be key.""
Unlike Trump, though, Coventry embraces the word failure, for it helped forge her stellar career.
""Everything's scary. Embrace that. You have to fail,"" Coventry told the swimming team at her American alma mater Auburn University last year.
""I've learned the best lessons by failing, and I have failed at many things. Life has a really good way of humbling you.""
At the same time that steely resolve comes to the surface when winning is at stake.
""I was banned from playing card games with the family, because they didn't like to deal with me when I lost,"" she said.
A glance at Coventry's CV suggests failure in her life has been relative.
Coventry, who had the Olympic rings tattooed on a leg after her first Games in 2000, is a two-time Olympic gold medallist and she has contributed seven of Zimbabwe's overall Games medals tally of eight.She has accrued domestic political experience, as she was Zimbabwe's Minister for Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation from 2019 to this year.

Rawalpindi completes Leh dredging,"US
The 8-kilometre-long channel and 15 adjoining sewerage drains within Rawalpindi were cleared of silt
Ahead of the monsoon season, the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA) has completed the desilting of Nullah Leh, a key flood channel in Rawalpindi.
The project, launched on May 8 with heavy machinery and manpower, concluded recently and cost Rs80 million, funded by the Punjab government.
The effort aims to ensure that major water flow during the monsoon can pass through Nullah Leh to the Soan River without causing urban flooding. Seven machines will remain stationed along the channel's banks until September as a precautionary measure.
The 8-kilometre-long channel and 15 adjoining sewerage drains within Rawalpindi were cleared of silt, with efforts focused on increasing depth, removing blockages near bridges and culverts, and ensuring uninterrupted water flow.
The project underwent two third-party inspectionsby the secretary of housing and the commissioner's team with a third inspection scheduled by the Federal Flood Commission.
WASA also inspected all its monsoon-related machinery and launched a simultaneous cleaning operation for 15 city drains, expected to be completed by June 30. Additionally, it is working to clean and cover all open manholes, with a six-hour response time for complaint resolution.
Preparations for the monsoon also include the establishment of one control room at the WASA headquarters and five emergency camps across the city.

BD's key pacers to return for SL series,"PK
Taskin, Shoriful and Mustafizur to play two intra-squad matches
Bangladesh cricket team's three key fast bowlers Mustafizur Rahman, Taskin Ahmed and Shoriful Islam have recovered from injuries and are likely to return for the upcoming white-ball series against Sri Lanka.
A Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official confirmed on Saturday that the trio will undergo final fitness assessments during two intra-squad practice matches scheduled for June 23 and 25 at the Bir Shrestha Shaheed Flight Lieutenant Motiur Rahman Cricket Stadium in Chattogram.
The three fast bowlers, all recovering from recent injuries, were seen bowling at full pace during the team's preparation camp. While their return to competitive cricket looks promising, BCB's medical team remains cautious.
""They have bowled at full intensity, but we have to be mindful that they are returning from injuries,"" a BCB medical department official said.
""Their match fitness will be assessed during the practice games, and only then will we make a final decision regarding their participation in the Sri Lanka tour. At this moment, they have not reported any discomfort.""
Mustafizur missed the T20I series against Pakistan after suffering a thumb injury during the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.
Taskin has been sidelined due to an ankle injury, while Shoriful was ruled out of the final T20I against Pakistan following a Grade one strain of the rectus femoris muscle in his right leg, as revealed by an MRI scan.
Bangladesh's white-ball probables began their training camp on Saturday in Chattogram, focusing on building momentum ahead of the Sri Lanka tour.
Following the two-match Test series, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka will face off in a three-match ODI series starting next month, with the first two games scheduled to be played in Colombo and the final ODI in Pallekele.
The tour will conclude with a three-match T20I series, to be played on July 10, 13 and 16 in Pallekele, Dambulla, and Colombo, respectively.

Speaker Swati slams US strike on Iran,"US
Saif blasts Shehbaz for Trump praise, calls it insult to Ummah
Speaker of the Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Babar Saleem Swati, has strongly condemned the United States' unprovoked attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, terming it a blatant and serious violation of Iran's sovereignty, territorial integrity, the United Nations Charter, and international law.
He stated that the strike comes at a time when Iran is already facing aggression from Israel, adding that such actions will not only escalate tensions in the region but also pose a grave threat to global peace. Swati expressed full solidarity and sympathy with the people and government of Iran, urging the international community to take immediate notice of the aggression and play its role in ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East.
He further emphasized that international institutions like the United Nations must not remain silent spectators, and that upholding international law should be their foremost priority.
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations, Barrister Dr Saif, has strongly criticized Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's reported proposal to nominate former US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, calling it the ""height of sycophantic politics.""
Barrister Saif said it was incomprehensible to suggest such an honor for a man ""responsible for raining bombs on Muslims."" He pointed out that President Trump not only directly attacked Iran during his tenure but also rejected ceasefire resolutions on Gaza eight times.
""Instead of mediating peace between Iran and Israel, innocent civilians are being directly targeted — and Shehbaz Sharif remains silent, yet talks of nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize. This is not only shameful, it is condemnable,"" he stated.
He further said, ""There is a limit to flattery, and Shehbaz Sharif's recent remarks are not just disgraceful but reflect the ultimate level of servitude. Nominating Trump is tantamount to insulting the entire Muslim Ummah.""

South Punjab records frequent suicide cases,"NL
Sociologists warn of silent epidemic if warning signs are ignored
A rise in suicide incidents across South Punjab has pointed to a mental health crisis in the region. In recent weeks, several cases of young men and women taking their own lives have been reported, with little to no attention paid to the underlying psychological and social issues that drive such acts.
According to mental health professionals, the primary triggers behind these tragedies include untreated depression, emotional isolation, economic pressure, and family conflict. What makes the issue more alarming is the lack of awareness and acceptance of mental illness in the region, particularly in conservative and rural areas where emotional distress is often ignored or dismissed.
Clinical psychologist Dr Sehar Iqbal, who has worked extensively with trauma and depression patients in Multan, emphasised the importance of early intervention. ""Most people who contemplate suicide do not truly want to die,"" she said. ""They want their emotional pain to stop, and they often feel like there is no one who understands or listens. One sincere conversation can sometimes reverse that decision.""
She noted that emotional withdrawal, insomnia, agitation, expressions of hopelessness, or sudden behavioral changes are often visible but misinterpreted or ignored.
""Mental health is just as real as physical health and it must be treated with equal seriousness,"" she added.
Family members, psychologists suggest, are the first line of defence. Simply being attentive to changes in behaviour, offering a non-judgmental ear, and ensuring open communication can serve as powerful tools in preventing suicidal thoughts from escalating. Phrases such as ""don't worry,"" ""be strong,"" or ""this will pass"" often do more harm than good, whereas calmly saying ""I'm here for you"" can offer immense relief.

Govt urged to withdraw Trump nomination,"SG
Politicians slam US president after Iran strikes
As the Middle East veers closer to all-out war, Pakistani politicians and notable figures on Sunday lambasted the government's decision to nominate US President Donald Trump for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize – just hours after Washington officially entered the Israel-Iran conflict with a thunderous overnight assault.
The dramatic escalation came as Trump, in a televised statement, declared that American forces had ""obliterated"" Iran's key nuclear facilities in a swift military campaign dubbed 'Midnight Hammer'.
The move jolted an already volatile region and drew sharp condemnation from voices at home and abroad.
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman called on the government to immediately withdraw its recommendation for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize to US President Donald Trump, asserting that while Pakistan desired friendship with the United States, it did not accept slavery.
Addressing the JUI Punjab General Council meeting in Murree, the JUI-F chief said: ""We want friendship with the US, but not at the cost of our sovereignty.""
Fazlur Rehman reiterated his demand for the government to rescind its Nobel Peace Prize recommendation for Trump, accusing him of having ""blood of Palestinians, Iraqis and Afghans on his hands"".
He condemned the US attack on Iran, calling it a blatant violation of both national and international laws.
""If we do not stand with Iran, should we side with Israel instead?"" he asked rhetorically. ""We fully support Iran.""
Former senator Mushahid Hussain minced no words. In a series of posts on X, he urged Islamabad to reverse its course.
""Since Trump is no longer a potential peacemaker, but a leader who has willfully unleashed an illegal war, [the] Pakistan government must now review, rescind and revoke his Nobel nomination!""
He also noted the deepening entanglement between Washington and Tel Aviv.
""Trump had been 'trapped by Netanyahu and Israeli war lobby, committing [the] biggest blunder of his presidency',"" Hussain wrote. ""Trump will now end up presiding over [the] decline of America!""
PTI lawmaker Ali Muhammad Khan also joined the chorus.
""RECONSIDER,"" he wrote in all caps, calling attention to the ""US attack on Iran and continuous US support of Israeli killings in Gaza"".
Former senator Afrasiab Khattak also weighed in.
""The sycophancy adopted by [the] Pakistani ruling elite in nominating President Trump for Nobel Peace Prize is not part of normative conduct in international diplomacy,"" he wrote, lambasting what he described as a spineless foreign policy move.
Author and activist Fatima Bhutto posed a question: ""Will Pakistan withdraw its nomination for him to receive the Nobel Peace Prize?""
Similarly, renowned Islamic scholar Mufti Taqi Usmani strongly condemned the US attack on Iran's nuclear installations, calling the act a violation of previous American commitments and a deeply alarming escalation.
In a post shared on the social media platform X Usmani denounced the US strike on Iranian nuclear sites, describing it as ""highly condemnable"" and a clear breach of past promises made by American leadership.

Pakistan's governance crisis impedes prosperity,"PK
State promised by Jinnah has devolved into system dominated by exclusion, elitism and inequality
What is a state? According to Ibn Khaldun, it is an entity that restricts, controls, and strives to eliminate injustice. It builds a governance system that upholds human equality, dignity, and liberty. Through fair governance, the state strives to provide basic necessities, growth opportunities, education grounded in values, and secure living conditions. It ensures the rule of law for all, including the government, institutions, and individuals.
In a nutshell, a state depends on a governance system that is people-centric, rooted in the rule of law, and committed to justice and prosperity.
Pakistan was envisioned as such a state. It was promised that the government would establish a social justice system, a welfare economy, and dignity for all. It would ensure peace and a people-centric system grounded in Islamic principles, achieved through inclusivity and democratic participation. Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah emphasised the need for a fair governance system, saying the very justification of the state would depend on it.
Unfortunately, after Jinnah's death, that vision began to fade. The ruling elite failed to understand his vision, denied the people their right to elect leadership, and became embroiled in power struggles. Bureaucratic interference took root early, sidelining democratic processes. In 1955, Ghulam Muhammad dissolved the assembly, seizing control and strengthening bureaucracy's grip. It marked the first major betrayal of the people's will and paved the way for martial law.
Pakistan soon became an experimental lab for imported governance models. Rulers introduced policies shaped by Western institutions. From Ghulam Muhammad onwards, the leadership kept experimenting – implementing liberal economic policies without liberal democracy, and introducing socialism under the control of feudals and the ultra-rich.
Religion, especially Islam, was repeatedly used to manipulate people but never implemented in its true spirit. This misuse goes against Quaid-e-Azam's vision of an Islamic system grounded in justice and equity.
Another defining feature of Pakistan's governance is elitism and exploitation. Though numerically small, the elite have captured the entire system. They enjoy vast privileges funded by the average taxpayer. Their grip on power is so deep that retirement is no longer an end - ""post-retirement parking"" has become common, with senior officials securing perks even after leaving office.
In recent years, this process has accelerated. The elite have abandoned merit and institutionalised favouritism. Now, the system has moved beyond capture to outright exploitation. Ironically, these elite deny their exploitative behaviour and instead blame each other – politicians fault the military, and military rulers blame politicians. Neither offers solutions.
The governance model has also become exclusionary. This exclusion starts in education and extends to jobs, social mobility, and access to justice. Education, which should be a tool for empowerment and nation-building, is riddled with inequality. The Constitution promises free education for every child through Articles 25-A and 37-B, but the state has failed to deliver.
Instead of strengthening public education, the government enabled the rise of private institutions. Since the 1980s, private schools have mushroomed, now comprising 38% of all institutions and educating 44% of children. These institutions often follow foreign curricula, diverging from the national framework.
State neglect – lack of investment in infrastructure, teacher training, and quality control – has further degraded public education. Consequently, many middle-class families are forced to turn to expensive private schools, while the elite send their children abroad or to top-tier private schools in Pakistan. Since policymakers' children don't attend public schools, they remain indifferent to the sector's decay.
This has long-term consequences. It creates deep societal divisions and undermines nation-building by denying equal opportunity.
The job market is similarly flawed. It is rigged in favour of those with power. Merit is often irrelevant. Instead, elite families pull strings to get their children high-paying jobs in public institutions, think tanks, NGOs, or international agencies. These organisations oblige, hoping to curry favour with decision-makers. This culture of nepotism shuts out qualified candidates from ordinary backgrounds.
Bribery is another barrier. Additionally, a damaging narrative has taken hold: only private university graduates are employable. Public university graduates are sidelined, worsening inequality and fuelling resentment among youth. Moreover, retired officials – both domestic and international – further distort the job market.
Former employees of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, or local government use their networks to bypass competitive hiring processes, denying opportunities to younger, deserving candidates.
Many of these retired individuals sell themselves as visionary consultants or leaders. If they were truly dedicated, one might ask, why didn't they perform during their tenure? And if their intentions are noble, why not work pro bono instead of drawing large salaries and enjoying high-level perks?
Many have also entered the consulting business. In theory, there's nothing wrong with that – if it's based on merit. In reality, however, these consultancies operate through networks of influence. Former officials use their ties within the bureaucracy and military to secure contracts. They promise future favours to juniors who help them now.
This has given rise to a class of ""on-the-job consultants"" – individuals who leverage their government roles to position themselves for future consultancies. They exploit their access to training programmes and higher education to build credentials and connections while still in office, and later transition into lucrative consulting roles.
This system entrenches inequality and marginalises the very citizens the state was supposed to empower. The way forward must start with restoring the people's role in decision-making. A state is not simply a government – it is a collective promise to its people. Pakistan must return to that promise.

Only state can announce jihad: DG ISPR,"US
Lt Gen Chaudhry says no one can defeat Pakistan as long as nation stands united
The military's chief spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, has said only the state is authorized to announce jihad against an aggressor and not any individual or group.
Lt Gen Chaudhry, who has been on an official visit to Karachi, expressed these views on Sunday during his meetings with people from different walks of life.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) director general, Pakistani citizens belonging to different religions enjoy equal rights under the Constitution. He said unity could only be ensured through peace and equality.
""Divisions based on race or language are condemnable. All citizens of Pakistan are equal. No one can defeat us, if we stand united,"" he added.
The military spokesperson was talking with reference to the recent conflict between Pakistan and India.
The two neighbouring nations last month engaged in a brief but dangerous confrontation, weeks after a militant attack in the Pahalgam area of the Indian occupied Kashmir.
During the four days of active conflict initiated by India, both the countries launched missile strikes into each other's territory while also carrying out drone and cyberattacks. The conflict came to an abrupt end after US President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire, apparently on the request of New Delhi.
The DG ISPR stated that India supports terror groups in Pakistan and that the Pakistan Army is responding to this threat by using a modern war strategy.
Pakistan has been accusing India of fomenting terrorism on its soil, particularly in Balochistan, which has been facing a low key insurgency for the last two decades.
During his visit, the ISPR chief was accorded a warm welcome in the country's economic hub.

Mango festival opens amid climate impact concerns,"PL
Experts noted that Pakistan typically produces around 1.8 million tonnes of mango annually
The Punjab Tourism Department has inaugurated the Mango Festival 2025 in Lahore, showcasing over 50 varieties of the beloved summer fruit.
The two-day event at a hotel drew large crowds, including tourists, farmers, agricultural experts, students and professionals from the food and hospitality industry.
The festival offered a mix of traditional dance, folk music, handicrafts and a wide array of mango-based dishes, turning the event into a celebration of agriculture, culture and culinary creativity.
Provincial Tourism Secretary Fareed Ahmad Tarar and Tourism Development Corporation of Punjab (TDCP) Managing Director Dr Nasir Mehmood opened the festival. On the occasion, Tarar described the festival not just as a celebration of mangoes but also as a tribute to the hardworking farmers and the rich agricultural and cultural heritage of the province.
Dr Mehmood emphasised that the event would serve as a platform for promoting tourism, hospitality and local industries alongside agriculture.
Agricultural expert Rana Asif Hayat Tipu highlighted that five tonnes of export-quality mangoes were made available at farm-gate prices to address public concerns that high-grade fruit is rarely accessible in retail markets.
He warned, however, that climate change, intense heat, dust storms and water shortages had severely affected this year's crop, causing an estimated 40 per cent decline in production in some areas.
Experts noted that Pakistan typically produces around 1.8 million tonnes of mango annually, with Punjab contributing 70% of the national output, Sindh 29% and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa about 1%.
Due to adverse weather conditions, 2025's output is projected to drop to approximately 1.4 million tonnes. Nonetheless, the government has ambitiously raised the export target to 125,000 tonnes for this season, aiming for $100 million in foreign exchange earnings.

Yet, true peace remains elusive until core issues like Kashmir, terrorism, water and trade are addressed.
On the western front, while China has brokered a rare trilateral political thaw between Pakistan and Afghanistan, the Iran-Israel conflict threatens to entrench itself deeper, potentially engulfing the entire Middle East. Let's not forget, the brutal Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated, costing thousands of lives and reshaping global alliances. History will remember this period as a defining chapter of the 21st century.
The new world order is uncertain; Pakistan must be precise, principled and prepared. In this global flux, Pakistan must strike a delicate balance: align with both global powers – the US and China – while forging regional partnerships with similarly sized nations to gain economic and diplomatic leverage.
Domestically, however, our economic narrative has been disappointing. In just 15 years, Pakistan has suffered five boom-bust cycles, falling repeatedly into balance of payments crisis, currency devaluation, high inflation, IMF bailouts and eroded investor confidence – foreign and domestic alike. These policy failures are not just unfortunate, they're criminally negligent.
A Charter of Economic Governance must be enshrined with binding commitments from all political parties, teaching economic prudence as a prerequisite to policymaking.
Economic mismanagement is not bad luck; it's bad leadership, which should not be repeated. This year's federal budget, therefore, offers a glimmer of hope. Pakistan appears to have realised – or is being forced to realise – that sustainable progress demands a higher tax-to-GDP ratio. Unfortunately, the burden still falls unfairly on the salaried, middle and lower classes, while powerful sectors like real estate, agriculture and services remain protected.
True reform demands that every sector contributes to national development and defence. The NFC Award too needs a rethink – allocations should increasingly be linked to provincial performance, not just population. Metrics such as export value addition, IT services, investor facilitation and productivity gains should determine incentives. Provinces must be held accountable for power distribution companies' (DISCOs) losses, population control efforts and public service delivery, particularly in healthcare and education.
Pakistan needs a performance-based federation; not just a population-based one. On the fiscal front, the budget's continued commitment to primary surplus is commendable – this marks the third consecutive year. It signals a much-needed course correction that should persist for the next decade.
Pakistan must now actively deleverage its debt profile to free up space for essential investments in education, healthcare and social protection. More importantly, this shift will help restore our national dignity – we must no longer be a country that survives by begging or borrowing.
The onus now falls on provinces to enforce tax equity. Agriculture, real estate, services, retail and informal sectors must be brought into the tax net. Retailers, smugglers and evaders must be documented, not harassed. Technology can enable this transition without human interaction, ensuring fairness and eliminating corruption.
Meanwhile, focus must urgently shift towards increasing value-added exports, fixing the broken energy chain and privatising failing or underperforming state-owned enterprises like Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco), Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco) and Peshawar Electric Supply Company (Pesco). Even profitable DISCOs need privatisation to eliminate inefficiency and political interference. We cannot rely forever on remittances – a stagnation trap is inevitable unless we pivot towards sustainable productivity.
Surviving on remittances is not strategy; it's surrender. The stakes are too high for business-as-usual. Pakistan must fix its economic foundations – now. This requires ironclad governance, tax equity and a 10-year economic vision rooted in productivity, exports and resilience.
The Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC)-backed civil-military leadership has a rare window of alignment and mandate. It must use this moment to institutionalise reform, not short-term firefighting. If we are to survive the turbulence ahead – geopolitical or economic – we need more than hope. We need a war chest, a policy compass and, above all, the courage to lead. Let this be the decade we finally get it right.

TikToker Babrah arrested for drug dealing,"PK
Says she got addicted to ice and cocaine at parties, then got into supply network
In an intelligence-based operation, Darakhshan police arrested a female drug dealer, Babrah alias Bebo Baloch, near Khayaban-e-Badar. Crystal meth (ice) was also recovered from her possession. Babrah daughter of Muhammad Ranjha is listed in the Special Branch's B-Category list, and is known as a TikToker and former model.
During interrogation, the accused revealed that she started modeling in 2007. Then, after her parent's separation and her mother's remarriage in 2017, Babrah moved into an apartment in the Khyaban-e-Muslim Commercial area, due to family conflicts. She continued modeling and gained popularity through TikTok.
Babrah revealed that she started attending parties where she developed an addiction to ice and cocaine, after which she became involved in supplying drugs, especially in upscale areas, using social media platforms to promote her network. She also admitted to committing theft, revealing that she had previously been arrested twice by Darakhshan and Sahil police.
A case was registered against the accused, under the Narcotics Act. Further, SHO Darakhshan, Shahid Taj, reported that the accused named several accomplices during interrogation.

Dragnet against drug dealers in Clifton,"US
Dens demolished in Quaidabad, dozens quizzed
Several suspects were rounded up and narcotics seized in a targeted police operation in the upscale Clifton and Boat Basin areas.
The operation, supervised by SP Clifton Imran Jagrani and SDPO Manisha Rupeta, involved a heavy police contingent that cordoned off key locations in Gizri, sealing all entry and exit points before launching the crackdown.
During the search, police rounded up several suspected drug dealers, including Usman, Abid, and Ali Raza, who were allegedly involved in the illicit sale of narcotics in the area. A substantial quantity of drugs was seized from their possession.
Police also recovered a cache of weapons from one of the suspects' residences, including two SMG Kalashnikovs, a .223 rifle, two pistols, an airgun, and dozens of bullets. Preliminary reports suggest the arms were licensed, though verification is underway.
SSP South Mahzoor Ali confirmed that multiple residences were searched, streets were combed, and several suspects were frisked during the operation. He stressed that such actions would continue to curb drug trafficking and criminal activities in the city.
Police smash drug dens
Separately, police conducted a large-scale operation in Quaidabad, demolishing several drug dens in the neighbourhoods of Sawati Mohalla, Muslimabad, and Lali Noor Bakhtiarwan.
The raid, supervised by SSP Malir Kashif Aftab Abbasi and led by the DSP Quaidabad, involved a large police contingent, including SHO Quaidabad, intelligence personnel, and female officers. The operation was launched following meticulous surveillance and technical monitoring of suspected drug dealers.
Police executed a strategic plan to dismantle clandestine drug hubs operating in dilapidated houses, narrow alleyways, and concealed inner routes. Among the key targets was a notorious hideout in Lali Noor Bakhtiarwan, a long-standing hotspot for narcotics trade, which was completely razed. The area has since been declared cleared of illegal activity.
During the operation, police conducted thorough searches of several houses and quizzed suspects linked to drug trafficking. No further details regarding arrests or seizures were immediately disclosed.

Ex-CM's son killed in brazen Khuzdar ambush,"AU
.
A tribal leader and the son of a former chief minister was killed in Khuzdar district of Balochistan on Sunday in a brazen ambush that sent shockwaves across the province.
Mir Attaur Rehman Mengal, son of Mir Muhammad Naseer Mengal, was on a hunting trip in the mountainous Aranji Awak area of Khuzdar along with his companions including a son, Mutiur Rehman, when his vehicle came under fire.
Attaur Rehman, who is also the elder brother of Jhalawan Awami Panel Chairman Mir Shafiqur Rahman, died on the spot while his son also sustained serious injuries.
According to some eyewitnesses, over two dozen armed miscreants took part in the attack. Following the incident, personnel of law enforcing agencies and security forces rushed to the spot and cordoned off the area. Rescuers shifted the dead and the injured to the nearest hospital.
Security forces are continuing their investigation, and a heavy presence has been deployed in the area to prevent any potential fallout.
PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain expressed deep sorrow and condolences over the martyrdom of Mir Attaur Rehman. He said Mir Naseer Mengal and his family have always remained loyal to Pakistan.

Land price mismatch mars auction,"US
Govt urged to revise official rates to unlock development potential
The Faisalabad Development Authority (FDA) has failed to auction more than 569 amenity plots over the last two and a half years due to a significant mismatch between official land rates and prevailing market prices.
Facing repeated setbacks, FDA officials have now sought assistance from the district administration and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to rationalise land valuations in line with current market dynamics.
Sources reveal that the vacant residential and commercial plots — 69 within city limits and over 500 in the FDA City Housing Colony on Sargodha Road — were initially mortgaged by private developers as part of layout plan approvals. These plots were earmarked for public utility sites, including schools, mosques, dispensaries, and parks, with FDA responsible for their development and disposal.
Director Estate Management FDA, Junaid Manj, said that in an auction held on May 21, 2025, the authority managed to sell only two utility plots out of 71 due to the stark disparity between market rates and those fixed by the Deputy Commissioner (DC) and FBR.
""For example, while the market price in Madina Town is around Rs7 million per Marla, the official DC and FBR rate is Rs12.5 million. This discourages buyers from participating in the auctions,"" he said.
Manj further noted that despite having prime properties available in locations like Madina Town, Gulistan Colony, Ahmad Nagar, Iron Market, Millat Town, Truck Stand Jhang Road, and Gulistan Plaza, public response has remained lukewarm due to unrealistic pricing and additional government-imposed taxes — up to 6% — on buyers.
""We've reached out through official correspondence and direct meetings with the concerned authorities, but the disparity persists. Every effort to sell these valuable plots has ended in disappointment,"" Manj lamented.
Sohail Maqsood Punnon, Project Director of the FDA City Scheme, shared that another auction exercise conducted on June 18, 2025, also failed as no participants turned up — despite prior confirmations from at least 12 interested parties.
""In FDA City, the market rate is Rs450,000 per Marla, yet the official DC rate is Rs800,000. It's simply impractical to expect successful auctions under such conditions,"" Punnon explained.
He added that the failure to auction these plots is depriving the FDA exchequer of vital public funds.
FDA Director General Chaudhary Muhammad Asif confirmed that letters have been sent to higher authorities requesting urgent rationalization of official land rates to bring them in line with market conditions.

People flock to recreational spots as weather turns pleasant,"US
Families enjoy day out at beaches, parks, and eateries across the city
With the intensity of heat subsiding and the weather turning pleasant on Sunday, large crowds of citizens headed out to enjoy the day at various recreational spots. Popular destinations like Sea View, Manora, Hawke's Bay, and city parks including the Karachi Zoo witnessed a surge in visitors as families took advantage of the improved weather.
Coastal areas saw the highest footfall, where people enjoyed the sea breeze, took dips in the water, and spent quality time with loved ones. Children and adults alike indulged in camel and horse rides, motorbike stunts, and snacked on traditional street food such as gol gappay, fruit chaat, and chana chaat. Some families even brought food from home to picnic by the sea.
As night fell, the city's food streets and eateries remained packed. People relished the cool evening weather, enjoying meals like BBQ, biryani, platters, and other local delights. Many Karachi residents called the improved weather a blessing after a long spell of extreme heat, saying they fully enjoyed the day and are now praying for downpour in the city.
Drizzle expected
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast partly cloudy conditions with chances of light rain or drizzle in Karachi due to low-level sea clouds and localised weather development.
According to the Early Warning Centre, light rain or drizzle is likely in parts of the city today. The maximum temperature over the next three days is expected to remain between 33°C and 35°C, while sea breezes are likely to remain active. Due to high humidity, the weather may feel humid at times.
On Sunday, the city's weather remained partly to mostly cloudy in different areas. High humidity levels made the daytime feel more humid. The maximum temperature recorded was 33.9°C with 76% humidity.
In most parts of Sindh, the weather is expected to remain hot to very hot and dry. However, in south, light rain or drizzle is also possible in Tharparkar and Umerkot.

Sri Lanka's sacred alms bowl faces modern crisis,"PK
Imported items killing off the traditional 'paathra'
The alms bowl is a symbol of monks, yet in Sri Lanka artisans are struggling as cheap substitutes flood the market, igniting a debate over Buddhist tradition and quality.
The village of Panvila has long been associated with craftsmen who produce the humble ""paathra"", the special bowl that forms part of the eight essentials donated to monks and which is used to ask for food.
Thenuwara Badalge Sarath, 65, says he is the only blacksmith left in a village that once supplied much of the country.
""When I learnt the craft from my father, there were more than 10 families in the neighbourhood who made these bowls,"" Sarath told AFP, while hammering a piece of scrap metal into a holy utensil.
""Today, I am the only one keeping up the tradition. My son died recently in a road accident, and there is no one to carry on this line of work after I am gone,"" said the fourth-generation craftsman.
He spends about a week producing a batch of five to six bowls from discarded steel barrels. He sells each for 600 rupees ($2), but competition from cheap imports is tough.
""There are aluminium bowls that come from abroad. They are cheaper and lighter – we can't compete,"" Sarath said at his village smithy, near the southern tourist resort of Hikkaduwa.
Karma drives demand
The Buddhist-majority nation of some 22 million people has just over 42,000 monks, but the demand for bowls is disproportionately high because of the positive karma attached to offering them to temples.
Kirinde Assagi, a leading Buddhist monk, said the alms bowl forms part of the eight items for a monk to lead an ascetic life and spread the teachings of Buddha, along with two robes, a razor, a straining cloth, a needle and thread, and a belt.
""The bowl is his livelihood. When a monk goes out begging with his bowl, he gets sustenance"", Assagi said.
""Because gifting 'ata pirikara' to monks brings enormous good karma, devotees clamour to donate this,"" said the monk, in reference to the eight-item package.
At his Gangaramaya temple in the capital Colombo there were nine such packages donated within an hour one weekend.
'Mountain' of discarded pots
Assagi says most of the bowls however are of poor quality, made out of aluminium and unfit to serve food in.
In a storeroom at the back of his temple, there is a huge pile of bowls that monks say are not suitable even for offering food to household pets.
""I will show you a mountain of begging bowls that we have discarded. We make holes at the bottom and repurpose them for potted plants.""
Monks in Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos traditionally seek alms every morning, underscoring their simple life and demonstrating that their livelihood depends on others.
But the influx of cheap bowls is impacting the dawn ritual.
""We see the practice of monks begging slowly dying off as the quality of the bowls goes down,"" he said.
The Gangaramaya temple in Colombo has campaigned to improve the quality of utensils offered to monks and revive the ritual of seeking alms.
Assagi said the Thai royal family has in recent years gifted more than 27,000 high qualitiy stainless steel bowls to Sri Lankan monks, most of whom are followers of the Siam sect of Buddhism practised in that nation.
Unlike the financially well-off Gangaramaya, smaller temples are known to sell their excess bowls back to the market in a move that undermines traditional craftsmen such as Sarath.
""When the bowls go back to the shop from a temple, we find it difficult to sell our produce,"" Sarath said.
He is trying to convince devotees that there is less merit in offering bowls that are being regifted.

BTS member SUGA's military service ends,"US
K-pop singer poised to return to music
SUGA, a member of the K-pop megaband BTS, will officially complete his mandatory military service on Saturday, marking the full return of all seven members of the global supergroup from duty.
South Korea's most lucrative musical act has been on a self-described ""hiatus"" since 2022 as its members undertook the mandatory service required of all South Korean men under 30 due to tensions with the nuclear-armed North.
SUGA will be the last to complete his service, ahead of the group's widely anticipated return to activities as a full unit.
His final day concludes at 11:59:59 pm, according to the band's agency HYBE and South Korea's Military Manpower Administration.
The rapper, who served as a social service agent — an alternative form of military duty — effectively completed his service on Wednesday after using up his remaining leave, according to his label.
""Above all else, I wanted to .... sincerely thank our fans who waited for me all this time,"" SUGA told the group's fans - collectively known as ARMY - on the platform Weverse.
""I've missed you so much.""
Before entering military service, the megaband generated more than 5.5 trillion won ($4 billion) in yearly economic impact, according to the Korea Culture and Tourism Institute.
Analysts expect HYBE's operating profit to jump next year, driven in part by BTS's anticipated return to large-scale touring, with some projections forecasting a 71 per cent year-on-year increase.
""The importance of BTS's reunion to HYBE, K-pop and South Korea at large cannot be overstated. They are singular in their part of the Korean Wave,"" Grace Kao, a sociology professor at Yale University, told AFP.
""I think their next tour will be their biggest yet.""
Since their release last week, band leader RM has appeared at Art Basel in Switzerland as the new global ambassador for Samsung's Art TV, while member V was spotted attending a piano recital in Seoul alongside Old Boy filmmaker Park Chan-wook.

Inter Milan claim first win at Club WC,"US
Inter beat Urawa Red Diamonds and Dortmund overcame Mamelodi Sundowns 4-3
Inter Milan came from behind to beat Urawa Red Diamonds and knock the Japanese side out of the Club World Cup on Saturday, while Borussia Dortmund held off Mamelodi Sundowns to win a seven-goal thriller.
Fluminense rallied in the second half to beat Ulsan 4-2 and knock out the South Korean side while Monterrey and River Plate ended goalless.
At Lumen Field in Seattle, Ryoma Watanabe got an early opening goal for Urawa Reds, who were backed by a noisy contingent of their supporters.
But captain Lautaro Martinez — who got Inter's equaliser in their 1-1 draw with Monterrey of Mexico in their opening game — repeated the trick to level matters with a clever overhead kick 12 minutes from time.
Valentin Carboni was then the unlikely hero as he grabbed the winner two minutes into injury time.
The 20-year-old Argentine had not played a competitive game since early October after suffering a serious knee injury while on loan at Marseille.
Carboni had not made an appearance for Inter in over two years, but he was on to hand to sidefoot home when the ball fell to him in the area.
""Our opponents play with their hearts and to counter that as a team we need to play with more pride, be humble and know how to suffer,"" Martinez told broadcaster DAZN.
The result left some Urawa fans in tears and Inter level on four points with River Plate with the two teams meeting next.
River Plate were let down by their finishing in a scrappy, foul-ridden encounter with Mexico's Monterrey, who sit on two points.
Esteban Andrada, Monterrey's Argentine keeper, made a series of saves while River's forwards were unable to put away the few chances that came their way.
Monterrey could still make it into the last 16 if they beat Urawa and River or Inter win their game.
Earlier Jobe Bellingham got his first goal for Dortmund as his new club overcame stifling heat in Cincinnati to beat Sundowns 4-3 and move to four points from two matches in Group F.
The South African champions had taken a surprise early lead through a fine solo goal from Lucas Ribeiro.
However, Sundowns goalkeeper Ronwen Williams handed Dortmund their equaliser on a plate, passing the ball straight to Felix Nmecha, who stroked home.
Serhou Guirassy gave Dortmund the lead with his 35th goal since the beginning of the season.
English midfielder Bellingham, who this month followed older brother Jude's footsteps in joining the German side from Sunderland, started for the first time for Dortmund and made it 3-1 just before the break.
Khuliso Mudau's own goal made it 4-1 before the hour mark, but Sundowns salvaged some pride by reducing the deficit through Iqraam Rayners and Lebo Mothiba.
""I'm sweating like I've just come out of a sauna,"" said Dortmund coach Niko Kovac when asked about the conditions in a game which started at midday local time.
""It was tough going for both teams, but the opposition are used to it. We certainly didn't give our best performance, but that wasn't possible today.""
Sundowns will still go into their final game in Group F with a chance of qualifying for the last 16.
""The boys made a wonderful performance... it was a hell of a match. I'm not happy but very proud,"" said their Portuguese coach, Miguel Cardoso.
South Korea's Ulsan gave Fluminense a real scare in their Group F clash at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, leading 2-1 until the 66th minute before the Brazilians ran out 4-2 winners, eliminating the K-League champions in the process.
Colombian striker Jhon Arias put Fluminense ahead with a 27th minute free-kick but goals from Lee Jin-hyun and Um Won-sang gave Ulsan the advantage at the break.
Nonata levelled for the Brazilians in the 66th minute before Juan Freytes put Fluminense ahead in the 83rd minute, slotting home after a scramble in the box.
Keno added a fourth in stoppage time to leave Fluminense on top of the group, level on 4 points with Borussia Dortmund ahead of their final game against South Africa's Mamelodi Sundowns in Miami on Wednesday.
A win or draw for the Rio club in their final group game will ensure their passage into the last 16.

"Conference urges safer, standardised aesthetic practices","US
Regulatory bodies urged to take action against substandard clinics, unqualified individuals
While looking beautiful is every individual's right, aesthetic procedures should only be performed by trained and registered professionals, stressed President of the Dermatology and Aesthetic Association of Pakistan (DAAP), Dr Bilal Shah, at the DAAPCon 2025 conference. The moot, held under DAAP's auspices, stressed the need to standardise and regulate aesthetic and beauty practices in the country, highlighting the growing trend of receiving cosmetic treatments, as well as the consequences of lack of knowledge and unstandardised aesthetic practices in Pakistan.
Many dermatologists and aesthetic physicians participated in the event, while pharmaceutical companies also set up stalls.
Dr Bilal Shah stated that undergoing aesthetic procedures at the hands of untrained individuals is not only dangerous but often leads to permanent damage, urging the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC), and relevant regulatory bodies, to take action against substandard clinics and unqualified individuals.
Celebrity dermatologist and organising committee member Dr Zara Shah stated that actresses and models commonly face pressure to lose weight or get nose reshaping, even though they often do not need these procedures. She explained that young girls also get expensive treatments like lip fillers and nose jobs, but due to a lack of knowledge, end up damaging their faces.
Dr Zara further noted that aesthetic procedures start at around Rs5,000 and can go up to Rs250,000-300,000 for advanced treatments. She explained that laser treatments are used to remove unwanted facial hair, eliminate melasma (dark patches), and enhance the overall appearance of the face, with many girls aspiring to achieve 'Korean glass skin', although it is important to understand the genetic differences between populations.
Additionally, she noted that exosome therapy is now being used to enhance beauty and maintain youthful skin, explaining that exosomes are natural particles in the body that help repair and regenerate skin. This therapy treats issues like pigmentation, wrinkles, acne, and hair loss, providing a collagen boost to the skin without surgery, making it look younger and fresher.
The conference offered the opportunity to learn about the latest aesthetic technologies, devices, and the experiences of medical professionals, with the aim of delivering better, safer, and more standardised, aesthetic services to Pakistani society.

Rain draws crowds to parks,"US
Brings relief to residents of metropolis from hot, humid weather
A welcome spell of rain swept across Lahore on Sunday, providing much-needed respite from days of heat and humidity and prompting thousands of residents to head outdoors and enjoy the transformed weather. With cloudy skies and cooler temperatures, public parks across the city turned into bustling gathering spots.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), rainfall accompanied by gusty winds affected several parts of Lahore, including Abbott Road, Lakshmi Chowk, Shimla Pahari, Ferozepur Road, Kalma Chowk, Canal Road, Mall Road, Anarkali, Jail Road, Gulshan Ravi, Islam Pura, Township, Garden Town and Sabzazar.
The rain, which reduced the day's temperature to 34 degrees Celsius, brought noticeable relief in humidity and improved air quality. Humidity levels were recorded at 70 per cent with wind speeds of 13km per hour. The temperature is expected to rise again to 36°C in the coming days.
With the oppressive weather temporarily eased, residents made their way to outdoor spaces such as Jilani Park, Jallo Park, Lawrence Garden, Lahore Safari Park, Model Town Park and other local parks in different neighbourhoods.
Families picnicked on the fresh grass, children played among the puddles, and joggers returned to long-abandoned tracks.
""I couldn't stay indoors after the rain,"" said Sana Ali, a university student walking with friends in Jilani Park. ""The breeze and the scent of the wet earth made everything feel alive again.""
Vendors in and around parks reported a surge in business as people lined up for corn, snacks, and ice cream in the breezy evening. In Lawrence Garden, elderly citizens and young couples strolled beneath the rain-washed trees, while Model Town Park saw groups of joggers, fitness enthusiasts, and families enjoying a long-awaited breath of fresh air.
The PMD noted that moisture-laden currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are continuing to penetrate upper and central regions of Pakistan, supported by a westerly wave over northern areas.
These weather patterns are likely to sustain intermittent rainfall over the coming days, particularly in upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
In the past 24 hours, pre-monsoon showers were recorded across the region, including 91mm at Islamabad's Zero Point, 88mm in Mangla, and 58 mm in Rawalpindi at Shamsabad.
Lahore received 3mm of rainfall.
Despite the widespread showers, southern regions continued to experience intense heat, with Bhakkar, Sibi, and Dalbandin reaching highs of 47°C.
Officials advised the public to remain cautious in low-lying areas due to the risk of water accumulation and urban flooding. For many Lahoris, however, Sunday's rain was not just a weather event -— it was a moment of shared joy.
""This is what we wait for all summer,"" said Irfan Mehmood, a retired banker watching his grandchildren play in Model Town Park. ""After days of stifling heat, today feels like a blessing,"" he added.

"Man fails to pay phone instalments, commits suicide","PK
The deceased, married and a father of two children
A man committed suicide after failing to pay installments for his mobile phone.
The deceased, 30-year-old Yasir Kharl, purchased a mobile phone on installments from a Karachi-based seller who reportedly kept harassing Yasir for missing a payment, and even pressured him with the help of police. The deceased, married and a father of two children, became distressed over his inability to pay the installments and committed suicide.
Medical Superintendent of District Headquarters Hospital, Dr Barkat Laghari, reported that Yasir consumed poison and was brought to the hospital where duty doctors provided him medical aid. After his condition seemingly improved, the people accompanying Yasir were advised to transfer him to Civil Hospital Hyderabad. However, they took him home instead. A few hours later, they brought him back, claiming he had stomach pain, but by that time, Yasir had already passed away.

Canada cruise to T20 World Cup 2026,"PK
The ICC men's T20 World Cup will be held next year in India and Sri Lanka
Canada have booked their place at the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2026, which will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, following an emphatic victory over the Bahamas in the Americas Qualifier at the Maple Leaf North-West Ground on Saturday.
Playing at home, Canada maintained their unbeaten run in the tournament, registering their fifth consecutive win to seal qualification.
In a dominant display, bowlers Kaleem Sana and Shivam Sharma picked up three wickets each to bundle out the Bahamas for just 57 runs. Chasing the modest target, Canada wasted no time, racing to victory in only 5.3 overs.
Dilpreet Bajwa starred with the bat, smashing an unbeaten 36 off just 14 deliveries to complete the rout. Led by Nicholas Kirton, Canada entered the regional qualifier as strong favourites, having competed in last year's T20 World Cup held in the USA and the Caribbean. They opened their campaign with a commanding 110-run win over Bermuda, followed by a 59-run victory against the Cayman Islands and a 10-wicket triumph over the Bahamas in the first round of fixtures.
In their second encounter against the Cayman Islands, a rain-shortened five-over contest, Canada posted 82 runs and secured another convincing win by 42 runs.
With this result, Canada join co-hosts India and Sri Lanka, along with Afghanistan, Australia, Bangladesh, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, United States and West Indies who have already qualified for the expanded 20-team tournament.
Seven more spots remain up for grabs through the remaining regional qualifiers two from Europe, five to 11 July 2025, two from Africa, 19 September to four October 2025 and three from the AsiaEast Asia Pacific Qualifier, one to 17 October 2025.

NSC convenes today to ponder regional scenario,"US
Islamabad condemns US strikes on Iran; Shehbaz speaks with Pezeshkian
Pakistan's civil and military leadership will meet in an emergency huddle on Monday (today) to discuss the United States strikes on Iran in a watershed development that has put the world on an uncharted path with far-reaching consequences.
Islamabad was quick to condemn the US strikes as clear violation of international law and UN Charter while vehemently dismissed reports of any complicity in the attack. Officials said neither Pakistan's airspace nor any other facility was used by the US to conduct highly controversial strikes.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also spoke to the Iranian President and reiterated Pakistan's condemnation of the US strikes on three nuclear sites of Iran. Shehbaz will also preside over the meeting of the high-powered National Security Committee (NSC).
The NSC meeting – to be attended by senior cabinet members and military and intelligence chiefs — will take stock of the situation. The primary agenda on the table will be how to evolve the country's strategy against the backdrop of brewing crisis.
Sources said on Sunday that Pakistan's stance was unambiguous even when Israel launched strikes on Iran about a forthright ago. Pakistan was against such unprovoked and reckless action by Israel, according to sources.
It was because of this reason Pakistan was at the forefront in condemning the Israeli strikes and extended full diplomatic support to Iran. Islamabad took a clear stance at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), denouncing Israel and saying that Iran reserved the right to respond.
There was no difference in the Pakistani stance when the US conducted unprecedented strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Pakistan faced a difficult situation as only a day ago it formally nominated US President Donald Trump for Noble Prize for his role in brokering ceasefire between India and Pakistan.
The sources said that Pakistan's move was aimed at encouraging Trump to pursue diplomacy over the use of force. That gamble, however, did not pay off. Nevertheless, this did not deter the Foreign Office from issuing a strong statement against the United States.
""Pakistan condemns the US attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities which follow the series of attacks by Israel. We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,"" read the Foreign Office statement.
""We reiterate that these attacks violate all norms of international law and that Iran has the legitimate right to defend itself under the UN Charter,"" it, said, adding that the unprecedented escalation of tension and violence, owing to ongoing aggression against Iran was deeply disturbing.
""Any further escalation of tensions will have severely damaging implications for the region and beyond. We emphasise the imperative need to respect civilian lives and properties and immediately bring the conflict to end.""
The Foreign Office stressed that all parties must adhere to international law, particularly the international humanitarian law. According to the statement, recourse to dialogue, diplomacy, in line with the principles of the UN Charter, remained only viable pathway to resolve the crises in the region.
Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz held a detailed telephone conversation with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and conveyed Pakistan's condemnation of the U attacks, which followed Israel's unprovoked and unjustified aggression over the past eight days.
Prime Minister Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan's ""unwavering solidarity"" with the brotherly people and the government of Iran, while expressing heartfelt condolences on the loss of precious lives and prayed for the swift recovery of the injured.
The prime minister expressed concerns that the US strikes had targeted facilities that were under the safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). These attacks constituted a serious violation of international law and the IAEA statute.
While noting Iran's right to self-defence, as enshrined under Article 51 of the UN Charter, Shehbaz stressed the need for an immediate return to dialogue and diplomacy. He also called for urgent collective efforts to de-escalate the situation.
The Prime Minister reiterated Pakistan's readiness to play a constructive role in this context. Pezeshkian appreciated Pakistan's support to Iran and thanked the prime minister, the government and the people of Pakistan, including the military leadership, for standing in solidarity with Iran.
The two leaders emphasised the need and urgency of forging unity among the Ummah at this critical juncture. The two leaders agreed to remain in close contact.

Peshawar buckles under urban sprawl,"US
As the city's population continues to expand, lack of long-term proactive planning has deteriorated its living condit
Once celebrated as the ""City of Flowers"", Peshawar now struggles to live up to its poetic title. The air that once carried the sweet scent of blooming apricots and the gentle rustle of orchard leaves now hangs heavy with dust, smoke, and the cacophony of honking horns. A city that was once admired for its natural beauty and cultural richness has descended into chaos, a casualty of unchecked population growth, political apathy, and haphazard urban development.
Peshawar's transformation began in earnest during the 1980s, when the Soviet-Afghan war sent a huge influx of refugees across the border into Pakistan. Many of them settled in and around Peshawar, altering the city's demographic landscape. In the following decades, Peshawar became the preferred refuge for internally displaced persons from the tribal belt, who were fleeing military operations, insurgency, and insecurity. Over time, the refugee camps evolved into permanent neighborhoods, and the temporary shelters turned into sprawling, unregulated settlements.
The resultant population boom has been relentless. According to the 2023 Digital Census, the population of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa reached 40.8 million, up from 35.5 million in 2017: an increase of 5.3 per cent in just six years. While the majority, 34 million, still reside in rural areas, the urban population has swelled dramatically. Peshawar alone grew from 4.3 million in 2017 to 4.7 million in 2023, at an annual growth rate of 1.5 per cent.
For Peshawar, the results of this rapid urbanization are visible in every corner. The roads, once adequate for a smaller population, are now choked with vehicles. According to Chief Traffic Officer Haroon Rashid, over 500,000 vehicles ply the city's roads daily. Despite the introduction of the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system in 2020, locals' heavy reliance on illegal rickshaws, unregistered vehicles, and a lack of public discipline continue to worsen road congestion and deteriorate air quality.
Dr Rashid Rehman, an urban infrastructure specialist at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET) Peshawar, believed the city was facing a systemic failure. ""Urban development continues to expand horizontally, devouring agricultural land and pushing the city's boundaries into rural areas. The lack of long-term strategic planning and zoning regulation is responsible for the chaos. High-rise buildings, for instance, could reduce the strain on land and services, but most housing schemes continue to promote large, detached homes. Weak enforcement of building codes has led to the construction of commercial plazas and residential complexes without adequate parking, water supply, or waste disposal systems,"" highlighted Dr Rehman.
K-P's Minister for Local Government and Rural Development, Arshad Ayub, acknowledged the city's growing pains but insisted that efforts were being made to improve conditions. ""Five new flyovers are under construction and the Ring Road will be expanded to divert traffic from the city center. The upcoming provincial budget includes significant allocations for urban development in Peshawar, including the procurement of new buses for the BRT system and stricter regulations for commercial and residential construction,"" claimed Ayub.
However, critics argued that such projects were reactive rather than proactive. Environmentalists warned that the loss of green spaces was not just a cosmetic issue but a threat to public health and ecological balance. Peshawar has lost many of its parks and orchards to unregulated construction due to which tree cover in the city has declined sharply.
The sense of loss is palpable among older residents, who remember a very different city. Haji Tahir Khan, a 60-year-old shopkeeper in Saddar Bazaar, recalled a time when the city was not only cleaner but also more livable. ""We had space to breathe, walk, and sit under a tree,"" he said. ""Now, even finding a parking spot is a daily struggle. The roads are full, the air is dirty, and the water is getting scarce. Is this the progress we were promised?""

Rs36b mini-budget proposed,"US
Govt eases restrictions on high-value purchases by ineligible persons
Four days ahead of the approval for Rs435 billion worth of tax measures announced in the budget, the government on Sunday proposed a Rs36 billion mini-budget and eased restrictions on major purchases by individuals with insufficient declared assets.
The revised criteria aim to address public concerns about the negative impact of the earlier blanket ban on economic activity by ineligible persons.
With the introduction of a mini-budget before the planned approval of 2025-26 budget on Thursday, the government has imposed total new taxes worth Rs462 billion. New taxes have been imposed on one-day old chicken and rates have been increased on companies' investment in mutual funds and earnings from investment in government debt.
The government has also agreed to relax the criteria for banning the economic transactions such as buying a home, plot, car, investing in securities and maintaining a bank account by those whose declared assets do not support these purchases. It had proposed to ban all such transactions if the declared assets do not support these purchases.
The government has now proposed that ineligibility criteria will not apply if the value of a car is up to Rs7 million. The ineligibility criterion would apply on purchase of over Rs100 million commercial plot and over Rs50 million residential property.
The ineligibility condition will be applicable if the cash in the bank account is more than Rs100 million per annum in all bank accounts of one individual. The ineligibility condition on stock market investment would be applicable, if the cumulative investment in a year is more than Rs50 million.
These limits have been set on the assumption that Pakistan's 5% richest evade taxes and the rest of the 95% do not have economic muscles for making major investments.
The new tax measures were tabled before the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance, which endorsed the government's proposals. PPP's Syed Naveed Qamar chaired the committee meeting.
The Federal Board of Revenue has proposed the Rs36 billion measures in lieu of reduction in proposed sales tax rate on import of solar panel from 18% to 10% and funding an increase in salaries of the government employees to 10%.
In a move that will further increase the prices of chicken in the country, the government has proposed to slap federal excise duty equal to Rs10 on a one-day old chicken. It has proposed amendments in the Federal Excise Act, 2005 to introduce the new levy.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had turned down the government's proposal to introduce a 5% federal excise duty on one-day-old chicks. The IMF representative had pointed out that, on one hand, the FBR claimed there were high taxes on food in Pakistan, and on the other hand, it recommended such proposals.
Chairman FBR Rashid Langrial told the standing committee that the new taxation measures of Rs36 billion were aimed at compensating the fiscal shortfall due to reduction in sales tax rate for the solar panels and funding the increase in the salaries.
The National Assembly Standing Committee proceedings mostly remained smooth. Syed Naveed Qamar, Rashid Langrial and newly appointed Minister of State for Finance Bilal Kayani steered the committee in the presence of powerful opposition. It was for the first time that NA standing committee discussed and approved the budget.
The PTI's two Members of the National Assembly Arif Mobeen Jutt and Usama Mela played very constructive role in scrutiny of the tax measures, which was also acknowledged by the Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.
In the budget, the government had announced 18% sales tax on import of solar panels. After reaching an understanding with the Pakistan Peoples Party, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar announced to reduce the rate to 10%. The total estimated revenue from the 18% tax was Rs20 billion, which is now projected at Rs12 billion.
Likewise, the FBR and the IMF had agreed to reduce the income tax rate for Rs100,000 monthly salary income from 5% to 1%. The finance ministry had also proposed 6% increase in salaries. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to increase salaries to 10% in the cabinet meeting held an hour before the announcement of the budget.
The prime minister also decided in the same cabinet meeting that to fund the additional increase in the salary, the tax on the lowest slab should be increased to 2.5%.
Secretary Finance Imdadullah Bosal had opposed to increase this tax to 2.5%. Now, the income tax rate for the lowest income slab of Rs100,000 will be 1% and to fund the salary increase, the government has taken three measures.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance also agreed to increase the income tax rate from 25% to 29% on dividends received by a company from mutual funds deriving income from profit on debt.
It has also proposed to increase withholding tax from 15 to 20% on profit on investment in the government securities by institutional investors.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb had announced Rs435 billion new measures in the budget, including introducing Rs2.5 per liter carbon levy and up to 3% car engine levy. Out of the Rs435 billion, the FBR related tax measures were Rs312 billion.
After adjusting negative impact of solar panel tax, cumulatively, the government has imposed Rs462 billion worth new tax measures in the budget. It has set the FBR's annual tax target at Rs14.13 trillion for the next fiscal year, which can be achieved on back of these measures and the promised enforcement by the FBR.
Currently, there is 15% income tax in the case of mutual funds, Real Estate Investment Trusts. It has now been decided that there will be 15% income tax in the case of Real Estate Investment Trust, 25% in case of mutual Funds, contingent upon proportional income derived from average annual investments in debt securities and equities respectively and 29% income tax on dividend received by a company from mutual fund deriving income from profit on debt.
Likewise, there will be 20% tax on the yield or profit paid by a banking company or financial institution on an account or deposit maintained with such company or institution; and 20% of the yield or profit on the government securities paid to any person other than an individual.
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance also approved Finance Bill 2025-26 with certain recommendations, forwarded by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance as well as recommendations of the NA Finance committee.
The FBR chairman said that the government had shared six new taxation measures with the IMF. Out of these six measures, three have been approved by the IMF.
The government has also decided that a uniform sales tax rate of 10% would be imposed on imported and local cotton aimed at addressing an anomaly that was creating problems for the local industry.

PTMs: student perspective,"SA
It has been observed that after every PTM, students find their relationship with parents or teachers more strained
Out of the troika – parents, teachers and students – of the education of a child, I have already written on the roles and rights of parents and teachers in the parent-teacher meetings organised regularly by educational institutions, and I am surprised how I could delay writing on the students' perspective on the PTM after writing the first column 'Teachers and parental feedback' on May 6, 2024 and the second one 'PTMs and parental involvement' on May 13, 2024. My apologies, guys!
On a lighter note, students expand the abbreviation of PTM in the vernacular as 'Puttar teri mot' (dude, your death is coming). The vernacular decoding, however, says it all about the apprehensions students have of the PTMs.
Generally but counterproductively, a PTM opens up with parents and teachers starting a cacophonous duet of a student's negative traits, academic struggles and disruptive actions. Finding himself viced between the two powers, the student thinks that the PTM has no solution to his problems. He internalises his resentment with the people from whom he expects empathy. It eventuates behavioural aberrations.
It has been observed that after every PTM, students find their relationship with parents or teachers more strained. That's why students, particularly those who lag behind in studies, dislike the PTMs – the platform where they are humiliated by their care providers. The day PTM is held is often dubbed ""the judgement day"" or ""the day of retribution"".
If parents and teachers don't present themselves as the ones who students can confide in, then feeling left in the lurch, what would they do but distrust them? In their heart of hearts, the marooned students must have been thinking that ""each one of us is greater than the worst thing we have ever done.""
Parents and teachers must avoid hurling jeremiads at students' study deficits. Hanlon's razor says: ""Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity."" And, if students cannot be exonerated for their stupidity, then who must be? Russell Barkley once said, ""The children who need love the most will always ask for it in the most unloving ways.""
Students want to be heard. They want to be known. But they are neither heard nor allowed to have their say. That's why they believe that the PTMs are about them, not for them. They are forced to do what doesn't hold their heart; they do it willy-nilly and fail to excel in that. Deepak Chopra says, ""If a child is poor in math but good at tennis, most people would hire a math tutor. I would rather hire a tennis coach.""
At the Budapest 2022 World Aquatics Championships, US artistic swimmer Anita Alvarez sank to the bottom of the pool, unconscious. Only Anita's coach Andrea Fuentes got apprehensive and shouted at the lifeguards who couldn't understand the emergency. The coach sprinted and dived into the pool to save Anita because she knew her student and her limit to hold her breath underwater. Fuentes received widespread admiration for the dramatic rescue.
Our students too want such a rescue at the PTMs, but they don't find any. The legendary educator Rita Pierson, in her appearance at the TED Talks Education, says, ""Every child deserves a champion – an adult who will never give up on them, who understands the power of connection, and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be."" Students want someone understand them. Failing on that, the outcome is as expected: quiet quitting, indiscipline and defiance.
A PTM lacerates scars on students' self-respect when they are humiliated in the presence of the class fellows and their parents. ""Students don't learn from people they don't like,"" asserts Rita. Also, peer judgement proves more deleterious. To avoid this soul piercing, PTMs must be punctuated with tete-a-tetes between students and their teachers to discuss their mutual problems and challenges, particularly of students whose antics are actually the SOS calls.
""Every child you encounter is a divine appointment,"" says Wess Stafford, a devout believer in the divinity of children. Students open up with parents who are always around whenever children need them. PTMs must be places of constructive dialogue, not trial courts, for students.

"Tehreek-e-Insaf slams US strikes, demands APC","PK
Warns of regional blowback, seeks Imran Khan's release for national consensus
The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) on Sunday came out swinging against the United States for launching strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, calling it a dangerous escalation and demanding that the government urgently convene an All Parties Conference (APC) to forge a consensus-driven and unequivocal policy on an increasingly belligerent Israel, which it said is pushing the entire region to the brink of a devastating war.
Slamming the blatant violation of international law and Iran's sovereignty, the PTI decried Washington's actions and accused the coalition government of burying its head in the sand while the region teetered on the brink of a devastating conflict.
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram warned that the flames of war have already reached Pakistan's doorstep, and the government's current ""ostrich-like approach"" was both futile and perilous.
He insisted the rapidly changing regional dynamics required swift, strategic, and united action.
PTI Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said that the US attack on Iran's nuclear facilities was condemnable, saying the action was not only a violation of international norms, laws and UN resolutions but also a violation of the sovereignty of the Iranian state. ""Such unilateral actions pose a serious threat to global peace and security, as well as the sovereignty of every country,"" the senator said.
Zafar said that the UN and the international community must intervene and resolve the issues quickly to prevent further tension in the region. ""We stand with Iran and the Iranian people in this difficult time,"" he said.
The PTI information secretary underlined that Pakistan can undoubtedly weather the storm, just as it did against India, but the power elites must take the nation into confidence and forge a consensus-driven approach because Pakistan was currently caught between a rock and a hard place.
In light of the escalating crisis, the PTI spokesperson called for the immediate release of PTI Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan and his inclusion in strategic decision-making regarding the situation arising from Israel's unprovoked attack on Iran and the subsequent US strikes on the country.
Waqas praised Khan's foresight, noting that a week earlier, he had sent a message through his sisters to postpone the protest for two weeks due to the Iran-Israel conflict.
Meanwhile, he added that US President Donald Trump issued a deceptive signal, claiming he would not engage in the Israel war for the next two weeks.
He said that Khan's famous quote, ""No one understands the West better than me"", proved to be true.
PTI leader lashed out at the imposed government for its habit of flattery, which he said now had crossed the national boundaries and was visible internationally. He recalled that PTI patron-in-chief had stated on the floor of the House that Pakistan could partner with the US in peace, but not in war, as the country had already paid an immeasurable cost in terms of both lives and resources for siding with the US in its meaningless and unnecessary wars.
He pleaded that Israel could not have invaded Iran without the strong backing and support of the US, which was evident from the airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities even after Tehran was given a two-week ultimatum, simply at the behest of the Israeli premier.
The party said that the US not only violated Iran's sovereignty but also breached the UN Charter, an act that could have far-reaching and catastrophic consequences at both regional and international levels.
He maintained that the excuse for the Israeli attack on Iran was even more absurd than India's recent strike on Pakistan under the pretext of the Pahalgam attack. Waqas observed that the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a blatantly contradictory and biased approach towards the Muslim world in its pursuit of nuclear capability, while remaining conspicuously silent about Israel's widely acknowledged nuclear arsenal.
He demanded that the UN and OIC urge the IAEA to inspect Israel's nuclear sites and work toward a nuclear-free Middle East, rather than targeting Iran under false pretexts, just as was done with Iraq, despite the IAEA's repeated and clear stance that Tehran is nowhere near acquiring a nuclear weapon.
He added that Iran has consistently maintained that its nuclear programme is intended solely for peaceful purposes.

'E-vehicle policy to ensure greener Pakistan',"PK
Ministry says promoting EVs vital to drive clean, affordable future transport
The government has stepped up policy-level efforts to promote electric vehicles in the country, as it offers a wide array of benefits across environmental, economic, public health and industrial development sectors.
This was stated by Muhammad Saleem Shaikh, spokesperson for the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination on Sunday in the context of the federal government's New Electric Vehicle Policy (NEVP) launched on Friday.
The policy aims to ensure a just and inclusive transition to cleaner mobility, reduce dependency on fossil fuels, stimulate local innovation and create new green jobs, he said.
""The Government of Pakistan is stepping up efforts to promote the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as a key part of the country's clean energy and climate resilience agenda. With the transport sector being a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and urban air pollution, the shift towards EVs marks a significant move towards a sustainable, healthier, and economically viable,"" the official remarked.
He further said that the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination (MoCC&EC)) has already reaffirmed its commitment at various forums to promoting EVs in the country as a strategic priority in the country's transition toward a low-carbon, climate-resilient future as part of global efforts to cut heat-trapping and climate-altering vehicular carbon emissions and achieve environmental and urban sustainability.
Saleem Shaikh said, ""Recognising the transport sector as among the key contributors to air pollution and climate change-causing greenhouse gas emissions, the ministry would now actively support every possible effort for the implementation of the New Electric Vehicle Policy 2025-2030 to drive the country toward a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable mobility system.
Director General of the ministry, Mohammad Asif Sahibzada, pointed out that the Ministry of Industries and Production, MoCC&EC and other key industrial and non-industrial stakeholders were working in close collaboration to implement the new policy.
He further said that the policy would go a long way in bringing more and more e-vehicles onto the country's roads as it envisions 30 per cent of all new vehicles sold by 2030 to be electric - including two-wheelers, three-wheelers, buses, and cars.
""This transition is not only vital for addressing adverse impacts of transport sector-related carbon emissions that contribute to climate change but also crucial for ensuring a clean, efficient and inclusive transport future for all Pakistanis,"" said Asif Sahibzada.
Talking about the environmental and public health benefits, Sahibzada highlighted that EVs emit zero tailpipe pollutants, significantly reducing urban smog and climate-warming emissions. This shift supports the country's commitments under the Paris Agreement and its national climate change targets, he added.
""Cleaner air means fewer respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. With fewer emissions on the road, citizens — especially children and the elderly — will benefit from improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs,"" he remarked.
He further said that electric vehicles undoubtedly offer long-term savings due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. They reduce Pakistan's dependency on imported fossil fuels, helping stabilise the economy and protect against global energy price shocks, he added.
The ministry's Director for Urban Affairs and Urban Air Pollution Experts, Muhammad Azeem Khoso said that cleaner air means fewer respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.

KU halts PhD admissions in many depts,"US
The decision was made during a meeting of the Board of Advanced Studies and Research (BASR)
The administration of the University of Karachi (KU) has decided to temporarily halt PhD admissions in around 10 departments for the 2025 academic session, due to the unavailability of required PhD-qualified faculty members.
The decision was made during a meeting of the Board of Advanced Studies and Research (BASR), chaired by Vice Chancellor Professor Dr Khalid Mehmood Iraqi.
Speaking to The Express Tribune, Dr Iraqi confirmed that PhD admissions have been suspended in specific departments. He said a similar step was taken earlier for the Law School, as it also lacked the necessary faculty. ""If we allow admissions in these departments without adequate teaching staff, students will suffer due to a lack of proper research guidance and course instruction,"" he added. He clarified that this is a temporary move until faculty availability improves.
Departments where both MPhil and PhD admissions have been suspended include: Health & Physical Education and Sports Science, Criminology, and the Sheikh Zayed Islamic Research Centre's Islamic Banking and Finance programmes.

Ravi Shastri warns of Bumrah overuse,"US
The former batter says someone at other end needs to step up
Former India head coach Ravi Shastri on Saturday slammed the Indian bowling unit for its lacklustre performance and inability to take wickets during the ongoing Headingley Test against England.
According to Indian media, Shastri who was visibly disappointed, singled out Jasprit Bumrah as the only bowler performing up to the mark, while sharply criticising the rest of the attack for failing to support him.
""There's a big difference in levels. The concern is Bumrah and what his workload will be as the series progresses because he is the one man who is expected to pick wickets every spell he bowls,"" Shastri remarked.
He raised concerns about the lack of support from Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur and Prasidh Krishna, emphasising that overburdening Bumrah could prove costly for India in the remainder of the series.
""I just hope someone at the other end puts their hands up,"" he added, highlighting the urgent need for the other bowlers to shoulder responsibility and ease the pressure on Bumrah.
India started day two in a dominant position at 324/2, with Rishabh Pant and Shubman Gill in full flow and on course for a massive first-innings total.
However, a dramatic lower-order collapse saw the last seven wickets fall for just 41 runs, leaving India all out for 471.
With the ball Bumrah once again shouldered the burden almost single-handedly.
He finished the day with impressive figures of 3/48 in 13 overs, dismissing Zak Crawley in his first over with a superb delivery and later removing Ben Duckett and Joe Root - the latter for the 10th time in Test cricket.
In contrast, Siraj, Shardul and Prasidh struggled throughout, going wicketless and conceding a combined 154 runs, failing to maintain consistent pressure despite India's imposing first-innings score.
Pant's 'falling sweep'
Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar was left impressed on Saturday by Rishabh Pant's brilliant century in the first innings of the Headingley Test against England.
Tendulkar praised Pant's fearless and unconventional shot-making, highlighting his unique 'falling sweep' technique, which the wicketkeeper-batter executed multiple times during his innings.
Pant, known for his audacious style, scored a commanding 134 runs off 178 balls, including 12 boundaries and six sixes.
One of the standout strokes in his innings was his trademark falling paddle sweep — a shot that often sees him lose balance and end up on the ground.
Tendulkar clarified that this is far from accidental. Sharing his insights on X formerly Twitter, he explained that Pant deliberately goes down with the shot to get under the ball and scoop it over leg slip with control, turning what appears awkward into a smart and effective tactic.
""Rishabh's falling paddle sweep is not accidental. It is intentional and extremely clever. Going down with the shot allows him to get under the ball and scoop it over leg slip with control,"" Tendulkar wrote.
The former India captain also praised Pant and Shubman Gill for their clever on-field tactics while facing young England spinner Shoaib Bashir.
Tendulkar noted that the pair deliberately spoke loudly in Hindi between deliveries — a subtle ploy to unsettle Bashir, who understands the language.
""I also noticed something interesting during Bashir's spell. Shubman and Rishabh were speaking loudly in Hindi between deliveries. It was not just casual talk.
""They were playing mind games with the bowler, trying to disrupt his rhythm. These minor details may not appear on the scoreboard, but they can have a significant impact on the game,"" Tendulkar concluded.
Meanwhile, Pant has added another feather to his cap by becoming the Indian player with the most sixes in the history of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC).

Four minor tremors felt in city,"PL
At least 55 slight quakes felt this month as Landhi fault line becomes active
A sequence of four mild earthquakes was recorded in Karachi on Sunday, causing concern among residents. According to the National Seismic Monitoring Centre, three of the tremors were centered in Malir while one originated near DHA. The strongest quake was in Malir, measuring 3.8 on the Richter scale. No casualties or property damage were reported.
Officials at the National Tsunami Warning Centre revealed that as many as 55 tremors have been recorded in Karachi and surrounding areas since June 1. Most were of low magnitude, but Sunday's quakes were more prominent and widely felt due to their shallow depth, making their impact more noticeable on the surface.
Seismologists suggest the recurring seismic activity is likely due to minor shifts along local fault lines beneath the city. Authorities have launched further geological assessments to monitor and analyze the trend.
The National Tsunami Centre director at the Meteorological Department, Ameer Haider Laghari, has warned that the Landhi fault line is expected to remain active for the coming days.
He explained that movements in underground tectonic layers are generating energy gradually being released, resulting in these recurring earthquakes. Earlier, according to the National Tsunami Center (Pakistan Meteorological Department), these tremors are not a warning sign of a major natural disaster, but rather a natural geological process.

When geography meets geopolitics,"SG
The importance of the Strait of Hormuz is not limited to the Middle East
The Strait of Hormuz – a mere 21 nautical miles wide at its narrowest point – is a passage so narrow, yet so powerful, that a single disruption here can jolt the arteries of the global economy.
Located between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman, the Strait of Hormuz serves as the primary maritime gateway for the world's energy supply. Roughly one-fifth of the global oil trade, an estimated 17 million barrels of oil pass through it daily. In 2024, oil flow through the strait averaged 20 million barrels per day (b/d), or the equivalent of about 20% of global petroleum liquids consumption.
Exporters including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar rely on this maritime passage to access international markets. The strait is also a major route for non-oil shipping, linking Gulf economies to Asia, Africa and Europe.
While some infrastructure exists to bypass the strait, such as overland pipelines through Saudi Arabia and the UAE, these alternatives have limited capacity and cannot fully substitute for Hormuz. As a result, the strait remains a strategic chokepoint, where even minor disruptions can impact global energy prices and shipping insurance markets.
The importance of the Strait of Hormuz is not limited to the Middle East. Asian economies such as China, Japan, India and South Korea are heavily reliant on energy imports from the Gulf, and any sustained disruption could affect global manufacturing and inflation. Similarly, European and North American markets are tied into the same global supply chains, making stability in the strait a shared international interest.
Control over the strait is geographically shared. The northern shore belongs to Iran, while the southern side is part of Oman, specifically its Musandam exclave. The navigable shipping lanes within the strait fall under territorial waters, but transit is governed by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which grants the right of transit passage to all vessels, including military ships, provided they do not threaten peace or security.
The Strait of Hormuz has never been fully blocked or closed to shipping. However, it has occasionally witnessed episodes of tension, particularly during periods of strained diplomatic relations or military escalation. Incidents involving tanker seizures, naval exercises and rhetorical threats from multiple actors have contributed to its reputation as a flashpoint. Its continued openness can be attributed to both geographical and legal factors.
The strait falls under the framework of transit passage rights established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which restricts unilateral actions by coastal states to impede navigation. Moreover, any actual attempt to close the strait would likely trigger a significant escalation of regional and international tensions, making the cost of such a move exceedingly high for all involved parties.
Amid escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, recent warnings from Iranian officials about the possible closure of the Strait of Hormuz have already begun to influence global oil markets. In mid-June 2025, following Israeli airstrikes on Iranian targets and subsequent rhetoric from Tehran, Brent crude prices surged by over 4%, reaching around $78 per barrel, while WTI crude followed a similar trajectory. While a full-scale closure has not occurred, forecasts suggest that even a partial disruption — such as the loss of 1.1 million barrels per day of Iranian exports — could push prices to $75-78, whereas a complete shutdown could send them soaring to $120-130 per barrel.
The world depends on this waterway, but few grasp the full magnitude of its strategic weight or the complexity of its control.
Safe to say Hormuz is small on the map, but vast in its impact.

Venice locals fed up with Bezos wedding,"PK
Protesters denounce arrival of celebrities for nuptials
Venice is divided ahead of next week's celebrity wedding of US tech-tycoon Jeff Bezos and Laura Sanchez, with some looking forward to the glitz and glamour, while others fear it will turn the scenic city of gondolas and palazzi into an amusement park.
Many details of the wedding are still under wraps – including the precise day it will happen – but it is certain that scores of stars from film, fashion and business will arrive to see Bezos tie the knot – provided they can get past the protesters.
One group has plastered banners on the city's famous Rialto Bridge reading ""No space for Bezos!"" and threatened peaceful blockades, complaining that the medieval and Renaissance city needs public services and housing, not celebrities and over-tourism.
""Bezos arrogantly believes he can take over the city and turn it into his own private party venue,"" said Tommaso Cacciari, a leading light of the ""No space for Bezos"" campaign.
Mayor Luigi Brugnaro and regional governor Luca Zaia, on the other hand, argue that the wedding will bring an economic windfall to local businesses, including the motor boats and gondolas that operate its myriad canals.
Eleven years ago actor George Clooney married human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in Venice, turning the city into Hollywood on the Adriatic with a weekend of lavish celebrations.
Then, locals and tourists alike were excited to witness a memorable moment in the city's long history of hosting stars for its film festival, the world's oldest.
Bezos, 61, the founder of e-commerce giant Amazon and the world's third-richest man, got engaged to journalist Sanchez, 55, in 2023, four years after the collapse of his 25-year marriage to Mackenzie Scott.
After a swirl of media speculation about the venue of what has been dubbed ""the wedding of the century"" Brugnaro confirmed in March that it would take place in Venice, which last year began charging tourists a fee to enter the city.
The date is expected to be some time between June 23-28 in the midst of three days of stylish celebrations.
In the face of early protests from residents who feared the arrival of thousands of celebrities and hangers-on, the city issued a statement clarifying that it would involve around 200 guests and would not disrupt Venetians' everyday life.
Bezos and Scott had four children together, while Sanchez was previously married to Hollywood agent Patrick Whitesell, with whom she has two children. She also has a son with NFL tight end Tony Gonzalez.

"RTH, RMC at loggerheads over vacant plot","US
Both parties claim rightful use of Roz Cinema site at Fawara Chowk, citing urgent needs
Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital (RTH) has approached the Rawalpindi Commissioner, Board of Revenue (BoR), the Punjab secretary health, and the District Development Committee to construct a Surgical Tower and 100-bed Trauma Centre on the site of the demolished Roz Cinema at Fawara Chowk, Raja Bazaar.
Meanwhile, the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), which has already built a boundary wall around the site, has proposed a multi-storey parking plaza at the same location.
The historic hospital at Fawara Chowkformerly the District Headquarters Hospital and now upgraded to Rawalpindi Teaching Hospitalis situated adjacent to the site of the old Roz Cinema. After the lease of the cinema expired and a court stay order was lifted, the RMC demolished the structure and enclosed the one kanal eight marla plot with a high boundary wall. The Corporation then submitted a proposal to the Punjab government for the construction of a parking plaza on the site.
On the other hand, RTH currently operates with a severely limited emergency facility of just 30 beds, and is overburdened with patients. The hospital administration has proposed the construction of a Surgical Tower, helipad, and a 100-bed trauma center on the site.
According to Dr Ikramullah Khan Niazi, the Medical Superintendent of RTH, the site was originally allotted to the hospital in 2006, but construction could not proceed due to a court stay order. Now that the legal hurdles have been cleared, the hospital has once again submitted the proposal to the Secretary of Health.
The matter has also been brought to the attention of the Rawalpindi Commissioner, who has referred it to the BoR. The issue was raised in a meeting of the District Development Committee, where officials highlighted the urgent need for expansion due to the hospital's overwhelming patient load.
If approved, the project would not only establish a modern trauma center but also include a helipad for air ambulance services on the rooftop, significantly enhancing emergency healthcare delivery in the region, Niazi added.
However, when contacted, Chief Officer of the RMC, Imran Ali, says the vacated land is municipal property, and the Corporation intends to construct a multi-storey parking plaza there.
The project aims to alleviate traffic congestion and provide parking solutions for the surrounding areas, including Fawara Chowk, Raja Bazaar, Kashmiri Bazaar, Ganjmandi, Liaquat Road, Iqbal Road, and Jinnah Road, he adds.

20 killed in Syria church suicide bombing,"US
Syria's interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State
At least 20 people were killed and dozens injured when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Mar Elias Church in the Dweila neighborhood of Syria's capital Damascus on Sunday, health authorities and security sources said.
It was the first suicide bombing in Damascus since Bashar al-Assad was toppled by an Islamist-led rebel insurgency in December.
Syria's interior ministry said the suicide bomber was a member of Islamic State. He entered the church, opened fire and then detonated his explosive vest, a ministry statement added.
A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said two men were involved in the attack, including the one who blew himself up.
Islamic State has been behind several attempted attacks on churches in Syria since Assad's fall, but this was the first to succeed, another security source told Reuters.
Syria's state news agency cited the health ministry as saying that 52 people were also injured in the blast.
A livestream from the site by Syria's civil defence, the White Helmets, showed scenes of destruction from inside the church, including a bloodied floor and shattered pews and masonry.
Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led the offensive against Assad before taking over in January for a transitional phase, has repeatedly said he will protect minorities. ""We unequivocally condemn the abhorrent terrorist suicide bombing at the Mar Elias Greek Orthodox Church in Damascus, Syria,"" the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement. ""We demand that the Syrian transitional authorities take immediate action to hold those involved accountable and implement measures to guarantee the safety of Christian communities and all religious groups, allowing them to live without fear.""
Syria announces 200% public sector wage
Syria announced on Sunday a 200 percent hike in public sector wages and pensions, as it seeks to address a grinding economic crisis after the recent easing of international sanctions.
Over a decade of civil war has taken a heavy toll on Syria's economy, with the United Nations reporting more than 90 percent of its people live in poverty.
In a decree published by state media, interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a ""200 percent increase to salaries and wages... for all civilian and military workers in public ministries, departments and institutions"".
Under the decree, the minimum wage for government employees was raised to 750,000 Syrian pounds per month, or around $75, up from around $25.
A separate decree granted the same 200 percent increase to retirement pensions included under current social insurance legislation.

Monsoon preparedness,"US
Karachi doesn't need more lip service. It needs proactive planning
With the monsoon clouds fast approaching, the question that looms large over Karachi is not whether it will rain, but how well the city is prepared to endure the prolonged downpours. According to the FAO, the India-Pakistan border region — including southern Sindh — is likely to witness extended monsoon activity from late June to October. For a metropolis like Karachi, where every heavy rain event in recent years has resulted in flooded streets, power outages, and loss of life and property, the signs are ominous.
University Road — one of the city's busiest arteries — remains mired in dust, traffic chaos and haphazard diversions due to ongoing metro line construction. Meanwhile, many parts of northern Karachi have been dug up for various utility and development projects, with little sign of urgency or coordination to restore them before the rains arrive.
In essence, the city is entering the monsoon season with its streets already broken and drainage lines exposed. There have been efforts to clear and upgrade drains in select localities like DHA and Clifton, but whether this will be sufficient is something only time — and the first heavy downpour — will tell. Outside these pockets, there has been virtually no large-scale or visible monsoon preparedness. The usual claims of nullah cleaning and de-silting remain unsupported by on-ground evidence, especially in low-lying and high-risk areas where flooding has become a seasonal norm. This patchwork approach to disaster prevention reflects a deeper malaise of the absence of a unified urban strategy. The fractured governance of Karachi — divided among the KMC, cantonment boards, provincial departments and private utilities — continues to stymie coordinated action.
Karachi doesn't need more lip service. It needs proactive planning. It requires a climate-resilient infrastructure overhaul and year-round planning, rooted in scientific forecasting and urban design. For now, Karachi stands on the precipice of another monsoon season, yet again underprepared, and with little excuse.

Americans rudest on the internet,"PK
Study shows Brits and Aussies come second and third, respectively
Almost two billion words — just under 600 of them swear words — were carefully assessed, and the United States then handed the dubious honour of being the most cursing country in the English-speaking world, at least online.
For the Australian duo behind the research, it came as a surprise that the inhabitants of their own country did not lead the way, such is the stereotype that Aussies are easy-going and relaxed, in actions and words.
But Australians were only the third-most likely citizens to drop a swear word in conversation online.
The reason that America — viewed by some to be a more conservative and polite culture among English-speakers — is the most profane community online may be the anonymity of the screen, according to the study's co-author Martin Schweinberger, a linguist at the University of Queensland, Australia.
""Especially when you're not tied to what you write with your name, for example,"" said Schweinberger. ""There are also cultural differences on what is allowed in social situations.""
""Different cultures have different norms on when and what is permitted. It seems as if the Americans, basically, are more forgiving online,"" he said.
Billions of words
Schweinberger and collaborating linguist Kate Burridge evaluated 1.7 billion words used in online news stories, company websites, institutional publications, blogs and other web sources, across 20 English-speaking regions.
From these sources, they created a list of around 600 obscenities, including modified words and abbreviations, like ""WTF"", and dozens of variations of the ""F"" and ""C"" words and other vulgarities.
They then analysed how frequently those vulgarities appeared in the documents they had found online.
In their results, Americans topped the list with a curse word appearing 0.036 per cent of the time. That is equivalent to 36 curse words in a 100,000-word text.
The British were next, with 25 curses per 100,000 words. Then the Aussies with 22, Singaporeans with 21 and New Zealanders with 20.
Bangladeshis are the politest among English-speakers — just seven vulgarities per 100,000 words.
Polite in the real world
While a broad range of internet sources were used for the study, social media was excluded from the dataset.
That was done deliberately, said Schweinberger, because social platforms require more ""weeding"" of material that is not suitable for analysis.
However, he said they have analysed the use of vulgarities on social media — compared to face-to-face interactions — in a separate study.
The results, which have yet to be published, are quite different: On social media, New Zealanders top the list, ahead of the Irish and Australians, said Schweinberger.
And in face-to-face interactions, the American stereotype for conservatism is evident. ""Face-to-face, the Americans are way down the list,"" Schweinberger said. ""But social media basically had the same pattern that we find in general online data.""
Swearing culture
For linguists, a data-rich analysis of the use of language online provides insight into how humans behave and interact.
Andrea Calude, a linguist at the University of Waikato, New Zealand, who was not involved in the study, said it was important to have a scientific approach to how words are used.
""Sometimes you think you know things which you don't, so you have to look at [the] data,"" said Calude. ""We think of English as one thing — one language — but look at how different English [is used] around the world,"" Calude said.
In particular, the context in which speakers use vulgarity is a useful way to help non-native speakers integrate into a new environment.
""Even in this connected world, we each have our own idiosyncratic way of speaking locally,"" said Calude. ""If you break those patterns, you identify yourself as not one of the locals. It speaks to this idea that there are local communities, even when you have a globalised world.""
Schweinberger, who hails from Germany, knows it from personal experience. He once used vulgarity in the company of American colleagues and said he ""could see their faces shift completely, as if I'd said something really horrible. I just wasn't aware of these cultural constraints.""
Analysing vulgarity, he said, was not only a valuable tool for linguists but for people in all walks of life.
""When we think of these bad words or bad language, it's not that you need to avoid it, it's to learn when to use it appropriately,"" Schweinberger said, ""and then it can be really effective for improving your communication style and skills.""

Six dead as rains batter Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa,"US
Tourists stranded, villages cut off as flash floods wreck homes, wash away access roads
Six people have lost their lives and five others have been injured in various rain-related incidents since June 20 across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has released a preliminary report on the human and material losses caused by recent heavy rains, lightning strikes, and collapsing walls across the province.
The fatalities include three men, one woman, and two children, while the injured comprise three men and two women.
The report further states that a total of seven houses were damaged during the storms and five were partially damaged, while two were completely destroyed.
The incidents occurred in various districts of the province, including Mansehra, Buner, Lower and Upper Dir, Malakand, and Kolai Palas Kohistan.
The PDMA has directed local administrations to provide immediate assistance to affected families and ensure the injured receive the best possible medical care.
Rainfall is expected to continue until June 23. The PDMA had already issued alerts to all district administrations to remain on high alert and take precautionary measures in advance.
PDMA officials added that the authority is in constant communication with district administrations and all relevant rescue and relief agencies. The Emergency Operations Center of PDMA is fully operational, and the public is urged to report any emergency by calling 1700.
On Saturday heavy torrential rains lashed the scenic areas of Kohistan in Upper Dir, including Jahaz Banda, Lamoti, Badgoi, and Jandri, triggering flash floods in streams and the Kohistan River. As a result, a child lost his life and widespread destruction has been reported.
The intense rainfall swept away at least three key connecting bridges in Jahaz Banda, Lamoti, Jandri, and nearby areas, severing road links and isolating local communities. Residents have initiated road repairs on a self-help basis amid the destruction.
Several houses, fertile farmlands, and access roads were washed away in the floods. Portions of the main Kumrat Road were also destroyed at various points, leaving scores of tourists stranded. Long queues of vehicles were seen along damaged sections of the route.
Floodwaters entered Patraak Bazaar, inundating shops and homes, causing substantial losses to both residents and traders. Multiple hydropower units were also swept away, resulting in power outages in several areas. Crops and fruit orchards were severely affected by the deluge.
Assistant Commissioner of Sheringal, Dir Bala, Muhammad Fayaz, along with local police, reached the affected areas and launched relief and recovery operations. Speaking to the media, he stated that temporary restoration of access roads and bridges will be ensured as soon as possible to facilitate movement and aid.

"Sugar, rice prices soar in wholesale markets","US
Traders to issue revised prices for all grocery items within next 10 days
With the upcoming fiscal year's budget implementation looming, wholesale markets have begun raising prices.
The price of a 50kg sugar sack rose by Rs300 on Wednesday, and an additional Rs200 increase is expected this week, pushing the retail price of sugar up by Rs10 to Rs190 per kg.
The price of tea leaves reached Rs2,200 per kg, while lentils and rice saw per-bag increases of Rs350 and Rs400, respectively.
Wholesale traders have warned that new prices for all grocery items will be issued within the next ten days due to newly imposed taxes.
They have also reduced the supply of sugar, rice, and lentils by 30 to 40 per cent, causing shortages in stores across the city.
Grocery Merchants Association President Salim Pervez Butt stated that prices of essential items like pulses, sugar, ghee, and rice are rising by Rs100 to Rs200 per bag daily.
Despite payments and orders, wholesalers are failing to meet demand. Rising fuel prices have also made transportation more expensive.
He criticised authorities for targeting small retailers while ignoring large-scale price hikes by wholesalers.
He questioned the early increase in prices, given that new taxes are set to take effect on July 1. Fears are mounting that milkmen, butchers, and bakers will also raise prices of milk, yoghurt, meat, and bread in July due to these tax measures.

Mosaic floors found in ancient Olympos church,"PK
Excavations in Turkish city unearth historic finds
Excavations at the Olympos Ancient City in Türkiye's southern Antalya province have uncovered new mosaic floors and a notable inscription at the entrance of a church, archaeologists announced.
Located in the Kumluca district, Olympos has been under continuous excavation since 2006, with year-round efforts underway for the past four years. The site contains remains from the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods.
Significant discoveries at the site include multiple churches, an entrance complex, the Bishop's Palace, a bridge, the Lycian Marcus Aurelius Arkhepolis Monumental Tomb, mosaic structures, the Antimakhos Sarcophagus, and monumental tombs near the harbour.
Gokcen Kurtulus Oztaskin, an associate professor at Pamukkale University and head of the excavation team, told Anadolu that the increased funding and ongoing support from Türkiye's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has enabled uninterrupted archaeological work.
""Olympos continues to surprise us with its mosaics. In 2017, 2022, and 2023, we discovered richly decorated mosaic floors at the sites we worked on. This year, we uncovered and restored the floor mosaics of Church No 1,"" he said.
He added that mosaics with geometric and vegetal motifs, along with inscriptions, were found in both the main and annex sections of the church. One inscription was located at the church entrance door.
Highlighting the inscription's message, Oztaskin said it reads: ""Only those on the righteous path may enter here.""
According to Oztaskin, the presence of mosaic inscriptions and benefactors' names indicates that Olympos was one of the most affluent cities in the Lycian region in terms of mosaic art.
Excavations in the northern section of the ancient city are expected to be completed within two years, after which focus will shift to the southern areas. Andalou

Milk rich in nutrients seen as remedy for diabetes
Camel milk, renowned for its rich nutrient profile and medicinal properties, has the potential to improve public health and significantly boost Pakistan's livestock exports, experts say.
Speaking on World Camel Day, observed annually on June 22, Dr Jamshaid Akhtar, Deputy Director of Livestock, emphasised the untapped potential of camels in Pakistan's semi-arid and arid regions.
He noted that camel milk contains insulin-like proteins, making it particularly beneficial for diabetic patients.
""Camel milk is a powerful natural remedy. It not only helps control diabetes but is increasingly in demand in the cosmetics industry due to its natural healing and moisturising properties,"" he said.
World Camel Day is celebrated on June 22 to raise awareness about the vital role camels play in desert ecosystems.
""This date was chosen symbolically as it marks the hottest and longest day of the year — a reminder of the camel's unmatched ability to survive extreme conditions,"" Dr Jamshaid explained.
""Camels are not just animals of the desert; they are lifelines in harsh climates.""
Pakistan, he added, is home to some of the world's best camel breeds, which are well-adapted to local environmental conditions. He urged livestock farmers to explore camel rearing more seriously and consider the economic value of camel-based products such as milk, meat, and even bones.
""Increased production and value addition in camel products can help Pakistan earn substantial foreign exchange,"" he said.
""By promoting camel products both locally and internationally, we can carve out a unique identity for our country in the global livestock sector.""
Dr Jamshaid also underscored the cultural and ecological significance of camels, which have historically served communities through transportation, food, and resilience against climatic adversity.
He called on local farmers to adopt scientific methods for efficient camel rearing, noting that modern practices could dramatically improve productivity.
""It's time we shift our perspective and recognise camels as a sustainable source of livelihood and a pillar of national economic growth,"" he concluded.

Awami Tehreek marks death anniversary of Rasool Bux Palijo,"US
President of the Awami Workers Party (AWP), Advocate Akhtar Hussain, deemed Palijo a genius and revolutionary
The seventh death anniversary of Rasool Bux Palijo, an iconic Sindhi nationalist leader, was marked at a public meeting of the Awami Tehreek (AT), in Thatta on Saturday.
The participants echoed chants against corporate farming and the exploitation of Sindh's resources. The event passed a set of 31 resolutions, including the abolition of legislations negating the country's constitution, the implementation of the 1940 resolution and of Muhammad Ali Jinnah's August 11, 1947, speech. The party also demanded aborting the construction of new canals and dams, repealing the Indus River System Authority (IRSA) ordinance, and terminating 'daaku raaj' in Sindh.
President AT, Advocate Vasand Thari, reiterated that the province's oppressed people rejected the corporate farming project, and vowed to see schemes like the building of new canals and dams on the Indus River meet the same fate as the controversial Kalabagh dam project. He accused the proponents of such projects of being enemies of Jinnah's envisaged Pakistan, blaming the country's establishment for turning Pakistan into an experimental ground for global imperialist agendas, surrendering the nation's sovereignty to international financial institutions.
Meanwhile, President of the Awami Workers Party (AWP), Advocate Akhtar Hussain, deemed Palijo a genius and revolutionary, while Chairman of the Haqooq-e-Khalq Party, Farooq Tariq, praised Palijo for his struggle in the service of Sindh and its people.
During the event, a group of girls clad in red dresses and wearing ajaraks presented a parade, carrying AT's flag.

Pakistan's moment for structural reforms,"US
Reforms target tariffs, electricity, SOEs and debt to make economy more competitive
After years of economic stagnation and firefighting to avert default, the government is finally pivoting towards long overdue structural reforms, buoyed by a markedly improved macroeconomic outlook.
Inflation, which had surged to 38% in mid-2023, has plunged to a six-decade low, prompting the central bank to slash interest rate from 22% to 11%. The exchange rate has stabilised around Rs280 per dollar, foreign currency reserves now cover nearly three months of imports and falling global oil prices have eased fiscal pressures. With this breathing space, the government is seizing the opportunity to take bold decisions and advance long-pending reforms.
Among the boldest reforms underway is the overhaul of Pakistan's import tariff regime. The government has rolled out a five-year plan to transition from one of the most inward-looking and protectionist economies to a more open, export-oriented model akin to East Asian success stories. The reform sets an ambitious target: reducing the maximum tariff rate from over 100% to just 15%. This includes the complete removal of regulatory duties, currently ranging from 5% to 90%, and additional customs duties of up to 7%.
Pakistan's current tariff structure is not only excessively high but also deeply fragmented, riddled with exemptions and privileges extended to favoured sectors and industries. These special treatments cost the government an estimated Rs550 billion annually, nearly half of all customs revenue. Removing such distortions will help level the playing field, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that form the backbone of the economy.
Lower tariffs will lower input costs for domestic manufacturers, enhance competitiveness and encourage firms to target export markets. A detailed analysis shows that these changes are likely to increase productivity, attract foreign investment and stimulate job creation. Consumers will also benefit through greater access to high-quality, affordable products. In short, this is not just a trade policy shift; it is a foundational move to unlock economic dynamism.
Complementing tariff reform is a drive to cut red tape. The government has finalised 63 regulatory reforms aimed at simplifying and digitising business procedures. These will be rolled out over the next 15 to 90 days, easing compliance and reducing the cost of doing business.
The power sector, long a major constraint on growth and fiscal stability, is undergoing significant reform. Following a review of independent power producer (IPP) contracts, a key breakthrough has been the approval of a financial restructuring plan to eliminate Rs1.275 trillion in circular debt through an agreement with commercial banks.
Electricity tariffs have been reduced by over 30% for industry and by more than 50% for 18 million protected households. Distribution companies (DISCOs) are now overseen by professional boards and improved governance has already cut losses by Rs140 billion in just nine months.
Debt management has seen a breakthrough with Pakistan's first debt buyback programme. Debt worth Rs1 trillion has been repurchased, saving over Rs850 billion in interest payments under refinancing arrangements. Combined with fiscal consolidation and restrained development spending, the overall fiscal deficit has narrowed to 5.6% of GDP in FY2025, down from 6.9% in the previous year.
State-owned enterprises (SOEs), long a major fiscal drain costing over Rs1 trillion annually, are finally on the path to reform. Privatisation is gaining real traction: five serious investor consortiums have expressed interest in acquisition of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), slated for privatisation in FY2025-26. Meanwhile, the process is advancing steadily for seven electricity distribution companies and two generation companies (Gencos).
Reforms in the pension system, a politically sensitive area, have also begun. These include linking pension increases to the Consumer Price Index (CPI), limiting pension duration to 10 years after a pensioner's death (for spouses only), capping multiple pensions and requiring pensioners re-employed in the public sector to choose between a salary or a pension.
Pakistan now stands at a rare moment of opportunity. The economic fundamentals are stabilising, inflation is down, the rupee is steady and fiscal discipline is improving. At the same time, a coherent set of structural reforms is being rolled out, targeting tariffs, electricity, SOEs, debt and the business environment. These are not cosmetic changes, but deep, systemic shifts designed to make the economy more competitive, equitable and future-ready.
What matters now is persistence. Reforms will face resistance from vested interests, from inertia within institutions and from shifting political winds. But if this momentum can be maintained, Pakistan could finally escape the cycle of boom and bust and move towards sustained, inclusive growth.

Three dead in Algeria stadium stampede,"US
Crowned Algerian champion for the second consecutive year and the ninth time in its history
Three people were killed and 81 injured in a stampede among supporters of Algerian football club MCA in Algiers, authorities said Sunday.
""Three deaths have been recorded,"" the health ministry said in a statement, adding that hospitals in the capital had admitted 81 injured people.
Crowned Algerian champion for the second consecutive year and the ninth time in its history, the celebrations of the Mouloudia Club d'Alger (MCA) turned to mourning.
According to the sports website La Gazette du Fennec, a security barrier collapsed, resulting in many fans falling onto the lower level.
The Stade du 5 Juillet was packed as reigning champions MCA drew 0-0 against NC Magra.
As a result of the tragedy, the national football league decided to cancel the official trophy presentation ceremony.
A previous toll after the supporters fell from the upper stands on Saturday said only one had died and 11 were injured.

Ex-education authority chief held for 'corruption',"US
Arrest, made in 'humiliating' manner, sparks outrage among education officials
Officials from the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) formally arrested the former Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Rawalpindi District Education Authority, Amanullah Cheema, 19 hours after being taken into custody in connection with an embezzlement case. The department's cashier, Arshad, was also arrested as a co-accused in the case.
Despite being a Grade-19 senior officer, Cheema was reportedly arrested in a humiliating and unprofessional manner, dragged from a basic office without a registered FIR. Initially, he was detained based only on a plain-paper inquiry request. An FIR was registered 18 hours later, allegedly after internal manoeuvring.
Due to the delay in filing the FIR, no physical remand could be sought on Sunday, and the authorities had to cancel their decision to present him before the duty judge.
Now, both accused are set to appear before the special Anti-Corruption Court (ATC) today (Monday) to request physical remand.
The absence of an FIR and the manner of arrest have caused resentment and unrest among education officers, principals, and headmasters. No one was allowed to meet the arrested officials until Sunday. Even when District and Tehsil Education Officers visited the Anti-Corruption office to inquire about the matter, the investigating officer prevented their meeting and began questioning them about corruption-related issues as well.
The entire Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) Department team remained active through Saturday night and all day Sunday, searching the offices of the Education Department, including the CEO's office. They turned over drawers, shelves, and files but reportedly found no concrete evidence. Still, they confiscated all files and records from the CEO's office and took them away for further scrutiny.
Cheema faces allegations of embezzling Rs8 million, primarily for purchasing furniture and stationery without following tender procedures, allegedly causing a loss to the public exchequer. In response, a legal team of senior lawyers has been assembled to defend the former officer.
During the inquiry that continued from Saturday night through Sunday (10am to 2pm), the arrested education officer categorically denied all charges.
Meanwhile, a new CEO has arrived from Sheikhupura to take over responsibilities in Rawalpindi. He formally assumed official charge on Sunday and is expected to take administrative charge at the office today (Monday).
This arrest is expected to lead to major political, administrative, and financial revelations in the coming days.

Alcaraz crowned king of Queen's for second time,"PK
The world number two warmed up for Wimbledon with a resounding win against Lehecka in the final
Carlos Alcaraz clinched his second Queen's Club title as the world number two warmed up for Wimbledon with a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 6-2 win against Jiri Lehecka in Sunday's final.
Alcaraz blasted 33 winners and 18 aces to subdue the gritty Czech world number 30 in two hours and 10 minutes in west London.
Having won titles on clay at the French Open, Rome and Monte Carlo, as well as the hard courts of Rotterdam, Alcaraz has now collected five trophies in 2025.
The 22-year-old has not lost since the Barcelona final against Holger Rune on April 20 and is enjoying the longest winning streak of his career with 18 successive victories.
Top seeded Alcaraz is just the second Spanish man to win Queen's twice after Feliciano Lopez, who lifted the trophy in 2017 and 2019.
""I'm happy to lift this trophy once again. It's a nightmare to play against Jiri, but it's been an incredible week,"" Alcaraz said.
""I came without expectations. I just wanted to play good tennis and get used to the grass.
""It's really special playing here every year. I can't wait to come back next year.""
For a player raised on the clay courts of Spain, Alcaraz has developed into a formidable force on grass.
The former world number one signalled his emergence on the surface by winning Queen's in 2023.
He clinched the Wimbledon title for the first time just weeks later and defended his All England Club crown last year.
Alcaraz, who has an 11-1 career record at Queen's, will start his bid for a third successive Wimbledon title on June 30.
After his semi-final win over Roberto Bautista Agut on Saturday, Alcaraz fired an ominous message to his Wimbledon rivals, warning that his ""grass-court mode"" had been activated.
And on the evidence of his relentless display against the obdurate Lehecka, he is in no mood to surrender his All England Club crown.
Playing his first tournament since his epic French Open victory against Jannik Sinner two weeks ago, Alcaraz's march to the Queen's showpiece made it five consecutive finals for the Spaniard.
In contrast, Lehecka was playing in his first grass-court final after a shock win against British star Jack Draper in the last four. The 23-year-old was the first Czech in the Queen's final since Ivan Lendl in 1990.

"No power outage during Ashura, DISCOs ordered","US
Minister instructs power companies to fix faulty equipment
The Energy Ministry has issued orders for uninterrupted power supply throughout the country during Muharram and instructed the distribution companies (DISCOs) to ensure immediate repair or replacement of faulty equipment in their system.
Energy Minister Awais Leghari has issued the instructions to the chief executive officers of all Discos, saying that the holy month of Muharram was approaching, when millions of people attend gatherings and processions across the country.
""As you are aware, the sacred month of Muharramul Haram is approaching, during which millions of devotees/mourners across Pakistan will participate in Majalis and processions to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (RA),"" he said.
""Since the holy month of Muharram is falling in the month of July and heat waves are expected, it is very much imperative that all necessary measures are taken to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to — avoid any inconvenience to the public,"" it added.
In this regard, the minister asked the Discos to take the action on an urgent basis, including plan for preemptive maintenance and load management; form emergency response teams; and ensure generator and backup support.
""Conduct thorough inspections of all transmission and distribution networks, particularly in areas where Majalis and processions are expected. Ensure that all faulty equipment is promptly repaired or replaced to prevent outages,"" the order stated.
""Deploy dedicated emergency response teams on high alert throughout Muharram, especially on the 9th and 10th of Muharram, to address any power disruptions immediately,"" it added.
The minister asked the Disco officials to coordinate with district administrations, law-enforcement agencies, and religious gatherings organisers to identify critical locations requiring priority power supply and backup arrangements.
The minister stressed the need for communicating proactively with consumers, especially Imambargahs and mosques, regarding any scheduled maintenance or potential load management measures to minimise inconvenience.
He emphasised updating the inventory to ensure that sufficient number of transformers and other materials were available in each sub-division. ""Ensure standby generators and UPS systems at sensitive locations to provide backup power in case of any grid issues.""
Furthermore, the minister instructed for assigning duty rosters and establishment of dedicated control centres to ensure round the clock availability of technical and operational staff to respond swiftly to any power-related issues.
""The sanctity of Muharram demands our utmost commitment to serving the public with diligence and respect. Any negligence in this regard will be viewed seriously,"" he said, and asked the officials to submit a compliance report.

Bumpy road to sustainability,"US
The transport sector is one of Pakistan's biggest contributors to carbon emissions
Pakistan's formal unveiling of the National Electric Vehicle (NEV) Policy 2025-30 marks a long-overdue step in the right direction — but one that also lays bare the country's chronic struggle to balance ambition with reality. While the government's goal of having 30 per cent of all new vehicles sold by 2030 be electric appears visionary, the road leading to that destination is littered with financial and structural potholes.
The transport sector is one of Pakistan's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, and tackling it is essential if the country is to meet its climate targets. On paper, the benefits of this transition are undeniable — saving 2.07 billion litres of fuel annually; trimming $1 billion in foreign exchange outflow; reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 4.5 million tonnes; and cutting national healthcare-related costs by $405 million, among others.
The inclusion of a gender-sensitive subsidy policy that reserves 25 per cent of electric bikes and rickshaws for women is also a welcome nod to inclusive mobility. But ambition without planning is a recipe for frustration. With an initial subsidy of just Rs9 billion allocated for the coming fiscal year, the numbers are unlikely to move the needle in any meaningful way. The affordability of New Energy Vehicles remains a serious question. For the average Pakistani struggling to make ends meet, an electric bike or car — even subsidised — remains out of reach.
The transition to sustainable energy in transport must be part of a broader, systemic green strategy. Piecemeal efforts, no matter how noble, will be easily overwhelmed by the inertia of structural inefficiencies and economic constraints. In a country battling an energy and climate crisis, sustainability must be rooted in pragmatic, long-term planning and above all the needs of the average citizen.

Shopkeepers ignore official prices,"PK
Consumers complain that every market operates on its own terms.
Soaring food prices and rampant overcharging have left citizens frustrated as shopkeepers continue to ignore government rates.
Despite weekly notifications from authorities, essential food items are being sold at prices up to double the approved rates, exposing a breakdown in price control enforcement across the city.
Consumers complain that every market operates on its own terms. The official rate lists, often displayed for show, are routinely disregarded.
This week, the price of live chicken was fixed at Rs244 to Rs258 per kilogramme, yet shopkeepers openly charged up to Rs360.
Chicken meat, officially priced at Rs374 per kg, was sold at Rs480 to Rs550, while boneless chicken reached as high as Rs1,000 per kg.
A similar pattern emerged across vegetable markets. Potatoes listed at Rs60 to Rs65 per kg were sold for Rs120 to Rs140.
Tomatoes were fixed at Rs50 to Rs55 per kg but retailed at Rs120. Onions, with an official rate of Rs35 to Rs40 per kg, were priced as high as Rs80. Locally produced garlic was priced at Rs205 to Rs215 per kg but sold for Rs280 to Rs300.
Chinese garlic, fixed at Rs248 to Rs260, fetched Rs400, while the Harani variety was similarly overpriced.
Ginger, officially priced at Rs500 to Rs525 per kg, was sold for Rs600 to Rs700. Cucumber, brinjal, spinach, bitter gourd and other staple vegetables saw discrepancies between official and market prices.
Even items whose official prices were reduced saw no relief. Watermelon, reduced to Rs33 to Rs35 per kg on the rate list, continued to be sold at Rs80 to Rs130.

OIC calls for 'strict adherence' to IWT,"US
The CFM called for strict adherence to bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India
The Council of Foreign Ministers of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC-CFM) on Sunday condemned Israeli aggression against Iran and expressed solidarity with Pakistan in the wake of ""unjustified strikes"" carried out by India last month.
The 'Istanbul Declaration' issued at the end of the two-day meeting in the Turkish city, emphasised that the ceasefire between Pakistan and India announced on May 10, 2025, must be ""faithfully adhered to"", in the interest of regional peace and stability.
The foreign ministers from the Muslim states met in Istanbul for the 51st session of the CFM and adopted the 'Istanbul Declaration'. The two-day session on Saturday and Sunday was held under the theme of 'The OIC in a Transforming World'.
The CFM called for strict adherence to bilateral agreements between Pakistan and India, including the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT); and stressed the importance of a broad-based dialogue for peaceful settlement of all outstanding disputes.
""Express our deep concern over the recent military escalation in the South Asia region, including the unjustified strikes carried out on multiple locations in Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and stress the need to exercise maximum restraint and avoid actions that would destabilise the region,"" it said.
The CFM expressed full support for the inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people in accordance with the UN Security Council and OIC resolutions, and the wishes of the Kashmiri people; and condemned massive human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
Israeli aggression
The Istanbul Declaration condemned the Israel aggression against Iran and stressed ""the urgent need to stop Israeli attacks"". It expressed great concern over this dangerous escalation and a threatening human, economic and environmental situation in the region.
The CFM condemned the ongoing Israeli campaign of genocide against the Gaza Strip as well as the systematic campaigns of destruction and killing in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, aimed at eliminating the Palestinian cause, including the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.
It reaffirmed the importance of achieving a permanent and sustainable ceasefire and of implementing the UNSC resolution aimed at ending the Israeli aggression, rebuilding of the Gaza Strip, and ensuring the provision of political and financial support to the Palestinian government.
The meeting called for and early convening of the United Nations High-Level Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution and relevant United Nations resolutions, under the co-chairmanship of the Saudi Arabia and France.
""Condemn the actions of Israel, the occupying Power, in using starvation as a method of genocide by obstructing the entry of humanitarian assistance and preventing United Nations humanitarian agencies from carrying out their mandates, with the aim of forcibly displacing the Palestinian population,"" it said.
""In this regard, we call for the rejection of all forms of forced displacement of the Palestinian people, the urgent opening of crossings and borders, the unimpeded and adequate delivery of humanitarian aid, and the provision of protection for the Palestinian civilian population,"" read the Istanbul Declaration.
The CFM called on the international community to take deterrent measures to stop Israel's destabilisation policies and its recent attacks on Iran, Syria, and Lebanon and make Israel accountable for its crimes.
Islamophobia, terrorism
The CFM urged the international community to take effective measures to combat extremism, hate speech, defamation of religions, negative stereotyping and the stigmatisation of people on the basis of religion, belief or ethnicity at the national and global level,
The declaration underlines that terrorism and extremism could not be associated with any religion, race, ethnicity or nationality and should be unequivocally condemned regardless of its forms and manifestations that continue threatening the global peace and security
The meeting welcomed the progress in the normalisation ties between Azerbaijan and Armenia and the efforts of the Syrian interim government for the integration of Syria into the regional and international system. it supported the aspirations of the Muslim Turkish Cypriots to secure their inherent rights.
The OIC foreign ministers appreciated the commendable efforts by Algeria, Somalia and Pakistan to promote Islamic causes in the context of their non-permanent membership in the UN Security Council, the declaration stated.

Climate crisis affects Pakistan education,"US
Classrooms are often overcrowded and lack basic cooling, heating or ventilation systems
Pakistan's children are losing weeks of education each year to school closures caused by climate change-linked extreme weather, prompting calls for a radical rethink of learning schedules.
Searing heat, toxic smog and unusual cold snaps have all caused closures that are meant to spare children the health risks of learning in classrooms that are often overcrowded and lack basic cooling, heating or ventilation systems.
In May, a nationwide heatwave saw temperatures up to seven degrees Celsius above normal, hitting 45C (113 degrees Fahrenheit) in Punjab and prompting several provinces to cut school hours or start summer holidays early.
""The class becomes so hot that it feels like we are sitting in a brick kiln,"" said 17-year-old Hafiz Ehtesham outside an inner city Lahore school.
""I don't even want to come to school.""
Pakistan is among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, with limited resources for adaptation, and extreme weather is compounding an existing education crisis caused mostly by access and poverty.
""Soon we will have major cognitive challenges because students are being impacted by extreme heat and extreme smog over long periods of time,"" said Lahore-based education activist Baela Raza Jamil.
""The poorest are most vulnerable. But climate change is indeed a great leveller and the urban middle class is also affected.""
Pakistan's summers historically began in June, when temperatures hit the high 40s. But in the last five years, May has been similarly hot, according to the Meteorological Department.
""During a power outage, I was sweating so much that the drops were falling off my forehead onto my desk,"" 15-year-old Jannat, a student in Lahore, told AFP.
""A girl in my class had a nosebleed from the heat.""
Around a third of Pakistani school-age children — over 26 million — are out of school, according to government figures, one of the highest numbers in the world.
And 65 percent of children are unable to read age-appropriate material by age 10.
School closures affect almost every part of Pakistan, including the country's most populous province Punjab, which has the highest rates of school attendance.
Classes closed for two weeks in November over air pollution, and another week in May because of heat. In the previous academic year, three weeks were lost in January to a cold snap and two weeks in May due to heat.
Political unrest and cricket matches that closed roads meant more lost days.
In Balochistan, Pakistan's poorest province, May heatwaves have prompted early summer vacations for three years running, while in northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, school hours are regularly slashed.
For authorities, the choice is often between sending children to school in potentially dangerous conditions or watching them fall behind.
In southern Sindh province, authorities have resisted heat-related closures despite growing demands from parents.
""It's hard for parents to send their children to school in this kind of weather,"" private school principal Sadiq Hussain told AFP in Karachi, adding that attendance drops by 25 percent in May.
""Their physical and mental health is being affected,"" added Dost Mohammad Danish, general secretary of All Sindh Private Schools and Colleges Association.
""Don't expect better scientists from Pakistan in the coming years.""
Schools in Pakistan are overseen by provincial authorities, whose closure notices apply to all schools in a region, even when they are hundreds of kilometres (miles) apart and may be experiencing different conditions, or have different resources to cope.
Teachers, parents and education experts want a rethink of school hours, exam timetables and vacations, with schools able to offer Saturday classes or split the school day to avoid the midday heat.
Izza Farrakh, a senior education specialist at the World Bank, said climate change-related impacts are affecting attendance and learning outcomes.
""Schools need to have flexibility in determining their academic calendar. It shouldn't be centralised,"" she said, adding that end-of-year exams usually taken in May could be replaced by regular assessments throughout the year.
Adapting school buildings is also crucial.
International development agencies have already equipped thousands of schools with solar panels, but many more of the country's 250,000 schools need help.
Hundreds of climate-resilient schools funded by World Bank loans are being built in Sindh. They are elevated to withstand monsoon flooding, and fitted with solar panels for power and rooftop insulation to combat heat and cold.

Pre-monsoon rain exposes drainage failures,"PK
Streets flooded with three to four feet of water with low-lying areas submerged
The very first heavy pre-monsoon rain, which lashed the city on the night between Saturday and Sunday, exposed the tall claims of cleanliness and drainage made by the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), and the Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC).
The intense downpour that occurred on the night between Saturday and Sunday wreaked havoc across the city, crippling the sanitation system.
Streets and neighbourhoods were flooded with three to four feet of rain and sewage water, particularly submerging low-lying areas. Once the rain stopped in the morning, it left behind layers of sludge and mud, ranging from three to six inches thick, in the streets, along with dead rats, lizards, and insects scattered throughout.
As the Sunday sun rose, the smell of decaying animals and sewage spread across neighbourhoods, raising serious public health concerns.
Residents fear the outbreak of diseases. Areas worst affected included Amarpura, Chah Sultan, Mukha Singh Estate, Dhok Khaba, Dhok Elahi Bakhsh, Arya Mohalla, Fazalabad, Nadeem Colony, Javed Colony, Tahmaspabad, Pirwadhai, Dhok Hassu, Dhok Naju, Zia-ul-Haq Colony, Dhok Ratta, Ganj Mandi, Peoples Colony, Range Road, Sheron Colony, and riverbank areas near Soan River, where mud made movement nearly impossible.
In all these areas, water entered homes up to one foot deep, and vehicles parked in streets were flooded, rendering them non-functional. Owners struggled to restart them using battery recharges and push-starts. Fear gripped low-lying residents, who on Sunday began moving their valuable household items and even pets to safer places.
All city underpasses were submerged, making earlier promises of drainage systems and installed machinery appear hollow. Both sides of the roads remained waterlogged, and 65 mm of rain was recorded in the twin cities overnight.
While Saturday night's rain had cooled the temperature, the intense Sunday heat and day-long power outage left residents sweltering. The power cut lasted 18 to 20 hours, also crippling the water supply system.
Although the heavy rain flushed out much of the sewage from the drains, it also carried back the previously cleaned silt and garbage into the main storm drains and Nullah Leh.
Meanwhile, medical experts have urged authorities to immediately carry out disinfectant sprays in streets filled with sewage, filth, and sludge to prevent the spread of diseases. Residents have appealed to the RWMC to urgently clean the affected streets and remove the mud and dead animals.
RWMC's spokesperson said that Sunday was a holiday and that clean-up operations in low-lying areas would commence today (Monday).
Residents Asif Khan, Chaudhry Imran, and Dr Ghori lamented, ""The monsoon hasn't even properly started, and this is already the situation. Instead of mere verbal promises, WASA and municipal officials must take real, on-ground action to ensure proper drainage and sanitation.""

The shark's not working',"US
How 'Jaws' shaped Hollywood blockbusters
In the summer of 1975, a film about a killer shark hit theatres and changed Hollywood forever. But behind the scenes, Jaws nearly capsized under the weight of its own ambition — with mechanical failures, sea-sick actors, and a young director teetering on the edge of collapse, narrates Variety in an ode to the film's 50-year anniversary.
""The shark's not working"" became a dreaded refrain on set, heard so often over walkie-talkies that it became a kind of dark inside joke. For Steven Spielberg, then just 27, those words were a nightmare. With three mechanical great whites - all named ""Bruce"" — frequently out of commission, production stalled again and again. Shooting on open water near Martha's Vineyard only made things worse. Waves, weather, and wayward boats disrupted filming, and each delay sent costs spiraling.
The film's original budget of $4 million eventually doubled, and the schedule stretched more than three months past deadline. Universal Pictures executives were reportedly close to pulling the plug.
""We didn't know how they were ever going to finish this movie,"" remembered Jeffrey Kramer, who played a sheriff's deputy in the film. ""There were rumours all around the set that the studio was going to shut us down.""
But Spielberg refused to crack under pressure. Co-writer Carl Gottlieb recalled that the director's nerves only showed through the state of his hands. ""His nails were bitten to the stubs,"" Gottlieb said, ""but that was the only manifestation of his nerves. Steven knew he needed to lead by example. That meant concentrating on his job and keeping his cool even when everything around him was going to hell.""
That ""hell"" included not just the malfunctioning sharks, but the cast's off-screen tensions. Robert Shaw, cast as grizzled fisherman Quint, frequently clashed with Richard Dreyfuss, who played oceanographer Matt Hooper. Their rivalry, sometimes fuelled by alcohol, added a layer of real animosity to their performances — though at the time, it was yet another stressor on a fraught set.
Shooting at sea was Spielberg's idea. He believed it would lend authenticity, but quickly discovered it made everything harder: lighting was a nightmare, camera equipment malfunctioned, and even simple continuity became a daily challenge thanks to the shifting tides.
The director later admitted that the production seemed doomed from the outset. ""Jaws should never have been made,"" he told Time shortly after the film's release in 1975. ""It was an impossible effort.""
Achieving the impossible
Yet somehow, this effort yielded one of the most influential films of the 20th century. Upon release, Jaws shattered box office records, earning USD260.7 million domestically and becoming the highest-grossing film in history at the time.
More importantly, it changed the way Hollywood thought about films. Until Jaws, summer was considered a dumping ground for lower-tier films. Big prestige pictures typically premiered in the fall or winter. But Universal, sensing something special, took a gamble. They released Jaws on June 20, 1975, at the start of summer vacation, and backed it with a then-massive $1.8 million marketing campaign. It paid off — teenagers and families flocked to theatres, and a new formula was born.
""This movie changed cinema, and you still can't go to a summer blockbuster or to the beach without thinking about it,"" said horror filmmaker Eli Roth. ""So much of the language of cinema comes from this film. [Spielberg] created all of it.""
What began as a troubled thriller became the blueprint for modern blockbusters. Without Jaws, there may be no Star Wars, no Jurassic Park, no Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Key to success
""It's a great story of what Steven Spielberg accomplished by surviving what was a nightmare,"" said filmmaker Steven Soderbergh. ""If that person hadn't made it, it probably wouldn't have been made at all. It certainly wouldn't be a classic.""
Even five decades on, the impact of Jaws is undeniable. Jason Blum, founder of horror juggernaut Blumhouse, said it remains a touchstone for emerging filmmakers. ""When directors bring us ideas, Jaws is still referenced as much as any other movie... Even young filmmakers say, 'It's going to be like the shark in Jaws.' That's incredible for a film that's 50 years old.""
Ironically, when the film was first in production, few at Universal expected it to succeed.
""Nobody thought much about it,"" recalled production designer Joe Alves. ""People at Universal were much more excited about this George C Scott film called The Hindenburg.""
Even industry insiders were sceptical. ""Everywhere we went, people treated us with sympathy, like we had some kind of illness,"" joked producer David Brown in an interview weeks before release.
But test screenings told a different story. Audiences shrieked, popcorn flew, and the studio immediately recognised the film's potential. In one fell swoop, Spielberg went from a director on the brink of disaster to the architect of a new cinematic era.
Today, the legacy of Jaws swims through every summer blockbuster. It's a reminder that behind some of cinema's biggest successes lie stories of risk, failure, and sheer determination.
And it all began th a shark that didn't work.

Gulf states on high alert after US strikes Iran,"US
UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait leaders discuss regional implications
Gulf states, home to multiple US military bases, were on high alert on Sunday with their leaders calling on all parties to exercise maximum restraint following US strikes on Iran that raised the possibility of a wider conflict in the region.
Leaders including the United Arab Emirates president, the Emir of Qatar and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who had all hosted Trump last month for a tour of the region, discussed the serious implications of the escalation for international and regional security, the UAE state news agency reported.
Saudi Arabia was on a high-security alert after the US strikes, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Sunday, while Bahrain urged motorists to avoid main roads. Kuwait said its defence council would remain in permanent session, and set up shelters in a ministries complex.
Tehran has previously warned that if it were attacked by the United States, it could target American assets in the region, including US military bases. The country's parliament approved the closure of the Strait of Hormuz , through which around 20% of global oil and gas demand flows.
Bahrain is home to the headquarters of the US Navy's 5th Fleet and there are US bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, as well as in neighbouring Qatar and the UAE. Nuclear authorities in Saudi Arabia and the UAE said they had not detected signs of nuclear contamination following the strikes in Iran.
The US strikes added to airline woes with Singapore Airlines cancelling flights to Dubai and British Airways cancelling flights to and from Dubai and Doha. Airlines have been avoiding flying over large parts of the Middle East, including Iran, Iraq, Syria and Israel, due to ongoing missile exchanges

Eid meat glut leaves butchers jobless,"PK
The few that reopened found no buyers and were forced to shut down again.
The surge of sacrificial meat following Eidul Azha has affected the local meat business, leaving butchers across the district out of work for nearly 25 days.
Even two weeks after the festival, most small and large butcher shops in the city remain closed.
The few that reopened found no buyers and were forced to shut down again.
Butchers had shut their shops nearly ten days before Eid. Since then, many have been unemployed, as residents continue to consume frozen meat stored in refrigerators and deep freezers.
Locals report making a variety of dishes - from curries and pulao to biryani, kebabs, and barbeque - with the stored meat, which they say will last another one to two weeks.
According to Khalid Qureshi, vice president of the Mutton and Beef Retailers Association, even hotels are experiencing a drop in meat consumption. Establishments that previously bought 10kg of meat daily are now purchasing only 4kg.
He also noted that professional beggar families collected meat door-to-door during Eid and sold it cheaply, further hurting the business of legitimate retailers.
Qureshi expects butcher shops to reopen around Thursday, July 3, once the frozen meat in homes runs out.

US attack on Iran: JI announces country-wide protests,"IN
Hafiz Naeem condemns 'open act of hostility', urges Muslim Ummah to unite against Israel, US
Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) has announced that it will carry out protests across the country on Monday (today) against US aggression on Iran.
In a statement on Sunday, JI Ameer Hafiz Naeemur Rehman condemned the US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities as regional tensions escalate, calling the attack an open act of hostility following sustained Israeli support.
The call for protests came as in a dramatic move that threw Washington into the thick of Israel's conflict with Tehran, US President Donald Trump announced on Sunday that American forces had ""obliterated"" Iran's key nuclear sites in a sweeping overnight assault, codenamed 'Midnight Hammer', raising the stakes across an already tinderbox Middle East.
""After backing Israel, Washington has now come out openly. The US aggression is tantamount to destroying global peace,"" he said.
He urged the Muslim Ummah to unite against the actions of both the United States and Israel.
Hafiz Naeem instructed all party cadres and responsible leaders to organise demonstrations nationwide under the slogan ""Down with America"".
""If the US does not immediately halt this war, we will escalate our campaign into a broader national protest movement,"" he warned.
Meanwhile, addressing the Youth Digital Summit in Islamabad, Hafiz Naeem recalled that former US President Donald Trump had claimed they would wait two weeks before taking any action, but he ""broke that promise on the very first day"".
""The United States no longer values moral considerations and speaks only the language of power,"" the JI chief said. ""America's downfall has begun. All conscientious people around the world must unite against oppressors.""
He added that for nearly two years, Israel has been carrying out a massacre of Muslims in Palestine, and that this ongoing brutality must be opposed globally.

The four-day Indo-Pak spat,"PK
The expenditures incurred on military and arms would be best spent upon education and health
Five weeks after the Indo-Pak confrontation, although hostilities have come to an end, the pit and cauldron of doubt and antagonism continues to simmer. War shocks still continue after closure of the four-day spat on 10 May 2025 in the shape of bluff and bluster and propaganda and misinformation.
On the Pakistan side, there continues to be fear and consternation of a replay of something like Sindoor for which pretexts may be discovered or imagined. On the Indian side, a media blitz continues to be spread about the threat of terrorism from Pakistan.
The flare-out between 7 and 10 May of 2025 may have only been four days long but it spewed a plethora of consequences – domestic, regional and international. Both the sides have claimed to gain the upper hand in the conflagration. India declared to have decimated nine terrorist outfits in ""POK"" and after nearly 27 years attacked sites across the international boundary in the Punjab. It also claimed to have struck several air bases with missiles and an AWACS plane parked in the hangers in the Nur Khan Air Base in Rawalpindi-Islamabad which is only about 6 to 7 minutes distance from a nuclear installation.
On the other hand, Pakistan claims to have taken down six Indian jets – three Rafaels, one Sukhoi, one Mirage and one MIG – with the help of Chinese provided J-10C using remotely fired missile PL-15.
Just one day before the commencement of the Paris Air Show, the CEO of Dassault, the manufacturers of multi-role French F-35 jet, declared that the claim of Pakistan to have downed three Indian Rafaels ""is inaccurate"". This claim flies in the face of French intelligence reports confirming the shooting down of the plane as well as the statement in an interview by the Indian defence chief made in the Shangri-La Security Dialogue of admitting the felling of Indian aircraft but refusing to mention the exact number of planes taken down.
The possibility of Chinese military technology having the better of cutting-edge western armaments as shown in the taking down of Rafaels by J-10Cs and PL-15 missiles reverberated throughout the world, denoting a sea change in the geo-strategic scenario particularly in the context of the US-China contest. The balance of power between India and Pakistan, supported and armed by Chinese latest technology, suddenly seemed to have undergone a big change with India having to face an uphill task in case of having to face a two-sided opponent in the shape of Pakistan and China.
The fusion between Chinese ideology and military equipment and Pakistan army strategy and tactics is something of great concern for India.
Another special aspect of the short confrontation was the use of social media war, hysteria and misinformation from both sides. In fact making outlandish claims of Karachi port having been destroyed and an attack on Lahore not only made a mockery of Indian media but indelibly dented the credibility of news emanating from Indian media.
Shivshankar Menon, former Indian high commissioner to Pakistan and former foreign secretary, in an interview with Karan Thapar made a claim typical of Indian mindset , saying, ""Sindoor may not have deterred terrorism in Pakistan and may have only provided a temporary respite since militarism is hard wired into the security structure"" and weltanschauung ""of Pakistan.""
Operation Sindoor, Menon claims, has not deterred terrorism but it has imposed costs for Pakistan to think twice before launching another terror attack. Now it is for India, according to Menon, how best to manage increasing the costs for Pakistan and gains for India.
Adil Shah of Georgetown University, USA, has averred that Sindoor did not deter Pakistan but rather emboldened it by giving it the impression of victory.
Trump's effort at bringing about a ceasefire between India and Pakistan to prevent the situation from escalating into a non-conventional nuclear flare-out has led to two consequences. Trump has reiterated on several occasions that he was responsible for effecting a ceasefire between the two South Asian neighbours and that he could bring about a solution to the Kashmir dispute.
American efforts in the Indo-Pak spat has led to the internationalisation of Kashmir dispute much to the chagrin of India which insists that the Kashmir dispute could only be resolved through bilateral measures. Trump's attempt has also led to the rehyphenation of India and Pakistan after several years of dehyphenation of US relations vis a vis the two South Asian opponents.
The May 2025 flare-out makes it all the more essential to bring an end to confrontation between India and Pakistan since another such occurrence could go out of hand due to escalation or accident. There is paramount need therefore for detente, peace and deterrence of confrontation between the two neighbours who suffer from similar problems of poverty, shelter, potable water and lack of health cover.
The expenditures incurred on military and arms would be best spent upon education and health. In this day and age, two poor countries to be in possession of nuclear capabilities and increasing expenditures on ever advanced arms and armaments is a self-defeating policy depriving millions of the basic essentials of a civilised life.

US attack: unravelling Iran's 75 years of work,"US
Iran also allowed the IAEA full monitoring access to its nuclear sites
Iran's nuclear programme, which began in the 1950s with the help of the United States, is a tale of immense financial and human sacrifices. Ironically, the very country that helped Tehran launch it now appears determined to destroy it nearly 75 years later.
During the Pahlavi dynasty in the 1970s, the programme expanded with the installation of nuclear power reactors. However, after the 1979 Iranian Revolution, the programme was halted, and the US imposed its first economic sanctions.
In the 1990s, suspicions arose in the international community that Iran was secretly developing nuclear weapons. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducted its first inspection in 2003, uncovering Iran's nuclear activities.
In 2006, permanent members of the UN Security Council and Germany initiated talks with Iran. This resulted in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), under which Iran agreed to limit uranium enrichment to 3.67% and reduce its enriched uranium stockpile.
Iran also allowed the IAEA full monitoring access to its nuclear sites, and the agency confirmed Iran's transparency until 2015.
In 2018, the United States — under President Donald Trump — withdrew from the deal, prompting Iran to gradually resume uranium enrichment. After 2021, enrichment levels reached 60%. Between 2021 and 2025, the IAEA expressed doubts and concerns over Iran's lack of cooperation.
In early 2025, a new diplomatic effort began to revive the agreement. Five rounds of negotiations were held, with a sixth round scheduled from June 1315 in Oman.
On June 12, the IAEA reported that Iran was close to reaching a nuclear breakout point.
The next day, June 13, Israel launched an attack on Iran, killing six nuclear scientists, the Iranian army chief, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) commander, and the aerospace commander.
In total, over fifteen Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed in recent Israeli attacks.
Two generals, the IRGC deputy intelligence chief, and a deputy commander were also killed.
Previously, in 2009, Iranian nuclear scientist Dr Masoud Mohammadi was assassinated. In 2010, Dr Majid Shahriari was also killed. In 2011, Dariush Rezaeinejad lost his life, and in 2020, the mastermind of Iran's nuclear programme, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was assassinated.
According to foreign news agencies, Iran has six major nuclear facilities across different cities.
Natanz and Fordow are used for uranium enrichment. Arak had a heavy water reactor, which was attacked by Israel on June 19. Bushehr is Iran's only nuclear power plant; Isfahan has a uranium conversion center while Lashkarabad hosts a nuclear experimental center.
Iran's nuclear facilities have also been targeted by multiple cyber and physical attacks.
In 2010, the Stuxnet virus damaged centrifuges at Natanz. In 2020, an explosion occurred at Natanz, which Iran termed sabotage. In 2021, another attack disrupted its power system. Iran has consistently blamed Israel for these attacks.

Tens of thousands join pro-Palestinian marches,"US
Thousands also gathered outside a French trade fair near Paris attended by Israeli defence firms
Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in European cities calling for an end to the war in Gaza.
In London, AFP journalists saw tens of thousands of protesters, who waved Palestinian flags as they marched through the British capital clad in keffiyeh scarves.
In Berlin, more than 10,000 people gathered in the centre of the city in support of Gaza, according to police figures.
And in the Swiss capital Bern, march organisers estimated that 20,000 people rallied in front of the national parliament, urging the government to back a ceasefire.
Thousands also gathered outside a French trade fair near Paris attended by Israeli defence firms, calling for an end to war profiteering and Israel's offensive in Gaza.
There have been monthly protests in the British capital since the start of the 20-month-long war between Israel and Hamas, which has ravaged Gaza.
Protesters carried signs including ""Stop arming Israel"" and ""No war on Iran"" as they marched in the sweltering heat.
""It's important to remember that people are suffering in Gaza. I fear all the focus will be on Iran now,"" said 34-year-old Harry Baker.
""I don't have great love for the Iranian regime, but we are now in a dangerous situation,"" he said, adding that this was his third pro-Palestinian protest.
Gaza is suffering from famine-like conditions according to UN agencies in the region following an Israeli aid blockade.
Gaza's civil defence agency has reported that hundreds have been killed by Israeli forces while trying to reach the US- and Israeli-backed aid distribution sites.
""People need to keep their eyes on Gaza. That's where the genocide is happening,"" said 60-year-old protester Nicky Marcus.
In Berlin, demonstrators gathered mid-afternoon close to the parliament, some chanting ""Germany finances, Israel bombs"".
""You can't sit on the sofa and be silent. Now is the time when we all need to speak up,"" said protester Gundula, who did not want to give her second name.
For Marwan Radwan, the point of the protest was to bring attention to the ""genocide currently taking place"" and the ""dirty work"" being done by the German government.
In Bern, demonstrators carried banners calling on the federal government to intervene in the war in Gaza, expressing solidarity with Palestinians.
The rally there was called by organisations including Amnesty International, the Social Democratic Party, the Greens and the Swiss Trade Union Federation.
Slogans included ""Stop the occupation"", ""Stop the starvation, stop the violence"", and ""Right to self-determination"".
Some marchers chanted: ""We are all the children of Gaza""

World reacts to strikes as 'dangerous escalation',"US
Russia calls US bombing 'irresponsible'; China urges all parties to cease fire
The reaction of international community poured in after the United States struck three nuclear sites in Iran on Sunday, with majority of the world leaders condemning the attack and calling for de-escalation.
The European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas called for de-escalation and a return to negotiations.
""I urge all sides to step back, return to the negotiating table and prevent further escalation,"" Kallas wrote on X, adding that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and that EU foreign ministers would discuss the situation Monday.
Russia 'strongly condemned' the bombings, calling them 'irresponsible' and a 'gross violation of international law'.
""A dangerous escalation has begun, fraught with further undermining of regional and global security,"" the Russian foreign ministry added.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the strikes a ""dangerous escalation in a region already on the edge"".
""There is no military solution. The only path forward is diplomacy. The only hope is peace,"" Guterres said in a statement.
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called on Iran to ""return to the negotiating table and reach a diplomatic solution to end this crisis"".
""Iran can never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon and the US has taken action to alleviate that threat,"" Starmer said on X, adding that ""stability in the region is a priority"".
French President Emmanuel Macron has called a meeting of the country's defence council for Sunday, with his office saying he had spoken with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Oman on Sunday.
France is urging ""all parties to exercise restraint to avoid any escalation that could lead to an extension of the conflict"", Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot posted on X.
China's foreign ministry said it ""strongly condemns"" the US strikes, warning that they ""escalate tensions in the Middle East"".
""China calls on all parties to the conflict, especially Israel, to cease fire as soon as possible,"" the ministry said.
Pope Leo XIV said after the strikes that ""humanity is crying out for peace"" and called for an end to all wars.
""Each member of the international community has the moral responsibility to end the tragedy of war, before it becomes an irreparable chasm,"" Leo said during his weekly Angelus prayer at the Vatican.
Saudi Arabia expressed ""great concern"" after the strikes on its neighbour, the ""sisterly Islamic Republic of Iran"".
""The Kingdom underscores the need to exert all possible efforts to exercise restraint, de-escalate tensions, and avoid further escalation,"" the foreign ministry posted on X.
Pakistan, the only nuclear-armed Muslim country and a longtime Washington ally, said the US attacks ""violate all norms of international law"".
""We are gravely concerned at the possible further escalation of tensions in the region,"" Pakistan's foreign ministry said, adding that Iran had the ""right to defend itself under the UN Charter"".
The Palestinian militant group Hamas condemned the ""blatant US aggression against the territory and sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of Iran"".
""This brutal aggression is a dangerous escalation,"" Hamas said, calling the attack ""a flagrant violation of international law, and a direct threat to international peace and security"".

Iran's N-sites hit as US inserts itself into war,"US
World awaits Tehran's reply; Washington asks Tehran to avoid retaliation; Pakistan, China, Russia push ceasefire
The world awaited Iran's response on Sunday after President Donald Trump announced the US had ""obliterated"" Tehran's key nuclear sites, joining Israel in the biggest Western military action against the country since its 1979 revolution.
Tehran has so far not followed through on its threats of retaliation against the United States – either by targeting US bases or trying to choke off global oil supplies – but that may not hold. Speaking in Istanbul, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said his country would consider all possible responses.
With the damage visible from space after 30,000-pound US bunker-buster bombs crashed into the mountain above Iran's Fordow nuclear site, Tehran vowed to defend itself at all costs. It fired another volley of missiles at Israel that wounded scores of people and flattened buildings in Tel Aviv.
An advisory from the US Department of Homeland Security warned of a ""heightened threat environment in the United States"". The US State Department ordered employees' family members to leave Lebanon and advised citizens elsewhere in the region to keep a low profile or restrict travel.
""There would be no return to diplomacy until it had retaliated, Araghchi said. ""The US showed they have no respect for international law. They only understand the language of threat and force,"" he added. later, Araghchi arrived in Moscow to consult with President Vladimir Putin, Iran's Nour News said.
Separately, in a post on X, Araghchi said Israel had derailed nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington with its initial strikes on June 13, while the US strikes on Sunday did the same to negotiations with European powers held this week.
Addressing European calls for Iran to return to negotiations, he asked: ""How can Iran return to something it never left?"" Later at a news conference in Istanbul, he said the United States and Israel had crossed a ""big red line"" by attacking Iran's nuclear sites.
Ali Shamkhani, an adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on X that the initiative was ""now with the side that plays smart, avoids blind strikes. Surprises will continue!"" he said, hours after Trump announced the strikes in a televised address.
Earlier, Trump said the US carried out a ""very successful attack on the three nuclear sites in Iran"", referring to Isfahan, Natanz and the underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordow. ""A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site,"" Fordo, he said in a post on his Truth Social platform.
Iranian media also said the Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites were hit. US Joint Chiefs Chairman Dan Caine said seven B-2 stealth bombers flew 18 hours from mainland America to Iran, with multiple aerial refuellings, to carry out the attack.
""Iran's fighters did not fly, and it appears that Iran's surface to air missile systems did not see us throughout the mission. We retained the element of surprise,"" he said. Trump said that Iran ""must now agree to end this war"", insisting that under no circumstances should Iran possess a nuclear weapon.
Trump called the strikes ""a spectacular military success"" and boasted that Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities had been ""completely and totally obliterated."" However, his own officials gave more nuanced assessments.
With the exception of satellite photographs appearing to show craters on the mountain above Iran's subterranean plant at Fordow, there has been no public accounting of the damage. The UN nuclear watchdog said no increases in off-site radiation levels had been reported after the US strikes.
Rafael Grossi, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) director general, told CNN that it was not yet possible to assess the damage done underground. A senior Iranian source told Reuters that most of the highly enriched uranium at Fordow had been moved elsewhere before the attack. The IAEA also said entrances to tunnels at Isfahan site hit by US strike.
Trump immediately called on Iran to forgo any retaliation, saying the government ""must now make peace [and] if they do not, future attacks would be far greater and a lot easier,"" he said. His Vice President, JD Vance, said Washington was not at war with Iran but with its nuclear programme.
At a pentagon briefing, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters that the president authorised a precision operation to neutralise the threats posed by the Iranian nuclear programme. ""This mission was not and has not been about regime change,"" Hegseth said.
In a step towards what is widely seen as Iran's most effective threat to hurt the West, its parliament approved a move to close the Strait of Hormuz. Nearly a quarter of global oil shipments pass through the narrow waters that Iran shares with Oman and the United Arab Emirates.
Iran's Press TV said closing the strait would require approval from the Supreme National Security Council. Security experts have long warned a weakened Iran could also find other unconventional ways to strike back, such as bombings or cyberattacks.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in an interview on ""Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,"" warned Iran against retaliation for the US strikes, saying such action would be ""the worst mistake they've ever made.""
Rubio separately told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" talk show that the US has ""other targets we can hit, but we achieved our objective."" ""There are no planned military operations right now against Iran,"" he later added, ""unless they mess around.""
The UN Security Council (UNSC) was due to meet later on Sunday, diplomats said, at the request of Iran, which urged the 15-member body ""to address this blatant and unlawful act of [US] aggression, to condemn it in the strongest possible terms.""
At the UNSC, Pakistan, China and Russia have proposed the 15-member body adopt a resolution, calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Middle East. However, it was not immediately clear when it could be put to a vote.
The three countries circulated the draft text, said diplomats, and asked members to share their comments by Monday. The US is likely to oppose the draft resolution, seen by Reuters, which condemns attacks on Iran's nuclear sites and facilities. The text does not name the United States or Israel.
Iranian authorities said that more than 400 people have been killed since Israel's attacks began, mostly civilians. Iran has been launching missiles back at Israel, killing at least 24 people over the past nine days, the first time its projectiles have penetrated Israel's defences in large numbers.
The elite Revolutionary Guards said on Sunday they had fired 40 missiles, including multi-warhead Kheibarshekan ballistic missiles, at Israel in the latest volley. Air raid sirens sounded across most of Israel on Sunday, sending millions of people to safe rooms.
Iran's armed forces said they targeted multiple sites in Israel, including Ben Gurion airport, after the US attacks. The targets also included a ""biological research"" facility, logistics bases, and various layers of command and control centres, it said.
IRNA news agency said 40 missiles were fired in Iran's ""20th wave"" of strikes. At least 23 people were wounded and police said at least three impacts were reported. ""Houses here were hit very, very badly,"" said Tel Aviv mayor Ron Huldai.
The Israeli military said it had launched its own fresh waves of strikes in western Iran and in Qom, south of Tehran. It later said its ""jets struck dozens of military targets throughout Iran"", including a long-range missile site in Yazd in the centre of the country for the first time.
IRNA reported four Revolutionary Guard members were killed in strikes on a military base in the north of the city. Iran's Shargh newspaper reported a ""massive explosion was heard"" on Sunday in Bushehr province, home to Iran's only nuclear power plant.
