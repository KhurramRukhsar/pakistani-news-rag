Govt opens special children's rehab centre,"US
CM announces Inclusive City project for people with special needs
Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Monday inaugurated a rehabilitation centre for children with physical and neurological developmental challenges.
The facility was established through collaboration between Marie Adelaide Leprosy Centre (MALC), the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities (DEPD), and the government.
The inauguration event was attended by DEPD Secretary Taha Ahmed Farooqi, German Consul General Dr Rüdiger Lotz, Global Health Advisor German Leprosy and TB Relief Association (GLRA) Dr Anil Fasstino, and MALC CEO Mervyn Francis, among other notable figures.
Calling the centre a beacon of hope for children with conditions such as autism and Down Syndrome, as well as other physical and neurological challenges, the CM expressed that the government's vision is to provide treatment and opportunities to these children so they may live dignified and fulfilling lives.
CM Shah revealed that the centre offers a comprehensive range of services provided by specialists. These include physiotherapy to improve children's physical development, speech therapy to enhance communication, remedial therapy to support cognitive development, behavioural therapy for encouraging constructive behavior, occupational therapy focusing on daily life skills, and a sensory room to help the children with sensory processing.

Meanwhile, responding to a question, CM Shah stated that the provincial budget would be presented on June 13, 2025, with special attention given to the agriculture sector. Further, he urged provincial representation on the boards of K-Electric (KE), and other power distribution companies, so that Sindh's consumers may directly benefit.
He also stated the government wants to run Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO) and Sukkur Electric Power Company (SEPCO) under a public-private partnership model.
The CM revealed that discussions with the federal government on the matter are ongoing, and while progress is being made, results will take time.

Ukraine's deep strike,"US
Ukraine has shown that it can strike not just at military outposts near the frontlines.
In what may prove a turning point in Europe's largest war since 1945, Ukraine has launched its boldest attack yet — striking four Russian air bases, including one deep in Siberia. Using 117 drones in a meticulously coordinated operation, Kyiv claims to have damaged or destroyed 40 aircraft — nearly a third of Russia's strategic bombers. The sheer scale, distance and success of the strike mark a significant escalation.
Dubbed 'Operation Spiderweb', the attack is being compared by some to Pearl Harbor. Russia's belief in its own territorial invincibility has been pierced.
Ukraine has shown that it can strike not just at military outposts near the frontlines, but at the core of Moscow's strategic depth. This comes just a day before long-stalled peace talks resumed in Istanbul — a calculated message from Kyiv.
President Volodymyr Zelensky has made clear that peace cannot come at the price of rewarding Russian aggression. Ukraine's readiness to strike so far behind enemy lines gives it new leverage, and changes the tone of negotiations.
Kyiv enters not as a weakened party seeking compromise, but as a state still very much in control of its military capabilities. But this also raises the stakes - for everyone.
The world must now confront the fact that the war may not wind down so easily. It is evolving. And with every evolution comes the risk of a wider, more unpredictable conflict.
If Russia chooses to respond with escalation, especially with the support of allies like Iran or North Korea, the fallout may not remain confined to Eastern Europe. Ukraine's attack may not end the war. But it has ended the illusion that this conflict can be managed through patience alone.

'Game of Thrones' star Liam Cunningham sets sail for Gaza,"US
Actor joins Greta Thunberg and others to release aid
Irish actor Liam Cunningham, 64, famous for playing Davos Seaworth in HBO's Game of Thrones series, has announced that he will be joining 11 activists in their attempt to break the Israeli siege on Gaza. Cunningham has been vocal in his support for Palestine since the Israeli bombings began in 2023, and he is joined in the cause by Greta Thunberg, a renowned Swedish climate activist. Member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan will also be accompanying the group.
The group set sail on Sunday on the boat Madleen, operated by the Freedom Flotilla Coalition (FFC). The journey is expected to take seven days if they are not hindered. As reported previously by Al Jazeera, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition had attempted to sail the vessel Conscience in early May, but it was attacked by Israeli drones while passing through Maltese waters.
Cunningham has been documenting and sharing their progress on social media.
According to a press release by the FFC, the boat is named Madleen after Gaza's first and only fisherwoman in 2014, symbolising the ""unyielding spirit of Palestinian resilience and the growing global resistance to Israel's use of collective punishment and deliberate starvation policies.""
In a press release on the UN Office of Human Rights Commission website, experts called for safe passage for the Freedom Flotilla Coalition's ship carrying essential aid supplies to Gaza. They expressed concern for Israel's disregard for international laws and its constant attacks on humanitarian aid workers.
""Aid is desperately needed for the people of Gaza to forestall annihilation, and this initiative is a symbolic and powerful effort to deliver it. Israel should remember that the world is watching closely and refrain from any act of hostility against the Freedom Flotilla Coalition and its passengers,"" the experts said.
""The people of Gaza have the right to receive aid through their own territorial waters even under occupation, and the Coalition ship has the right to free passage in international waters to reach the people of Gaza,"" they said. ""Israel must not interfere with its freedom of navigation, long recognised under international law.""
Call for solidarity
Another Irish supporter of Palestine who made news this week is the Irish MMA Fighter Paddy McCorry, who shouted ""Free Palestine"" while tackling his Israeli opponent, Shuki Farage, in an act of solidarity with Gaza on Saturday. This event happened at the Cage Warriors 189 event in Rome, Italy, where he also raised the Palestinian Flag after his win. He shared the viral clip of this win and captioned it ""Street justice"".
According to the UN World Food Program, more than 70,000 children and 17,000 women in Gaza need urgent treatment for acute malnutrition. They state on their website that ""more than 116,000 metric tons of food assistance – enough to feed 1 million people for up to 4 months – is ready to be brought into Gaza if the blockade is lifted.""
Earlier, actors, musicians, activists and other public figures wrote a letter calling on Prime Minister Keir Starmer to ""end the UK's complicity in the horrors in Gaza"".
British-Albanian pop sensation Dua Lipa has been vocal about the war in Gaza and last year criticised Israel's offensive as a ""genocide"".
Other signatories include actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Tilda Swinton and Riz Ahmed, and musicians Paloma Faith, Annie Lennox and Massive Attack.

Buoyed projections?,"US
Inflation is being seen at 7.5%
The government's projection of an exalted growth rate of 4.2% for the next fiscal year has made jaws drop. On what premise it is so confident is hard to guess, but the ground realities suggest a dismal picture. The beleaguered dispensation is pinning its hopes on tight monetary control and effective management of the economy – but that is no small task.
All the projected targets for the ongoing fiscal year were missed as the economy achieved 2.68% growth as against the projected 3.6%. The agrarian sector merely posted 0.56% growth and the country is now on the verge of importing grains. So are the pathetic statistics with industry and other plum portfolios.
The euphoria seems based on the sole achievement that the economy has swelled to $411 billion with a per capita income rise to $1,824. Likewise, the services, transport, storage, construction, information and communication sectors have managed moderate upward trends. All this seems to have encouraged the government to propose new growth targets of 4.4% in commodity-producing sectors; 4.5% in agriculture sector, 3.5% in LSM and 3% in mining.
Inflation is being seen at 7.5%. But there is a surprising squeeze too that the government is eyeing: the construction sector which grew by 6.6% this year is targeted at only 3.8%. So is the case with electricity, gas and water supply sectors that are nourished by 29% this year, but are projected to grow by only 3.5% next year. This is untenable and what crosscurrents they will leave behind is another enigma of sorts.
On the international front, there is a tight-walking for the government as the IMF is too inquisitive, having almost torpedoed the plans on crypto, and insisting on tax collection to be raised to Rs16 trillion. On the other hand, the Planning Commission says it has only left with Rs880 billion and only high-priority developmental projects will see the light of the day.
The rare hope-line is the largesse of the ABD which has doled out $800 million to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management programmes.

Aus confirm Pakistan tour in 2026,"US
Todd Greenberg backed Pakistani players for the upcoming BBL
Cricket Australia (CA) is gearing up for a white-ball series tour to Pakistan, scheduled for early next year, signaling a positive step towards strengthening cricketing ties between the two nations.
During an online press conference, CA CEO Todd Greenberg conveyed his positive outlook on the upcoming tour, emphasising the significance of the series against Pakistan and the ongoing collaboration between the two cricket boards.
""I believe it will be another good tour of Pakistan. The series against Pakistan is an important part of our schedule. There has been good communication between Pakistan and Australia regarding both red-ball and white-ball series,"" Greenberg said.
""We need to look for more opportunities for series, which we will definitely do,"" he added.
Looking back on the 2022 tour, Greenberg expressed enthusiasm about future matches in Pakistan.
""We would like to play a series in Pakistan. In 2022, we toured Pakistan after a long gap, and the tour was very successful. The Australian team received a warm welcome. It would be great if such series continue to happen.""
Greenberg emphasised the league's commitment to bringing in talent from Pakistan, recognising the popularity of Pakistani players among fans, and explained the mutual benefits of such participation.
""There is no doubt that Pakistani players are very popular within the community. Our effort is to attract players from all over the world for the BBL,"" he said.
""If leading Pakistani players come, they will definitely enjoy it here. The league will benefit greatly from these top players for their teams and franchises,"" he added.
Regarding player participation, Greenberg confirmed, ""I hope we will definitely attract some players for the next edition of the BBL.""
It is pertinent to mention that Pakistan last toured Australia in November 2024 for a white-ball series.
Under Mohammad Rizwan's captaincy, the Men in Green secured a historic 2-1 victory in the ODI series - their first series win in Australia since 2002.
However, Australia bounced back strongly, winning the subsequent T20I series 3-0.
For the unversed, according to the Future Tours Programme (FTP) for 202527, Australia are expected to tour Pakistan for a white-ball series featuring three ODIs and three T20Is in FebruaryMarch.
White-ball camp
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has summoned 22 top white-ball performers for a camp, including the senior trio of Babar Azam, Mohammad Rizwan and Shaheen Shah Afridi on Monday.
According to the details, the shortlisted 22 players will report for the camp here in three groups, scheduled to be held on June 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
During the camp, the PCB will inform the players about the future course of action, while their fitness and respective performances will also be analysed.
Sources further suggested that senior players will participate in all three training sessions, which will also feature the top performers of the recently concluded Pakistan Super League (PSL) 10.
Furthermore, Pakistan's white-ball head coach Mike Hesson will meet with top performers and will update them regarding the future course of action.
Players called up for training camp: Babar Azam, Usman Khan, Saud Shakeel, Shahid Aziz, Abbas Afridi, Salman Mirza, Mir Hamza, Abdullah Shafique, Khawaja Nafay, Haider Ali, Ahmed Daniyal, Mehran Mumtaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Khurram Shahzad, Mohammad Rizwan, Maaz Sadaqat, Mohammad Nawaz, Aamir Jamal, Naseem Shah, Sufiyan Muqeem, Ali Raza and Tayyab Tahir.
For the unversed, Pakistan's white-ball entered a new era under the leadership of former New Zealand head coach Hesson.
The 50-year-old had an ideal start to his tenure as the green shirts registered a 3-0 T20I series whitewash against Bangladesh, which also marked their first series triumph at home since December 2021.
Following the drought-ending series victory over Bangladesh, Pakistan are scheduled for a brief break before touring back to Bangladesh next month for a potential three-match T20I series.

MrBeast hits 400 million subscribers on YouTube,"US
Content creator thanks platform, fans on X
MrBeast has reached a new milestone on YouTube by surpassing 400 million subscribers. Celebrating the feat on X (formerly Twitter), he wrote, ""400,000,000 subscribers! A decade ago, before I blew up, everyone in my life told me I was too obsessed and constantly told me that I'd never make it.""
The YouTuber added that his passion led him against the criticism. ""Despite that, I was in love with making content and grinded every moment my eyes were open for seven years before anyone started watching. I literally told my mom I'd rather be homeless than do anything else.""
Grateful to the platform and his subscribers, he said, ""The greatest gift in life is being able to wake up everyday with a purpose and thanks to YouTube and you guys, I have that. Thanks for 400M.""
No other channels on the platform are even close to the number. To put into perspective, Pewdiepie and T-Series – who had the popular online race to 100 million subscribers back in 2019, which the Indian music company won – are at 110 million and 295 million subscribers respectively.
In 2023, MrBeast expressed his desire to break T-Series' record of subscribers – with MrBeast at 125 million subscribers and T-Series at 230 million then. He broke the record in 2024, becoming the most subscribed YouTuber on the platform.
MrBeast, born James Stephen ""Jimmy"" Donaldson, joined YouTube in 2012 by posting gaming content and trying other formats. Flashforward to a 2017 video, he counted down to 100,000, which became his gateway to fame. The video currently has almost 32 million views.
Since then, the YouTuber became known for his extravagant challenges and large-scale giveaways. In 2024, he premiered his own version of Netflix's Squid Game, called Beast Games on Amazon's Prime Video. The 10-episode competition series featured 1,000 players and set a grand prize of $5,000,000.
Later, a lawsuit was filed against the content creator and his production company on behalf of five unnamed contestants, as per Variety. The lawsuit alleged that the show failed to provide basic necessities such as medical care, food, and sleep to the participants, adding that they were not paid minimum wage for their overtime involvement and were subjected to ""dangerous circumstances and conditions.""
In response, MrBeast wrote on X, ""We have tons of behind-the-scenes footage dropping when the series does to show how these claims were blown out of proportion. Just can't release it now because it would spoil the games.""
The show scored a 5.7 rating on IMDb and a 20 per cent score on Rotten Tomatoes, with viewers remarking that it exploited underprivileged participants for entertainment and missed the point of Squid Game.

Gold inches up as global market cools,"US
Safe-haven edges up Rs1,000 to Rs354,100 on US-China pullback; rupee slips 14 paisa to 282.11/$
Gold price inflation in Pakistan slowed on Tuesday and recorded a marginal increase, mirroring global market trends where the precious metal retreated after reaching a near four-week high as investors turned cautious ahead of a possible phone call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.
In the domestic market, the price of gold rose by Rs1,000 per tola, settling at Rs354,100, while the 10-gram rate climbed by Rs857 to Rs303,583, according to the All-Pakistan Gems and Jewellers Sarafa Association (APGJSA). This followed a sharp increase of Rs5,900 per tola on Monday when prices had touched Rs353,100.
Internationally, gold fell over 1% on Tuesday after hitting a near four-week high, pressured by a firmer dollar as investors grew cautious ahead of a potential call between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, according to Reuters.
Spot gold fell 1.1% to $3,340.79 an ounce as of 1421 GMT, after hitting its highest since May 8 earlier in the session. US gold futures eased 0.9% to $3,365.90.
""We are moving into this period that is well known to be the summer doldrums, so there's an expectation that the gold market could fall into a bit of a lull or a sideways consolidation,"" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures.
Markets are on edge ahead of a likely Trump-Xi call this week, after Trump accused China of violating an agreement to roll back tariffs. The talks come as trade tensions between the world's two largest economies continue to simmer.
Adnan Agar, Director at Interactive Commodities, noted that gold touched an intraday high of $3,387 and a low of $3,333 before stabilising around $3,350. ""After yesterday's strong $90 move, some profit-taking emerged today. The price reversed near $3,400, failing to break that level, and fell to $3,333,"" Agar said.
He added that if the market closes below the $3,340-$3,345 range, it could test the $3,300 level again. Conversely, a break above $3,400 could push prices toward $3,420 or even $3,440 in the near term.
Meanwhile, the range-bound Pakistani rupee registered a slight decline against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Tuesday, slipping by 0.05%.
The local currency closed at 282.11, down by 14 paisas from Monday's closing rate of 281.97, according to the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).
Globally, the US dollar fell to a six-week low on Tuesday amid growing concerns over the US economy, as the ongoing trade war under President Donald Trump's administration continues to take a toll on economic sentiment. The dollar rose 0.5% from an over-a-month low hit earlier in the session, making gold costlier for foreign buyers.

Securing our national security through economic stability,"US
Further challenges include ongoing energy shortages and poor infrastructure.
The recent hostilities with India highlight why a comprehensive and resilient security framework is crucial for Pakistan — not only to protect our borders but also having a strong economy capable of supporting and protecting its people.
At the core of Pakistan's national security should be economic stability, an area where historically we have fallen short. Our economy faces several significant challenges that leave us vulnerable, both domestically and internationally.
High levels of debt, budget deficits, and energy crises have weakened our economic development. These challenges force us to rely heavily on international loans, making us susceptible to external influences, which limits our ability to act independently, especially in times of conflict.
Currently, Pakistan's external debt has reached concerning levels — approximately 80% of our total economic output. This means we frequently have to borrow more money simply to repay old loans, creating a cycle of financial instability.
Meanwhile, limited tax collection and widespread tax avoidance lead to continuous budget shortfalls, leaving insufficient funds for essential areas like infrastructure, education, healthcare, and defence. Such financial weakness directly impacts our national security, limiting our options and weakening public trust.
Moreover, rising prices and a weakening currency have been hitting ordinary citizens hard. High inflation, particularly in essential goods like food and fuel, increases public frustration and weakens our internal unity, which is vital during crises.
Further challenges include ongoing energy shortages and poor infrastructure, hindering industrial productivity and economic growth. These problems prevent Pakistan from effectively participating in global markets, limiting job creation and opportunities for our youth. This has led to high levels of youth unemployment, creating further frustration among the younger generation.
However, these challenges also offer an opportunity for reform. To strengthen our national security, Pakistan urgently needs to implement economic reforms.
First, we must practice disciplined financial management, expand our tax base, and improve transparency in government finances. Enhancing tax collection through technology and digital systems can increase government revenues, reducing our dependency on external loans.
Addressing our trade imbalance is also crucial. We should focus on increasing exports and reducing dependency on imports by developing local industries and agriculture. This approach can help build foreign exchange reserves, essential for maintaining our economic independence.
Additionally, investing in renewable and sustainable energy sources and infrastructure is vital. Renewable energy will reduce our energy crisis, lower costs, attract investments, and help our industries grow. Infrastructure improvements through public-private partnerships can further support economic growth, enhancing our overall national cohesion.
Effective governance is another area that needs urgent attention. Reducing corruption and improving accountability through digital governance and stronger institutions will increase public confidence and attract both local and international investments. Strong governance ensures a stable economy, directly benefiting national security.
Above all, investment in human development is key to long-term stability. By increasing investment in education, healthcare, and skills training, we build a workforce ready for future challenges.
Future-ready universities equipped with advanced technologies like AI and blockchain can significantly enhance our human capital. These universities can nurture critical thinking, innovative problem-solving, and technical skills, preparing our youth not only for today's job market but also for the jobs of tomorrow.
Pakistan's national security depends greatly on our economic strength. Our leaders must recognise that real national security is achieved when every citizen has equal opportunities, access to quality education, healthcare, and employment.
Embracing reforms, particularly those focused on human development through advanced universities and modern technologies will not only secure our economic future but also protect our national sovereignty.

Pilgrims warned of high temperatures,"US
Saudi hosts urge them to stay indoors during Hajj high point
Saudi authorities have asked pilgrims performing the Hajj to remain in their tents for several hours during the high point of this week's pilgrimage, citing high temperatures.
According to a report in Saudi media, Hajj Minister Tawfiq al-Rabiah has requested that pilgrims refrain from leaving their tents between 10:00am and 4:00pm on Thursday.
The ""Day of Arafat"" traditionally marks the high point of the hajj, when pilgrims scale Mount Arafat on the outskirts of Makkah.
There, pilgrims assemble on the 70-metre (230-foot) high hill and its surrounding plain for hours of prayer and the holy Quran recital, staying there until the evening.
There is little to no shade on Mount Arafat, leaving pilgrims directly exposed to the harsh desert sun for hours.
""We warn against climbing mountains or high places on the Day of Arafat, as it causes extreme physical exertion and increases the risk of heat exhaustion,"" the health ministry said in a separate statement published by Saudi media.
Temperatures this year are forecast to exceed 40 degrees Celsius as one of the world's largest annual religious gatherings, bringing together devotees from around the globe, gets under way on Wednesday.
Officials have beefed up heat mitigation measures hoping to avoid a repeat of last year's hajj, which saw 1,301 pilgrims die as temperatures reached 51.8 degrees Celsius (125.2 Fahrenheit).
This year, authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024.
Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres (12 acres), thousands more medics will be on standby, and more than 400 cooling units will be deployed, the Hajj minister told AFP last week.
As of Sunday, more than 1.4 million pilgrims had arrived in Saudi Arabia for the pilgrimage, officials said. AFP

Muneeb preaches kindness to animals this Eidul Azha,"US
Actor raises awareness on camel being pelted by kids
In a recent Instagram Story, Muneeb Butt shared a video clip of a camel hastily fleeing a busy neighbourhood. ""Yes, this happened yesterday,"" Muneeb wrote, adding that he checked the CCTV footage to confirm what happened prior to the escape.
""Some kids were throwing little stones at this poor animal. He broke his cord and ran,"" he explained. With Eidul Azha just around the corner, the Shiddat actor implored, ""Please, teach your kids how to interact with sacrificial animals.""
Netizens nodded along to Muneeb's statement, agreeing on the importance of treating animals with respect and kindness prior to the slaughter ritual on Eid.
One Instagram user asserted that the sentiment should apply even beyond Eid: ""Not just sacrificial animals, but with all animals. Raise your children with empathy towards the creation of Allah. It breaks my heart when I see children treating these innocent souls brutally."" Another added, ""Parents should teach their kids about animal rights.""
Sacrificial animals have been the talk of the town as of late, since earlier, Alizeh Shah urged netizens to be more sensitive and not share content of animals being slaughtered online.
""Every year, I see so much pain on the roads – blood, fear in the eyes of animals, their cries – and my heart breaks,"" she said, stressing that while animals may not speak, they do have feelings.
""They love, they nurture, they form bonds – just like we do. They were created by the same loving God who created us, and to see them suffer so publicly, often with pictures, jokes, and memes shared on social media – it's something I personally find very difficult to digest,"" she admitted.
Alizeh acknowledged that people's intentions are often pure and reverent when it comes to observing religious sacrifice. She emphasised that she does not oppose the act of sacrifice itself, but instead hopes for some empathy this Eidul Azha.
Requesting her followers to make this Eid more about the spirit of humility, the Taqdeer actor added, ""If it's possible, please be mindful of the images and videos shared online. Some of us are deeply affected by them,"" she wrote. ""Islam teaches mercy, compassion, and dignity – for humans and for animals.""
Alizeh added that anyone is free to disagree with her, but it personally pains her to watch the animals in such a state. ""You may disagree and that's okay. I respect all views,"" she wrote. ""But I had to say this because the silence has been heavy on my heart.""

In the complex and often chaotic theatre of Pakistani politics, few figures have inspired as much devotion and division as Imran Khan. Once hailed as the harbinger of 'Naya Pakistan', his first term in office ended in disappointment and political isolation. Now, from behind bars and under sustained political exclusion, he paradoxically stands as the most popular leader in the country.
But popularity does not equate to power, and even less so to reform. If he is to return to office — not just in name, but in effectiveness — Imran Khan must fundamentally rethink his approach. He must become what he wasn't in his first term: a pragmatic reformer grounded in strategy rather than idealism, and institution-building rather than rhetoric.
His first term (2018-2022) was filled with soaring ambitions but lacked the capacity and discipline to fulfil them. The anti-corruption crusade became tainted by selective accountability. His appointments — notably in Punjab — undermined governance. Economic management was erratic, swinging from populist subsidies to IMF dependency.
Above all, Khan failed to convert his mass appeal into a coherent policy framework capable of reforming Pakistan's entrenched institutions. This inability wasn't just about external conspiracies or establishment betrayals, as he often claimed. It reflected an internal contradiction between his transformative rhetoric and transactional politics.
Imran Khan's current position is more precarious yet also more historically charged than ever. He is no longer the preferred choice of the establishment, whose support was once indispensable to his political rise. The institutional machinery, including the judiciary and civil service, appears aligned against him.
PTI's organisational structure has been dismantled, its leaders jailed, silenced, or coerced into defection. Media coverage is restricted. And yet, his personal popularity continues to soar among a broad and disillusioned public, especially the youth.
This paradox — of a leader loved by millions but isolated from the levers of power — raises a fundamental question: If given another chance, could Imran Khan actually lead the systemic change Pakistan desperately needs?
To do so, he would have to abandon some of the very impulses that defined his first term. The confrontational stance toward the establishment, while politically energising, proved unsustainable. If he returns with the same antagonistic posture, his second government may face the same fate as his first — resistance from powerful institutions and ultimate paralysis.
What he needs instead is not submission, but strategic coexistence. The military remains a stakeholder in Pakistan's statecraft. Rather than wage open war, a better approach would be to negotiate a redefined civil-military relationship within a constitutional framework. This would mean reviving bodies like the National Security Council to institutionalise dialogue and minimise backdoor manipulation, while reasserting parliamentary supremacy through consistent democratic performance, not just moral claims.
Equally important is a complete overhaul of his economic strategy. Khan's past economic governance was marred by indecision, mixed messaging, and policy U-turns. If he wants to stabilise Pakistan's battered economy, he must bring in an empowered, professional economic team with both vision and autonomy.
Reforming the Federal Board of Revenue to expand the tax base, especially targeting under-taxed sectors such as real estate and retail, must become a top priority. International negotiations with lenders like the IMF should be handled transparently and professionally, balancing fiscal discipline with social protection. Economic patriotism must replace elite capture — and that begins not with slogans, but with enforceable reforms.
One of Khan's signature failures was the politicisation of accountability. Institutions like the National Accountability Bureau became perceived tools of political vendetta rather than justice. In his second term, if there is to be one, Imran Khan must establish a credible, independent anti-corruption mechanism.
That would require bipartisan legislation, full transparency in asset declarations across the board, and reforms in the judicial process to fast-track white-collar crime cases. Only when accountability is applied across political and institutional lines can it gain legitimacy in the public eye.
Education and social harmony, often overshadowed by political battles, must also be central to any reform agenda. Khan's attempt to introduce a Single National Curriculum was well-intentioned but shallow in execution. A truly unified national education system must foster critical thinking, civic values, and respect for diversity — not just uniformity of textbooks
. Parallel efforts must target hate speech, sectarian networks, and violent extremism, which continue to corrode Pakistan's social fabric. A peaceful society cannot emerge without inclusive education and active de-radicalisation.
Yet all these reforms, however well-planned, cannot succeed without a complete transformation of leadership style. Khan must govern less like a charismatic crusader and more like a consensus-building statesman. That means empowering his team, tolerating dissent, and abandoning the politics of constant confrontation.
His combative attitude towards political rivals, the judiciary, and even the media during his first term created more enemies than allies. To implement real change, he will need a broad coalition — not of convenience, but of purpose. The art of governance lies not in defeating opponents, but in converting them into stakeholders.
The challenges are immense, but so is the potential. If Khan returns as the same leader who governed from 2018 to 2022, Pakistan may see a repeat of instability, isolation, and unfulfilled promises.
But if he evolves — if he learns from failure, adapts to political realities, and builds bridges instead of burning them — he could still emerge as a transformative figure. Not because he is flawless, but because he may be uniquely positioned, given his popular mandate, to defy the inertia of Pakistan's status quo.
Imran Khan does not need to be a saviour. He needs to be a builder - of institutions, of trust, and of a democratic culture. That will require more than charisma. It will demand patience, humility, and strategy. The question is no longer whether he can return. It is whether, if he does, he can finally deliver.

Pakistan busts German-led global child abuse ring,"US
NCCIA uncovers dark web network operating from Muzaffargarh
Pakistan's National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has unearthed a disturbing international child exploitation network operating from Muzaffargarh, allegedly led by a German national named Renz.
The revelation was made by State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry during a joint press conference in Islamabad on Tuesday, alongside NCCIA Director General Dr Syed Waqaruddin Syed.
According to officials, the network targeted children between the ages of six and ten, most of whom belonged to extremely poor families. A so-called ""children's club"" was reportedly set up as a front to attract victims.
The facility featured advanced equipment, including high-quality cameras, lighting, and recording tools.
Minister Chaudhry revealed that children were initially given money and later blackmailed into exploitation. The videos were filmed in a studio-like environment and sold on the dark web for thousands of dollars per day.
The German suspect is said to have travelled to Pakistan for 28 days, during which he trained local operators and established the setup.
""This was not just a local case. This was an international operation being run from within Pakistan,"" the minister said. ""We have confirmed that this gang was creating and distributing live content globally.""
A major raid was conducted by the NCCIA on May 23, with support from local police and intelligence agencies. The operation led to the rescue of at least six children, who were handed over to the Punjab Child Protection Bureau. In total, more than 50 children were identified as victims.
So far, authorities have registered 178 First Information Reports (FIRs) related to child exploitation. Fourteen individuals have already been sentenced to seven to ten years in prison.
Two suspects linked to this particular case were arrested during the raid, while three remain at large. Efforts are underway to locate and apprehend them.
Some parents of the victims were also found to be complicit in the abuse, either knowingly or by accepting money.
""It is heartbreaking to say that in some cases, even the parents were part of this horrific business,"" said the minister.
The NCCIA acted on intelligence received from the U.S.-based National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Interpol. The agency operates a 24/7 monitoring system and collaborates with international organisations to track and prevent online crimes against children.
Dr Waqaruddin added that hundreds of videos were recovered from the studio, many of which had already been shared via encrypted platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, and later sold on the dark web.
""This is a major breakthrough. It's the first time such a large, organised international network has been exposed and disrupted in Pakistan,"" said the DG. ""We are working closely with Interpol and German authorities to trace and arrest the foreign suspects.""
He also highlighted that Pakistan is now among the 71 countries with access to Interpol's global databases, which has significantly accelerated investigation and international cooperation.
Minister Chaudhry stressed that recent amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) have increased punishments for child exploitation crimes from seven to ten years, to fourteen to twenty years.
The offences are now categorised as non-bailable and non-compoundable.
""We are taking this matter very seriously,"" he said. ""The Prime Minister and Interior Minister have been briefed, and we are seeking funds to expand NCCIA offices across the country. We want a strong cybercrime unit in every district of Pakistan.""
The minister concluded by appealing to the media and civil society to support efforts against online child abuse.
""This is not just the government's fight. It is a fight for our children, our future, and our moral responsibility.""

Rivals Meloni and Macron seek to mend fences,"US
.
Italy's Giorgia Meloni and France's Emmanuel Macron met Tuesday in Rome, seeking to reconcile their differences as they confront common challenges, notably US tariffs and the Ukraine war.
The far-right prime minister welcomed the centrist French president to her Palazzo Chigi office, the pair kissing lightly on the cheek and both smiling.
A guard of honour played both national anthems before the two European rivals headed inside for talks and a dinner, with no plans to speak to the press.
They are not natural political allies, but as the leaders of the EU's second- and third-largest economies, they are both grappling with the fall-out from the war in Ukraine, as well as US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs against the bloc.
Meloni on Friday acknowledged ""divergences"" with Macron but denied she had any ""personal problems"" with him, and said she was ""very happy"" with the visit.
An Italian government source said Rome and Paris hoped to ""lay the foundations for a further strengthening of relations"" between two nations ""on the front line of the various fronts of international politics"".

Kyrgios 'disappointed' after Wimbledon blow,"HK
The Australian has not played at the All England Club since 2022
Nick Kyrgios will miss Wimbledon for a third successive year after another injury setback.
The Australian has not played at the All England Club since reaching his only grand slam singles final in 2022, where he was beaten by Novak Djokovic.
After more than two years on the sidelines with knee and wrist problems, Kyrgios returned at the start of this season but was forced to abandon plans to play doubles at the French Open after suffering another knee injury.
And he has now revealed he will not be able to play in his favourite part of the season, writing on Instagram: ""Just wanted to give everyone a quick update – I've hit a small setback in my recovery and unfortunately won't make it back for grass this year.
""I know how much you've all been looking forward to seeing me out there, and I'm genuinely sorry to disappoint. This is just a bump in the road though, and I'm already working hard to get back stronger than ever.
""Thank you for all your continued support – it means everything to me. See you soon!""
The 30-year-old's career was put in jeopardy by a torn ligament in his wrist in 2023, which required surgery and kept him out for a year and a half.
He finally returned to action in January but admitted after losing to Britain's Jacob Fearnley in the first round of the Australian Open that he might have played his last singles match at Melbourne Park.
He was in tears when more pain in his wrist prompted him to retire at Indian Wells in March, although he did win his first singles match since 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald in Miami later that month in what was his most recent tournament.
Kyrgios was still a draw at Wimbledon last year after moving into TV punditry, while he will be appearing at the New Wimbledon Theatre on June 24 as part of the live tour of his podcast 'Good Trouble'.

Alarm as China's critical mineral export ban takes hold,"US
.
Alarm over China's stranglehold on critical minerals grew on Tuesday as global automakers joined their US counterparts to complain that restrictions by China on exports of rare earth alloys, mixtures and magnets could cause production delays and outages without a quick solution.
German automakers became the latest to warn that China's export restrictions threaten to shut down production and rattle their local economies, following a similar complaint from an Indian EV maker last week.
China's decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets has upended the supply chains central to automakers, aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and military contractors around the world.
The move underscores China's dominance of the critical mineral industry and is seen as leverage by China in its ongoing trade war with US President Donald Trump.
Shipments of the magnets, essential for assembling everything from cars and drones to robots and missiles, have been halted at many Chinese ports while the Chinese government drafts a new regulatory system.
Once in place, the new system could permanently prevent supplies from reaching certain companies, including American military contractors. The suspension has triggered anxiety in corporate boardrooms and nations' capitals — from Tokyo to Washington — as officials scrambled to identify limited alternative options amid fears that production of new automobiles and other items could grind to a halt by summer's end.
""If the situation is not changed quickly, production delays and even production outages can no longer be ruled out,"" Hildegard Mueller, head of Germany's auto lobby, told Reuters on Tuesday.
Diplomats, automakers and other executives from India, Japan and Europe were urgently seeking meetings with Beijing officials to push for faster approval of rare earth magnet exports, sources told Reuters, as shortages threatened to halt global supply chains.
A business delegation from Japan will visit Beijing in early June to meet the Ministry of Commerce over the curbs and European diplomats from countries with big auto industries have also sought ""emergency"" meetings with Chinese officials in recent weeks, Reuters reported. Reuters

Wheat in Pakistan — quo vadis?,"US
The abolition of government procurement was a shock to the system
For years Pakistan's sclerotic wheat sector has been on life support which has cost the taxpayers and consumers billions of rupees.
Wheat is the basic staple food for most Pakistanis and makes up the bulk of our calorie intake. However, production has grown slowly, lagged behind population growth and made Pakistan increasingly dependent on foreign supplies. Between 2 and 3 million tons – around 10% of our needs – were imported in 2023-24 and it is likely that similar, if not larger, imports will be needed this year.
The main reason for this slow growth is lagging farm level productivity – yields have remained stubbornly low at around 30 maunds per acre (3 tons/ha) over the last decade.
The reasons for slow productivity growth are well known. Wheat is mostly produced by small farmers on tiny plots of land, often measuring less than 10 acres. These farmers lack technical knowledge and skills, as well as access to finance.
They have failed to adopt even simple technology interventions such as reduced tillage, planting with certified seeds, use of seed drills, balanced fertiliser and micronutrient applications, and careful use of water. There are also large on-farm and off-farm losses due to poor harvesting and lack of bulk handling and storage in modern silos.
Instead of working to improve yields through land consolidation, better farm management and improved technology, the government has in the past tried to accelerate growth by literally throwing money at it. Billions of scarce public money have been spent on subsidising costs of inputs and buying wheat at fixed prices that are often above the free market equilibrium price.
The logic that underpinned this policy is that lower fertiliser prices would increase applications and raise yields; and high wheat prices would increase the amount of land allocated to wheat while also enhancing investment in inputs such as seeds, machinery and water.
However, the policy has demonstrably not worked. The reasons for this failure are not difficult to understand. Fertiliser subsidies go mainly to medium and large-scale farmers who are already using close to optimal levels of fertilisers.
Subsidies mean more money in their pockets but bring about little change in behaviour. In contrast, poor farmers, most of whom use sub-optimal doses of fertiliser, are usually not able to access subsidies.
Similarly, poor farmers rarely benefit from high government procurement prices – the bulk of their production is for self-consumption and the surplus, if any, is usually sold at harvest time to intermediaries at whatever price they get.
With growing fiscal constraints and pressure from various domestic stakeholders as well as development partners, the government has finally stopped wheat procurement at fixed prices.
The abolition of government procurement was a shock to the system. In 2024, wheat prices fell to half their level in 2023. Wheat farmers were up in arms saying that the lack of government procurement and the collapse in prices meant that, for the first time in decades, they are unable even to cover operating costs.
The solution is not to go back to a procurement system that has failed, but to move forward to create an efficient and competitive wheat sector. Like any major structural change it will not be easy.
Some short-term measures to ease adjustment are already under implementation by the government and the private sector. These aim to improve the working of markets; provide a safety net to the poorest farmers; and enhance financial flows into the systems.
Some of these measures are already having an impact. Wheat prices for the current 2025 season were initially similar to those for 2024. However, market intermediaries have realised that with output projected to be significantly lower than 2024, prices will increase. Already there are reports of large offtakes by traders and increasing prices.
However, for the medium to long term it is essential to understand that farmers cannot make money if they continue to cultivate tiny plots, use inputs inefficiently and get yields of only 30 maunds per acre.
The brutal fact is that cereal crops, such as wheat, can only be efficiently grown on large farms that use modern technology, appropriate machinery and quality inputs. Ideally this could be done if small farmers come together to work in cooperative or consortia; if larger farmers rent land from friends and relatives; or if corporates are allowed to buy or lease land.
More dynamism is also essential to meet the challenges of climate change and in particular of changing rainfall patterns. This has resulted in higher precipitation in some of the arid areas in Balochistan and Sindh, and has expanded the potential area for wheat. But, making better use of this potential requires agile production systems.
In good rainfall years, manpower, equipment and inputs need to be quickly moved into arid areas to plant wheat. In addition, small but carefully designed investments are needed, for example, in small dams for storage and water spreading; machinery pools that can be moved quickly as needed; and low-cost storage facilities for harvested grains.
All this does not mean that small farmers should not grow wheat for their own use or for their friends and family. They should. And government research and extension systems must help them do this more efficiently. But at the same time, they should be helped to diversify into high value products where they can actually make money.
Furthermore, there is need for a more liberal approach to both domestic and international trade in wheat related inputs, particularly seeds; allocation of more funding to research, including in collaboration with the private sector and international institutions; and creation of conditions for the private sector to utilise new lands in previously uncultivated areas
The government should also liberalise wheat movements across the country, as well as allow the private sector to freely import and export. These steps are essential to create a national market that can balance out national and local supply shocks – shocks that are likely to increase in frequency and intensity in coming years.

Tracing Mohammad Haris' T20 rise,"HK
He scored a century against Bangladesh in third T20I
Hasan Nawaz and Mohammad Haris registered the fastest and second fastest T20I centuries for Pakistan in a space of 72 days showcasing their belligerent batting at the international stage.
Hasan's scintillating 44-ball century came just in his third T20I outing at Auckland's Eden Park on 21 March, while wicketkeeper-batter Haris brought up his ton off 45 balls against Bangladesh in the final T20I of the three-match series on 1 June in Lahore.
In the game against New Zealand, both opened the batting and amassed 74 runs off 5.5 overs, the highest-ever Powerplay for Pakistan in T20Is bettering a nine-year record of 73 runs against England in Manchester.
The duo also contributed a combined 300 runs from 150 balls while batting in the top four during the series sweep over Bangladesh.
Hasan has so far faced 118 balls in Pakistan colours making 227 runs with 16 fours and as many maximums. Haris, meanwhile, has racked up 370 runs across 17 T20I outings at a strike rate of 152 hitting 33 fours and 21 sixes. What stands out in these numbers is their prodigious ball-striking ability and record-breaking tons early in their careers.
With the domestic 2024-25 and the home international season coming to an end, it is pertinent to trace the build-up towards Hasan and Haris' spectacular showings with the bat for Pakistan in T20Is.
The 24-year-old, Haris, got off the mark in his T20I career with a straight six off England's Richard Gleeson at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore in September 2022. Nearly three years later, he fittingly brought up his first international century at the scene of his T20I debut.
Haris, who has featured in six ODIs for Pakistan, boasts 16 dismissals behind the stumps in 11 of his 23 outings in white-ball cricket. He enacted five dismissals including one stumping in the recent series against Bangladesh and hammered 179 runs at a staggering strike rate of 201, earning him the player of the series award.
In just his second T20I, Haris was called up to fill in for Fakhar Zaman in a crucial ICC T20 World Cup 2022 match against South Africa at Sydney Cricket Ground. He announced his arrival by belting Kagiso Rabada for consecutive sixes followed by a four for his first runs in the tournament.
The Peshawar-born batter showcased a range of shots in his 11-ball 28 hitting two fours and three sixes to set the tone for a huge total in a must-win match for Pakistan. His 31 and 30 in the following matches against Bangladesh and New Zealand, respectively, also showed glimpses of his tremendous potential.
Haris has featured in 117 T20s scoring 2,860 runs at a strike rate of 147.65 with the help of one century and 15 half-centuries. He made his T20I comeback, after last featuring for Pakistan in the format in April 2023, following a title-winning campaign with Allied Bank Stallions in the Champions T20 Cup and a strong performance in HBL PSL X.
Haris-led Stallions went onto lift the trophy in the T20 tournament, where he contributed 269 runs in nine matches at a strike rate of 151 including three half-centuries.
In HBL PSL X, Haris collected 247 runs with a strike rate of 148 in 10 matches for Peshawar Zalmi including the highest score of 87. His tally of 53 fours and 21 sixes across the two T20 tournaments proved his boundary-hitting capability, striking a boundary every 4.5 balls.
On Sunday night, Haris became the first non-opener and fifth Pakistan batter to register a T20I century marking a turning point in his Pakistan career.
Haris has been a regular feature in the Pakistan Shaheens setup, leading them in the white-ball leg of the Darwin tour in July 2024, Bangladesh 'A' tour of Pakistan in August 2024, Sri Lanka 'A' tour of Pakistan in November 2024 and the ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup in July 2023 (50-over) & October 2024 (T20).

Panel mulls ways to tackle drug issue,"US
Senator Siddiqui proposes focal unit in ICT to combat rising threats to child safety
In response to the rising threat of drugs, abuse and the lack of child protection mechanisms in educational institutions, a Senate panel on Tuesday called for urgent, coordinated measures to ensure a safe and drug-free learning environment for children, beginning with a pilot initiative in Islamabad.
The Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights was presided over by acting Chairman Senator Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, in the absence of Chairperson Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who could not attend due to health reasons.
The committee convened to deliberate on the growing threats to child rights in educational institutions, particularly the alarming rise in narcotics use, sexual abuse and the absence of mental health and rights-based education in school curricula.
Senator Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui expressed serious concern over the availability of drugs in educational institutions, especially within the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), stressing that immediate steps must be taken.
He also highlighted the lack of cooperation from provinces in similar initiatives, stressing the need to first address the situation within the federal jurisdiction.
He questioned the effectiveness of current awareness initiatives in schools, noting that existing textbooks and curricula fail to convey the severity of drug-related dangers.
He urged the inclusion of a dedicated chapter on drug awareness at every grade level and called for the use of realistic examples to ensure the message is effectively communicated to students.
Moreover, highlighting deficiencies in teacher training and curriculum development, Senator Siddiqui said, ""No curriculum can succeed without capable teachers. Training programs for educators remain weak, and this must be addressed immediately.""
The committee agreed to establish a committee recommending that the Ministry of Interior designate a focal unit for ICT, including representatives from the Ministry of Education, ICT administration, Islamabad Police, Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) and the Human Rights Division.
The unit will oversee zone-wise implementation, develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for educational institutions and create a reporting mechanism to track drug-related activities.
Senator Siddiqui emphasised the need for a pilot model in Islamabad that could serve as a framework for other regions.
""We must create a role model initiative in Islamabad and streamline the process. This problem cannot be solved overnight, but a structured and targeted approach will lead us in the right direction,"" he said.

Imran takes up reins of PTI ahead of protest,"US
Becomes patron-in-chief of embattled party
PTI founder Imran Khan, while announcing that the door for talks with the powerful stakeholders was still open, declared on Tuesday that a nationwide protest movement was now the party's only remaining option.
While taking back full control of party affairs by becoming PTI's patron-in-chief, the former premier said that he would lead a nationwide protest movement from prison, declaring it the party's only remaining path after allegedly being shut out of political and legal avenues.
The new patron-in-chief named Opposition Leader in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub, to coordinate the protest campaign, apparently sidelining Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who previously used to handle such responsibilities.
The PTI supremo gave no timeline for the protest movement but said it would not be limited to Islamabad this time around. Khan once again clarified that his willingness to negotiate was only in Pakistan's broader interest, not for any personal relief.
The announcements came through PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, who met Khan at Adiala Jail during proceedings of the Toshakhana II case.
Speaking to the media afterwards, PTI chairman said Khan believes that ""all doors have been closed"" on PTI and that a peaceful countrywide protest was now the only path forward.
According to Gohar, Khan made it clear that he would head the protest movement himself, issuing all instructions through the NA opposition leader.
Importantly, Gohar confirmed that this time the communication pertaining to the protest would not rely on Gandapur, who had previously been tasked with organising and leading such events.
""For Ali Amin Khan Sahib,"" he said the instructions right now are: 'concentrate on the province and governance.""
""Different responsibilities will be assigned to different individuals,"" Gohar said, stressing that Khan has full trust in the party leadership and recognises the sacrifices made by many within the party ranks.
In response to a question, he clarified that no date or time frame for the protest movement has been disclosed yet, saying Khan would determine the timing himself.
To another question, Gohar confirmed that Khan has assumed the role of PTI's patron-in-chief, effectively reasserting full control over party decision-making.
""From now on, all key decisions will be taken by the PTI founder,"" Gohar said, reiterating that he was the one who used to take all decisions before as well. ""He was, is and will remain the leader forever,"" he said.
Dismissing rumours about his own removal, Gohar insisted he remains the legitimate party chairman as long as Khan decides so, saying Khan was, is and will always remain the party supremo and he was only fulfilling duties until Khan was in jail.
""These are just baseless rumours,"" he responded to the speculation, adding that some people were spreading rumours about his removal to create confusion.
Gohar stressed that his own preference remains for dialogue over confrontation, saying he has always tried to resolve issues through negotiation and still wanted that.
However, he added that Khan believes ""no political path has been left open"" for PTI, especially after what he described as alleged rigging in the recent Sambrial by-election on the heels of alleged mandate theft in the general elections.

Bilawal proposes ISI-RAW tie-up to fight terror,"US
Terms ceasefire a welcome first step
Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said on Tuesday that ""if"" the premier spy agencies of both Pakistan and India ""sit together"" and collaborate with each other there could be a significant decline in terrorist activities in the region.
Bilawal, who is leading a multi-party delegation to world capitals to present Pakistan's stance on the recent escalation with India, told a press conference in New York that the ceasefire between the two countries was a ""welcome first step"", yet it was merely a first step.
Bilawal's press conference came just before his departure for Washington for the delegation's meeting with top US leaders and lawmakers. At the UN, he held several meetings with ambassadors from the Security Council (UNSC) members, including the US, France, and the current president of Guyana.
Bilawal suggested instead of accusations, counteraccusations and finger-pointing over terrorism, the effective way would be for Pakistan and India to work together to combat this menace.
""I am completely confident that if ISI [Inter-Service Intelligence of Pakistan] and RAW [Research and Analysis Wing of India] sat down and worked together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism both within India and Pakistan,"" he said.
He pointed out that Pakistan was the biggest victim of terrorism and suffered far more terrorist attacks than India. ""If you compare the number of victims to terrorism then far more Pakistanis are killed by terrorists than Indians,"" he told the media.
Bilawal condemned India's illegal strikes inside Pakistan on May 7, calling them a violation of the UN Charter and international law. He said the attacks targeted civilian infrastructure, places of worship, dams, and water and energy facilities, causing civilian casualties, including women and children.
He also rejected India's ""new normal"" doctrine as ""new abnormal"" that it was trying to impose on the region. ""We can't leave the fate of 1.5 or 1.7 billion people in the hands of non-state actors and terrorists, allowing them to decide on a whim that two nuclear-armed powers should go to war.""
He blamed India for using the April 22 Pahalgam attack in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) as a pretext for aggression. He said that India rejected Pakistan's offer for investigation and instead launched strikes against Pakistan.
In response, he added, Pakistan acted in self-defence and downed six Indian planes that had attacked its territory. Pakistan has consistently condemned terrorism in all its forms,"" he said. ""Pakistan would still like to cooperate with India to combat terrorism.""
Bilawal credited the international communityparticularly US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio – for facilitating a ceasefire between the two countries. However, he warned that while the ceasefire is a welcome first step, the risk of full-scale conflict remained dangerously high.
Urging the global community to continue pushing for dialogue and diplomacy as the only viable path to lasting peace, Bilawal cautioned that ""the threshold for war [between Pakistan and India] has lowered, not risen"" because of India's so-called new normal.
""In addition to this, there is a root cause [which] in this case is the unresolved agenda of Kashmir before the UN Security Council,"" he said. ""If we continue to ignore this issue and allow that wound to fester, there will forever be a bone of contention between India and Pakistan.""
He stressed the need for a mechanism where Pakistan and India could bring any complaints to a mutually agreed forum and work together to identify, track and deliver justice to terrorists. He also said that the threat to cut Pakistan's water would be seen as an act of war by Pakistan.
Pakistan had sent two delegations to different world capitals as part of Islamabad's diplomatic offensive against India to apprise the world of Pakistan's stance vis-à-vis India's aggression following the Pahalgam attack.
Bilawal is leading a nine-member delegation to the US while another team, led by Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Tariq Fatemi is currently touring Moscow and held a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Tuesday.
At the UN, the Pakistani delegation reached out to the representatives of the UNSC members, including some of the close allies of India, and briefed them on the alarming security developments in South Asia, following India's recent military aggression and unilateral actions.
The meetings on Tuesday included the permanent representatives to the UN from the US, Guyana [the UNSC president for the month of June], France and officials from the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
France is one of the closest allies of India and the meeting of the Pakistani delegation with the French Ambassador to the United Nations was significant keeping in view that the Pakistani Air Force (PAF) shot down French-made Rafale jets on the night of May 6 and 7.
An official handout said that Ambassador Jerome Bonnafont met with the Pakistani parliamentary delegation. Bilawal apprised the French envoy of the grave consequences arising from India's baseless attribution of the Pahalgam attack to Pakistan without any credible investigation or evidence.
The delegation briefed the French ambassador regarding the alarming security developments in South Asia, following India's recent military aggression and unilateral actions in violation of the international law that threatened the fragile strategic balance in the region.
Bilawal condemned India's unilateral military strikes against civilians, leading to deaths and injuries and damage to civilian infrastructure in Pakistan, the arbitrary holding in abeyance of the IWT, and India's persistent belligerence.
He warned against India's attempt to impose the so-called ""new normal"" of arbitrary strikes, saying that such conduct would have serious implications for a nuclearised region like South Asia. He said that Pakistan was committed to eliminating terrorism, including the one funded and supported from India.
He underscored the imperative of a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant UNSC resolutions for durable peace and stability in South Asia. He urged France to play a role in ensuring a sustained ceasefire, revival of the IWT, and initiation of a comprehensive Pak-India dialogue.
The French ambassador expressed his country's support for regional peace and stability and the need for bilateral dialogue between India and Pakistan. He reiterated the importance of restraint, dialogue, and adherence to international obligations.
Members of the parliamentary delegationHina Rabbani Khar, Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Khurram Dastgir Khan, Jalil Abbas Jilani, Tehmina Janjua, Bushra Anjum Butt and Syed Faisal Subzwari – were also present on the occasion.
The Pakistani delegation was scheduled to arrive in Washington later in the day, where it planned to engage with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, other senior officials, lawmakers, and think tanks till June 6. The team will also visit London and Brussels later.
Meanwhile, at the beginning of his visit to the Russian Federation, SAPM Fatemi, called on Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov in Moscow and conveyed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's message for President Vladmir Putin.
During the meeting, Fatemi reiterated Pakistani leadership's commitment to deepening bilateral cooperation with Russia across various sectors, including energy, connectivity, and trade. He also provided a detailed briefing on recent developments in South Asia.
The SAPM outlined Pakistan's concerns regarding regional escalation risks. In particular, he highlighted the serious implications of India's threat to disrupt the IWT by declaring it in so-called ""abeyance.""
Lavrov expressed satisfaction with the steady growth in bilateral cooperation, underscoring key collaborative projects such as the establishment of new Steel Mills and critical connectivity initiatives.
He reaffirmed Russia's eagerness to strengthen ties with Pakistan within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), particularly in the area of counter-terrorism.
Regarding Pakistan-India relations, Foreign Minister Lavrov emphasised Russia's support for the normalisation of ties between the two countries, noting its positive impact on regional stability.

PM vows strategic response to India's water threat,"PK
Shehbaz tells Peshawar Jirga K-P's NFC funds to continue until terrorism ends
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday announced plans to expand country's water storage capacity in consultation with all the provinces, emphasising that Pakistan's response to India's provocations, especially regarding the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), would ""be more strategic and collaborative"".
Addressing a representative Jirga in Peshawar, the prime minister said that Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P) had been receiving 1% share under the National Finance Commission (NFC) since 2010 to fight terrorism, adding that the funding would continue until complete elimination of the menace.
The prime minister began his speech with paying tribute to the K-P people for their patriotism and bravery in the fight against terrorism. He told the Jirga he had come to Peshawar to listen to the public grievances and to resolve them.
The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to securing its water rights under the IWT. He called for urgent measures to enhance the country's water infrastructure to ensure that the rights of the provinces were safeguarded.
He said that India could not deprive Pakistan of its rightful share of water or suspend the IWT unilaterally. Pakistan has the right to every drop under the treaty,"" he declared. ""Now, we will take steps to store water in the country to counter India's threats,"" he said.
He called for expanding the existing water storage capacity and accelerating work on major projects, such as Diamer-Bhasha and Dasu dams. ""A decision on water issue will be taken by inviting all provinces for discussions on how to increase water reserves, so that India's malicious designs are buried,"" he said.
NFC Award
Shehbaz said that K-P Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur had spoken about reviewing the NFC award. He announced that he would form a committee on K-P's share in the NFC award and the province's issues would be resolved in collaboration with the provincial government, and military officials.
The prime minister told the Jirga that more than Rs700 billion funds had been given to K-P during different periods. ""The first agenda item of the NFC Award in 2010 was anti-terrorism efforts in K-P,"" Shehbaz recalled. ""All provinces fully agreed to giving 1% to K-P for the fight against terrorism,"" he added.
""That decision was just and appropriate, as K-P has remained the frontline province in the war against terrorism,"" he said. ""These funds were released to strengthen police force, develop CTD [Counter-Terrorism Department], and enhance the capacity of law-enforcement agencies,"" he added.
""K-P will continue to receive funds until the complete elimination of terrorism,"" he added. However, he noted that Balochistan, despite facing similar security challenges, had not received that much financial support under the NFC - an issue he suggested might needed reassessment.
Escalation with India
Prime Minister Shehbaz said that the Pakistani Armed Force had taught an unforgettable lesson to India in the recent May 7-10 confrontation and warned New Delhi that any repeat of aggression would invite a strong and uncompromising response from Islamabad.
Shehbaz said the enemy's ambush in the night between May 6 and 7 killed and injured innocent Pakistanis. ""[In response] What the Pakistan Army taught India under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir is a lesson they will never forget,"" he said.
""[Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi's government is licking its wounds after a crushing defeat and it is in an angry and hysterical state. Sometimes they threaten to shoot, other times to cut our water off. If India makes any move again, they will be taught the same lesson.""
The prime minister termed K-P a vital province that has historically supported Pakistan and promised to address the concerns of its people. ""They have rendered sacrifices that history will never forget. Whenever Pakistan was in need, you put aside all differences and stood united for Pakistan,"" he said.
The Jirga was attended by Field Marshal Asim Munir, K-P Chief Minister Gandapur, Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and other political and military leaders as well as tribal elders. Earlier, the participants offered Fateha for both civilian and military personnel who have laid down their lives for the nation.
Self-reliance
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz chaired a high-level meeting on the construction of Diamer-Bhasha Dam and other matters related to water resources in Islamabad. He said that building new dams was crucial to enhance water storage capacity, ensure water supply for agriculture, and prevent floods.
He said that the country's self-reliance was linked to affordable electricity, and its agriculture, which required increased water storage and efficient water usage. He directed for prioritising the completion of projects like Diamer-Bhasha Dam to establish an effective system for energy production and abundant water storage.

Russia says no quick breakthrough in 'complex' Ukraine talks,"US

Russia on Tuesday said it was wrong to expect a quick breakthrough in Ukraine talks, a day after Moscow rejected Kyiv's call for an unconditional ceasefire at negotiations in Istanbul.
The sides agreed on a large-scale swap of captured soldiers and exchanged their roadmaps to peace, or so-called ""memorandums"", at the discussions, which lasted less than two hours.
More than three years into Russia's offensive — which has killed tens of thousands on both sides and forced millions from their homes in eastern Ukraine — the two sides appear as irreconcilable as ever.

"Holder, Russell return for West Indies","US
They will face England and Ireland later this month
Cricket West Indies (CWI) has announced the T20I squads for the upcoming series against England and Ireland, with big names like Jason Holder and Andre Russell making a return.
However, Nicholas Pooran will be rested for the tour following his involvement in the IPL.
West Indies will face England in three T20Is immediately after their ODI series at The Oval concludes on Tuesday.
Following that, they will head to Ireland for another three-match T20I series, although several players and members of the coaching staffincluding Russellwill be rested for the Ireland leg.
Holder last appeared in a T20I for West Indies in February 2024, having missed the World Cup later that year due to injury. Russell's most recent match was against England in Barbados last November, where an ankle injury ruled him out of the remainder of the series.
Sherfane Rutherford returns to the squad after missing the Bangladesh series, while Keacy Carty will only feature in the Ireland T20Is, replacing Brandon King who has been granted leave.
New Test captain Roston Chase will also depart after the England series to prepare for Australia's upcoming tour, with former West Indies Under-19 player Jyd Goolie receiving his first senior call-up.
Ahead of the first Test against Australia starting June 25, West Indies will hold a Test training camp in Barbados from June 13-21.
West Indies Men's T20I Squad for England: Shai Hope (captain), Johnson Charles, Roston Chase, Matthew Forde, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder, Akeal Hosein, Alzarri Joseph, Brandon King, Evin Lewis, Gudakesh Motie, Rovman Powell, Andre Russell, Sherfane Rutherford, Romario Shepherd.

Accused held for torturing biker remanded,"US
Qureshi requested the court to grant only a one-day physical remand
The Judicial Magistrate South has granted a two-day physical remand of the suspects involved in torturing a young man in DHA Ittihad Commercial. The police had presented the accused Salman Farooqi and Owais Hashmi in the court.
The police submitted the FIR, which was registered on a complaint filed by an eyewitness Muhammad Saleem, a sales manager at a mobile company who was present in the area for work-related purposes.
Lawyer of the accused Naeem Qureshi filed a bail application on behalf of his client, arguing that the charges, primarily involving threats, were bailable under the law. However, the investigating officer (IO) requested a physical remand for further inquiry.
Qureshi requested the court to grant only a one-day physical remand, however, after hearing both sides, the court granted a two-day physical remand and directed the IO to submit a progress report at the next hearing. As the accused were being taken out of the courtroom, lawyers shouted, 'beat them'. One lawyer even slapped Salman Farooqi.

Automaker airlifts parts over geopolitical risks,"US
.
British automaker MG has said that they have taken swift action to overcome recent disruptions to its supply chain by airlifting critical vehicle components to Pakistan.
The move comes in response to delays caused by geopolitical issues that temporarily rerouted shipments, affecting the delivery schedule for certain colour options for their HS PHEV – Pakistan's first locally assembled plug-in hybrid electric vehicle.
To minimise customer inconvenience and get production fully back on track, the company opted for the faster, though more expensive, method of air transport for essential parts. MG Pakistan General Manager Marketing Division Syed Asif Ahmed stated that production has now resumed at full pace and deliveries are restarting immediately, emphasising that getting vehicles to customers with minimal further delay is their top priority.
Managing logistics for automobile manufacturing in Pakistan poses significant challenges for global automakers, especially in today's world, where competition between Japanese, European and Chinese automakers is becoming intense in Pakistan and globally.
The country relies heavily on imported parts, especially for new variants, which makes supply chains vulnerable to international shipping delays, port congestion, complex customs procedures and fluctuations in global freight costs. Geopolitical instability in surrounding regions can further complicate shipping routes, as MG Pakistan recently experienced, creating bottlenecks and forcing rerouting.
Infrastructure limitations within Pakistan, including the transportation networks, also add layers of complexity to ensuring parts arrive at assembly plants just in time for production.

"Musk blasts Trump mega-bill, days after farewell","US
.
Tensions between allies Elon Musk and Donald Trump erupted on Tuesday as the world's richest man derided the president's key piece of economic legislation in a startling rupture just days after exiting a controversial job in the White House.
Musk was lauded by the Republican leader as he left his advisory role atop Trump's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" last week, despite criticism over his failure to deliver on promises of a transformative program of spending cuts.
""This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,"" Musk posted on X as he followed its progress from the sidelines, in by far his most caustic remarks on Trump's agenda.
""Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong.""
It was not Musk's first comments on Trump's so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" which is set to add $3 trillion to US deficits over a 10-year horizon, despite deep cuts to health and food aid programs.
But Musk's previous criticism was more restrained, with the Tesla and SpaceX magnate offering only that it undermined his cost-cutting efforts.
On Tuesday he said the bill — being considered by Congress — would burden ""citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.""
His post laid bare an increasingly tense relationship between the White House and Musk, who donated almost $300 million to Trump's 2024 election campaign.
Yet the normally pugilistic Republican has pulled his punches, aware of his biggest backer's enormous influence over young, tech-savvy and historically apathetic voters -- a key Trump constituency in 2024.
""The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill, it doesn't change his opinion,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a rapid response to Musk's tweet.
""This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it.""
The spat came with House Republicans gearing up to pass legislation due from the White House later Tuesday that proposes to enshrine into law $9.4 billion of DOGE's cuts.
House Speaker Mike Johnson called Musk's comments ""disappointing,"" adding that he had talked his ""good friend"" through the bill during a 20-minute phone call on Monday, and that he ""seemed to understand.""
As the world's richest person bowed out of his role as Trump's cost-cutter-in-chief, their relationship appeared on an even keel as the Republican hailed his fellow billionaire's ""incredible service.""
Trump even insisted that Musk was ""really not leaving"" after a turbulent four months in which the South African born tycoon cut tens of thousands of jobs, shuttered whole agencies and slashed foreign aid.
DOGE -- announced after Musk became a regular fixture on the campaign trail for Trump — led an ideologically-driven rampage through the federal government, with its young ""tech bros"" slashing tens of thousands of jobs.
But its achievements fell far short of Musk's original boast that he could save $2 trillion dollars — more than the government's entire discretionary spending budget for 2024.
The DOGE website claims to have saved taxpayers less than a tenth of that total — just $175 billion — and fact checkers even see that claim as dubious, given previous serious inaccuracies in its accounting.
Senate Democrats released a report Tuesday itemizing 130 examples of ""unethical or potentially corrupt"" administration actions they say have helped Musk add $100 billion to his wealth during his tenure.
The report came as senators began what is expected to be a fraught month of negotiations on Trump's mammoth policy package, expected to add between $2.5 trillion and $3.1 trillion to deficits over a decade.

Saeed proud of weightlifter Sybil Sohail's gold medal,"US
Singer took to IG to congratulate
Farhan Saeed, former frontman of the renowned Pakistani band Jal and now a singer-songwriter and actor, took to Instagram to publicly express his pride after Sybil Sohail became the first Pakistani woman to win the gold medal at the Asian Weightlifting Masters Championship in Doha, Qatar.
In a simple Instagram Story, Saeed tagged Sohail herself and wrote, ""Proud moment. Congratulations."" Adding a Pakistani flag emoji at the end of his short but sweet message to lock in his national pride, Saeed's simple message captured the essence of the country's joy and pride in Sohail's achievement.
This was not the first time Saeed has used his social media platform to highlight Pakistani sporting excellence. When javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem clinched gold at the Asian Athletics Championship by defeating a strong Indian contender in the men's javelin final in May, Saeed took to Instagram Story to extend his congratulations on the historic victory.
Sohail, 31, competed in the 59kg weight category in Doha. She lifted a total of 95kg — 40kg in the snatch and 55kg in the clean and jerk — to secure her place at the top of the podium.
This gold medal marked not only her debut in international weightlifting but also a significant milestone for Pakistani women in strength sports.
Previously a decorated powerlifter, Sohail holds titles such as Commonwealth Powerlifting Champion and Asian Commonwealth Powerlifting Champion. Transitioning to weightlifting, she set out with a clear ambition: to raise Pakistan's flag at major Asian events.
""I aim to make my country proud, make my family proud. We have sacrificed a lot for the sport, but I need to make sure that all of that effort and dedication pays off,"" Sohail told The Express Tribune in Doha.

'Offer met with silence can't be accepted later',"US
.
The Lahore High Court (LHC) has set aside a family court's ruling, observing that an offer or proposal which is not expressly accepted and is instead met with silence, conduct or behaviour indicating disinterest or unwillingness, cannot be accepted at a later stage.
The case involved petitioner Ahmed Raza, who, during family court proceedings, offered that he had no objection to the decreeing of two suits - one for recovery of maintenance allowance and another for dowry articles and gold ornaments - in favour of Respondent No.2.
However, he made this conditional upon her parents or real brothers swearing a special oath on the Holy Quran, affirming that her claims were truthful.
Interestingly, at the time, the respondents did not respond to the offer, neither accepting nor rejecting it.
The petitioner subsequently closed his oral evidence, sought time to produce documentary evidence, and the case was fixed for final arguments on November 16, 2020.
However, before the final arguments could proceed, the respondents filed an application expressing their willingness to accept the petitioner's earlier offer made during cross-examination.
The petitioner contested this application, requesting the court to decide the suits on merit. Nevertheless, the family court ruled that the petitioner could not back out of the offer or proposal he had made.
Challenging this decision, the petitioner approached the LHC, which overturned the family court's order.
Justice Malik Waqar Haider Awan held that once the trial had moved forward, leaving the offer unaccepted, it became ineffective. ""The party missed the train by not expressly accepting the offer promptly,"" the judge noted.
Thereafter, the petitioner's documentary evidence was recorded, and the matter was set down for final arguments.
Counsel for Respondents No. 2 to 4 contended that once the offer for a special oath was made, the petitioner could not withdraw from it.
Subsequently, the LHC held that a lack of timely acceptance rendered the proposal null and void.

Wildlife officer shot in anti-poaching raid,"US
Suspects escape after firing on team trying to stop illegal Chinkara hunting
A team from the Punjab Wildlife Department came under armed attack during an early morning anti-poaching operation near Toba Tharola in Rahim Yar Khan district, leaving one officer injured and damaging an official vehicle.
The assailants, suspected of illegally hunting endangered wildlife, fled the scene. An FIR has been registered at Derawar police station.
According to the First Information Report (FIR) filed by Senior Wildlife Ranger Usman Khan, the department received a tip-off about illegal hunting activity involving the endangered Chinkara deer.
Acting on the intelligence, a team led by Assistant Chief Wildlife Ranger Mujahid Kaleem, along with Ranger Nadir Ali, driver Amjad Farooq and other staff, reached the area around 5:50am on Monday.
The team intercepted a suspicious white vehicle believed to be involved in poaching.
As officials attempted to stop the car, one of the suspects, identified as Tahir, allegedly opened fire on the officers.
Wildlife Officer Muhammad Safdar sustained injuries to his face and eye due to shattered glass from the vehicle's window, while the other suspects also fired shots before escaping under the cover of darkness.
The FIR includes charges under Section 324 (attempted murder), Section 427 (mischief causing damage), Section 186 (obstructing public servants), and Sections 148 and 149 (rioting and unlawful assembly) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Additionally, Section 12 of the Punjab Protected Areas Act 2020 (amended 2025), which prohibits unauthorised hunting in protected zones, has also been invoked.
The complainant stated that he can identify the attackers.

Aftershock getaway,"RO
For them, freedom was a larger concern than safety.
District Prison Malir was amongst the many areas in Karachi that experienced mild earthquake tremors in recent days. While this led to mass panic and building evacuations in most places, 213 inmates captive in the Malir prison instead saw it as an opportunity and orchestrated one of the largest jailbreaks in Pakistan.
For them, freedom was a larger concern than safety. Since then, 78 prisoners have been recaptured. According to the Inspector General of Police in Sindh, this mass escape was the direct result of letting around 2,000 prisoners out into the courtyard as a safety precaution, who were then enabled to escape due to ""some lapses"".
The entire incident calls into question not only the enacted security measures that allow for lapses with such colossal consequences, but also an evident gap in the jail administration's safety training and crisis management competence.
According to international safety guidelines, you are advised to 'drop, cover and hold on' during earthquake tremors and only evacuate if there are signs of immediate danger afterwards.
Moreover, there are reportedly more than 6,000 prisoners in the Malir jail, while its capacity ceases at 2,200. Such flagrant violations of multiple safety standards are naturally a recipe for disaster that cannot be prevented, only dealt with. The prison's superintendent insists that the jailbreak was ""not a security lapse"" but rather all due to ""a natural disaster.""
While an unusual situation transpired due to the natural disaster, it is essential for security personnel to be trained in unusual situations, so that a 'timely response' does not have to refer to recapturing 78 escaped prison inmates.
The IG Sindh has ascertained that the prisoners escaped by opening the door of the jail. In a facility designed to make the outside world inaccessible for thousands, why was that an achievable feat?

It was revealed during the meeting of a parliamentary panel that around 135,000 Pakistanis have sought political asylum in western countries in the last two years. The committee was also told that 52,000 Pakistanis have been deported from neighboring countries including Iran during the same period.
The Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis held a meeting on Tuesday. During the session, chaired by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, the director general of passports revealed that 125,000 Pakistanis in Europe and more than 10,000 in the United States had applied for political asylum.
He informed the committee that some countries do not jail Pakistani nationals who arrive there through illegal means but immediately repatriate them to Pakistan.
""34,000 Pakistanis were deported from Iran last year. The passports of deported individuals have been blocked, while those involved in criminal activities are being given strict punishments,"" he said.
The DG noted that over 10.3 million skilled Pakistani professionals are currently working abroad.
Earlier, officials from the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis stated that Saudi Arabia has reduced the number of visas issued to Pakistanis and tightened the eligibility criteria.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) briefed the committee that since 2023, over 52,000 Pakistanis have been deported, including 5,000 beggars deported from Saudi Arabia.

Parents bring Eid gifts for children at Judicial Complex Facilitation Centres
Special Eid reunions have begun in the District Courts, allowing divorced parents to meet their estranged children with the permission of family courts. Divorced mothers, fathers, grandparents, aunts, and uncles have started meeting their separated children at Judicial Complex Facilitation Centres.
In the past two days, 168 divorced families have reunited with their children for special Eid visits, which will continue today (Wednesday) and tomorrow (Thursday). These meetings had been emotionally charged, with tearful scenes witnessed.
Mothers and fathers brought special Eid gifts for their children, including garments, shoes, bicycles, toys, clothing, artificial jewellery, makeup items, and dolls. Children also received cash ""Eidi."" Each child was allowed up to two and a half hours of reunion time.
Most of the children live with the other parent following the parents' remarriage.
Along with mothers, grandparents, aunts, and uncles also participated in the visits. After the meetings, many mothers parted from their children with tearful eyes. Every year during Eid, family judges arrange special meetings between children and their parents.
One father, Faisal Rasheed, shared his thoughts, saying: ""I divorced my wife due to family disputes; we have two children. I have remarried, and the children live with their mother. I deeply regret it now and miss the kids terribly. I urge all families involved in court disputes to withdraw their cases and live happily with their children, or else they will regret it. Divorce has negative impacts on children, especially daughters, whose marriages face challenges that are hard to describe.""
Zeeshan, an official at the court facilitation centre, said they provide meeting arrangements as per court orders and ensure meetings end on time.
Two children, Rania and Arslan, expressed their joy, saying, ""We are very happy today. It's been four months since we last saw our father. We received lots of toys, clothes, shoes, a bicycle, and cash. Eid should come every month so we can keep getting nice clothes, money, and toys.""

It also made Roland Garros Djokovic's most successful Grand Slam in terms of match wins, bettering the 99 victories that he has at the Australian Open, although the 38-year-old has lifted the trophy a staggering 10 times at Melbourne Park.
""It's a number which is very good and nice, but a 101st win is even better,"" Djokovic told the crowd in French.
""It's not finished for me here the tournament and I feel very good and good to make history here. I hope there will be another win here in two days.""
By reaching the quarter-finals for the 16th straight year, Djokovic also became the oldest man entering the last eight at Roland Garros since 39-year-old Istvan Gulyas in 1971.
Djokovic arrived in Paris having won his 100th tour-level trophy in an otherwise lacklustre year and has not dropped a set in the tournament so far to remind his much younger title rivals of his undiminished hunger for more milestones.
He swapped breaks early on with Norrie in the first set but ran the 29-year-old ragged thereafter to win it before shrugging off another wobble on serve in a draining second set to pull away and double his advantage on Court Philippe Chatrier.
""I feel good I have a lot of expectations from my game,"" added Djokovic, who earned his sixth win over Norrie in as many meetings after also powering past the left-hander en route to the Geneva title.
""Every day I play better ... 12 sets played and 12 sets won. Everything is positive and solid at the moment.""
Djokovic broke to love in the third game of the third set after an unforced error by Norrie and the former world number one never looked back from there to book a last-eight meeting with German third seed Alexander Zverev.
The last time the duo clashed was in the Australian Open semi-finals in January, when Djokovic had to retire injured, but he will now look to extend his 8-5 record over the German.

Traders propose balanced budget,"US
.
A balanced and strategy-driven federal budget is essential for Pakistan's economic future as it can define the country's direction and create a favourable environment for struggling businesses.
It was the key takeaway from an awareness session on the upcoming budget for 2025-26, organised by the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI).
Speaking at the session, acting LCCI President Engineer Khalid Usman said the key pillars of the budget should comprise the expansion of tax net, relief for the existing taxpayers, protection for the domestic industry, elimination of duties on imported raw material, GDP and export growth and meaningful reforms.
He stressed that tariffs must be used as a policy tool to shield domestic industries and reduce reliance on imports. He advocated zero-rated customs duty and sales tax on raw material to ensure cost-effective industrial production.

Govt reaffirms energy reform commitment,"US
Petroleum minister announces revival of Cabinet Committee on Energy, deepens ties with Azerbaijan's SOCAR
Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik reaffirmed Pakistan's commitment to a resilient and sustainable energy future during his keynote address at the Ministerial Plenary session titled 'Global Cooperation for a Resilient and Sustainable Energy Future' at the 30th Baku Energy Forum.
According to a statement released on Tuesday, in his speech, Malik congratulated Azerbaijan's Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov and pledged Pakistan's full cooperation with the forum's transition agenda, which aims to shift from a fossil fuel-driven framework to a balanced energy mix. He emphasised Pakistan's strategic realignment under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif's leadership towards a more sustainable, inclusive, and coherent energy paradigm.
Highlighting Pakistan's ongoing industrialisation, Malik noted that the country's rising energy demand must be met by integrating renewable energy sources and technology. To support this, he announced the revival of the Cabinet Committee on Energy, chaired by the prime minister, to enhance coordination between the Petroleum and Power Divisions and ensure cohesive policy evolution. The minister also detailed Pakistan's efforts to expand its gas infrastructure by encouraging local exploration, acknowledging the assistance of Azerbaijan and other partner countries in developing indigenous gas resources. He said conservation measures and reform initiatives are underway to dismantle inefficiencies and ensure long-term sustainability of the gas sector.
""Despite economic challenges, Pakistan is committed to making the gas sector sustainable by dismantling inefficiencies and implementing reforms,"" Malik stated. ""Reform is the cornerstone of the prime minister's vision for a resilient energy future.""
Attendees at the plenary included Azerbaijan's Energy Minister Parviz Shahbazov, the Turkish Deputy Minister of Energy, and Director of Energy at the European Commission Cristina Lobillo.
Separately in Islamabad, Malik held a bilateral meeting with Rovshan Najaf, President of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR), to enhance energy cooperation between the two countries. The discussion focused on deepening bilateral ties, potential joint ventures, and attracting investment in Pakistan's oil and gas sector.
Malik reiterated Pakistan's intent to strengthen partnerships with leading global energy firms and stressed the government's commitment to creating an investor-friendly climate. Najaf praised Pakistan's progress in the energy sector and reaffirmed SOCAR's interest in expanding cooperation with Pakistani stakeholders.

K-P is abandoning children,"PK
Over 5,000 schools in K-P operate without a single watt of electricity.
Let's call it what it is: K-P is abandoning its children. Not metaphorically, not in the way people toss around, 'Oh, the system is broken.' No. The system isn't broken; it's functioning exactly as it's allowed to, with chilling indifference to the rights of the most vulnerable.
A recent report by the provincial Education Department pulls no punches. Legions of children enrolled in over 10,000 public schools across K-P arrive each day at buildings as bare as unfinished construction sites. No boundary walls. No electricity. No washrooms. Not even drinking water.
Over 5,000 schools in K-P operate without a single watt of electricity. In more than 2,000 schools, safe drinking water is a rarity. Thousands more lack washrooms or a protective wall around them. In Peshawar — the provincial capital itself — 21 schools are in the dark, 15 can't offer clean water, 17 lack even a toilet and eight stand exposed, wall-less, to the city's sprawl. Peshawar, not some remote hillside village!
Think about that for a second. We send our children off to elite schools in cars, armed with water bottles, packed lunches and backpacks stuffed with textbooks. Meanwhile, countless children in this country walk into schools that don't even have a toilet. Is this the dignity we promise every child under the Constitution?
Yet, millions don't even get this indignity because they never enter a school at all. Thirty-seven per cent of children in K-P are out of school altogether. That's millions of futures we're snuffing out before they even begin. Nearly eight out of every 10 children in Lower and Upper Kohistan never even make it into a classroom. In Peshawar alone, over half a million are out of school — of those, 319,000 are girls. It's not a gender gap anymore; it's a gulf.
And if you thought the ones lucky enough to be enrolled were at least getting a decent education, think again. Because unable to fund enough textbooks, the province now prints half and asks schools to source the rest from promotees, turning scarcity into strategy.
The hand-me-down model might sound thrifty, but in practice, it's a debacle. Most old books either fall apart, go missing or are defaced with scribbles, tears and tea stains. And let's be honest: a lot of students just don't return them. So expecting this to work as a long-term plan isn't just lazy or absurd; it's negligent!
What all this adds up to is a blatant violation of Article 25-A of the Constitution which guarantees every child the right to free and compulsory education. It also tramples all over the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Free Compulsory Primary and Secondary Education Act, 2017. Laws on paper, like fire alarms in buildings no one checks.
Turning this around requires the provincial government to act decisively across several fronts.
First, it needs to stop pretending its job is done at enrolment. Children need functioning schools, not just roll numbers. Fixing basic infrastructure — electricity, toilets, clean water, boundary walls — isn't some high-minded reform; it's the minimum standard of decency.
Second, launch a real plan - not just window dressing - to bring out-of-school children (OOSC) into the system. This must include targeted efforts in high-need areas like Kohistan — even Peshawar — and the tribal districts, especially for girls left behind in droves.
Third, stop slashing textbook budgets and start facing reality. If the government wants students to reuse books, it must put in place a real system to collect and track them. Or better yet, fund a full print run, because this isn't where we should be paisa-pinching.
This isn't a resource issue; it's a priority issue. And so far, our priorities are glaringly apparent in every broken classroom, every empty desk and every torn-up textbook.
K-P is failing its children. And if this doesn't set off alarms, maybe we've failed too. Because at the very least, K-P's children deserve better. That shouldn't be a radical thing to say.

Maharaj surprised by Klaasen's retirement,"US
He says Klaasen is still young, in fact younger than him
South Africa's veteran spinner Keshav Maharaj on Tuesday praised Heinrich Klaasen's significant impact on national cricket and reflected on the defining moments of Klaasen's career.
He highlighted Klaasen's skill, resilience and the important role he played in major tournaments despite a relatively short international stint.
Speaking in an ICC interview while preparing for the World Test Championship final, Maharaj reacted to Klaasen's surprise retirement decision by lauding the wicketkeeper-batter's influence on the modern game.
""He is probably one of, if not the most feared batsmen, especially in the white-ball game these days. Yeah, it is sad to know that he is walking away. He is still young — he is younger than me. But you know, we can only wish him well. I am sure he has his reasons as to why, and you have got to respect that,"" Maharaj said.
Maharaj paid tribute to the retiring Klaasen, recognising the huge void his departure would create in the South African lineup.
""It is amazing to see how his journey transitioned — from being in and out of the team, probably not knowing where he stood, to one series that really changed the game.
It is a huge boot to fill within the lineup. But I know he'll still be here supporting us and making sure that we get over the line in this game as well,"" he added.
Maharaj recalled the series against Australia in 2020 as a turning point for Klaasen, which marked his rise in ODI cricket.
He also remembered Klaasen's heroic performance in the 2024 T20 World Cup final, describing it as a testament to his world-class talent.
He brought us back into the game and gave us a little bit of hope. We probably did not cross the final hurdle, but it was super special to witness the caliber and skill of the player come out in a game of that magnitude. It just shows why he's world-class,"" he concluded.
It is pertinent to mention that South Africa wicketkeeper-batter Klaasen on Monday announced his retirement from international cricket with immediate effect.
The decision means Klaasen, who will be 34 next month, played his last game for South Africa in the Champions Trophy semi-final defeat to New Zealand in Lahore in March.
Klaasen made his international debut in 2018 during an ODI series against India and went on to represent South Africa across all three formats over a seven-year career.
ODIs proved to be his most successful format, where he played 60 matches and scored 2,141 runs at an average of 43.69 and an impressive strike rate of 117.05, including four centuries and 11 half-centuries.
Among his standout performances was a blistering 174 off just 83 balls against Australia at Centurion in 2023 — the highest individual score by any batter at No. 5 in ODI history.
In T20 Internationals, Klaasen featured in 58 matches, amassing 1,000 runs at a strike rate of 141.84, with five half-centuries to his name.
He also appeared in four Test matches, scoring 104 runs at an average of 13.00.
The wicketkeeper batter last played for South Africa in March this year during the ICC Champions Trophy semifinal against New Zealand. He was dismissed for just three runs off seven balls, as the Proteas lost the match by 50 runs.

'Own resources used in conflict with India',"US
CJCSC warns lowering of threshold where cities are focal targets is dangerous for both India and Pakistan
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza told BBC that Pakistan fought the recent 96-hour conflict with India using only its own resources.
His remarks counter reports from Indian media claiming China's military assistance to Pakistan during the clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours last month.
General Mirza emphasised that Pakistan used equipment comparable to India's and procured some military hardware from other countries. He highlighted that previous skirmishes were limited to disputed areas and did not reach the international border.
However, he continued, ""This time the borders were relatively peaceful and this time the cities were hot.""
He argued that this lowering of threshold where cities are considered focal targets is dangerous for both India and Pakistan in any future conflict.
Tensions between Pakistan and India soared after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, killing 26 in IIOJK. India blamed Pakistan-based elements without presenting any evidence, which Islamabad denied calling for an independent probe. India closed the Wagah border, revoked visas, and suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, prompting Pakistan to call it an ""act of war.""
Explosions hit Pakistani cities on May 67, as India launched air attacks on Pakistan. Pakistan retaliated with Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, targeting Indian military sites. A US-brokered ceasefire was later announced after escalating military exchanges.
""This affects the trade, investment and development needs for 1.5 billion people,"" Gen Mirza said. ""There is no formalised conflict resolution or management mechanism at the moment. The Director-General of military operations of both countries have a hotline that is regularly used on Tuesday to exchange issues and information, and is available on currents if any untoward situation like this, and it can be used at any time. However, this is the only option available.""
He warned that future conflicts may not remain confined to specific regions and criticised the absence of an effective and organied mechanism to resolve Indo-Pak disputes.
He continued that if there is only one defence mechanism available at all times and it faces an Indian polity with a reckless and extremist mindset, then the time window for intervention substantially decreases.
He concluded by saying, ""With the absence of any conflict management system, the chances of this conflict spiraling remain high"".
Regarding emergency communications, the chairman noted reliance solely on DGMO hotlines and expressed concern that extremist mindsets limit international intervention time.
He added that global powers, including the US, have limited time left for mediation.
Previously, Pakistan on June 2 strongly criticised recent comments by Indian leaders, describing them as reflective of a hostile and dangerous mindset that undermines regional peace.
The statement from Pakistan's Foreign Office followed remarks made by India's Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson on May 29, when he claimed that talks on Kashmir would only proceed if Pakistan ""hands over Azad Jammu and Kashmir"" to India.

'Sana's murder a case of repeated rejections',"IT
Sleuths claim to have arrested 22-year-old perpetrator within 20 hours of killing
Islamabad police on Tuesday claimed to have arrested the prime suspect in the murder of popular TikToker Sana Yousuf within 20 hours of the incident, saying the teen was killed for repeatedly rejecting the advances of the suspect.
According to the police, the killing occurred in an upscale area of the capital, where a masked and armed assailant entered her home in the evening and opened fire before fleeing the scene.
Sana was rushed to a nearby hospital but succumbed to her injuries.
Police initially termed the incident a targeted killing and accelerated their investigation. According to Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi, authorities employed modern technology, including CCTV footage and geo-fencing, to trace the suspect's movements and phone activity.
Calling it a high-profile case with significant public pressure, the IG stated that law enforcement officials worked tirelessly and made the arrest using all available resources. The arrested individual has reportedly confessed during initial interrogation, and police have recovered the weapon used in the crime along with the victim's mobile phone. A case has been registered, and officials say the charge sheet will soon be submitted to the court.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi praised the police for their prompt action, saying the resolution demonstrates that there is no place for lawlessness in the country.
Meanwhile, social media users have reacted strongly, demanding justice and the harshest possible punishment for the perpetrator. Followers and supporters of Sana Yousuf have appealed to the government for exemplary action to deter such crimes in the future.
Police assure that the case is being handled as a model investigation and that judicial proceedings will be expedited to deliver justice to the victim's family.
Hailing from Chitral, Sana was a populer TikTok star. Her body was transferred to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) for a post-mortem examination.
Initially, the police said they were investigating the incident but have not yet been able to apprehend the suspect.
They also said the suspect may have been a guest at the victim's house at the time of the murder.
""The suspect entered the house, fired multiple shots, and then fled the scene,"" said police.
Sympathies and condemnations poured in following the brutal murder.
""A young woman Sana Yousaf full of dreams, hope, and courage was silenced simply for daring to exist online. Her presence on social media was met with violence, and her life was stolen in cold blood. She deserved to live. To thrive. To speak. We must mourn her. And we must rise,"" a netizen said.

"Commuters urge metro, electric bus fare review","US
The decision has particularly affected low-income groups
Commuters on Tuesday appealed the concerned authorities to reconsider the increase in metro and electric bus fares, terming the decision a burden on those using this service on daily basis.
According to them, the fare has doubled from Rs50 to Rs100 per ride, sparking widespread discontent among daily passengers who rely on these services for affordable transportation.
The decision has particularly affected low-income groups, who rely heavily on these subsidised services.
Nasreen Bibi, a widow and domestic worker, expressed her frustration, saying, ""Paying Rs100 for a one-way trip is unaffordable for me. How will I manage Rs200 per day just to get to work and return back."" She added that the fare increase has added considerable strain to her finances, particularly since she is the sole earner for her family.
Citizen Aleem Danish said that with limited public transport options, commuters have to pay the higher fare, adding he has to pay Rs200 daily just for transportation. ""This is unsustainable and the authorities need to reconsider this decision.""
The students have also demanded relief from the authorities, urging them to review the fare structure and introduce more affordable options for daily commuters.

Fertiliser firms fined for price fixing,"PK
CCP slaps Rs375m in penalties over cartel behaviour; FMPAC to challenge order in court
The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has cracked down on alleged collusion in the fertiliser sector, imposing Rs375 million in penalties for creating a monopoly and extracting billions from farmers. In response, the Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC) has announced it will challenge the CCP order in court.
Interestingly, these fertiliser barons had previously refused to pay multi-billion rupee dues on account of the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC), instead obtaining stay orders from the courts. They had collected billions from farmers but failed to deposit these funds in the national exchequer — a matter that remains unresolved.
The CCP, a watchdog for anti-competitive practices, launched a suo motu inquiry and imposed a penalty of Rs50 million on each of the six major urea manufacturers, along with a Rs75 million fine on FMPAC, totalling Rs375 million. The penalised companies include Fatima Fertiliser Limited, Fauji Fertiliser Company Limited, Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Limited, Fatima Fertiliser Company Limited, Engro Fertiliser Company Limited, and Agritech Limited.
According to the CCP's findings, these firms, in coordination with their trade association FMPAC, ran an 'awareness campaign' that effectively amounted to fixing urea prices nationwide. The Bench, comprising Dr Kabir Ahmed Sidhu and Salam Amin, concluded that this activity violated Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2010.
While the manufacturers claimed to be setting prices independently, they failed to justify the remarkably synchronised pricing strategy. The CCP investigation revealed that the practice distorted competition and harmed farmers — particularly during the critical Rabi and Kharif seasons — by artificially inflating fertiliser prices and limiting market choices.
The companies' attempt to shield themselves under the 'state action doctrine' was also dismissed. The CCP Bench found no formal government directive, or compulsion, to justify their collusive behaviour. Instead, the firms exploited a government instruction about raising awareness among farmers regarding urea prices. They used this as cover to jointly announce uniform urea prices across the country. The bench held that such ""actions, taken under the pretext of complying with government instructions, effectively undermined market dynamics and distorted competitive pricing mechanisms.""
The CCP expressed concern that despite differences in input costs, economies of scale, market size, and gas prices, all six companies were selling a urea bag for the identical price of Rs1,768. The bench remarked that in a market where each company's production capacity and market share are publicly known, such coordinated disclosures cannot be viewed as incidental or competitively benign. Rather, the joint announcement amounted to overt collusion.
Repeated directives from the Fertiliser Review Committee (FRC) also went unheeded, with companies failing to address supply imbalances. Notably, the CCP had earlier warned fertiliser manufacturers and FMPAC in 2010, 2012, and 2014warnings that did not lead to lasting change.
The CCP chairman reiterated that trade associations should not serve as platforms for sharing price-sensitive information or coordinating pricing strategies. The Commission reaffirmed its commitment to ensuring competitive markets, protecting consumer welfare, and holding violators accountable. In response to the CCP's order, FMPAC issued a statement asserting it had no role in pricing decisions. It clarified that it does not determine or coordinate the pricing of urea or any other fertiliser product. As a non-commercial advisory body, FMPAC claimed it has never engaged in price-setting activities, and any implication otherwise is factually incorrect.
FMPAC stated that the controversial advertisement was published under a formal directive from the federal government, communicated via the Fertiliser Review Committee (FRC).
During the FRC's meeting on November 25, 2021 — held amid concerns about urea hoarding and market manipulation — it was resolved to initiate a public awareness campaign. FMPAC was directed to publicise the prevailing market price, which had already been acknowledged during the proceedings.
FMPAC insisted that it acted in good faith to implement the government's directive, without involvement in setting or proposing the published price. The intent, it said, was to ensure transparency and protect farmers from exploitative practices — not to distort market dynamics.
FMPAC plans to contest the CCP's interpretation and pursue legal remedy through the appropriate appellate forum. The Council expressed confidence that a fair and comprehensive review would confirm its actions were lawful and transparent.

Stamp shortage halts judicial proceedings,"US
Vendors sell Rs50 stamp for Rs100, Rs100 for Rs150, and Rs500 stamp for Rs800
Court fee stamps have run out in Rawalpindi's District Courts and Judicial Complex for the last few days, halting the registration of new cases and making the litigants inconvenient in routine legal processes.
For the past week, stamps of Rs20, Rs40, Rs50, Rs100, and Rs 500 denominations have not been available.
As a result, the registration of new cases has come to a standstill, and litigants are facing serious difficulties in filing judicial applications and obtaining certified copies of case documents.
The District Treasury has also halted the collection of payments from stamp vendors for the issuance of these stamps, instructing them that no challans should be accepted until a fresh supply of court fee stamps arrives.
Some vendors, who anticipated the shortage, purchased large quantities of court fee stamps two weeks ago and are now selling them on the black market. A Rs20 stamp is being sold for Rs50, Rs40 for Rs70, Rs50 for Rs100, Rs100 for Rs150, and the Rs500 stamp is being sold for Rs700 to Rs800.
According to sources in the District Treasury, the Punjab government is planning to increase the prices of court fee stamps in the upcoming budget, which is why the printing of stamps at the old rates has been discontinued. New stamps will be printed according to the revised rates.
Stamp vendors have complained that since May 27, they haven't received any stamps despite submitting the required challans. Vendor Naveed Khan complains that the shortage has severely impacted their business, and he hasn't sold a single court fee stamp in the past five days.
Lawyers Shahnzaib Khan, Kaneez Fatima, and Malik Amir Advocate are of the view that the judicial system cannot function without court fee stamps, which are essential for court decisions, record keeping, and the filing of new civil cases.
The entire judicial process at the courts has been paralysed due to the unavailability of these stamps, and access to certified copies from the record room has also been suspended. Dozens of cases are pending as a result.
The president of the District Bar Association, Sardar Manzar Bashir, has warned that if court fee stamps are not supplied within 24 hours, the bar will launch a strong protest.
He urged Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema to take immediate notice of the situation and ensure the prompt supply of court fee stampsor alternatively, allow payment collection until the new stamps are made available.

Cambridge students protest against Israel,"US
Demonstrators accused university of funding genocide
Students at the University of Cambridge in the UK set up a protest encampment Monday demanding that the educational institution end all investment ties with Israeli companies and firms supporting or supplying arms to Israel.
The protest began under the famous ""Newton Tree"" at Trinity College, believed to be a descendant of the tree that inspired Isaac Newton's theory of gravity. In response, college authorities erected wooden barriers and tarpaulin to block the area from view and demanded an end to the protest. Students then moved their tents to nearby St John's College.
To protect their education and privacy, many students covered their faces and concealed their identities. Speaking to Anadolu, a protester identifying as Hancock Davies claimed the university has millions of pounds invested in the Israeli arms company Elbit Systems.
""Trinity College ordered an eviction because they don't understand our demands. Their only response is suppression. They refuse to take responsibility for the sources of their financial gains,"" Davies said.
Davies emphasised the students' solidarity with Palestinians, calling on Trinity to sever ties with companies complicit in what he described as genocide.
""People here don't want to live next to institutions that profit from or support massacres abroad,"" he added.
Another protester, identifying himself as Carl, urged all Cambridge colleges to follow King's College, which has begun reviewing its investment partnerships in response to student demands.
Carl said students also want scholarships for Palestinian students and support for rebuilding Gaza's education system, which has been devastated by Israeli military attacks.
""Cambridge is one of the most powerful and wealthy institutions in the UK. It has the means to support Gazan students and researchers,"" he said.
""But continuing academic and financial ties with occupying forces sends a message that genocide is normal."" Andalou

While calling low-scale tremors ""a good thing"" due to the release of the earth's energy, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also warned of the possibility of a major earthquake, citing concerns over pre-shocks that often precede larger seismic events.
""I studied earthquake engineering long ago these low-scale tremors are actually a good thing - the earth is releasing its energy,"" he added.
Speaking to reporters after inaugurating a rehabilitation centre for children with physical and neurodevelopmental conditions in Karachi, Shah criticised the decision to evacuate inmates from prison due to the tremors.

Section 144 imposed near Punjab airports,"US
.
In a move to bolster aviation safety and security, the Punjab Home Department has imposed Section 144 within a 15-kilometre radius of all airports and Pakistan Air Force (PAF) airbases across the province.
The restrictions will be in effect from June 5 to June 20.
Under the order, a complete ban has been placed on pigeon flying, fireworks, the use of drones or laser lights and the disposal of animal waste within the designated perimeter.
The decision has been taken in the interest of protecting human lives and property and to ensure the smooth operation of flight services.
The Home Secretary of Punjab issued the restrictions under Section 144(6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, citing that such activities pose serious threats to flight safety and operations.
Open disposal of sacrificial remains, in particular, attracts birds, which can pose severe risks to aircraft and passenger safety.
The directives apply uniformly across all civil airports and PAF airbases in Punjab.
All deputy commissioners have been instructed to ensure strict implementation of the ban and to maintain enhanced cleanliness in areas surrounding airports and airbases.
A spokesperson for the Punjab Home Department emphasised that the move is a preventive measure aimed at mitigating potential hazards during the Eidul Azha period, a time when instances of open waste disposal and celebratory activities traditionally increase.

South Punjab enjoys cattle market boom,"US
Thousands invest months of labour into rearing animals for Eid
For many, Eidul Azha is not just a religious occasion but a season of long-awaited income.
Muhammad Hussain, a small farmer from Pipli Adda in Vehari, raises cattle all year round with devotion. ""This is our crop,"" he says, gently brushing his prized bull. ""I don't grow wheat only but I grow bulls also. Eid is our harvest season.""
He feeds the cattle hand-cut grass, sings to them and decorates them in anticipation of buyers who arrive from cities, seeking healthy, attractive animals for sacrifice.
Hussain is not alone. Thousands like him across South Punjab invest months of labour, love and money into rearing animals, hoping for good returns on the Eid.
The region known for its agricultural lifestyle transforms into a thriving economic market fueled by livestock trade during the season.
Connecting the dots are people like Malik Nadeem, a middleman in Chak 34/WB who facilitates deals between farmers and urban customers.
""I bring animals from remote villages to markets in Multan, Vehari and Lahore. It's not easy, but this is our season to earn after a year of struggle,"" he shares while supervising the loading of cattle onto rickshaws and mini-trucks under the summer sun.
The economic activities do not stop with the sale of animals. A network of support emerges.
Allah Dittah, a young grass seller from Chah Darkhanwala, says he sells bundles of fodder at twice the usual rate before the Eid. ""People buy the best for their animals in these days."" His stall outside the local market never shuts during the Eid week.
Then there is Sufi Nazeer, who sells ornamental accessories for animals, including necklaces, bells, colourful ropes and embroidered sheets. ""When a child loves his bull, he decorates it like a bride,"" he stated. His Eid sales sustain his family for months. The story continues even after the sacrifice. Allah Rakha collects animal hides door to door.

Did Mozart have any friends?,"US
Annual festival explores classical composer's social circle
If the famous composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart were a child prodigy today, he would probably have millions of followers and ""friend"" requests on social media, as per DW.
But even in the 18th century, Mozart's father Leopold warned his son against false friends - people who envied him, but also flatterers who only told him what he wanted to hear.
This year's Mozartfest Würzburg, which started last week and runs through June 22, is about Mozart's friendships.
The festival in Würzburg is the oldest and largest Mozart festival in Germany, held every year at the Würzburg Residence, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The festival's motto this year, ""But through sound: friend Mozart,"" refers to one of his quotes, and how music was his main form of expression - and connection.
""A true friendship requires trust and mutual understanding,"" says artistic director Evelyn Meining, adding that even millions of followers on social media platforms cannot replace such a relationship.
Friendless child prodigy
Mozart caused a sensation in the mid-18th century as a so-called wunderkind. He travelled with his father through Europe for years, captivating court nobles with his talent on the violin and piano. But there was no time for close friendships with his peers.
""Of course, the family was very focused on itself; the bond was particularly strong in the early 1760s,"" Meining told DW.
Even later, one cannot imagine Mozart hanging out with friends at cosy dining events. ""These were more likely relationships built within a musical context: colleagues, musician friends, teachers, patrons or orchestra musicians from the bands,"" explains Meining.
Artistic friendships play a special role among the performers at the Mozartfest this year. The opening event featured friends Nils Mönkemeyer (viola) and William Youn (piano), accompanied by the Ensemble Resonanz under conductor Riccardo Minasi. Mönkemeyer and Youn met through music. They love Mozart's works, but they also wanted something more modern for their performance.
They therefore commissioned Manfred Trojahn, who has made a name for himself with modern operas, to write a new piece: Trame lunari, a double concerto for viola, piano and chamber orchestra that facilitates an unusual combination of instruments. Trame lunari translates roughly as ""moon phantoms.""
""There are many color changes in the piece, many nuances of lighting, and that's what the title refers to,"" Trojahn told DW.
He appreciates the transparency of Mozart's music. ""My composition should be light and transparent, just like Mozart's works,"" Trojahn explains.
Mönkemeyer and Youn are a well-rehearsed team. They performed sometimes extremely delicate sounds with nuance and sensitivity.
Haydn, fatherly friend
Mozart is still considered a role model for many musicians today. He himself had role models such as the composer Joseph Haydn and Bach's son, Johann Christian Bach, whom he admired for his elegant, light music.
Joseph Haydn was 24 years older than Mozart. They developed a friendly father-son relationship, and Mozart wrote in letters that Haydn was his ""dearest friend."" In 1785, he dedicated six string quartets to Haydn, to whom he handed the scores, saying they were his ""children.""
The horn player Joseph Leutgeb was also one of Mozart's close friends. Mozart wrote humorous taunts into his scores, such as ""For you, Mr Donkey.""
Mozart was also friends with Anton Stadler, one of the best clarinetists of his time. He composed a clarinet quintet and a clarinet concerto for him.
Later, as Mozart became increasingly ill and lonely, he wrote that music was essentially his only friend.
'False friends'
And what about the false friends Mozart's father worried about?
One of them appears in Milos Forman's 1984 film, Amadeus: Antonio Salieri is portrayed in the film as a mediocre composer and as Mozart's adversary, scheming behind Mozart's back and even poisoning him.
Although this narrative has long since been refuted, it remains a popular belief. Evelyn Meining wants to dispel such clichés at the Mozartfest: ""Salieri was not a vicious competitor. That's all untrue,"" she says. Nor was he a failure living in Mozart's shadow, but a respected court composer. ""Mozart and Salieri held each other in high esteem,"" Meining adds.
'Black Mozart'
Joseph Bologne, Chevalier de Saint-Georges, is also portrayed as Mozart's rival in literature and in the film Chevalier (2022), directed by Stephen Williams.
Born in Guadeloupe in 1745, the son of a white French nobleman and a Black slave, he came to France as a child. He made a name for himself early on as a violinist and composer.
Haydn later composed for Bologne's own orchestra. Bologne was also considered for the position of director of the Academie Royale de Musique, but racial discrimination prevented his appointment.
The violin duel between Mozart and Bologne depicted in the film Chevalier never actually took place. It is questionable whether Bologne, nine years older than Mozart, even had direct contact with him as a young musician.
As composers who were active at the same time and were celebrated artists in their circles, it has simply been since assumed that they were competitors, explains Meining. Even the label ""Black Mozart"" for Joseph Bologne only came about posthumously.
The festival's ""Mozart Laboratory"" hosts discussions on the topic of friendship, with a focus on artistic associations and social networks. ""Because, of course, we are in the midst of a revolutionary social transformation, strongly driven by new digital developments such as the internet, social media and AI,"" says Meining.
To counteract this, there will also be concerts held in private homes, where like-minded people can come together and perhaps rediscover music as a ""medium of friendship.""
Who knows, the event might lead to new friendships.

Govt College University without deans,"US
Despite presence of eligible professors, no academic heads appointed since varsity's upgrade; ex-VC silent on delay
Government College University Hyderabad — the only public-sector university in the city — has been operating without Deans of Faculties since its inception, with all academic departments lacking officially appointed academic heads for over four years.
The institution, formerly Government College Kali Mori, was granted university status by the Sindh government after completing a century of its establishment.
Professor Nasir Ansar, then the college principal, served as the university's acting Vice Chancellor for nearly two years. Subsequently, the provincial government appointed Dr. Tayyaba Zarif as the university's first permanent Vice Chancellor following a formal selection process. She recently completed her four-year term and is once again in the running for reappointment. In the interim, Dr. Amjad Arain is serving as the acting Vice Chancellor.
Sources in the Sindh government told The Express Tribune that throughout Dr. Zarif's tenure, no summary was submitted to the Chief Minister of Sindh — the university's controlling authority — for the appointment of Deans, even though qualified candidates were available. As a result, all three academic faculties — Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, and Computing & IT — have continued to operate without formal academic leadership. Key academic decisions, including those made by the Boards of Faculties, were taken without officially designated Deans.
Currently, six professors are serving across the three faculties. These include Dr. Abdul Mannan Shaikh, Dr. Altaf Ahmed, Dr. Shakeel Ahmed, Dr. Amjad Ali, Dr. Abdul Razzaq Lark, and Dr. Imtiaz Ali Brohi — all of whom were promoted to full professor between 2022 and 2024. However, no summary for their appointment as Deans was initiated during that period.
Following Dr. Zarif's departure, sources say the university's Director of Human Resources, Najam-ud-Din Sahoo, has now submitted a summary to the Department of Universities and Boards for the appointment of Deans.
Efforts were made to contact Dr. Zarif for her comments on the matter. She was approached via phone and WhatsApp, but no response was received.

Rising stars headline Blackcaps Central Contracts,"US
Mitch Hay, Muhammad Abbas, Zak Foulkes and Adi Ashok are included in new contracts
A quartet of exciting talents has earned first-time BLACKCAPS central contracts for the 2025-26 season, with Mitch Hay, Muhammad Abbas, Zak Foulkes and Adi Ashok set to bolster New Zealand's ranks.
Hay, a 24-year-old keeper-batsman from Canterbury, struck an unbeaten 99 off 78 balls to anchor New Zealand's ODI innings against Pakistan earlier this year, and also set a world record with six dismissals in a T20I during his debut tour in Sri Lanka in November.
Twenty one year-old Wellington allrounder Muhammad Abbas smashed a record-breaking 52 off 26 balls on his ODI debut against Pakistan in March, setting the fastest fifty on debut in men's ODIs.
He also showcased his left-arm pace bowling in the same match, claiming Mohammad Rizwan as his maiden ODI wicket.
Foulkes (22) made his T20I debut for the BLACKCAPS against Pakistan last year, stepping in for the injured Adam Milne and impressing with his all-round skills. He made his ODI debut in November.
Auckland leg-spinner Adi Ashok (22) rounds out the newcomers, returning to the BLACKCAPS ODI squad earlier this year after making his debut in 2023, and most recently starring with a five wicket haul in New Zealand A's win over Bangladesh A at Sylhet. The selection process, managed by Chief High Performance Officer Bryan Stronach and overseen by NZC, involved BLACKCAPS head coach Gary Stead, selector Sam Wells, assistant coaches Jacob Oram and Luke Ronchi, and Performance Manager Mike Sandle.
A statistical review of domestic and international performances across Test, ODI, and T20I formats informed the rankings, with the final 20 players selected based on past performances, the 2025-26 schedule, and their likelihood of representing New Zealand.
NZC Chief Executive Scott Weenink hailed the new additions as a sign of New Zealand cricket's bright future.
""The contracts with Mitch, Muhammad, Adi and Zak reflect the incredible talent coming through our system,"" Weenink said.
""These players have shown they can compete at the highest level, and their hunger to represent the BLACKCAPS is exciting.
""We're thrilled to see this group drive our team forward.""
Weenink added: ""The list captures the depth and versatility of our talent pool. With a packed season ahead, including the ICC T20 World Cup in February, these players are ready to make their mark and inspire fans across New Zealand."" Tim Southee (retired), Ish Sodhi, Ajaz Patel, and Josh Clarkson, all of whom were centrally contracted in 2024-25, were not offered contracts this year. Discussions on casual playing contracts for players such as Kane Williamson, Devon Conway, Finn Allen, Tim Seifert, and Lockie Ferguson, are ongoing.
The full list of players centrally contracted for 2025-26 is: Muhammad Abbas, Adithya Ashok, Tom Blundell, Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Jacob Duffy, Zak Foulkes, Mitch Hay, Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Henry Nicholls, William O'Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mitchell Santner, Ben Sears, Nathan Smith, Will Young.

Two witnesses record testimonies in gifts case,"US
Imran's counsel completes cross examination; court to resume hearing on 11th
Two more prosecution witnesses on Tuesday gave their testimonies in a case related to alleged misuse of the official gift repository rules by PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi during the former's term as the prime minister.
Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand conducted the hearing of the case in a courtroom inside Rawalpindi's Central Prison popularly known as Adiala Jail. Both Imran and Bushrawho are detained in the prison facility — attended the hearing.
After the testimonies, the counsel for Imran, Arshad Tabriz, cross-examined both the witnesses. Lawyer of Bushra Bibi, Qosain Faisal Mufti, will cross examine the witnesses at the next hearing.
Bushra Bibi had refused to attend the last hearing of the case — also called the Toshakhana II casedespite repeated summonses by the court. The judge had later warned of cancelling her bail in the case.
The court will resume hearing on June 11.
According to the charge-sheet, Imran misused his position to acquire a Bulgari jewelry set that the Saudi crown prince presented as a gift during the couple's visit to Saudi Arabia between May 7 and 10, 2021.
The set included a ring, bracelet, necklace, and a pair of earrings. According to the evidence gathered during the investigation, Imran and Bushra unlawfully retained the set.
On May 18, 2021, the deputy military secretary informed the section officer of Toshakhana about the need to assess and declare the price of the gift, but it was not deposited.
Bulgari sold the necklace for 300,000 euros and the earrings for 80,000 euros to a Saudi franchise on May 25, 2018. However, the price of the bracelet and ring could not be determined.
As of May 28, 2021, the total estimated value of the Bulgari jewelry set was approximately Rs75,661,600. The necklace alone was valued at Rs56,496,000, and the earrings at Rs15,065,600.

FAFEN gives Sialkot by-poll all clear,"US
Says barring isolated violations, polling environment remained peaceful
During a by-election at Sialkot PP-52 constituency on Sunday, observers belonging to the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) documented persistent instances of illegal campaigning near polling stations, isolated violations of voter identification, ballot processing, and counting procedures.
In a three-page report issued on Tuesday, Fafen, however, noted that the general environment around polling stations remained largely peaceful on the polling day.
PML-N's candidate Hina Arshad Warraich received the highest number of votes in the by-election held after the seat fell vacant because of the demise of her father Arshad Warraich. Both the PTI and the PPP had later accused the ruling party of using state machinery to win the polls.
The report said the by-election was marked by a slight decrease in voter turnout and a reduction in the number of invalid votes compared to the 2024 General Elections amidst isolated procedural irregularities, including the disruption of the counting process by police officials at a polling station.
Despite a decline in turnout – from 50% to 45% – the margin of victory increased significantly, from 8,535 votes in GE-2024 to 39,684 in the by-poll. The Provisional Consolidated Statement of the Results of Count (Form-47) was finalized at approximately 1:15 am, well within the legal deadline of 2:00 am.
The report cited a particularly serious incident, in which a police contingent entered the premises of Polling Station No 169 when the count of ballots was underway.
""They removed the party agents and observers present in the counting hall and took the election materials and polling staff away with them without waiting for the process to be completed. Fafen was unable to obtain a copy of the result of the count of the polling station for the by-election.""
The report noted that while voter turnout in the by-election was lower than in GE-2024, it was slightly higher than the turnout recorded in the recent NA-213 Umerkot by-election held in April 2025.
Female voter turnout dropped from 47 percent in GE-2024 to 39 percent, while male turnout decreased from 53 percent to 50 percent in the by-election.
""According to Form-47, the PML-N's vote share rose from 41 percent in GE-2024 to 59 percent in the by-election. The runner-up independent candidate, backed by PTI, saw his vote share decline from 35 percent to 29 percent.""
Fafen had deployed ten trained observers including seven men and three women, who observed voting and counting processes at 39 of the 185 polling stations established in the constituency.
According to Fafen observers, around 79 percent of the observed polling stations had party's/candidate's camps in the close vicinity of polling stations while 85 percent polling stations had banners or flags of contesting candidates or parties displayed in their surroundings.
The party camps around polling stations were also displaying campaign materials and distributing voter chits and food to visitors around 23 percent of the observed polling stations. Party-supported vehicles were seen providing transport to voters outside 46 percent of the observed polling stations.
It said the polling officers were observed to be checking the National Identity Cards (NICs), marking the thumbs of the eligible voters with indelible ink, obtaining their thumb impressions on electoral rolls and striking off their names on the electoral rolls at almost all of the observed polling booths.
""However, they were observed to be skipping to loudly call out the name of the voters so that the polling agents could know the identity of incoming voters and match it with their copy of electoral rolls at 49 percent of the observed polling booths,"" it added.

Buyers struggle with cattle costs,"US
Rates of sacrificial animals in twin cities surge by up to 30% ahead of Eidul Azha
Cattle markets in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad have seen a sharp rise in prices ahead of Eidul Azha, leaving many buyers struggling to afford sacrificial animals.
Prices for goats, cows, and buffaloes have surged by up to 30% compared to last year, with traders citing increased costs of feed, transportation, and rising demand as key factors.
Ali Asad, a local buyer, shared his frustration: ""I had budgeted Rs50,000 for a goat, but the same quality now costs Rs70,000. This is putting a huge strain on middle-class families.""
He added that small goats now cost as much as Rs100,000, while the price of a heifer has jumped from Rs150,000 to Rs240,000. Another buyer, Muhammad Arshad, echoed similar concerns, saying many people are being forced to compromise on the size or quality of animals due to unaffordable rates. He called for government intervention and a standardised pricing mechanism to prevent exploitation.
Meanwhile, some buyers are turning to online platforms for more affordable options, a trend that gained popularity during the pandemic.
Cattle trader Muhammad Imtiaz defended the high prices, stating, ""We've seen a significant rise in fodder, fuel, and labour costs. While demand is high, we also need to adjust prices to cover expenses and ensure fair profit."" Despite the inflation, enthusiasm for Eid preparations remains strong, though affordability remains a key concern for many families.

Drive stresses hazards of waste burning,"US
Experts point towards risk of diseases as serious consequence
A recent university campaign organised by the Institute of Urbanism (IoU) in collaboration with the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) and the IIUI Prime Minister Green Youth Movement Club, has drawn attention to the dangers of open waste burning (OWB) and promoted eco-friendly alternatives.
The event, titled ""Let's Learn Why Not to Burn,"" brought together experts, environmental regulators and youth activists to discuss the severe environmental and health risks posed by OWB.
Islamabad produces more than 1,575 tons of waste daily, with a large amount left uncollected, particularly in non-sector areas. Much of this waste is either dumped openly or illegally burned, releasing toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases.
Former Dean of Basic & Applied Sciences, Dr Irfan Khan, warned, ""Burning waste emits harmful substances that can cause respiratory diseases and even cancer.
This practice damages both public health and the environment."" IoU Executive Director Dr Ejaz Ahmad stressed the importance of education and research in tackling the issue. ""Universities must lead in innovation and advocacy to promote sustainable waste management,"" he said. Ashiq Nawaz from Pak-EPA acknowledged enforcement challenges, stating, ""Open burning is banned, but weak implementation and lack of awareness hinder progress.""

Gandapur warns excluding the province will render negotiations incomplete
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur has demanded that the K-P government be made a part of peace talks with neighboring Afghanistan, warning that excluding the province would render the negotiations incomplete.
Addressing a jirga in Peshawar, K-P Chief Minister Gandapur extended felicitations to the entire nation over a befitting response to Indian aggression, saying that PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, despite being unjustly imprisoned, united the entire nation against Indian hostilitiesproving himself a true leader.
Expressing his gratitude to Imran Khan and his supporters, Gandapur said their unwavering stance was instrumental in defending Pakistan. ""Despite political differences, we have forged national unity for the sake of the country's sovereignty and integrity,"" he said.
The chief minister also called on the federal government to avoid imposing taxes on the erstwhile FATA and PATA regions, arguing that the local population is not financially capable of bearing such burdens. ""These areas have been severely affected by the war on terror and require significant investment,"" he emphasized.
Highlighting the sacrifices of people from merged districts, the chief minister urged the federal government to fulfill all promises made to them.
He demanded immediate release of compensation money for people displaced from these regions and called for an end to drone strikes in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, citing civilian casualties.
He also demanded immediate inclusion of the merged districts' share in the National Finance Commission (NFC) award. ""We are not asking for another province's share — we're demanding our rightful due,"" he said.
The chief minister further urged the federal government to release all pending dues owed to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including net hydel profit and the province's full share in tobacco cess. ""These are the rightful entitlements of our people,"" he asserted.
In his address, the chief minister urged the reinstatement of the traditional jirga system to sustainably resolve disputes in the merged districts.
He also demanded Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's inclusion in peace talks with neighboring Afghanistan, warning that excluding the province would render the negotiations incomplete.

"Driven by exports, cement sales rise 2.5%","US
Industry supplies 42.8m tons in July-May FY25 against 41.7m tons last year
Domestic cement sales recorded a year-on-year drop of 1.94% to 34.4 million tons in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year as compared to sales of 35.1 million tons in the same period of last year, according to data released by the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association.
Exports, however, grew 25.73%, which resulted in a marginal overall growth of 2.46% in industry sales from July 2024 to May 2025.
In May alone, cement dispatches rose 8.57% to 4.651 million tons against 4.284 million tons in the same month of last fiscal year.
Local supplies from the industry reached 3.662 million tons in May as compared to 3.362 million tons in May last year, which was higher by 8.93%. Exports jumped 7.27% as volumes increased from 0.922 million tons in May 2024 to 0.989 million tons in May 2025. North-based mills sold 3.261 million tons, up 11.87% against sales of 2.915 million tons last year, while southern mills supplied 1.39 million tons, higher by 1.54% from dispatches of 1.379 million tons.
Cement mills in the northern region dispatched 3.02 million tons to domestic markets, registering an increase of 9.71% against 2.753 million tons in May last year. Sales of southern mills in local markets rose 5.37% to 641,894 tons compared to 609,174 tons last year. Exports from northern mills went up 48.27% as shipments increased from 162,929 tons in May 2024 to 241,578 tons in May 2025. Exports from the south edged down 1.53% to 747,856 tons against 759,456 tons in the previous year.
During the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, total cement dispatches (domestic and exports) were 42.764 million tons, which were 2.46% more than 41.739 million tons during the corresponding period of last year.
Domestic dispatches stood at 34.419 million tons against 35.102 million tons last year, showing a reduction of 1.94%. Exports, on the other hand, showed a healthy increase of 25.73% as volumes reached 8.345 million tons as compared to 6.637 million tons in the previous year.
A spokesman for the cement manufacturers association emphasised that the 1.94% negative growth in domestic sales in July-May FY25 needs to be examined seriously.
""Domestic demand plays a key role in utilising the idle capacity of the cement sector as well as in the overall economic development of the country. The cement industry attracts many allied industries like steel, paints, electrical items, etc and an increase in construction activities lifts the economy as a whole,"" he said. The spokesman was optimistic that the government would consider the industry's plea in the upcoming budget and would announce a reduction in duties and taxes in order to make cement affordable for the masses.

The All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA), Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA), and Karachi Cotton Association have jointly demanded the removal of yarn and fabric from the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) and the abolition of the 18% sales tax on locally produced cotton and yarn.
Speaking at a press conference at APTMA House on Tuesday, APTMA Central Chairman Kamran Arshad, flanked by other industry leaders including Asif Inam, Naveed Ahmed, Khawaja Muhammad Zubair, Jesomal, and Sham Lal, called the policy of zero-rating imports while taxing local production ""anti-national."" Arshad stated that large-scale industries are deteriorating, and the withdrawal of the EFS for local industry has inflicted massive damage, leading to the shutdown of 120 spinning mills and over 800 ginning factories.
He said the textile sector had repeatedly raised concerns with policymakers, including during meetings with International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials, stressing that the industry could not sustain the burden of such heavy taxation. Arshad warned that the government must act before the industry is forced to shut down entirely or relocate abroad, noting that a looming US tariff war has added further pressure.
Arshad claimed that the EFS has brought the industry to the edge of collapse. During talks with the IMF, the delegation highlighted the financial losses the sector had faced under the EFS, but were told the matter lies within the jurisdiction of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). In response to these concerns, the prime minister has constituted a review committee headed by Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal to assess the scheme.
Urging the government to curtail its own spending instead of overburdening industry, Arshad pointed to the iron and steel sector as another example of policy failure, claiming it suffered over Rs300 billion in losses under the EFS. ""If the policy is not reversed, more textile mills will shut down,"" he warned. Karachi Cotton Association representative Sham Lal said cotton production has declined sharply — from 15 million bales to just 5 million — due to misguided government policies.
He criticised the dismantling of the state's traditional ""roti, kapra, makaan"" (food, clothing, shelter) slogan through flawed economic measures. With 120 spinning mills and over 800 ginning units closed, the industry is collapsing, he said, asking where imported American cotton would go if local factories continue to shut down.
Mahesh Kumar of the PCGA added that sugar mills have contributed significantly to the downfall of the cotton sector. He said the ginning industry currently holds 5.5 million bales of unsold cotton and that many ginners are now defaulting on bank loans due to the deteriorating situation.
However, not all stakeholders in the textile sector share the same view. The Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMA) criticised APTMA's stance and defended the EFS. PHMA Chairman Babar Khan called the imposition of sales tax under EFS an anti-export measure and said taxing imports within the scheme would damage the export sector. Khan stressed that value-added textile exporters rely on the EFS and are demanding its restoration to its original framework under SRO 957, as it existed before the 2024-25 federal budget. He argued this would enable the entire textile value chain to benefit from tax exemptions.
Questioning APTMA's change in position, Khan pointed out that the association had supported the scheme since 2021 but was now opposing it. He accused APTMA of misleading propaganda and of undermining the value-added sector, which, according to him, could have helped Pakistan's textile exports cross the $50 billion mark.
The PHMA chief urged the government to ensure equal opportunities for all stakeholders and to reinstate the sales tax exemption on local purchases under the EFS. He said the practice of collecting and then refunding sales tax is inefficient, especially given frequent delays in refunds. Such delays, he added, would create serious liquidity issues for exporters.

Over 200 inmates escape from Malir Jail,"US
Prisoners were brought out from barracks due to tremors
Taking advantage of the chaos during an earthquake, at least 216 prisoners escaped from Malir Jail on Monday midnight amidst firing by security guards.
A robust search operation by the district and jail police and Rangers followed, during which 90 escapees were recaptured, while the rest are still at large.
According to the police, the jail administration evacuated the prisoners from the barracks as a precautionary measure due to the potential danger following the earthquake.
Over 1,000 prisoners gathered near the Mari Gate, causing a stampede. The prisoners took advantage of the situation, broke the locks of the Mari Gate, and started escaping by jumping over the jail walls.
Jail police and Frontier Corps (FC) personnel tried to stop the prisoners by firing warning shots.
However, one prisoner snatched a kalashnikov from a police officer and started firing indiscriminately, injuring two FC personnel and one police officer.
Other prisoners also injured officials with stones and sticks and managed to escape. The intense firing caused panic in the area, and traffic on the National Highway was suspended.
The road from Quaidabad to Malir Jail was closed, resulting in long queues of vehicles between Malir Kala Board and Quaidabad.
A large contingent of District Malir police, Rangers, and FC reached the scene.
The IG and DIG prisons, Superintendent of Jail, SSP Malir, and other senior officials also reached the site.
The Sindh Home Minister, Zia ul Hassan Lanjar took notice of the incident and directed SSP Malir to take immediate action and arrest the escaped prisoners.
He instructed effective measures, surveillance, intelligence, and roadblocks, and ordered strict departmental action against negligent officials.
A house-to-house search was conducted in the surrounding areas.
Locals captured videos of the escaping prisoners and shared them on social media, showing some shirtless prisoners fleeing barefoot and others escaping in six-seat rickshaws.
In the initial search operation, 50 prisoners were arrested from the jail quarters, while Malir City police arrested 19 prisoners from different vehicles, and Sukhan police arrested eight others.
The police also made announcements on mosque loudspeakers to inform the public about the prisoners' descriptions. Identity cards were checked, and suspicious individuals were taken in custody for questioning.
Meanwhile, a woman took her son and his friend back to the jail, one of whom was a drug addict and reached home at 3:30am after escaping.
The woman said, she gave them meal before taking them back to the jail.
She is hopeful that her son would recover from drug addiction in the jail.
IG Sindh Ghulam Nabi Memon also reached Malir Jail on Tuesday morning and received a briefing from the Superintendent on the situation.
Most of the prisoners were jailed in narcotics cases, and several of them had psychological issues.
Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has removed the Inspector General of Prisons and suspended the DIG Prisons and Malir Jail Superintendent over the incident.
Shah termed the incident ""completely unacceptable"" and vowed to hold those responsible accountable, citing gross negligence by jail authorities.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon has said announced that no strict action would be taken against prisoners who voluntarily return within 24 hours.
However, those who fail to return, will be charged under the provisions of jailbreak, which carry a sentence of up to seven years in prison.

Key infrastructure projects face delays,"US
Rs4.38b projects on Mall Road remain incomplete even after 100 days
Two major signal-free road infrastructure projects in Rawalpindi, worth over Rs6.5 billion, have missed their completion deadlines, causing significant inconvenience to residents. These include the Nawaz Sharif Flyover at Khawaja Corporation Chowk on Adiala Road and underpasses on Mall Road at KTM Chowk, Mall Plaza, and the pedestrian underpass at Medicine Market.
While the flyover at Khawaja Corporation Chowk has been completed, carpeting and beautification work remains pending.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had set a deadline of May 31 for its completion, but the project remains unfinished. This project alone costs Rs2.3 billion.
Similarly, the Rs4.38 billion underpasses and pedestrian underpass project on Mall Road, originally set for completion in 45 days, remains incomplete even after 100 days. As a result, access to key locations including hospitals, the Mega Medicine Market, PIA, State Life, and Cantonment offices has been disrupted.
Zahid Bakhtawari, President of Anjuman Shehriyan Rawalpindi, criticised the delay, sayinag the situation has become unbearable for patients and businesses. Promises made to complete the work in 45 days have not been fulfilled.
PML-N MNA from Cantt, Malik Abrar Ahmed, stated efforts are ongoing to prevent further delays. He emphasized that in high-level meetings, authorities have been directed to speed up the work. If both projects are completed within the next 15 days, a joint inauguration could be held, pending the Chief Minister's schedule. While C\&W Department officials had earlier confirmed the May 31 deadline, they are now unwilling to comment on the delay.

Stocks hit record as ADB loan fuels rally,"IT
KSE-100 index surges 1,573 points and settles well above 120k
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday soared to an all-time high above 120,000 points as investor optimism grew following a string of positive economic developments.
The approval of a $800 million loan by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Pakistan's public finance programme and the government's approval of a Rs880 billion Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) bolstered market sentiment.
The KSE-100 index surged to the intra-day high of 1,816 points, before closing the day with an increase of 1,573 points at 120,451. Commercial bank, fertiliser and cyclical stocks led to broad-based gains while higher trading volumes, which reached 578 million shares, reflected renewed investor confidence.
According to Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp, stocks closed at an all-time high, led by across-the-board activity, after the ADB approved a $800 million financing package. Additionally, the government set the FY26 growth target at 4.2% and approved Rs880 billion for the PSDP.
Mehanti added that budgetary relief was expected to be announced for oil refineries, real estate and the agricultural sector. This, alongside the rupee appreciation, played the role of catalyst in bullish close at the PSX.
At the end of trading, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 1,573.07 points, or 1.32%, and settled at 120,450.87.
In its review, Topline Securities commented that bulls maintained their firm grip on the market, propelling the KSE-100 index to a record close at 120,451, supported by renewed investor confidence and an improving macroeconomic outlook.
The index surged to the intra-day high of 1,816 points as momentum picked up sharply after news broke that the ADB had approved a $800 million loan under Pakistan's public finance programme – a major vote of confidence in the country's economic reform trajectory.
Adding fuel to the rally, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) gave its nod to Pakistan's budget proposals, reinforcing hopes of continued fiscal discipline and policy continuity, Topline said.
Driving Tuesday's rally were key index movers including Fauji Fertiliser Company, HBL, Engro Fertilisers, Lucky Cement and Bank AL Habib, which contributed 691 points, it added. In its commentary, Arif Habib Limited (AHL) remarked that the KSE-100 index unlocked 120,000 points at close on Monday, which bodes well for further upside during the remaining week.
Some 65 shares rose while 31 fell, with Fauji Fertiliser Company (+1.79%), HBL (+5.19%) and Engro Fertilisers (+3.56%) contributing the most to index gains. On the flip side, Systems Limited (-0.84%), Service Industries (-1.55%) and Haleon Pakistan (-2.32%) were the biggest drags, it said.
AHL also mentioned that the ADB approved $800 million for Pakistan's public finance programme aimed at strengthening fiscal sustainability and improving financial management.
Meanwhile, the anti-trust body fined fertiliser makers for fixing a higher sale price, which adversely impacted farmers. ""Holding 120k will allow the KSE-100 to extend gains towards 125k,"" it projected.
JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the benchmark index surged throughout the day and reached a historic high at 120,451 points. Buying interest was witnessed across commercial banks, fertiliser and cyclical stocks, driving broad-based gains, he said.
""With the index at the all-time high, a breakout could lead to fresh momentum and attract further institutional participation. We recommend investors to capitalise on this and invest in fundamentally strong stocks in the fertiliser, cement and banking sectors on any intra-day pullbacks,"" Naviwala stated.
Overall trading volumes increased to 578.2 million shares compared with Monday's tally of 497.9 million. The value of shares traded was Rs26.8 billion.
Shares of 467 companies were traded. Of these, 232 stocks closed higher, 187 fell and 48 remained unchanged.

It was followed by Faysal Bank with 26.7 million shares, gaining Rs4.89 to close at Rs53.77 and Invest Bank with 25.5 million shares, gaining Rs0.04 to close at Rs2.35. Foreign investors sold shares worth Rs956 million, the National Clearing Company reported.

Forces kill 7 terrorists in Kachhi, Kalat IBOs
Security forces on Tuesday killed seven alleged terrorists during two separate operations in Kalat and Kachhi district of restive Balochistan.
According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations, security forces carried out an intelligence based operation (IBO) in the Mach general area of district Kachhi on reported presence of ""Fitna-al Hindustan"" terrorists.
""During the operation, our troops effectively engaged the terrorists' location, and after an intense exchange of fire, sent five Indian sponsored terrorists to hell,"" it said.

'Butcher of Bosnia' requests early release,"US
.
Former Bosnian Serb military chief Ratko Mladic, sentenced to life imprisonment in 2017 over genocide and war crimes, requested early release on Tuesday for health reasons.
The notorious general, dubbed the ""Butcher of Bosnia"" for the atrocities he oversaw during the 1992-1995 Bosnian war, said he only has a few months to live.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, sentenced Mladic, who is now over 80 years old, for his role in the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre, in which some 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed in July 1995 by Bosnian Serb forces.
According to a request filed by his lawyer and seen by AFP, the former war leader suffers from an incurable disease and ""his remaining life expectancy is measured in months"".
For years, his entourage has described him as sick and frail, requesting in 2017 his provisional release for health reasons.
""Despite the reluctance of the (United Nations Detention Unit) medical service to give a definitive end-of-life expectancy prognosis on paper, it is undeniable and not in dispute that Mr. Mladic is imminently approaching the end of his life,"" his lawyer wrote. AFP

Rs3.8b wastewater project back on track,"IT
Civil works resume after 18 months of litigation, procurement controversies
After over a year and a half of legal battles, procedural delays, and scrutiny by multiple government bodies, the long-awaited Rs3.845 billion sewerage and wastewater management project in Jaranwala is finally under way.
The project, regarded as a significant step toward meeting climate resilience goals and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the UN and the Government of Pakistan for 2030, is being executed by the Municipal Committee (MC) Jaranwala.
According to official sources, the comprehensive project includes the rehabilitation of municipal services, construction of roads and chowks, upgrading drainage systems, laying of a new sewerage network, and the establishment of a wastewater treatment plant.
Additional components include the provision of liquid waste machinery, solid waste management equipment, model street development, rehabilitation of parks and green belts, and the installation of a disaster management system.
An MC officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that the project had initially faced severe controversy.
Disputes arose during the tendering process when technical and financial bids were invited simultaneously.
Only one firm was declared technically qualified, leading other bidders to challenge the decision in lower courts, the Lahore High Court, and various government institutions including the Anti-Corruption Establishment, Punjab Municipal Development Fund Company (PMDFC), Punjab Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), and the Deputy Commissioner (DC) Faisalabad.
Despite PMDFC's recommendation to include all bidders and the World Bank's intervention through its task team leader, MC Jaranwala proceeded with opening the bids in March and April 2024.
The PPRA called for procurement records, which were not provided, resulting in the cancellation of the tendering process.
The Lahore High Court also issued a stay on the proceedings during this period.
Last year, similar concerns from the World Bank led the Punjab Local Government Department to suspend two key officials of MC Jaranwala, including the chief officer, over procurement irregularities.
These setbacks delayed the project and deprived over 1.5 million residents of essential water and sanitation facilities.
However, Assistant Commissioner and Administrator MC Jaranwala, Rangzeb Goraya, confirmed that the project is now progressing smoothly. ""Civil works have resumed. Key components like the parking shed, several roads and chowks, liquid waste machinery supply, and desilting of sewerage lines have already been completed in record time,"" he stated.
Goraya also disclosed that five new PC-1s for complementary projects — including model streets, road rehabilitation, and solarization of disposal stations — have been finalized.

27 killed near Gaza aid point,"US
.
Twenty-seven people were killed in southern Gaza on Tuesday as Israeli troops opened fire near a US-backed aid centre, with the military saying the incident was under investigation.
United Nations chief Antonio Guterres decried the deaths of Palestinians seeking food aid as ""unacceptable"" and the UN rights chief condemned attacks on civilians as ""a war crime"", after a similar shooting near the same site on Sunday.
Gaza's civil defence agency said that ""27 people were killed and more than 90 injured in the massacre targeting civilians who were waiting for American aid in the Al-Alam area of Rafah"", in the territory's south.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal earlier told AFP the deaths occurred ""when Israeli forces opened fire with tanks and drones"", while Israel said troops fired towards ""suspects"" who had ignored warning shots.
The International Committee of the Red Cross gave the same death toll but without mentioning the Israeli forces.
The organisation said Gazans face an ""unprecedented scale and frequency of recent mass casualty incidents"".
The latest shooting occurred about a kilometre (just over half a mile) from a centre run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which Israel has worked with to implement a new aid distribution mechanism. AFP

"Court bans Thandiani, Taxila crushers","US
.
The Abbottabad Bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) has issued a landmark 31-page judgment, declaring the stone crushing plants on Thandiani Road and Taxila illegal and ordering their permanent closure.
In its detailed verdict, PHC noted that the NOCs (No Objection Certificates) obtained by the stone crushing plant operators from various government officials held no legal validity.
Previously, the Environmental Protection Tribunal, which holds monthly sessions at the Sessions Court Building in Abbottabad, had also ordered the closure of these stone crushing plants for damaging the environment and air quality. However, the plant owners managed to continue their operations by appeasing the police and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Challenging the Environmental Tribunal's decision, the stone crushing plant owners filed writ petitions at the Abbottabad Bench of PHC through their lawyers, including Nasir Aslam and Zafar Iqbal. PHC rejected these petitions and ordered the permanent closure of all stone crushing plants causing environmental harm near residential areas.
This public-interest historic ruling was achieved largely through the efforts of young lawyer Hashim Iqbal Khan Jadoon, who was educated and trained in Canada.

ADB snubs India to approve Pakistan loan,"US
Manila-based lender praises Islamabad's improved macroeconomics
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) on Tuesday approved an $800 million financing package for Pakistan to enhance tax collection and provide guarantees for securing foreign commercial loans by rejecting Indian objections.
The Manila-based lender protected its neutrality by refusing to allow the use of the platform for settling political score by India. The ADB was under pressure from India not to approve the financing package but Pakistan being the founding member has all the rights to secure loans by fulfilling the agreed conditions.
The ADB's local office announced on Tuesday that the lender approved an $800 million programme to strengthen fiscal sustainability and improve public financial management in Pakistan.
The lender stated that the $300 million loan was approved for the Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme and the first-ever policy-based guarantee of up to $500 million had also been approved, which was expected to mobilise financing of up to $1 billion from commercial banks.
It was the second time in the past three weeks that India failed to block Pakistan's external loans, first in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and then in the ADB.
The Indian executive director tried to block the funding on political grounds. The Pakistani executive director apprised the board that India was financing terrorism in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to the Pakistani authorities.
The development came after India had earlier managed to postpone the approval of the $800 million financing package by the ADB for Pakistan for five days by exploiting a lacuna in the rules.
The Pakistani authorities said that the Indian executive director raised the issues of high indebtedness of Pakistan and alleged that the money could be used for other than the stated purposes. The Pakistani executive director replied that India's debt was unsustainable compared to Pakistan. The Indian debt-to-GDP was 80.4% of GDP compared to Pakistan's 73.6%, according to the IMF's data.
The Pakistani executive director apprised the board that India was fuelling terrorism in Pakistan by providing funding to the terrorists in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (K-P).
On the point of using the ADB's funding for other than intended purposes, the board was apprised that raising such questions was tantamount to pointing fingers at the lender's financial management and showed lack of trust.
The board was informed that Pakistan had necessary means and resources to protect its national integrity and it had proven it during the four-day war last month.
Pakistan downed six Indian jet fighters, including Rafaels, during the conflict. The Indian chief of defence staff admitted last week that Pakistan did shoot down Indian jets but he did not disclose the number and the name of the planes.
The ADB board was also apprised that Kashmiris were fighting for their right to self-determination and India should not blame Pakistan.
Prime Minister's Narendra Modi's war hysteria has brought over seven-decade old unresolved issue of Kashmir into the global political and economic discourse. However, Pakistan needs to put its economic house in order by minimising reliance on foreign lenders and consultants. Many Indians work in these multilateral institutions.
There is now a high time that the government should reduce its reliance on the foreign loans, particularly on budget support loans. The ADB's $800 million package is not meant for any development purposes and the money and guarantees will be used to build the foreign exchange reserves.
The government had reached an understanding with two foreign commercial banks for a $1 billion loan on the back of the ADB's guarantees due to its low credit rating. The final term sheet and loan disbursement are subjected to the approval of the ADB's $500 million guarantee.
Pakistan's gross reserves stand at $11.5 billion, which the government wants to increase to over $14 billion by the end of June. The ADB will charge a nominal upfront fee for giving the guarantee.
Despite a recent rating upgrade, Pakistan's credit rating still remains low at B-Negative, which is two notches below the investment grade. Fitch upgraded Pakistan from a substantial default risk to a high risk of default rating.
The ADB's $300 million policy loan is the second tranche under the Resource Mobilisation Programme, which the government wants to take for improving the tax collection by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Pakistan had met all the prior conditions for securing the second loan tranche from the ADB.
""Pakistan has made significant progress in improving macroeconomic conditions,"" said ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan. She added that the new $300 million programme backed the government's commitment to further policy and institutional reforms that would strengthen public finances and promote sustainable growth.
""The programme supports far-reaching reforms to improve tax policy, administration, and compliance, while enhancing public expenditure and cash management,"" stated the ADB. ""It also promotes digitalisation, investment facilitation, and private sector development,"" it added.
These measures aim to reduce Pakistan's fiscal deficit and public debt, while creating space for social and development spending. The ADB said that the new programme is underpinned by a comprehensive support package — including technical assistance and close coordination with development partnersdesigned to help Pakistan build long-term fiscal resilience and stability.

Alcaraz in French Open semi-final hunt,"US
He expects a stiff challenge from Tommy Paul in the French Open quarter-finals
Carlos Alcaraz expects a stiff challenge from Tommy Paul in the French Open quarter-finals on Tuesday, as women's title rivals Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka look to set up a blockbuster clash.
Reigning men's champion Alcaraz is through to the last eight at Roland Garros for the fourth year running and aims to become the third man this century to defend his title, after Gustavo Kuerten and Rafael Nadal.
Alcaraz has dropped a set in each of the past three rounds and said ""I fought against myself in the mind"" after a tough four-set victory over Ben Shelton in the last 16.
The 22-year-old Spaniard holds a 4-2 career record against Paul, the US 12th seed whom Alcaraz beat in the quarter-finals of the Paris Olympics on the way to a silver medal last August.
""I remember that every match that I've played against him he was really tough,"" said Alcaraz.
""His level is really high right now. He has a lot of confidence.
""It's going to be a really interesting match to watch, because every time we play against each other, we rise our level to the top as well.""
If Alcaraz gets past Paul he will meet the winner of Tuesday's other men's quarter-final between in-form Italian Lorenzo Musetti and Frances Tiafoe.Musetti has been one of the form players on clay this season, reaching at least the last four in all three of the principal warm-up events ahead of the French Open.
Both Musetti and US 15th seed Tiafoe are appearing at this stage of Roland Garros for the first time.
Tiafoe, twice a US Open semi-finalist, has yet to drop a set in Paris and is confident he can go even further.
""When I'm playing well, I'm there and present and having fun, I think the sky's the limit for me.""
Swiatek, Sabalenka on collision course
Swiatek arrived at her favourite tournament with serious doubts over her ability to win a fifth French Open in six years after a lengthy trophy drought.
The 24-year-old Pole has not won a title since lifting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen for a third successive edition 12 months ago.
She was put to the test by Elena Rybakina, who led by a set and a break before Swiatek escaped trouble to book a quarter-final with Elina Svitolina.
""It means a lot. I think I needed that kind of win to like feel these feelings that I'm able to win under pressure,"" Swiatek said after reeling off her 25th win in a row at the French Open.
""It's a great confirmation for me. Yeah, I for sure wanted to have a match like that.""
Ukrainian 13th seed Svitolina pulled off an even more remarkable comeback against 2024 runner-up Jasmine Paolini, saving three match points to reach her fifth Roland Garros quarter-final.
The 30-year-old has never advanced to the last four but will hope to finally match husband Gael Monfils' run to the semi-finals in 2008.
That French connection also guarantees Svitolina has her fair share of supporters in Paris.
""For so many years I loved and still loving to play here in France,"" she said.
""The support is amazing. They push me to play better... this is a great feeling to have when the crowd is giving you this extra energy.""
World number one Aryna Sabalenka is on a revenge mission against Olympic champion Zheng Qinwen after losing to the Chinese star in Rome recently.
Zheng beat Sabalenka for the first time in seven attempts and will try to repeat the trick against the player she lost to in the 2024 Australian Open final.
""I expect a great battle, and I'm super excited to face her in the quarter-finals, and I want to get my revenge. Yeah, I want to get this win after Rome,"" said Sabalenka.
Madrid champion Sabalenka feels she is ready to go all the way in Paris, where her best performance was reaching the semi-finals two years ago.
""I think in the last year I improved a lot in my game, and I think now going to the French Open, I don't have those doubts that I cannot play on clay, so maybe I'm more confident this year.""
A win over Zheng could line up an eagerly anticipated last-four showdown with Swiatek.
