Audit report finds over ‘Rs1tr irregularities’ in Punjab,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323674-audit-report-finds-over-rs1tr-irregularities-in-punjab,"ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan, in its report for the audit year 2024–25, has uncovered massive irregularities — including fraud, misappropriation, overpayments, financial mismanagement, mis-procurement and unauthorised retention of consolidated fund receipts — amounting to over Rs1 trillion in the expenditure accounts of the Punjab government.
According to the report, published recently, the key audit findings of the report include 14 cases of fraud and misappropriation amounting to Rs3.1 billion, 50 cases of recoveries/ overpayments and unauthorised payments amounting to Rs25. 4 billion, 21 cases of financial mismanagement amounting to Rs10.6 billion, 45 cases of mis-procurement amounting to Rs43 billion, 12 cases of unauthorised retention of consolidated fund receipts in commercial banks besides imprudent decisions to retain public funds in non-interest bearing accounts by respective autonomous bodies amounting to Rs988 billion, 24 cases of HR-related irregularities amounting to Rs8.2 billion and seven cases of performance-related deficiencies amounting to Rs3.6 billion.
“As a result of the audit, a recovery of Rs25,462.55 million (Rs25.4 billion) was pointed out. Recovery affected from February 2024 to January 2025 was Rs2,239.66 million (Rs2.2 billion) which was verified by Audit,” disclosed the report.
The report identifies internal control lapses pertaining to areas such as financial management, procurement and contract management, hiring of human resources, payroll procedures, handling of assets, as well as overall budgetary planning and execution.
It recommended that the management is required to investigate the matters of misappropriation and fraud for taking action under the law against those held responsible, affect recoveries of overpayments and unauthorised payments and strengthen its recovery mechanism, develop and upgrade internal control checks, reinforced by disciplinary action against government officials involved in malpractices, adhere to the provisions and restrictions as provided and set forth in the Punjab Procurement Rules 2014, curb diversion of provincial consolidated fund receipts outside treasury for retention in commercial banks, follow advertisement-based recruitment through merit-based selections against all posts with a view to strengthen internal controls on HR, ensure stringent monitoring and evaluation on key performance indicators, key result areas for achievement of deliverables for improving project outcomes and improved service delivery targets.
The audit report 2024-25 covers the financial year 2023-2024.
The cases highlighted in the report include non-reconciliation of e-pay online receipts worth Rs282 billion, non-recovery of loan & advances from companies/ development authorities -- Rs352 billion, Long outstanding dues not reported as Receivables -- Rs282 billion, unreported amount of Punjab Consolidated Funds held in Commercial Bank Accounts Rs44 billion and non-deposit of Interest -- Rs2 billion, non-retrieval of illegal encroachment of state land consisting of 541.563 acres, grant of subsidies to ineligible farmers-Rs480 million. Out of Punjab government’s total expenditure, four sectors covered almost 73 percent of the spending which are: Communication & Works 41 percent, Health 15 percent, Education 6 percent and Housing Urban Dev & Public Health Eng 11 percent. “It was notable that although agriculture is considered as an economic driver in Punjab, the spending share of Irrigation Department and Agriculture Department is 4 percent and 5 percent respectively. On the other hand, the remaining (others) 18 percent of spending was divided into departments such as Environmental Protection, Excise & Taxation, Mines & Minerals, Women Development, Forestry and Wildlife & Fisheries Department etc.
Salaries and other employee benefits constituted 25 percent, Repayment of Debts 20 percent and Servicing of Debts 5 percent of the total expenditure. Repair and Maintenance was only 2 percent of the total expenditure, said the report.
The Punjab government is advised to work on improving revenue collection, bring reforms in its budgetary and expenditure management systems to get better value for money. A set of measures aimed at business process re-engineering, enhancing of e-services, raising agricultural productivity, increasing industrial production, receipt of pending claims/ dues, change of rules and regulation, and utilisation of modern research and development tools for resource planning, distribution and monitoring will be fruitful.
In response to the AGP report, Punjab Minister for Information Azma Bukhari said that due process would be followed and the paras would be placed before Special Departmental Accounts Committees (SDACs), and those paras that remain unsettled in the SDACs would be placed before the PAC for consideration. “Decisions of the PAC will be complied with. Until unsettled paras are considered by the PAC, any action would be against the law and procedure and premature,” she concluded.

Benazir Hunarmand Programme: Zardari launches initiative to equip youth with skills,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323675-benazir-hunarmand-programme-zardari-launches-initiative-to-equip-youth-with-skills,"ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday reaffirmed his enduring commitment to social uplift and human development through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), as he launched the Benazir Hunarmand Programme, which aims to provide cutting-edge vocational training to equip youth for global competitiveness.
“Through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), we have empowered millions. Now, with the launch of Benazir Hunarmand Programme, we are equipping our youth with the skills and tools they need to build a better future,” he said while formally inaugurated the Benazir Hunarmand Programme at a ceremony held at Aiwan-e-Sadr, marking a significant step towards youth empowerment through advanced skill development.
First Lady Aseefa Bhutto Zardari, Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan, federal ministers, parliamentarians, foreign diplomats, and other prominent personalities attended the ceremony.
The President formally launched the programme alongside Ms. Aseefa Bhutto Zardari. President Zardari said BISP was based on the philosophy of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Shaheed whose legacy was carried forward by Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, who believed in inclusive prosperity and education for all. “We are determined to realise her vision for the uplift of marginalised segments of society,” the President said.
He emphasised that the programme would provide cutting-edge vocational training, including computer technology, and foreign languages such as German and Chinese, enabling Pakistani youth to compete globally. “We want the children of labourers to learn skills that allow them to support their families with dignity and contribute meaningfully to the nation,” the President said.
Highlighting the importance of the Benazir Hunarmand Programme, President Zardari noted that skills development was crucial not only for national progress but also for preparing a skilled workforce to meet the growing demand in international markets. “We should equip our youth with modern technical skills needed globally,” he remarked.
He particularly stressed the significance of nursing profession, calling it one of the most sought-after fields internationally, and urged that special priority should be given to training in this area.
President Zardari also paid tribute to Syed Naveed Qamar, then finance minister, for his instrumental role in launching BISP back in 2008. “Today, BISP is not just a national success story but a global model in poverty alleviation,” he noted.
Highlighting the international demand for skilled professionals, particularly in nursing, he stressed the need to raise training standards to meet global benchmarks.
The President said the Benazir Hunarmand Programme is a continuation of that legacy, aimed at uplifting communities through empowerment and opportunity.
He reiterated his resolve to ensure that the youth of Pakistan are provided with the skills, education, and opportunities necessary to build a prosperous country.
The President said June 21 was an important day for Pakistan People’s Party as it was the birthday of Benazir Bhutto Shaheed. “It is also a day of sorrow as we lost Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto who guided us with her wisdom and farsightedness,” he added.
Earlier, BISP Chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid addressed the gathering, describing the launch as the realisation of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto’s promise to empower the youth. “Benazir Hunarmand Programme is more than a policy initiative; it is a movement to build a secure and skilled future for Pakistan’s young generation,” she said.
Benazir Income Support Programme Chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid said BISP, since its inception 17 years ago, had become the largest social protection programme. Under the programme, women were declared head of the household and received financial help for their 10 million families, she added.
She said BISP had always been more than a safety net, it was a commitment to inclusion, dignity and transformation of people especially women.
Benazir Hunarmand Programme while using the database of BISP will create an empowered and self-reliant citizenry, which will be capable of participating productively in economic endeavours, she explained.
The programme, she said, would offer practical and demand-driven training in multiple fields enabling critical economic and social change and causing poverty alleviation.
Senator Rubina Khalid praised Aseefa Bhutto Zardari’s active participation in the programme, calling it both symbolic and historic. She also thanked the German government for its continued support and cooperation in advancing the programme’s objectives.
BISP Secretary Aamir Ali Ahmed also spoke at the event, stating that Rs. 716 billion has been allocated for the programme in the upcoming fiscal year.
The ceremony concluded with a symbolic cake-cutting to mark the birth anniversary of Shaheed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, paying homage to her legacy of service, sacrifice, and empowerment.

"IMF has nixed 25% rebate for teachers, NA panel told",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323676-imf-has-nixed-25pc-rebate-for-teachers-na-panel-told,"ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has rejected the FBR’s proposal to allow 25 percent tax rebates to teachers and researchers in the budget 2025-26. In the Finance Bill 2025-26, the FBR proposed a holding period of 12 months for availing the concessionary tax regime on investment made in Special Convertible Rupee Accounts (SCRA).
The National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance met under the chairmanship of Syed Naveed Qamar at the Parliament House on Saturday. While reviewing of Finance Bill, the chairman argued that the condition of “holding period” would discourage investment in the SCRA. The government should set around 3-6 months holding period for making investments in the SCRA. The FBR Chairman endorsed the viewpoint of Naveed Qamar. The FBR Chairman said that we can propose a six-month holding period. The FBR has already discussed the proposal with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). In case of a three-month proposal, this should be subject to the approval of the federal cabinet.
Muhammad Ali Malik, Executive Director of the SBP informed the NA panel online that the proposed amendment had nothing to do with the Roshan Digital Account (RDA). The proposed change is related to the SCRA. There should be some limitation of holding period for keeping investment in SCRA. There is need to discourage short-term investments in the SCRA. If they keep investments above one year period, the concessional tax regime should be applicable. To avoid volatility in market, the holding period should be one year for making investment in the said accounts. According to the SBP assessment, there would be no immediate or significant impact on investment in case one year holding period is introduced, the SBP official added. However, the NA panel proposed six months holding period for availing concessionary tax regime on SCRA investments.
On the rebate for teachers/researchers, the Chairman FBR Rashid Mahmood Langrial informed the National Assembly Standing Committee on Finance that the IMF rejected proposal of the FBR to allow 25 percent tax rebate to teachers and researchers from July 1, 2025. The FBR, he said, approached the Fund twice but they did not agree to it. The IMF wants harmonization of taxes so they did not allow tax rebate to teachers/ researchers. However, he stated that the government could provide a subsidy from its budgetary resources if possible. But the Minister of State for Finance regretted that there is no fiscal space available in 2025-26.
The NA committee recommended that the withholding tax should be increased from 0.6 percent to 0.8 percent on cash withdrawals from banks by non-filers. However, the committee rejected the proposal of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance to raise the tax rate from 0.6 percent to 1 percent.
On the taxation of salaried individuals, FBR Chairman informed that only 1% tax would be applicable on salaried individuals where taxable income exceeds Rs 600,000 but does not exceed Rs 1,200,000.

"Moro violence: Police register FIRs, make arrests",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323677-moro-violence-police-register-firs-make-arrests,"KARACHI: Following a violent protest that erupted in Moro, Naushehro Feroze district, on May 20, 2025, police have reportedly registered at least 13 FIRs against local residents, triggering concerns of human rights violations and political victimization.
The protest, which was against the construction of canals on river Indus and corporate forming, held by activists allegedly affiliated with a nationalist group Jeay Sindh Mutihida Mahaz (JSMM), turned violent when demonstrators clashed with police and later set fire to the house of Sindh’s provincial Home Minister Zia Lanjar. The incident also resulted in the death of two protesters, sparking public outrage and calls for an impartial investigation.
In the aftermath, local residents claim they are facing collective punishment. Several villagers alleged that shops and houses belonging to members of the Laghari community were demolished by the police without any legal justification. Eyewitnesses say the demolitions were carried out under heavy police supervision and without prior notices or court orders. (Villagers provided pictures, videos of demolished properties to The News.)
Adding to the controversy, three young men from the same Laghari community Bakhshal Laghari, Shahbaz Laghari and Dilshad Laghari have reportedly been arrested by the Shikarpur police, and three separate narcotics cases have been filed against each of them — a move the villagers believe is part of a deliberate attempt to implicate them in false criminal cases and suppress dissent. “We are being punished for belonging to a specific community,” a local elder told The News on condition of anonymity. “The government should answer for the deaths during the protest, not harass innocent villagers.”
Local residents and community representatives have submitted petitions and appeals to the Chief Justice of the Sindh High Court, Sindh Home Minister, the Inspector General of Sindh Police, and leading national and international human rights organizations, urging them to take immediate notice of the situation. They are demanding the formation of an independent judicial commission to investigate both the protest killings and the alleged retaliatory actions by law enforcement agencies.
In solidarity, the legal fraternity the Sindhu Indus Lawyers Forum announced a ‘lawyers convention’ at Karachi on June 25, 2025. Organizer of the convention senior lawyer Advocate Aaquib Rajpar said that their demand is for judicial inquiry of the Moro incident of May 20, state oppression and police’s brutalities.
Legal experts Advocate Inderjeet Lohano, Zulifqar Thebo and others say that these heavy-handed responses  constitute violation of constitutional rights. Human rights defenders Advocate Noor Tunio, Karachi Bar Association treasurer Advocate Haseeb Panhwar and Advocate Rasheed Rajar have expressed serious concern over the ‘reprisal’.
Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Naushero Feroze Bashir Birohi told The News that the cases (FIRs) are not against any community. Those FIRS were registered against the violent protestors who attacked police, injured eight officials, snatched weapons, looted and torched vehicles and set ablaze Home Minister’s House.  SSP Birohi added that the violent perpetrators are from different communities. Secondly there is no siege of Laghari village, neither any shop or house demolished by Police, any media person could visit the area to witness the situation.
SSP Birohi concluded that the perpetrators are playing victim and trying to use media and build pressure on Police. Police investigation is in progress and most of the accused were identified through footages and eyewitnesses. Police will certainly take legal action against the accused involved in violent riots.

Tens of thousands join pro-Palestinian marches in London and Berlin,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323678-tens-of-thousands-join-pro-palestinian-marches-in-london-and-berlin,"LONDON: Tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters marched in London and Berlin on Saturday calling for an end to the war in Gaza, amid concerns that the Iran-Israel conflict could spark wider regional devastation.
Protesters in the British capital waved Palestinian flags, donned keffiyeh scarves and carried signs including “Stop arming Israel” and “No war on Iran” as they marched in the sweltering heat.
“It’s important to remember that people are suffering in Gaza. I fear all the focus will be on Iran now,” said 34-year-old Harry Baker, attending his third pro-Palestinian protest. “I don’t have great love for the Iranian regime, but we are now in a dangerous situation,” he added.
There have been monthly protests in the British capital since the start of the 20-month-long war between Israel and Hamas, which has ravaged Gaza.Saturday’s march comes amid heightened global tensions as the United States mulls joining Israel’s strikes against Iran.
Cries of “Palestine will be free” rang out as protesters carried signs saying “Hands off Gaza” or “Stop starving Gaza”.Gaza is suffering from famine-like conditions according to UN agencies in the region following an Israeli aid blockade.
Gaza’s civil defence agency has reported that hundreds have been killed by Israeli forces while trying to reach the US- and Israeli-backed aid distribution sites.“People need to keep their eyes on Gaza. That’s where the genocide is happening,” said 60-year-old protester Nicky Marcus.
“I feel frustrated, angry because of what’s happening in Gaza,” said 31-year-old data analyst Jose Diaz.“It’s in everyone’s eyes. It’s still on after so many months,” Diaz added.A 31-year-old Iranian student who did not want to share her name, told AFP she had family in Iran and was “scared”.
“I’m worried about my country. I know the regime is not good but it’s still my country. I’m scared,” she said.Tehran said over 400 people have been killed in Iran since Israel launched strikes last week claiming its arch-foe was close to acquiring a nuclear weapon, which Iran denies.
Some 25 people have been killed in Israel, according to official figures.In Berlin, more than 10,000 people gathered in the centre of the city in support of Gaza, according to police figures.
“You can’t sit on the sofa and be silent. Now is the time when we all need to speak up,” said protestor Gundula, who did not want to give her second name.“Germany finances, Israel bombs” was among the chants from the crowd, which gathered mid-afternoon close to the German parliament.For Marwan Radwan, the point of the protest was to bring attention to the “genocide currently taking place” and the “dirty work” being done by the German government.

"Tax on salaries, imported solar panels cut",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323679-tax-on-salaries-imported-solar-panels-cut,"ISLAMABAD: The Finance Minister has announced tax relief for salaried individuals. Tax on individuals drawing salaries between Rs 50,000 to Rs 100,000 per month will be reduced to 1pc. Furthermore, the allocations for BISP have been enhanced to Rs 716 billion and the tax on imported solar panels has been reduced to 10pc.
He made this announcement in the House while winding up the budget debate, as the 204 recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance were also adopted prior to the prorogation of the budget session. The minister sounded optimistic that like the previous year, over 50 percent recommendations of the finance committee will be included in the final budget.
Explaining the income tax on withdrawal of  salaries, he maintained that only 1 pc tax is a symbolic and practical step showing that the state does not want to overburden this segment. He also contended that the reduction in the income tax on salaried class was already part of the proposed budget. He remarked, “we hope that this move will not only result in the increase of disposable income of the class but also restore their trust in the taxation system. It is pertinent that initially, the tax rate for individuals earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million a year was proposed to be cut to 2.5pc from existing 5pc, which now has been reduced to 1 pc.
Regarding the widely criticised power of arrest proposed to be given to the FBR, Aurangzeb assured the House that more safeguards have been added to the law to prevent misuse of authority while expressing the government’s firm commitment to take the country towards inclusive and sustainable economic growth, where all get equal opportunities to make progress. He also pointed out that the federal expenditures have been envisaged to increase by 1.9 percent in the next fiscal year as compared to ten or twelve percent in previous years. The finance minister sounded optimistic that like the previous year, over 50 percent recommendations of the Finance Committee will be included in the final budget.
The finance minister confirmed that the initial 18pc tax proposed on imported solar panels in order to promote the local industry has been reduced to 10pc. He added that in light of the discussions in both houses of the parliament and the suggestions by its members, the government demonstrated seriousness and flexibility in this context. The minister explained that this tax will be applicable on the 46 percent imported parts of solar panels and claimed that the prices of solar panels will this increase only by 4.6 percent. He also noted that before the enforcement of 10 percent tax, the government has received information about hoarding and unlawful profiteering by certain elements. Aurangzeb emphasized the increase in prices by ‘some opportunists’ even before enforcement of the proposal was condemnable while warning those hoarding imported solar panels that action would be taken against them under the law.
Aurangzeb said the relief and social protection measures in the budget reflected that the government was alive towards its responsibilities and pointed out that the budget of Benazir Income Support Programme has been enhanced to Rs716 billion from Rs592 billion.
Later, the minister also clarified that only sales tax was being imposed in the merged districts of ex-Fata and there was no proposal about income tax.  “Even the sales tax will be staggered and in phases. The allocations for the merged districts are made every year and for next year, an increase is also made in the allocation,” he explained while responding to a point of public importance raised by Senator Dost Muhammad of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The PTi lawmaker noted that the merged districts were extremely poor and that was why the previous governments had exempted them from taxation for the last 10 years.
Meanwhile, at the very outset of the proceedings Leader of Opposition Syed Shibli Faraz complained about non-provision of the report of the Senate Standing Committee On Finance containing the final recommendations and wondered how would they have ownership of the recommendations which they had not seen. “We have no idea how many of the recommendations, we gave were included in the report,” he said.
Shibli also emphasized that the chairman of the finance committee should have been from the opposition, as it is their job of oversight. He regretted that the budget has put more tax burden on the people. Shibli charged that the government has not reduced its expenditure and the economy is being run on loans, which cannot be a sustainable basis. “The budget is devoid of any vision, as total reliance is on loans and no new avenues of revenue have been mentioned in it and there is no plan to reduce poverty,” he noted.
PTI parliamentary leader Senator Ali Zafar called for adhering to Article 73 of the Constitution and sharing the House standing committee’s recommendations with the members at least a day before so that they could go through them before adoption in the Senate. Zafar pointed out presently, this article was not being followed and the members were not given report of the committee. “The  responsibility under the article should be fulfilled as the Senate can only give recommendations for which its relevant committee do  the exercise but it can’t approve them, these are to be adopted by the House after consideration of every bit of it,” he said.
Rana Mahmoodul Hassan of PPP spoke for a strategy to improve the plight of the agriculture sector from the present worrying situation and also proposed imposition of water emergency in the country and chalking out a short and long-term policy on the issue. Senator Manzoor Kakar thanked the government for accepting the proposals and said that ‘we are a nation that believes in democracy and without the opposition, things can’t be done properly’.

Ogra flags fuel stock readiness amid regional tensions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323680-ogra-flags-fuel-stock-readiness-amid-regional-tensions,"ISLAMABAD: With tensions rising in the broader region and fears of supply chain disruptions mounting, Pakistan’s oil and gas regulator on Saturday confirmed the country holds adequate stocks of petroleum products to meet current demand — but warned oil marketing companies (OMCs) to strictly maintain the mandatory 20-day reserves required under their licenses.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) issued a formal advisory to all OMCs, emphasizing the need to brace for potential shifts in global energy dynamics by securing sufficient inventory to avoid any domestic shortfalls.
“Ogra remains committed to closely monitoring the situation and will continue taking proactive steps to safeguard the country’s energy security,” said the authority’s spokesperson. The reminder comes as geopolitical instability in the region threatens to impact global oil supplies and market volatility, prompting energy regulators worldwide to reinforce national preparedness.

"In suit against Imran, PM says defence wasting court’s time",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323681-in-suit-against-imran-pm-says-defence-wasting-court-s-time,"LAHORE: Additional Sessions Judge Yelmaz Ghani on Saturday adjourned Rs10 billion defamation suit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif against Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan till June 23 (tomorrow).
The court, while addressing Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif through video link, said, “you should declare that you won’t make any false statement, and if so, Allah will be angry with me.” The PM replied making the aforementioned statement.
PTI lawyer Mohammed Hussein asked the Prime Minister why his statement did not mention who identified him in front of the oath commissioner, since his present hearing was being held in his room.
The Prime Minister said the oath commissioner would have known him anyway in capacity as Punjab chief minister. Besides, he had had many appearances before the same judge in the past.
He regretted that so far, no matter other than seals and signatures were discussed by respondents wasting precious court time. The court remarked that perhaps defence wanted to meet you again and again. Shehbaz Sharif told the court that legal notice was issued on his direction. PTI lawyer said there is no legal notice in your claim. Shehbaz Sharif’s lawyer said the court should allow us to submit legal notices. The court said you should file a petition in this regard.

"Finance Bill: Safeguards in place to prevent misuse of arrest powers, says FBR",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323682-finance-bill-safeguards-in-place-to-prevent-misuse-of-arrest-powers-fbr,"ISLAMABAD: The FBR has made it crystal clear that certain safeguards are in place to ensure avoidance of misuse of arrest powers in the proposed Finance Bill 2025-26.
According to an official statement issued on Saturday, the Finance Bill is currently being discussed in the National Assembly and business circles. Several news stories in digital and print media suggest that some of the amendments introduced to the bill are not well understood by the general public. For instance, the legal provisions for the arrest of those involved in a tax fraud have already been provided under Section 37A of the Sales Tax Act, 1990 along with an elaborate procedure to be followed after the arrest which involves intimating to the special judge immediately and the production of such a person before the judge within 24 hours. However, the proposed amendments now restrict the powers of an officer to arrest by making a prior inquiry after approval of the Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR). Only on the basis of the findings of the inquiry, the CIR will authorize the investigation which would give the investigation officer the powers of an officer incharge of a police station under Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898). The arrest can only be made with the prior approval of the CIR if the investigation officer has reasons to believe that a tax fraud has been committed by a person.
The new legal provision further provides that if the arrest is mala fide, the matter will be referred to the chief commissioner for a fact-finding inquiry. This shows that in contrast to the earlier provision where an assistant CIR could arrest an offender, the new provisions bring transparency in the process by a mandatory prior inquiry and investigation and final permission by the CIR.
Moreover, certain changes are also necessary to reassure the compliant taxpayers that those evading taxes or involved in tax fraud are dealt with by the state with an iron hand. FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial has expressed willingness to discuss the recent changes made in the tax laws and introduce changes wherever needed, for example, the provisions related to arrest could be revised to mandate the permission of multiple senior officers before any arrest. Furthermore, to ensure that these powers are not misused by the authorized tax officers against the compliant taxpayers and business community, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has formed a high-powered committee which will be headed by the minister for Finance and Revenue to re-evaluate the proposed amendments and suggest adequate safeguards to prevent potential misuse of powers. The other members of the committee will include ministers of Law and Economic Affairs Division, minister of state for Finance, SAPM Industries and chairman FBR. The committee will also examine various options to ensure that legal economic activities are not stifled and propose additional protective measures against unlawful use of authority. The committee will submit its recommendations to the prime minister in three days.
The FBR is committed to safeguarding the legal rights of the compliant taxpayers and increasing tax collection and state revenues by discouraging non-compliant taxpayers and acknowledging those who are paying their due share to the state.

Chairing a meeting here on Saturday, she said: “As many as 11,000 poor wemen living in villages will be given buffaloes and cows with a budget of Rs2 billion in 12 districts of southern Punjab. As many as 4,870 cattle will be given under an unprecedented program. The CM Punjab Livestock Assets Program aims to increase milk production and provide employment to rural women at home.

Divorced and widowed poor women up to the age of 55 can also apply through the related app while sitting at home. The women can also contact the Chief Minister Facilitation Desk at the Animal Hospital to get free cattle.”
She said: “Elimination of poverty gap between villages and cities is our resolve. Economic development is also the right of a daughter living in a village. Equal economic opportunities are being provided in cities and villages. Whether a woman lives in a city or a village, education, health and employment are her basic rights.”
The chief minister highlighted: “Large-scale tree plantation and environmental projects are being launched under the Punjab Green Program. We have a comprehensive plan to plant 42 million trees on 50,869 acres under the Chief Minister Plant for Pakistan Initiative and 1.375 million trees are being planted on 3,790 acres of forest wasteland under the CM Agroforestry Initiative. The scope of Green Pakistan Program has been expanded and plantation of 466.463 million trees on 251,000 acres continues. Plantation of 5 million trees in rows on 10,223 miles in the canal areas of Punjab has been activated.

A modern GIS-based protection system has been introduced as immediate detection of fire and encroachment is possible with drone, satellite and LIDAR technology.”
“A digital communication cell has been established. Modern monitoring equipment and additional staff are being provided to the Monitoring and Evaluation Wing of the Forest Department. Digital tree enumeration in the form of rows and GIS-based survey has been started in Punjab. Modern machinery has been purchased for forestry work and the process of plantation and forestry operations has been accelerated. Establishment of 104 Forest Command & Control Centres for 24-hour monitoring across the province is significantly increasing the capacity for forest protection.”
Meanwhile, the chief minister on Saturday handed over cheques of prize money to sanitation workers for their unprecedented and lightning-fast sanitation services on the Eid-ul-Azha. She had announced a reward of Rs10,000 each for the workers for the best sanitation arrangements on the three Eid days. A magnificent tribute was paid to sanitation workers at splendid ceremonies held in 123 Tehsils across Punjab. The sanitation workers danced with joy to the beat of drums. They were overwhelmed over an unprecedented reception for them. Public representatives along with commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners participated in the ceremonies. On the CM direction, a sumptuous meal was also served to the sanitation workers. Cakes were cut in different cities in their honour. A sanitation worker said: “I can’t believe such an event can happen for us too.” Another said: “Thank you Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, we can never forget these moments of happiness.”
In her message, Maryam said: “Sanitation workers are the beauty of our society. Cleanliness arrangements under the Clean Punjab Program on the Eid-ul-Azha were appreciated across the country. Credit for the success of cleanliness campaign goes to the sanitation workers as they continued to work even in the scorching heat. On behalf of the people of Punjab, I pay my heartfelt tribute to sanitation workers. Their hard work and dedication is worthy of imitation by others. An example of fast-paced sanitation was set on Eid, which will be remembered for a long time.” On the CM’s direction, a documentary film related to the Eid-ul-Azha Clean Punjab program was also shown at the ceremonies.
Message: Maryam Nawaz has said: “Be it happiness or sadness, loneliness or separation, music is capable of expressing every emotion.” In her message on the World Music Day, she said: “Pakistani artists have given international recognition to oriental music. The Information and Culture Department is training and supporting young artists at the Alhamra Arts Council. Financial assistance to needy artists is being provided under the Artist Fund for Arts and Music. Music becomes an ambassador of peace and conveys a message of love across borders.”

Israel signals it could act on Fordow before Trump’s deadline expires: sources,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323684-israel-signals-it-could-act-on-fordow-before-trump-s-deadline-expires-sources,"WASHINGTON/DUBAI/JERUSALEM: Israeli officials have told the Trump administration they do not want to wait two weeks for Iran to reach a deal to dismantle key parts of its nuclear programme and Israel could act alone before the deadline is up, two sources said, amid a continuing debate on Trump’s team about whether the US should get involved.
The two sources familiar with the matter said Israel had communicated their concerns to Trump administration officials on Thursday in what they described as a tense phone call.The Israeli officials said they do not want to wait the two weeks that U.S. President Donald Trump presented on Thursday as a deadline for deciding whether the U.S. will get involved in the Israel-Iran war, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Israeli participants on the call included Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Israel Katz and military chief Eyal Zamir, according to a security source.The Israelis believe they have a limited window of opportunity to move against the deeply buried site at Fordow, the crown jewel of Iran’s nuclear program, said the sources. The United States is the only country with the bunker-busting bombs powerful enough to reach the facility, which is dug into the side of a mountain.
A person in Washington familiar with the matter said Israel has communicated to the U.S. administration that it believes Trump’s window of up to two weeks is too long and that more urgent action is needed. The person did not say whether the Israelis made that point during the high-level call.
During the call, Vice President JD Vance pushed back, saying the United States shouldn’t be directly involved and suggesting that the Israelis were going to drag the country into war, said the sources. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also participated in the call, said a security source. Reuters could not determine who else took part in the call.
The Jerusalem Post reported earlier that a phone call had taken place on Thursday.The prospect of a U.S. strike against Iran has exposed divisions in the coalition of supporters that brought Trump to power, with some prominent members of his base urging him not to get the country involved in a new Middle East war.
The White House declined to comment for this story.The Israeli Prime Minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iran’s mission to the United Nations also did not immediately respond.
Publicly, Netanyahu has not ruled out Israel attacking Fordow alone, though officials have not provided any details on how that would be achieved.Four sources said it is now increasingly likely that the country will launch a solo military operation. Israeli air superiority over much of Iran makes an operation more feasible, though still risky, said two of the sources. The Israelis feel they have the momentum and have limited time given the costs of the war, one source added. “I don’t see them waiting much longer,” said the source.
It is not clear whether such an operation would involve bombing, ground forces, or both. Two of the sources said that rather than attempting to destroy the entire site Israel could instead do significant damage to it.
That could mean focusing on destroying what is inside the site rather than the site itself, said one of the sources, declining to elaborate.Some analysts have speculated that Israel could use special forces to enter Fordow and blow it up from inside.
Another scenario being considered, according to a source familiar with the matter, would be to drop a series of munitions in rapid succession in an attempt to breach the fortified site, similar to how the Israeli military killed Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah last year.Such a strike could be followed by an incursion by special forces, the source said.
It is not clear that Israel has munitions powerful enough to penetrate the fortified facility. It is widely believed that to have a high chance of success, U.S. intervention would be needed.But even with the massive firepower of a joint U.S.-Israeli military action, military and nuclear experts believe that a military operation would probably only temporarily set back a program the West fears is already aimed at producing atom bombs one day, although Iran denies it.

"PTI ready for serious, result-oriented talks: Gohar",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323685-pti-ready-for-serious-result-oriented-talks-gohar,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said on Saturday that his party was ready for serious and result-oriented parleys for the country’s sake.
During chat with the media here, he conceded that some individuals from the government and their own party’s ranks were impeding contacts in terms of their statements or acts.
However, he emphasised that the PTI was open for discussions, as hopes for renewed dialogue between the PTI and the establishment appeared to have stalled  following Eid-ul-Azha. It was speculated that there was a possibility of resumption of dialogue between the two sides, however, statements from party leaders, more importantly from the party patron-in-chief Imran Khan and unexpected recent protests in the United States, dimmed such chances.
It is also maintained that the lack of a coherent strategy is a major obstacle in building confidence-building measures to pave way for resumption of dialogue.  Last month, incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan had announced a countrywide movement to be launched, without giving a date, which has recently been postponed for two weeks due to ongoing global developments following the Iran-Israel conflict.
The party supremo had announced he would lead the movement from Adiala Jail and asked Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, who is PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, to chalk out a strategy. It is expected that the proposed protest movement would be further delayed in case the regional situation does not improve with particular reference to the Israeli conflict with Iran.

All SC judges must be nominated to Constitutional Bench: Justice Mansoor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323686-all-sc-judges-must-be-nominated-to-constitutional-bench-justice-mansoor,"ISLAMABAD: Supreme Court senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah has stressed for nomination of all apex court judges in the Constitutional Bench instead of selective inclusion.
Justice Mansoor wrote a letter to the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) secretary on June 16 before the commission’s meeting scheduled for June 19. The JCP on June 19 had extended the tenure of Justice Aminuddin Khan for another term of six months as head of the Constitutional Bench till 30th of November, 2025.
“My office verbally informed you on June 12, 2025, that I will not be available in Pakistan’ to attend the meeting, I therefore wish to formally record the following submissions which may be incorporated in the minutes of the meeting, as I will not be able to attend the meeting even online,” the senior judge wrote.
He stressed that all the Supreme Court judges must be nominated to the Constitutional Bench, adding that any selective inclusion without a transparent process or identifiable criteria is patently discriminatory and damaging to institutional harmony.
The senior puisne judge intimated that one would have reasonably expected that due to non-availability of one of its members, the meeting would be deferred-particularly in keeping with past practice, where meetings have been deferred due to the unavailability of members representing the Executive.
Additionally, Justice Mansoor said that the meeting falls in the summer vacations announced by the court. “However, it appears that the meeting is continuing as scheduled perhaps due to the judiciary’s minority position in the Commission,” he wrote.
Referring to Agenda Item No 1 of the JCP June 19 meeting, Justice Mansoor stressed that the commission must wait till the constitutionality of the 26th Constitutional Amendment is decided by this court before addressing matters that flow directly from it.
The senior judge was of the view that proceeding with extensions or re-appointments to a Constitutional Bench whose very legal foundation is under serious constitutional challenge further deepens the institutional crisis and weakens the court’s legitimacy.
Similarly, he said that the commission must realise that continued delay in adjudicating this foundational issue is visibly eroding the credibility of the court and shaking public confidence in its neutrality.
“It is both surprising and regrettable that rather than first addressing the legitimacy of the 26th Amendment, the commission is rather insensitively prioritising the matter of judicial extensions an act which, in substance, continues the disputed scheme introduced by that very amendment,” Justice Mansoor wrote.
He further said that it is imperative that the court’s image is not allowed to drift under the control or convenience of the Executive, which now appears to wield disproportionate influence over the affairs of the JCP.
“Without prejudice to the above, and pending adjudication of the constitutional challenges, all judges of the Supreme Court must be nominated to the Constitutional Bench in the interim,” Justice Mansoor wrote.
The senior judge stressed that formal criteria must be developed for selection of judges to the Constitutional Bench before any further constitution or expansion of the Bench. “The absence of objective standards renders past nominations vulnerable to the charge of cherry-picking,” he wrote, adding that this ad hocism has already cast a long shadow on the legitimacy of the Constitutional Bench, and continued exclusion of senior judges without reason only worsens that perception.
Referring to Agenda Item No 2 of JCP meeting regarding policy decision about framing of Rules under Article 175A(20) of the Constitution, Justice Mansoor emphasised that any policy decision must wait till the constitutionality of the 26th Amendment challenged in a series of pending petitions before this Court is decided.
He urged that these concerns be taken with the seriousness they merit, adding that the strength of the judiciary rests on its credibility, its internal coherence, and its fidelity to constitutional principle, not on expediency or executive preference. “If the commission is to retain its institutional legitimacy, it must lead with integrity, transparency and collective wisdom,” the senior puisne judge concluded.

New Pak	US ties to help reduce tension in region: Hoti,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323688-new-pak-us-ties-to-help-reduce-tension-in-region-hoti,"TAKHTBHAI: Awami	National	Party 	(ANP) leader and former chief	minister Ameer	Haider	Khan	Hoti on Saturday termed Field	Marshal Asim	Munir’s recent visit to the US as a positive step for Pak	US relations, saying the sojourn would help reduce regional tension and restore bilateral ties.
Talking to a delegation of office	bearers of the Takhtbhai Press Club (Registered) led by its president, Hoti said that it would have been even better, had the president and prime minister also been included in the delegation, so that the world could receive a stronger message about the stability of democracy in Pakistan.
He stressed that all institutions must operate strictly within their constitutional boundaries. Parliamentary supremacy and robust democratic traditions, he said, were the only sustainable answers to Pakistan’s internal and external challenges.
About the Iran-Israel conflict, Hoti warned that escalating tensions in the Middle	East, especially between Israel and Iran, were pushing the entire region toward dangerous instability. He said the international community, and the US in particular, bore a heavy moral and diplomatic responsibility to restore peace. “Because of Washington’s well	known leverage over Israel, the US could press for an immediate ceasefire. As a superpower, the US must work for global peace rather than offer unconditional support to its allies,” he pleaded.
To a question about past Pakistan–India conflicts, the ex-CM said Pakistan’s armed forces responded with exceptional bravery, professionalism, and national spirit, thwarting the enemy’s designs. The entire nation, he said, stood behind its soldiers and was ready to sacrifice for the defence of the homeland.
The nationalist leader also criticized the current provincial government, claiming that the KP chief	minister was not fully autonomous in budget matters and was waiting for instructions from party founder Imran	Khan.
“Allowing such informal influence over a critical constitutional and fiscal process, undermines provincial autonomy and democratic norms, weakens the legislative role of the provincial assembly, and erodes public trust. Delays in budget passage could, he warned, create a constitutional and financial crisis with irreparable damage to the province,” he added.

"Barrister Gohar, Omar Ayub, others acquitted in two cases",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323668-barrister-gohar-omar-ayub-others-acquitted-in-two-cases,"ISLAMABAD: A local court has accepted the acquittal pleas of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, Ali Bukhari and others in two cases related to protests involving PTI leaders and workers, acquitting them in both matters.
During the hearing of the cases registered at Karachi Company Police Station, accused Shoaib Shaheen and Ali Bukhari appeared in the court of Judicial Magistrate Shahzad Ahmed, while exemption applications were filed on behalf of Barrister Gohar and Omar Ayub, which the court approved.
Defence lawyer Sardar Shubh Khan, argued for acquittal, stating that the cases were filed by unrelated individuals and that eight accused arrested on the spot had already been discharged. The court questioned the absence of accused Amir Mughal and Amir Dogar, to which the lawyer responded that the court should decide their status. He also cited a previous instance where Murad Saeed was acquitted in similar cases due to non-appearance.
After hearing the arguments, the court reserved its decision on the acquittal pleas and later approved them. The court ordered the acquittal of Barrister Gohar, Omar Ayub, Ali Bukhari, Shoaib Shaheen, Amir Dogar, Malik Rafique, Amir Mughal and others in the cases, directing the case files to be sent back to Karachi Company Police Station.
The cases stemmed from a protest held on April 26, 2024, from Shoaib Shaheen’s office to Karachi Company against alleged rigging in the general elections. The accused were booked under Section 144 and other relevant provisions.

"Investigators say int'l terror outfit behind attack on JUI-S chief, others",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323669-investigators-say-int-l-terror-outfit-behind-attack-on-juis-chief-others,"PESHAWAR: Senior investigators believed that an international terrorist network that carried out attack on a police party in Peshawar in May was behind attacks on religious personalities in the country, including suicide attack on Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Sami chief Maulana Hamidul Haq in February.
The group was identified after the suicide attack on a police car in the limits of Chamkani Police Station last month. Two policemen were martyred and three others wounded in the attack on May 11.
A source said the suicide bomber was identified to be a foreigner who hailed from a Central Asian country. During the investigation, he added, some other members of the ring, including foreigners, were identified.
The embassy concerned about these foreigners was also approached and informed about the involvement of their citizens, it was revealed.  The source disclosed that the same network was believed to be involved in attack on Maulana Hamidul Haq, the chief of JUIS, who was martyred in a suicide attack outside the mosque in Darul Uloom Haqqania in Nowshera on February 28.
The source added that the suicide bomber, who targeted police in Peshawar, was launched to carry out attack on a rally of JUIF in the vicinity on May 11 but he detonated explosives around his vest when intercepted by the cops. The rally was addressed by JUIF chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman.
The source added that the same terror network was suspected to be behind a series of targeted attacks on religious personalities in Pishtakhara and other parts of Peshawar.  Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed confirmed that the police had reached close to the group involved in the attack on Maulana Hamidul Haq and other religious figures.  A senior official said some facilitators had been held while it had been learnt that they were getting funds from abroad.

JI stages demo outside PA against denying Karachi its due share in budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323638-ji-stages-demo-outside-pa-against-denying-karachi-its-due-share-in-budget,"The Karachi chapter of the Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) staged a protest demonstration outside the Sindh Assembly on Saturday against lack of due share of Karachi in the provincial and federal budgets.
A large number of people, belonging to all different walks of life, participated in the demonstration. The protesters, carrying placards and banners, chanted slogans against the ruling parties for “depriving Karachi and Karachiites of their due rights”.
Addressing the participants, Karachi JI emir Munem Zafar Khan said the ruling partners both in the center and the province once again presented an anti-people, anti-Karachi budget.  He said the megacity had been surrounded by never-ending crises, including an acute water shortage, devastated infrastructure, a lack of a mass transit system and a power crisis.
He demanded of the government to earmark Rs500 billion to initially address the burning issues of Karachi. The city needs 10,000 busses under the mass transit system as mere 300 busses are unable to cater to a city that is home to more than 30 million individuals, he said. He also demanded restoring the Karachi Circular Railway Project.
He demanded monetary and administrative powers for the local government setup as per the Constitution of Pakistan. He elaborated his viewpoint that the city generates 54 percent export of the country, 67 percent revenue for the national exchequer, and 95 percent budget
for the province, but it was kept deprived of its own rights.
Not only that the tanker mafia practically rules over the city, and a large number of Karachiites are deprived of basic facilities, including health, education, and transport, he said.  Talking about the much-needed K-4 water supply project, he said Wapda submitted a requisite of Rs40 billion to complete the project, but the government earmarked just Rs3.2 billion, practically shelving the project. Karachi paid Rs3,000 billion in tax, but the government couldn’t allocate just Rs40 billion for the K4 project, he highlighted.
The JI leader strongly criticized the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement dubbing the two parties as a product of Form 47.  Talking about the infrastructure, he highlighted the Red Line project that was underway, saying it was supposed to be completed in June 2024 with an estimated cost of $504 million. The project was yet in limbo, whereas the estimated cost had increased to $700 million, he said, adding that Karachiites would have to repay this amount with interest in the years to come.
Zafar also highlighted the Karimabad underpass and said it was constructed to facilitate the PPP’s Dr Asim Hussain. The Rs1.3 billion project after ruining hundreds of businesses now stood at an estimated cost of over Rs3 billion.
Talking about the transport sector, he quoted a five-year-old report that one seat was available against 44 commuters in Karachi. He added that the situation had been worsened during the past five years.
He added that the Sindh government illogically banned four-seat rickshaws without providing any alternatives, just to add insult to the injury.  He said 58 percent Karachiites use motorbikes to commute and instead of facilitating them, the government just increases penalties and traffic challans. He said Karachiites would not accept this injustice.

Mayor complains of Karachi’s exclusion from Export Development Fund to federal minister,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323641-mayor-complains-of-karachi-s-exclusion-from-export-development-fund-to-federal-minister,"Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab has formally written to Federal Minister for Commerce and Chairman of the Export Development Fund (EDF) Board Jam Kamal Khan to voice strong concern over Karachi’s continued exclusion from the allocation and utilisation of Export Development Funds.
In the letter, Wahab noted that Karachi accounted for nearly 55 per cent of Pakistan’s total exports, making it the country's economic engine. Despite this pivotal role, the city had received little to no support from the very fund established to enhance export infrastructure across Pakistan.
“It is unfortunate to note that there has been no significant contribution made by the Export Development Fund to catalyse Karachi’s export sector,” wrote the mayor. “Unjust allocation and utilisation of funds reinforce the perception that the Federal Government is ignoring Karachi.”
Wahab emphasised that as Pakistan’s largest metropolis and commercial capital, Karachi had been experiencing rapid growth in both population and industrial output, necessitating increased investment in logistics, infrastructure and export-related services.
He urged that development funding must reflect both Karachi’s economic contribution and its evolving needs. He also requested the EDF board to provide details of fund allocations over the past 10 years, and called for transparency regarding any current or planned projects in Karachi, if any.
“There can be no economic stability without Karachi’s inclusion. Ignoring its rightful share is not only unjust, but also counterproductive to national growth,” he stated. While expressing confidence in Kamal’s leadership, Wahab called for immediate corrective action to ensure Karachi was no longer sidelined in federal export promotion initiatives.

Installation ceremony of Ikebana International Karachi Chapter 204 held,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323644-installation-ceremony-of-ikebana-international-karachi-chapter-204-held,"The installation ceremony of the Ikebana International Karachi Chapter 204 was held at a hotel in Karachi on Saturday.
Japanese Consul General Hattori Masaru attended the event as the chief guest. The highlight of the ceremony was a floral art demonstration by Shaima Saeed, showcasing the traditional Japanese art of Ikebana.
Speaking on the occasion, the consul general said that Ikebana represented an important aspect of Japanese culture, and he was pleased to see so many Pakistanis appreciating and enjoying it.
“Ikebana is not only practised in Japan but also all over the world. It conveys the spirit and beauty of Japanese nature,” he said. The new president of the Ikebana International Karachi Chapter 204, Tarannum Afroze, said she hoped to expand the reach of Ikebana among children, particularly in schools and colleges.
“We want to promote this beautiful art form more widely, especially among the younger generation. We also plan to hold exhibitions in Lahore and Islamabad to raise awareness and help more people understand the essence of Ikebana,” she said, wearing the president's badge.
“Art brings us closer to nature and allows us to express creativity in ways that many other hobbies do not,” she opined. She explained that Ikebana was a traditional Japanese art of flower arrangement. ""It is not just about arranging flowers but it involves study and understanding the philosophy behind each arrangement. We follow a curriculum, read books, and learn through certified schools. My school, for instance, is the Sogetsu school of Ikebana.” Salma Aziz, who served as the president for the past two years, expressed gratitude saying she was proud to have had a successful tenure.

Various parts of city receive drizzle for second day,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323645-various-parts-of-city-receive-drizzle-for-second-day,"The residents of the metropolis, after reeling under scorching heat for days, took a sigh of relief after the city received drizzle for a second day on Saturday.
Light showers were reported in Karachi's Lyari, Mauripur, Clifton and surrounding areas with the maximum temperature likely to reach 36 degrees Celsius amid a 68 percent humidity level coupled with 19 kilometres per hour winds blowing from the West.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast further intermittent drizzle throughout the day today along with the possibility of strong winds. The PMD's prediction comes a day after various areas, including Gulshan-e-Maymar, Sohrab Goth, Scheme 33, Federal B Area, Liaquatabad, University Road, Stadium Road and PECHS, experienced brief showers — providing much-needed relief to Karachiites, who have been experiencing above 40°C in recent days.
Earlier, the Met Office in its pre-monsoon advisory stated that moist currents from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea were beginning to enter the country, setting the stage for the upcoming monsoon season. From 22 to 24 June, strong winds and thunderstorm-related rainfall are expected in Sukkur, Larkana, Dadu, and Jacobabad.

‘Taxing solar panels to not reverse transition towards clean energy’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323646-taxing-solar-panels-to-not-reverse-transition-towards-clean-energy,"The imposition of general sales tax (GST) on imported solar panels, regardless of the final tax rate decided by the federal government, will not slow down Pakistan’s accelerating transition towards renewable energy. This progress is driven by the unwavering commitment of end-consumers and businesses dedicated to improving environmental conditions and reducing the carbon footprint of Pakistan’s power sector.
This was the collective view expressed by clean energy experts, academics, industrialists, climate activists and renewable energy traders during a webinar examining the federal government’s recent budgetary proposal to impose GST on imported solar panels. The proposed measure aims to encourage domestic manufacturing of renewable energy equipment.
The webinar, titled ‘Taxing the Sun: Will Solar Still Shine in Pakistan?’, was jointly organised by the Energy Update and Pakistan Solar Association (PSA). PSA Chairman Waqas Moosa opened the discussion by thanking environmental advocates and non-governmental organisations for their continued support of solar energy adoption by households and commercial users. He emphasised that shifting to solar power was a critical means to reduce dependence on polluting fossil fuels.
Moosa highlighted that the decade from 2020 to 2030 had been globally recognised as a pivotal era for transitioning to clean energy. He predicted that Pakistani consumers would persist in embracing solar energy to power their homes and businesses, regardless of the added cost from the GST.
He cautioned, however, that Pakistan's local industry was not yet sufficiently developed to meet the growing demand for advanced solar panels in adequate quantity. As such, relying solely on local production at this stage could risk stalling progress.
He criticised the proposal to tax imported solar panels, calling it a serious setback to Pakistan’s efforts in combating the climate crisis. ""Whether or not a tax is implemented"", he said, ""domestic consumers will continue shifting to solar energy due to persistent power shortages and unaffordable electricity tariffs.""
Muhammad Zakar Ali, chief executive officer of the Inverex Solar Energy, echoed this sentiment. He said that the vast majority of electricity users in Pakistan now understood the long-term value of clean energy and would continue to transition away from grid-supplied electricity, regardless of tax implications.
He argued that Pakistan needed a minimum of 18 to 24 months to establish a viable local industry capable of producing clean energy equipment at scale. Imposing a tax prematurely, he warned, could deter both domestic and international investors.
He noted that high electricity tariffs for industrial users could discourage investment in solar panel manufacturing plants. He, however, predicted that prospective Chinese investors would soon launch joint ventures with Pakistani industrialists to set up such facilities.
Ali explained that establishing local solar panel manufacturing plants could lead to the development of five supporting vendor industries, significantly boosting the clean energy supply chain in Pakistan.
Former Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI) office-bearer Tanveer Ahmed Barry stated that industries had little choice but to transition to renewable energy due to the unreliable and unstable power supply from the national grid.
He pointed out that while Pakistan’s installed electricity generation capacity exceeded 45,000 megawatts, only around 27,000 megawatts were currently deliverable to end-users due to the outdated transmission infrastructure. He also highlighted the immense untapped potential for solar energy adoption among off-grid rural households.

‘Modern skills in police system need of hour’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323660-modern-skills-in-police-system-need-of-hour,"LAHORE: The rapid scientific evolution happening around the world, including AI, have also had a profound impact on the police system in Pakistan.  “The success rate can be increased many times by bringing in modern technological skills, including drones, cameras and AI, during police operations,” said DPO Sialkot Faisal Shahzad while speaking as special guest at a session arranged by the National Vision Think Tank (NVTT) on Saturday.  ""In the next few years, the police system will not be able to function in the same way’’. Like every other profession, he said, the police, too, has to evolve to bring itself to an international level.  With regards to a general perception of citizens fearing the police, he said, the police should definitely be feared, but this fear should be on criminals rather than the citizens.  Ahsan Ziaur Rehman, Bilal Mahmood Butt, M Ashraf, Nadeem Ch, Dilawar Ch, M Mansoor, M Amer, Usman Feroze, GM Jagtpuria, Afzaal Abbasi, Ans Zia, Ishaq Gujjar, Jamshed Khan and other participants attended the session.

Experts call for leveraging renewed international interest in Kashmir dispute,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323616-experts-call-for-leveraging-renewed-international-interest-in-kashmir-dispute,"Islamabad: Former ambassador Masood Khalid has stated that the recent exchange of strikes between Pakistan and India renewed international attention on longstanding regional disputes.
Mr Khalid was addressing a discussion on “The pursuit of truth: competing narratives in post-Pahalgam” jointly organised here by Institute of Regional Studies (IRS) and Policy East (PE).
The speaker emphasised that Pakistan should capitalise on this renewed interest, especially from the US, to resolve the Kashmir dispute. He also acknowledged the media's role stating that Pakistan's strategic communication effectively dismantled India's narrative and exposed its weaknesses.
Air Marshal (r) Javaid Ahmed, President, Centre for Aerospace and Security Studies (CASS), presented a technical assessment of the conflict's operational aspects. He cautioned against normalising the crisis and emphasised the need to maintain and consistently follow through with the narrative.
Rear Admiral (r) Faisal Shah highlighted India's operational miscalculations and commended Pakistan's strong response, which upheld strategic redlines of no internal interference, prevention of repeat incidents and adherence to existing agreements.
Dr Taimur Shamil, Executive Director, Policy East, highlighted the increasingly transnational nature of information conflicts and the imperative for Pakistani institutions to develop robust international partnerships with other global institutions.
Journalists Umar Khalid Butt (PTV) and Haitham Naser (TRT) offered firsthand insights on narrative development and dissemination. Their critique of current institutions and advocacy for better media think-tank collaboration generated lively debate among the professors, analysts and policy researchers present during the question hour.
In his opening remarks, IRS President Jauhar Saleem highlighted Pakistan's effective and principled diplomatic response which countered misleading narratives and exposed India's domestic political motivations for escalating the crisis. On narrative building, he underscored the importance of a comprehensive strategy adding that, the narrative should not be constructed in isolation, but rather through a holistic approach, incorporating diverse perspectives and insights, drawing from strategic considerations and societal input. He argued that by embracing this comprehensive approach, the resulting narrative would be more impactful.

Sports complex opens doors to special children,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323617-sports-complex-opens-doors-to-special-children,"Islamabad: In a landmark step towards inclusive sports development, the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination, in consultation with the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training, has announced that children with special abilities will now have access to the facilities at the Pakistan Sports Complex in Islamabad.
The initiative, aimed at promoting accessibility and equal opportunity, is set to benefit up to 5,000 registered students with special needs in the upcoming session, according to officials. They said a joint committee had been tasked with conducting a comprehensive audit of the existing infrastructure within two to three weeks.
The officials said the objective was to assess current accessibility standards and recommend improvements to create a barrier-free environment. They said the committee would also devise a detailed plan to customise facilities to meet the diverse needs of children with disabilities.
The officials said once the audit and planning phase was completed and approved, implementation would begin, formally opening the complex’s doors to registered students. They said the move was part of a broader government commitment to fostering inclusivity, enhancing physical and mental development and boosting confidence among children with special abilities.
“This is about levelling the playing field,” said a senior IPC official. “We want to ensure that every child, regardless of their physical or cognitive limitations, has the opportunity to engage in sports and grow.”
The officials said key goals of the initiative included promoting inclusive sports, enhancing accessibility and supporting the holistic development of children with special needs. The officials expressed optimism that the initiative would not only empower thousands of children but also raise awareness about the importance of inclusive recreation in nation-building.

Visa applicants denied basic facilities by visa processing companies,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323618-visa-applicants-denied-basic-facilities-by-visa-processing-companies,"Islamabad:The distressing scene at visa processing companies in Islamabad, specially a busiest one, paints a stark picture of systemic failures, severely impacting thousands of ordinary citizens and demanding immediate intervention from relevant authorities. The current situation, as detailed by a visitor's family, stands as a strong indictment of the customer service, ethical standards, and oversight within Pakistan's visa processing ecosystem.
The conditions endured by visa applicants are nothing short of inhumane. With temperatures soaring to an unbearable 45 degrees Celsius, denying basic amenities like drinking water and shaded shelters to individuals, particularly the elderly and families with young children, isn't just neglectful—it's a direct threat to their health and well-being. Prolonged exposure to such extreme heat can precipitate severe medical emergencies, including heatstroke and acute dehydration.
Adding insult to injury, the complete absence of proper waiting areas forces people to stand for hours, often ensnared in chaotic queues. This strips them of their dignity, transforming what should be a routine service into an arduous ordeal. Such indignity is particularly egregious for those traveling from distant areas like AJK, GB, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Rawalpindi, Islamabad, and Murree, who have already endured exhausting journeys.
The reliance on ill-trained staff from private security agencies is a critical flaw, leading to pervasive misbehaviour and even outright abuse. These individuals, often the first point of contact for applicants, set a profoundly negative tone for the entire experience through their unprofessional conduct. Their presence underscores a severe lack of proper hiring protocols, comprehensive training, and adequate supervision by the visa processing companies.
Furthermore, the pervasive attitude suggests a complete absence of any customer service ethos. Instead of facilitating a smooth process, staff members appear to operate as arbitrary gatekeepers, compounding the stress and frustration of already anxious applicants.
The rampant presence of ""agents wandering around the building with document processing machines loading on the bikes and other vehicles"" points to a severe breach of security and fertile ground for rampant corruption. This alarming situation indicates that sensitive personal documents are being handled outside secure premises, rendering applicants highly vulnerable to fraud, theft, and identity compromise.
Even more gravely, the explicit mention of agents operating in ‘connivance of the visa processing companies’ and the unsettling silence of ‘administration and local police due to briberies’ are serious allegations of institutional corruption. This creates a deeply unfair system where those who can afford to bribe agents and officials receive preferential treatment, while honest applicants are left to suffer. Such a scenario implies a systemic breakdown of accountability and oversight. The ‘looting’ of people by these agents, especially those who have travelled long distances, epitomises a predatory environment where vulnerable individuals are shamelessly exploited for their aspirations to travel or seek opportunities abroad. This exploitation can manifest through exorbitant fees, false promises, and even the fabrication of crucial documents.
Perhaps the most disturbing aspect of this crisis is the alleged ‘silent spectator’ role of the administration and local police. This suggests a profound failure of governance and law enforcement to uphold their duties and protect citizens. If these allegations hold true, it points to a deeply entrenched network of corruption that systematically undermines public trust in the legal and administrative systems.
Moreover, such widespread misconduct and exploitation not only inflict harm upon individual citizens but also significantly damage Pakistan's international image. This adverse perception can deter legitimate travellers, potential investors, and even those seeking humanitarian assistance, as the visa process becomes synonymous with hardship and pervasive corruption.
The presence of unauthorised agents within or around visa processing centres should be strictly prohibited and rigorously enforced.  Wherever feasible, the entire visa application process should be digitized and moved online to significantly reduce physical interaction points and thereby diminish the scope for agent involvement.
The Ministry of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and relevant provincial governments must proactively step in to regulate these companies more effectively. This should involve stricter licensing requirements, regular independent audits, and the imposition of heavy penalties for non-compliance.
A robust, accessible, and highly responsive complaint mechanism, entirely independent of the visa processing companies themselves, must be established. This mechanism should allow individuals to report issues without any fear of reprisal. This could take the form of a dedicated helpline or an online portal supervised by a neutral government body.
The current state of affairs is far more than mere inconvenience; it represents a severe humanitarian concern and a glaring reflection of a broken system. Urgent and decisive action is imperative to restore dignity, ensure fair treatment, and eliminate the systemic exploitation faced by Pakistani citizens seeking legitimate visa services.

Commercial Market Satellite Town: a blend of tradition and modernity,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323619-commercial-market-satellite-town-a-blend-of-tradition-and-modernity,"Commercial Market Satellite Town is a testament to Rawalpindi’s evolving commercial landscape. With a mix of traditional shops and modern retail outlets, it caters to a diverse clientele. The market’s strategic location and variety of offerings make it a popular destination for shoppers seeking both quality and convenience.
“Once a quiet cluster of family-run shops has transformed into one of the city’s most bustling commercial hubs. Yet, despite the march of progress, the market retains a nostalgic charm that keeps loyal patrons coming back,” says Farzana Ali.
“From decades-old bakeries selling traditional rusks and cakes wrapped in brown paper to sleek boutiques showcasing the latest in fashion trends, Commercial Market caters to every generation. The aroma of freshly cooked samosas mingles with the scent of new leather handbags and the faint whirr of salon hairdryers. It’s a sensory mosaic that reflects Rawalpindi’s changing face,” says Anwer Hussain.
“For many small business owners, this market has been a launching pad and an Economic Pulse Point. “My father opened this shop in 1978. We started with just kitchen utensils. Now, we also offer imported crockery and gift items. We have changed with the times, but our customers still ask for old-style enamel dishes their mothers used to buy,” says Rizwan Hasan, who runs a shop near car parking area.
“New cafes with Instagrammable interiors now stand beside stationery shops that have been here for generations. Young entrepreneurs are drawn to the market’s foot traffic, while older shopkeepers see it as a legacy to uphold,” says Syed Alamdar Hussain.
“The transition has not been without its challenges. There have been trials amid change. The rise of malls and e-commerce has threatened traditional footfall. Still, the market’s location, diversity, and loyal clientele have helped it endure,” says Fazal Naqvi.
“According to some lamenting shoppers, at times the parking is a nightmare, but I still prefer coming here. You get everything from mehndi cones to mobile accessories, and there’s always a good bargain to be had,” says Shumaila Zaidi.

Climate threats leave coastal hospitals vulnerable,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323621-climate-threats-leave-coastal-hospitals-vulnerable,"Islamabad: Amid growing risks posed by climate change to Pakistan’s coastal health facilities, the federal government on Saturday announced to launch a major initiative to strengthen medical infrastructure at Karachi Port Trust Hospital, Port Qasim Medical Centre, and Gwadar Port Hospital—key maritime health centres facing outdated emergency systems, weak disease surveillance, and limited disaster preparedness.
Currently falling short of international benchmarks such as the WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) and the Maritime Labour Convention (MLC 2006), these hospitals are ill-equipped to handle climate-driven health emergencies like oil spills, extreme weather events, or infectious disease outbreaks.
They also lack digital health records, telemedicine capabilities, and standardized infection control and quarantine protocols—gaps that severely undermine response capabilities in high-risk port zones.
Recognising these urgent challenges, Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, announced the launch of a climate-resilient transformation of maritime healthcare infrastructure during a high-level meeting in Islamabad.
The initiative begins with a nationwide baseline assessment of healthcare facilities at the country’s major ports to integrate climate adaptation measures across the system. The minister directed that immediate steps be taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, minimize contamination risks, and build healthcare systems resilient to climate shocks.
“The health and resilience of our maritime workforce are vital to sustaining trade and national growth amid climate challenges. Strengthening health systems is essential not only as a moral duty but as a foundation for economic and environmental resilience,” he said.
The first phase of this initiative will focus on targeted upgrades at KPT, Port Qasim, and Gwadar hospitals, addressing critical deficiencies in trauma care, mental health support, and outbreak preparedness. Special attention will be given to maternal and child health, occupational disease surveillance for port workers, and gender-sensitive infrastructure.
Junaid Chaudhry also announced the development of a comprehensive digital health roadmap aimed at enhancing emergency preparedness for climate-induced disasters, ensuring equitable healthcare access for vulnerable port communities, and integrating real-time data with provincial health departments for coordinated responses.
The plan includes expanding mental health support systems and introducing stress management programs for maritime laborers facing climate-related psychological stress. A dedicated implementation team will oversee progress, ensure transparency, and coordinate resource mobilization.
Stakeholder consultations will be held with fisherfolk unions, port worker associations, healthcare NGOs, and provincial authorities to ensure the initiative reflects on-the-ground realities and community-specific vulnerabilities.
Estimates suggest that the three key hospitals combined receive 2,000 to 3,000 patient visits daily, underscoring the urgent need for robust, climate-adaptive healthcare systems to serve Pakistan’s maritime and port populations.

During the ceremony, the chief guests expressed solidarity with the sanitation workers and distributed checks worth Rs10,000 each among more than 1,000 sanitation workers of Rawalpindi Tehsil. These checks served as a recognition of their tireless efforts and dedication to keeping the city clean during the Eidul Azha sacrificial days. In her speech, Special Secretary Asiya Gul stated that sanitation workers are the real heroes of Punjab. Acknowledging their services is a top priority for the Government of Punjab.
In line with Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s vision, efforts are ongoing to dignify the sanitation sector and provide relief to its workers. Presiding over the event, MNA Tahira Aurangzeb said that sanitation workers are the pillars of our society without whom no system can function. The government is committed to resolving their issues and providing permanent employment wherever possible.
MNA Raja Qamar-ul-Islam added that these checks are not merely financial support, but a practical expression of respect and honor for the workers. Our government is labour-friendly, and this vision comes directly from Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif.
Deputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema said that workers on the front lines of cleanliness are the guarantors of our cities’ beauty and health. The district administration will continue playing every possible role in their welfare.
Former mayor Sardar Naseem paid tribute to the sanitation workers, saying they are close to our hearts. The dream of development is incomplete without them. Raja Haroon demanded job security and permanent employment for sanitation workers.
CEO RWMC Rana Sajid Safdar stated that those who clean our city are its true builders. Their continuous efforts during Eid kept Rawalpindi clean. Providing them with financial assistance is not just an institutional responsibility but also a moral obligation. The “Suthra Punjab Program” is a revolutionary initiative by the Chief Minister of Punjab aimed at modernizing the sanitation system. We have also made progress in the board for regularizing 900 workers.
All political and social representatives present in the ceremony paid tribute to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s initiative and appreciated the policy of expanding the sanitation system to rural areas. Sanitation workers also shared their thoughts during the event, stating that for the first time they felt that their services were being truly respected. They thanked the chief minister, RWMC, and the district administration for this recognition.

ICCI stresses globally accredited training to boost skilled workforce,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323568-icci-stresses-globally-accredited-training-to-boost-skilled-workforce,"ISLAMABAD: Nasir Mansoor Qureshi, president of the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI), has emphasised the urgent need for globally accredited vocational and technical training programmes to enhance Pakistan’s skilled workforce to increase its demand in international markets.
Talking to a delegation of visiting business leaders at the Chamber House on Saturday, Qureshi underlined the importance of aligning all vocational and technical training initiatives across the country with international standards, said a press release issued here.
The ICCI president said this alignment is vital for enhancing the global employability of Pakistan’s youth and unlocking new avenues for foreign remittances. He noted that by ensuring internationally recognised quality in training institutions, Pakistan can open up greater overseas opportunities for its young population, thereby contributing significantly to the national economy through an increase in foreign exchange inflows.
The ICCI president appreciated the efforts of the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) and the prime minister’s initiative to bring all public sector training programmes under a unified regulatory framework.
He welcomed the move to standardise curricula as a meaningful step towards producing a competitive and competent workforce. Highlighting the importance of a skilled youth population for the country’s economic progress, Qureshi said, “A fully trained and internationally competitive workforce can not only uplift our economic indicators but also place Pakistan firmly on the road to sustainable development.”
He further stated that the ICCI is fully committed to playing its part in this national goal. “We aim to promote entrepreneurship and support startups by strengthening collaboration with academic institutions, fostering innovation, and preparing youth to meet global market demands,” he added.
The ICCI president reiterated that empowering youth with internationally accepted skills is a critical investment for ensuring long-term economic resilience and prosperity for Pakistan.

US President Trump discloses $57m earnings from crypto venture,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323569-us-president-trump-discloses-57m-earnings-from-crypto-venture,"Donald Trump has disclosed almost $60 million in income from one of his cryptocurrency ventures, highlighting how the US president has benefited from his embrace of the digital asset industry, says a report by foreign outlet Financial Times.
Trump on Friday reported income of $57.4 million derived from his involvement with World Liberty Financial, a cryptocurrency group he backs with his sons Donald Jr and Eric, said the report published on Saturday.
The more than 200-page filing, published by the US Office of Government Ethics, an ethics watchdog, shows that Trump holds 15.75 billion governance tokens -- which provide him with voting rights -- in the World Liberty Financial venture.
The cryptocurrency enterprise was among the largest sources of income among hundreds of items, including earnings from books and property investments.
The annual financial disclosure is likely to heighten scrutiny of Trump’s financial entanglements with the crypto industry, which have prompted concerns about potential conflicts of interest, the Financial Times report added.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. World Liberty Financial said in January it had sold 21 billion tokens in a public sale, reaching its goal to generate $1 billion. A 2024 filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission described Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff as a ‘promoter’ of WLF.
Trump’s public support has helped fuel a rally in crypto markets, propelling the price of bitcoin above $100,000 a coin. The SEC, under the leadership of chair Paul Atkins, has dropped several high-profile cases against crypto groups. Trump has also repeatedly touted his own $TRUMP memecoin on social media -- and last month hosted a gala dinner for its biggest holders, the report said.
The Trump family media company last week said it hoped to launch its own exchange traded fund that would directly hold bitcoin, and in May said it would raise $2.5 billion to create a “bitcoin treasury”.
Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr in May told a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas that transacting with cryptocurrencies was “cheaper”, “faster”, “safer” and “more transparent” than fiat currencies.

Tesla set to open India showrooms in July with Made-in-China EVs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323570-tesla-set-to-open-india-showrooms-in-july-with-made-in-china-evs,"Tesla Inc is set to open its first showrooms in India in July, people familiar with the discussions said, kicking off formal operations in the world’s third-biggest automobile market as the Elon Musk-led firm hunts for growth amid falling sales in Europe and China, reports Bloomberg.
The electric vehicle giant’s first set of cars have arrived in the country -- Model Y rear-wheel drive SUVs shipped from Tesla’s China factory, according to the people, who asked not to be identified as the information is private, as well as documents seen by Bloomberg News. The Model Y is the world’s largest selling electric car.
Tesla is set to open its first showroom in Mumbai as early as mid July, which will be followed by one in New Delhi, according to the people. It has also imported Supercharger components, car accessories, merchandise and spares from the US, China and the Netherlands, the documents show.
The debut will end a years-long on-again, off-again saga over Tesla’s entry into India -- a market Musk has long eyed but held back from entering due to disagreements over tariffs and local manufacturing. The breakthrough in bringing Tesla to India comes after Musk met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the US in February.
Bloomberg News reported in February that Tesla was set to ship a few thousand cars to a port near Mumbai.Tesla spokespersons did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on opening of the India showrooms and the preparations underway.
Premium price
Five Model Y vehicles have already arrived in Mumbai from Tesla’s Shanghai factory, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. The cars were declared at INR2.77 million ($31,988) and attracted more than 2.1 million rupees in import duties -- a levy that’s consistent with India’s 70 per cent tariff on fully-built imported cars under $40,000 plus surcharges, the documents show.
The model is expected to go on sale for more than $56,000 before taxes and insurance, though Tesla will determine the final sticker price based on its margin and positioning strategy, according to people familiar with the plans.
That compares with an ex-showroom price of $44,990 for the same model in the US, which sells for $37,490 once tax credits are applied.
The premium price tag will likely be a major hurdle to Tesla’s plans as the automaker will need to convince value-driven consumers to open their wallets. EVs account for just over 5.0 per cent of new passenger vehicle sales in India, but premium cars still represent less than 2.0 per cent of the market, data with Indian government’s vehicle registration portal show.
Beefing up
The company hasn’t appointed a new country head following the departure of Prashanth Menon, but is beefing up hiring across charging, retail and policy teams, according to people familiar with the matter.
The Model Y imports represent an initial foray into the market and Tesla plans to expand its presence, including offering more models.It’s leasing warehouse space in Karnataka, in India’s south, and is adding more in Gurugram, outside New Delhi, the people said.
Tesla executives from other countries are making weekly visits, the people said, to the Mumbai and New Delhi showrooms, which are in high-profile, luxury business precincts in an effort to attract affluent shoppers.

Rupee seen stabilising around 285 next week,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323571-rupee-seen-stabilising-around-285-next-week,"KARACHI: The rupee may stabilise near 285 against the US dollar in the coming weeks despite a visible squeeze in dollar liquidity, as analysts dismiss recent pressure as largely tactical and sentiment-driven rather than a fundamental deterioration.
The local unit closed at 283.7 on Friday in the interbank market -- its weakest level since December 2023 -- while importers were being quoted at 284.25-284.5, and open market rates hovered around 285.7. Banks, in a rush to boost official remittance flows, are offering Rs1-2above market to attract inflows, according to a note by Tresmark.
Despite this, analysts suggest there is little cause for alarm. Pakistan’s foreign reserves have almost doubled from $8.8 billion in June 2023 to over $17 billion now, and are expected to exceed $20 billion this month, bolstered by a projected $3.4 billion in inflows.
“The market may be short by around $300-400 million to make dollar liquidity truly comfortable,” the note stated. Exporters holding back proceeds in anticipation of rupee weakness and geopolitical jitters following the Iran-Israel conflict are also contributing to temporary tightness in the market.
Meanwhile, the central bank continues to mop up dollars from the market in a bid to meet its IMF-linked reserve targets, keeping the exchange rate under mild pressure. Pakistan’s real effective exchange rate (REER) stands at 97.8, indicating that the rupee remains slightly undervalued -- just under India’s REER of 98.57 -- offering a cushion for competitiveness. The current account is also projected to post a surplus this fiscal year, easing macroeconomic concerns.
Analysts see the government reluctant to allow a material depreciation of the currency due to inflation and political sensitivities. The rupee is expected to consolidate near 285 in July, though the FY2025 budget assumes an average rate of 290, setting an informal trading band between 283 and 297. Rating agencies, meanwhile, are forecasting levels as high as 298-305 by mid-2025.
“Gradual depreciation of around Rs1.5 per dollar per month -- roughly 6.2 per cent annually -- would remain manageable,” the note said. Oil price risks remain contained for now. While Middle East tensions persist, global dynamics are shifting. “We live in a world where Middle East oil is a lot less relevant to the US,” said Ali Meli of Monachil Capital Partners, citing the shale revolution and growing OPEC output. Brent crude is expected to cap near $83 per barrel. At that level, the impact on Pakistan’s import bill is estimated at $400 million annually, with a 2.0 per cent inflationary effect -- considered manageable barring a prolonged surge.

Middle East tensions put investors on alert,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323572-middle-east-tensions-put-investors-on-alert,"NEW YORK: Investors are mulling a host of different market scenarios should the US deepen its involvement in the Middle East conflict, with the potential for ripple effects if energy prices skyrocket.
They have honed in on the evolving situation between Israel and Iran, which have exchanged missile strikes, and are closely monitoring whether the US decides to join Israel in its bombing campaign.
Potential scenarios could send inflation higher, dampening consumer confidence and lessening the chance of near-term interest rate cuts. This would likely cause an initial selloff in equities and possible safe-haven bid for the dollar.
While US crude prices have climbed some 10 per cent over the past week, the S&P 500 has been little changed as of yet, following an initial drop when Israel launched its attacks. However, if attacks were to take out Iranian oil supply, “that’s when the market is going to sit up and take notice,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.
“If you get disruption to supply of oil product on the global marketplace, that is not reflected in today’s WTI price and that is where things get negative,” Hogan said. The White House said on Thursday President Donald Trump would decide on US involvement in the conflict in the next two weeks.
Analysts at Oxford Economics modelled three scenarios, ranging from a de-escalation in the conflict, a complete shutdown in Iranian production, and a closure of the Strait of Hormuz, “each with increasingly large impacts on global oil prices,” the firm said in a note. In the most severe case, global oil prices jump to around $130 per barrel, driving US inflation near 6.0 per cent by the end of this year, Oxford said in the note.
“Although the price shock inevitably dampens consumer spending because of the hit to real incomes, the scale of the rise in inflation and concerns about the potential for second-round inflation effects likely ruin any chance of rate cuts in the US this year,” Oxford said in the note.
OIL IMPACT
The biggest market impact from the escalating conflict has been restricted to oil, with oil prices soaring on worries that the Iran-Israel conflict could disrupt supplies. Brent crude futures have risen as much as 18 per cent since June 10, hitting a near five-month high of $79.04 on Thursday.
The accompanying rise in investors’ expectations for further near-term volatility in oil prices has outpaced the rise in volatility expectations for other major asset classes, including stocks and bonds.
But other asset classes, including stocks, could still feel the knock-on effects of higher oil prices, especially if there is a larger surge in oil prices if the worst market fears of supply disruptions come true, analysts said.
“Geopolitical tensions have been mostly ignored by equities, but they are being factored into oil,” Citigroup analysts wrote in a note.“To us, the key for equities from here will come from energy commodity pricing,” they said.
STOCKS UNPERTURBED
US stocks have so far weathered rising Middle East tensions with little sign of panic. A more direct US involvement in the conflict could, however, spook markets, investors said.
Financial markets may be in for an initial selloff if the US military attacks Iran, with economists warning that a dramatic rise in oil prices could damage a global economy already strained by Trump’s tariffs. Still, any pullback in equities might be fleeting, history suggests. During past prominent instances of Middle East tensions coming to a boil, including the 2003 Iraq invasion and the 2019 attacks on Saudi oil facilities, stocks initially languished but soon recovered to trade higher in the months ahead.
On average, the S&P 500 slipped 0.3 per cent in the three weeks following the start of conflict, but was 2.3 per cent higher on average two months following the conflict, according to data from Wedbush Securities and CapIQ Pro.
DOLLAR WOES
An escalation in the conflict could have mixed implications for the US dollar, which has tumbled this year amid worries over diminished US exceptionalism. In the event of US direct engagement in the Iran-Israel War, the dollar could initially benefit from a safety bid, analysts said. “Traders are likely to worry more about the implicit erosion of the terms of trade for Europe, the UK, and Japan, rather than the economic shock to the US, a major oil producer,” Thierry Wizman, Global FX & Rates Strategist at Macquarie Group, said in a note. But longer-term, the prospect of US-directed 'nation-building' would probably weaken the dollar, he said.
“We recall that after the attacks of 9/11, and running through the decade-long US presence in Afghanistan and Iraq, the USD weakened,” Wizman said.

"Telecom sector’s average revenue per user climbs 50% in five years, says brokerage firm",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323573-telecom-sector-s-average-revenue-per-user-climbs-50pc-in-five-years-says-brokerage-firm,"KARACHI: The telecom sector has recorded a steady rise in average revenue per user (ARPU), which hit Rs313 per month in FY2024-25, up from Rs209 in FY2019-20 -- marking a 50 per cent increase over five years, according to brokerage Topline Securities.
In a post on LinkedIn on Saturday, the firm added that the increase in ARPU reflects a broader shift driven by higher data consumption, the expansion of broadband services, upward tariff revisions and a reduction in multi-SIM usage.
“While this upward trajectory signals improving digital adoption,” Topline noted, “Pakistan’s ARPU still trails regional peers.”According to Topline’s analysis, mobile ARPU hovered near Rs210 for three consecutive years before gaining momentum -- from Rs209 in FY2019-20 to Rs212 in FY2021-22; Rs229 in FY2022-23; Rs276 in FY2023-24; and finally reaching Rs313 by December 2024.
The firm believes continued growth in data services and sector consolidation could help sustain revenue expansion, although operators may face pressures from inflation and regulatory constraints.

"Budget dialogue urges climate fund, end to fossil subsidies",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323574-budget-dialogue-urges-climate-fund-end-to-fossil-subsidies,"KARACHI: Urgent climate and energy-related demands dominated a high-level budget dialogue held in Karachi, where experts and civil society groups called for the establishment of a ‘national climate adaptation fund’, restoration of tax incentives for renewable energy and phasing out fossil fuel subsidies in favour of greener alternatives.
Organised by the Sindh Just Energy Transition Alliance (SJETA) in collaboration with the Civil Society Support Programme (CSSP), the forum brought together government officials, academics, students, civil society members, and researchers to examine the federal and provincial budgets for 2025-26 through the lens of climate justice and energy transition.
The event concluded with a ‘policy ask document’ set to be submitted to the national and provincial assemblies. Among its top recommendations were aligning public spending with the Integrated Generation Capacity Expansion Plan (IGCEP 2025-34); gender-responsive budgeting; stronger funding for climate research; and a strategic shift from short-term mitigation to long-term climate adaptation.
Delivering the keynote address, Prof Dr Raza Ali Khan, former chairperson of the Economics and Management Sciences Department at NED University Karachi, urged the government to prioritise locally grounded renewable energy solutions and ensure effective use of climate funds. He said aligning fiscal policy with green goals is essential for long-term resilience.
Kashif Ali, executive director at Transparency International Pakistan, presented a critical review of existing budgets, revealing a sharp disconnect between climate ambitions and actual allocations. He noted that adaptation infrastructure, renewables, and local solutions remain underfunded, while fossil fuel subsidies still consume large fiscal space.
Representing the government, Engr Rajveer Singh, special assistant to the chief minister of Sindh on human rights, welcomed the forum’s recommendations. He highlighted provincial reforms, including the creation of SEPRA and STDC, and assured participants that the input would be shared with relevant ministries during ongoing budget deliberations.
Dr Fateh Mari, former vice chancellor of Sindh Agriculture University Tando Jam, called for dedicated research budgets to address climate challenges in agriculture, especially in water resource management and sustainable farming practices.
Presiding over the session, Prof Dr Mohammad Aslam Uqaili, former vice chancellor of Mehran University of Engineering and Technology (MUET), called for a structural overhaul of Pakistan’s budget framework.
He advocated community-led renewable energy models and highlighted Sindh’s untapped potential in solar and wind energy.Noor Bajeer, CEO of CSSP, who opened the session, stressed the need for inclusive and equitable fiscal policies that reflect the lived climate realities of vulnerable communities.
Iqbal Detho, chairperson of the Sindh Human Rights Commission, linked environmental protection to constitutional obligations under Article 9(A), stressing that both governance and timely budget execution are key to realising climate goals.

"FPCCI criticises budget powers for tax officials, seeks policy revisions",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323575-fpcci-criticises-budget-powers-for-tax-officials-seeks-policy-revisions,"KARACHI: The Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) has strongly opposed several provisions in the federal budget for FY2025-26, warning that excessive powers granted to tax officials could undermine investor confidence and hamper industrial activity.
President of FPCCI Atif Ikram Sheikh said the organisation rejects the “excessive, overly subjective and harassment-prone authorities” granted to tax officials under the proposed budget. He specifically criticised provisions that allow tax authorities to withdraw funds from business accounts or raid premises without prior notice. “These harsh measures must be rolled back before the budget is passed to restore business community confidence,” Sheikh said in a statement. “The tax target can only be achieved if exporters and industrialists are consulted through a structured dialogue.”
He also noted the absence of concrete steps to support Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s stated goal of achieving export-led growth.Sheikh warned that increased human interaction between tax collectors and businesses undermines fairness and transparency. “Globally, it is well established that the more a tax official is allowed to intervene, the greater the likelihood of abuse and unpredictability,” he said.
FPCCI Senior Vice President Saquib Fayyaz Magoon called for the restoration of the fixed tax regime (FTR) for exporters, saying long-term clarity is essential to encourage both domestic and foreign investment.
Magoon also urged the government to expand the scope of the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) to include local manufacturers. “Excluding them risks supply chain disruptions and will reduce competitiveness in regional and global markets,” he said. He further expressed concern that key FPCCI recommendations -- such as incentive packages for the IT & ITeS, mining, and fishing sectors -- were ignored in the budget despite their high-growth potential.
FPCCI Vice President Asif Sakhi said tax officials should move away from viewing businesses as evaders. “We need a shift towards a more facilitative, respectful approach if we want voluntary compliance,” he said.
FPCCI VP Aman Paracha proposed a high-level fact-finding committee to determine why the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) failed to meet its FY25 collection target.Nasir Khan, another FPCCI vice president, warned that many entrepreneurs have already moved operations abroad. “The remaining ones are barely keeping factories open without incurring losses,” he said.
The FPCCI also criticised the 10-year restriction -- or tax year 2035 limit -- imposed on developers in special economic zones (SEZs). The group argued the window is too short to accommodate the time required to establish operations and begin revenue generation.“To truly attract FDI and serious long-term investors, this period should be extended to at least 20 years -- ideally 30,” the FPCCI said.

Untapped mineral wealth holds strategic promise for Pakistan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323576-untapped-mineral-wealth-holds-strategic-promise-for-pakistan,"LAHORE: Pakistan’s vast mineral wealth could significantly transform its economy if managed strategically. Experts point to the need for long-term planning, public-private partnerships, legal clarity, and transparent governance to unlock the potential of this largely dormant sector.
Despite having abundant mineral resources, Pakistan has failed to fully exploit them due to underinvestment, inadequate infrastructure, outdated geological surveys, and persistent governance and security challenges -- particularly in Balochistan and tribal areas. Investor confidence has been further dampened by inconsistent policies and legal disputes.
Infrastructure deficiencies also constrain development. There is minimal local value addition, with most minerals exported in raw form, thereby missing downstream economic benefits.Among Pakistan’s key underdeveloped assets is the Reko Diq copper and gold deposit in Chagai district, Balochistan -- one of the world’s largest untapped reserves. The site holds an estimated 5.9 billion tonnes of ore containing 0.41 per cent copper and 0.22 grams of gold per tonne. Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold is leading the development, though progress has been slow due to disputes.
Iron ore deposits have been identified in Kalabagh, Chiniot and Nok Kundi, with significant reserves in Chiniot. However, these remain largely unexplored for commercial extraction. Lead and zinc mining is underway at a small scale at the Duddar Mine in Balochistan, with potential for greater exploitation.
Industrial minerals such as gypsum, limestone and rock salt are being mined in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for use in cement, construction and food processing. Khewra’s salt is internationally known, yet value-added exports remain limited.
High-grade chromite from Muslim Bagh and Khanozai in Balochistan is exported raw with little domestic processing. Similarly, minerals like bentonite, bauxite, and Fuller’s Earth, found in Sindh, KP and Balochistan, are underutilised despite applications in ceramics, cosmetics and drilling.
Thar coal, with estimated reserves exceeding 175 billion tonnes of lignite, is being developed under CPEC, though environmental and cost concerns persist. Small-scale uranium extraction in Dera Ghazi Khan supports civil nuclear programmes, but commercial viability has not been fully pursued.
Gemstones including emeralds, rubies, topaz, and tourmaline are found in Swat, Gilgit-Baltistan, and KP, yet a lack of certification labs, outdated mining methods, and weak international branding limit Pakistan’s competitiveness in the global market.
Historically, China has led investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector. However, recent developments indicate a growing interest from the US, particularly in critical minerals such as copper, gold and lithium.
In April 2025, Senior Bureau Official at the US State Department Eric Meyer led a high-level delegation to the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum in Islamabad. He met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Army Chief General Asim Munir, and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, calling mineral development “a core area of mutual interest” and encouraging US firms to explore investment opportunities.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio also held discussions with Ishaq Dar in April, highlighting collaboration on critical minerals as a pathway to deepen bilateral trade and investment. The American approach blends diplomacy, business engagement, financial tools, and trade policy -- signalling a strategic, multi-pronged interest in Pakistan’s untapped mineral wealth.

"‘Survive, nothing more’: Cuba’s elderly live hand to mouth",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323577-survive-nothing-more-cuba-s-elderly-live-hand-to-mouth,"HAVANA: With a monthly pension barely sufficient to buy 15 eggs or a small bag of rice, Cuba’s elderly struggle to make ends meet in one of Latin America’s poorest and fastest-aging countries.
As the communist island battles its deepest economic crisis in three decades, the state is finding it increasingly hard to care for some 2.4 million inhabitants -- more than a quarter of the population -- aged 60 and over.
Sixty is the age at which women -- for men it’s 65 -- qualify for the state pension which starts at 1,528 Cuban pesos per month.This is less than $13 at the official exchange rate and a mere $4 on the informal street market where most Cubans do their shopping.
“Fight for life, for death is certain,” vendor Isidro Manuet, 73, told AFP sitting on a sidewalk in the heart of Havana, his skin battered by years in the sun, several of his front teeth missing.“I manage to live, survive, nothing more,” he said of his meagre income that allows him to buy a little food, and not much else.
As he spoke to AFP, Manuet looked on as small groups of people walked by his stall carrying bags full of food.They were coming out of Casalinda, one of several part government-run megastores that sells goods exclusively to holders of US dollars -- a small minority of Cubans.
Most rely instead on informal stalls such as the ones Manuet and other elderly Cubans set up on sidewalks every morning to sell fruit, coffee, cigarettes, candy, used clothes and other second-hand goods.
‘Things are bad’
Near Manuet’s stall, 70-year-old Antonia Diez sells clothing and makeup.“Things are bad, really bad,” she sighs, shaking her head.Many of Cuba’s elderly have been without family support since 2022, when the biggest migratory exodus in the country’s history began amid a crisis marked by food, fuel and medicine shortages, power blackouts and rampant inflation.
More beggars can be seen on Havana’s streets -- though there are no official figures -- and every now and then an elderly person can be spotted rummaging through garbage bins for something to eat, or sell.
The Cuban crisis, which Havana blames on decades of US sanctions but analysts say was fuelled by government economic mismanagement and tourism tanking under the Covid-19 pandemic, has affected the public purse too, with cuts in welfare spending.
As a result, the government has struggled to buy enough of the staples it has made available for decades to impoverished Cubans at heavily subsidised prices under the ‘libreta’ ration book system.
It is the only way many people have to access affordable staples such as rice, sugar and beans -- when there is any.Diez said she used to receive an occasional state-sponsored food package, “but it’s been a while since they’ve sent anything.”
‘No future’
This all means that many products can only be found at ‘dollar stores’ such as Casalinda, or private markets where most people cannot afford to shop.
According to the University of Havana’s Center for Cuban Economic Studies, in 2023 a Cuban family of three would have needed 12 to 14 times the average minimum monthly salary of 2,100 pesos (around $17) to meet their basic food needs.
Official figures show about 68,000 Cubans over 60 rely on soup kitchens run by the state Family Assistance System for one warm meal per day.At one such facility, ‘Las Margaritas’, a plate of food costs about 13 pesos (11 dollar cents). Pensioner Eva Suarez, 78, has been going there daily for 18 months.
“The country is in such need. There’s no food, there’s nothing,” she told AFP, adding her pension is basically worthless “because everything is so expensive.”Inflation rose by 190 per cent between 2018 and 2023, but pensions have not kept pace.
Some are losing faith in communism, brought to the island by Fidel Castro’s revolution, and its unfulfilled promises such as a litre of subsidised milk for every child under seven per day.“I have nothing, my house is falling apart,” said Lucy Perez, a 72-year-old economist who retired with 1,600 pesos (about 13 dollars) a month after a 36-year career.
“The situation is dire. The nation has no future.”It’s not just the elderly suffering.Cuba was rocked by unprecedented anti-government protests in 2021, and students have been rebelling in recent months due to a steep hike in the cost of mobile internet -- which only arrived on the island seven years ago.In January, the government announced a partial dollarisation of the economy that has angered many unable to lay their hands on greenbacks.

South Korea’s chief trade negotiator to visit US,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323578-south-korea-s-chief-trade-negotiator-to-visit-us,"SEOUL: South Korea’s trade minister Yeo Han-koo will visit the United States from June 22 to 27, the trade ministry said on Saturday.
The visit will include discussions with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and the third round of bilateral technical discussions, a ministry official told Reuters. Further details about the meetings were not disclosed. “Since a South Korea-US summit has yet to take place and key ministers have not been appointed under the new administration, negotiations are likely to focus on areas that the trade ministry can manage -- excluding major issues such as defence cost -- sharing and exchange rates,” Heo Yoon, an economics professor at Sogang University, said. “Given these circumstances, reaching a comprehensive agreement on key negotiation frameworks and agendas is expected to be challenging.”
South Korea, which is currently facing a 10 per cent blanket tariff and a 25 per cent country-specific duty temporarily paused for 90 days, agreed with the US during initial trade negotiations in late April to craft a trade deal reducing tariffs by July 8.
Asia’s fourth-largest economy unexpectedly contracted in the first quarter amid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs and domestic political unrest following former President Yoon Suk Yeol’s martial law decree in December.

Pakistan seeks furniture export boost with industry training in Peshawar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323580-pakistan-seeks-furniture-export-boost-with-industry-training-in-peshawar,"KARACHI: The Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) held a seminar in Peshawar aimed at strengthening export readiness in the country’s wood and furniture sector, as part of a broader push to enhance value-added exports from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).
The event, titled ‘Wood Identification, Quality Assessment and Export Procedure’, was organised by TDAP’s E&M-Division-II in collaboration with the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI), and drew strong participation from local business leaders in the furniture trade.
Speakers from the SCCI and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Furniture Association highlighted persistent challenges faced by the industry -- including weak institutional support, poor export infrastructure, and lack of training -- as key barriers to scaling Pakistan’s furniture exports.
The technical session featured detailed presentations on wood quality and classification by Dr Zahid Rauf and Dr Tanveer Hussain from the Pakistan Forest Institute. TDAP officials, including Director Nadia Farooqui and Deputy Director Zahid Mohammad, presented export procedures and trade facilitation tools tailored for the furniture industry.
Industry representatives also flagged structural bottlenecks such as the inactive status of the Pakistan Furniture Institute in Hayatabad and the lack of progress on a proposed dedicated Furniture City. The SCCI president urged TDAP to launch further capacity-building initiatives focused on digital marketing and e-commerce to help firms tap into global markets.

"Pakistan showed grit, says Tahir Zaman",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323597-pakistan-showed-grit-says-tahir-zaman,"KARACHI: Pakistan hockey team head coach Tahir Zaman said that the green shirts performed exceptionally well in the FIH Nations Cup 2025.  Pakistan lost the final 6-2 against New Zealand on Saturday.
He stressed that they conceded six goals, but played with a brave heart and showed amazing fight, especially the second half where they not only scored two goals, but also displayed some attacking.
While talking to The News from Kuala Lumpur after the match, he said, “Given the challenging circumstances, the players showed unbelievable grit, fight and strength. Defeating teams like Japan and France is no easy thing,” Tahir said.
It has to be mentioned that only Wales and Japan are ranked below Pakistan, while all other participating teams have better positions in FIH rankings. He said that New Zealand played well, made good attacking moves and Pak defenders could not stop them due to which they scored five goals in the first 30 minutes.
Tahir said that poor defense was the main reason for the defeat. “Being the runners-up, we have showed that we can compete in big events if we get the chance to play in such events more often. Moreover, by beating France in the semi-final on the penalty shootout, we proved that we can win when it gets to the penalty shootout,” Tahir stressed.
He said that all matches were tough and players learnt a lot in every match and improved their game and performance after each match. He observed that attacking game of Pakistan in the tournament was the major factor in the success.
He said that the forward line played marvelously, made tricky moves, and broke the defense line. Among the positives, Tahir spotted players like Rana Waheed, Ammad Shakeel, Sufyan Khan, Abdul Rehman and several others who played clinical roles in bringing Pakistan so close.

"Pakistan in semis,to take on Qatar",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323598-pakistan-in-semis-to-take-on-qatar,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan defeated Indonesia 3-1 to earn a place in the semi-finals of the Nations Cup Volleyball following the quarter-finals at Manama (Bahrain) Saturday.
Pakistan lost the opening set 20-25, before recovering well to take the next three 25-21, 25-20, 25-17. Pakistan captain Murad Jehan led from the front and delivered an all-around performance, dominating both in attack and defense.
Usman Faryad Ali controlled the net with powerful blocks and crucial spikes. Fahad Raza showed exceptional coordination and playmaking abilities, contributing significantly to the team’s momentum.
Their outstanding performances were pivotal in turning the game in Pakistan's favor after dropping the opening set. With this victory, Pakistan has officially qualified for the semi-finals. Pakistan will take on a strong Qatar side in the semi-finals. Qatar defeated Vietnam in a five-game thriller in the third quarter-finals.

Australian opener Konstas says he has ‘come a long way’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323599-australian-opener-konstas-says-he-has-come-a-long-way,"SYDNEY: Teenage opener Sam Konstas said Saturday he had ""come a long way"" from his combative debut against India after winning his place back for Australia´s opening Test against the West Indies.
The 19-year-old made headlines in the Melbourne Boxing Day Test last year when he took on fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah to make a blazing debut 60 with a slew of unorthodox shots. But he only lasted one more Test before being jettisoned with some pundits seeing his batting as ""reckless"".
With a struggling Marnus Labuschagne dropped for the opening Test in Barbados on June 25 and Steve Smith out nursing an injured finger, Konstas has another chance, confirmed as a certain starter.
""The emotions probably got to me with the crowd,"" Konstas, who has his Test cap No.468 tattooed on his forearm, said of his explosive Boxing Day knock. ""I´ve been trying to focus on a few key areas with my batting coach, and I feel like I´ve come a long way, so hopefully I can display that in the next few Test matches.""
Konstas is set to open alongside Usman Khawaja, 19 years his senior, with an opportunity to cement the position as his own. Since David Warner retired some 18 months ago, Australia have tried five openers, including Konstas, and with an Ashes series against England later this year they need stability.
""Very excited. Obviously it´s a tough team to crack into as we´ve got legends of the game,"" said the teenager. ""Hopefully I grab my opportunity with both hands. ""It´s a dream come true to be honest, 19 years old, playing for your country, travelling the world. I´m very lucky to be where I am currently."" Australia play three Tests against the West Indies.

Naqvi meets former chief Dr Naseem,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323601-naqvi-meets-former-chief-dr-naseem,"LAHORE: Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and Interior Minister, Mohsin Naqvi, held a cordial meeting with former PCB Chairman Dr. Naseem Ashraf, engaging in a wide-ranging discussion on cricket administration and institutional experience.
Naqvi shared details of the meeting via a post on X, noting: “Had a wonderful conversation with former Chairman PCB Dr. Naseem Ashraf. A gentleman of great insight and experience — there’s always so much to learn from him.”
The exchange marks a rare public interaction between current and past PCB leadership, reflecting Naqvi’s continued efforts to draw from institutional memory as the board navigates both domestic and international cricketing developments.
Dr. Naseem Ashraf, a seasoned bureaucrat and cricket administrator, served as PCB Chairman from 2006 to 2008 after being appointed by then-President Pervez Musharraf. He resigned in August 2008, just weeks before Pakistan was scheduled to host its first ICC Champions Trophy — a tournament that was later relocated due to security concerns. His tenure was marked by challenging decisions, including fallout from the forfeited Oval Test against England in 2006.

Bumrah strikes before Duckett and Pope hold firm in 1st Test,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323602-bumrah-strikes-before-duckett-and-pope-hold-firm-in-1st-test,"LEEDS: India spearhead Jasprit Bumrah struck an early blow before England´s Ben Duckett and Ollie Pope kept the tourists at bay on Saturday to leave the first Test at Headingley intriguingly poised.
At tea on the second day, England were 107-1 in reply to India´s first innings 471, a deficit of 364 runs. Duckett, dropped on 15, was 53 not out and Pope unbeaten on 48 after they had come together at 4-1 when Bumrah dismissed Zak Crawley.
India had been threatening a score in excess of 500 earlier Saturday after Rishabh Pant (134) joined opener Yashasvi Jaiswal and captain Shubman Gill as one of three batsmen to make hundreds in the innings. But a collapse either side of lunch saw India lose their last seven wickets for 41 runs inside 12 overs.
England captain Ben Stokes led from the front with an economical 4-66 in 20 overs, while fast bowler Josh Tongue wrapped up the innings on his way to 4-86. Stokes had opted to field first after winning the toss Friday in seemingly ideal conditions for batting.
As a result, his openers now had to face the outstanding Bumrah under grey skies, illuminated by the Headingley floodlights, that favoured the unorthodox fast bowler. And the last ball of the first over of England´s reply saw Bumrah produce a near unplayable delivery that angled in and seamed away to take Crawley´s outside edge, with Karun Nair holding a sharp catch at first slip.
England should have been 39-2 when Duckett´s thick outside edge off Bumrah flew to backward point only for Ravindra Jadeja, so often superb in the field, to drop a two-handed catch. Bumrah´s opening spell yielded fine figure of 1-21 in five overs.
But with India keen not to over-burden Bumrah following a back injury, he only bowled one more over before tea. Pope, fresh from his 171 against Zimbabwe last month, survived a delivery from Mohammed Siraj on 34 on umpire´s call. Duckett, meanwhile swept left-arm spinner Jadeja to complete a fifty with his eighth four in 68 balls faced.
India resumed on their overnight 359-3, with Gill 127 not out and Pant unbeaten on 65. Gill, in his first innings as India skipper since succeeding the retired Rohit Sharma, surpassed his previous highest Test score of 128 with a classic off-drive for four against Chris Woakes.
Pant, by contrast went to a hundred in spectacular style, the wicketkeeper charging down the pitch to Shoaib Bashir before hoisting the off-spinner high over deep midwicket for six despite one hand coming off the bat.
The 27-year-old then celebrated his century with an acrobatic somersault. Pant´s seventh hundred in 44 Tests, and fourth against England, came off 146 balls including 10 fours and four sixes in a typically aggressive innings.
The pair were in complete command until Gill´s mistimed pick-up shot off Bashir flew straight to deep square leg as the 25-year-old skipper fell for 147, having faced 227 balls including 19 fours and one six. Gill´s exit ended a partnership of 209 in 49 overs with Pant that had taken India to 430-4 and opened the door for a flurry of wickets to give England hope.

"Flamengo floor Chelsea at Club World Cup, Bayern edge out Boca",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323603-flamengo-floor-chelsea-at-club-world-cup-bayern-edge-out-boca,"Philadelphia: Flamengo produced a brilliant second-half fightback to beat Chelsea 3-1 at the Club World Cup on Friday and qualify for the last 16, while Bayern Munich joined them in reaching the knockout phase with a battling win over Boca Juniors.
In Philadelphia, Pedro Neto gave Chelsea an early lead but Flamengo, roared on by their frenzied supporters who made up the majority of the 54,019 crowd, did not deserve to be behind and came roaring back in the second half.
Bruno Henrique came off the bench in the 56th minute and quickly equalised before setting up former Real Madrid, Manchester City and Juventus defender Danilo to make it 2-1. Chelsea were stunned, and their hopes of pulling level again were effectively destroyed when substitute Nicolas Jackson was sent off in the 68th minute for a dangerous tackle on Ayrton Lucas.
Wallace Yan then sealed the victory for the Rio de Janeiro club, the Brazilian league leaders, when he made it 3-1 late on. ""It was a special day for me and our club,"" said Flamengo coach Filipe Luis.
""We knew we would have chances against Chelsea, because we have one way to play and they know how to follow that path."" Flamengo have won both matches in Group D and their place in the knockout stage was confirmed later when Esperance of Tunisia defeated Los Angeles FC 1-0 in Nashville.
Youcef Belaili scored the only goal of the game in the 70th minute in front of a sparse crowd featuring Nicole Kidman. LAFC, who were last-minute qualifiers after beating Club America of Mexico in a play-off, cannot now progress further.
Chelsea and Esperance each have three points from two games and their meeting in Philadelphia next Tuesday will decide who joins Flamengo in advancing. ""We expected a tough game because Flamengo is a very good team, with good players and a good manager,"" said Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca.
""They play very well, and in Brazil they are top of the league, unbeaten for many games, so it was not a surprise for us."" Flamengo´s win followed Botafogo´s stunning success against European champions Paris Saint-Germain on Thursday, continuing an impressive record for South American clubs at the competition.
But Bayern´s 2-1 win over Boca in Miami was the first time either a Brazilian or Argentinian team had lost in 10 matches since the tournament started. England star Harry Kane did not find the target when Bayern hammered New Zealand´s Auckland City 10-0 in their opening game, but he opened the scoring in Miami with a clinical finish on 18 minutes.
Boca´s fans made up most of the 63,587 crowd and brought incredible passion and noise to the Hard Rock Stadium, spurring their team on to equalise in the 66th minute. Alan Velasco found Miguel Merentiel down the right and he powered goalwards, skipping around Josip Stanisic before producing a brilliant finish past Manuel Neuer in the Bayern goal.
It looked like South American clubs´ unbeaten record in the tournament so far was going to hold, but with six minutes remaining Michael Olise provided the decisive blow. After a scramble on the edge of the box, Kane found the France international with a delicate lay-off and Olise provided precision control with a superb finish into the corner to send Bayern through to the next round.
""Big performance from the guys. We knew it wasn´t going to be easy, we knew we were coming into a hostile environment,"" Kane told DAZN. ""We have seen how tough it has been for European teams to play against the South American teams. I thought we did really well,"" added Bayern coach Vincent Kompany. Earlier, Benfica crushed Auckland City 6-0 in Orlando to boost their own hopes of progressing and eliminate the tournament´s only Oceania representative.
Angel Di Maria´s two penalties bookended the victory for the Portuguese side, with Leandro Barreiro scoring a brace while Vangelis Pavlidis and Renato Sanches got their other goals. The game was the fourth in the past four days to be hit by a weather delay. The match was interrupted at half-time because of a storm, eventually resuming two hours later. A draw for Benfica against Bayern in Charlotte next Tuesday will send them through and eliminate Boca.

Lehecka stuns Draper to reach Queen’s final,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323604-lehecka-stuns-draper-to-reach-queen-s-final,"LONDON: Czech world number 30 Jiri Lehecka stunned Britain´s Jack Draper to reach the Queen´s Club final with a 6-4, 4-6, 7-5 victory on Saturday.
Lehecka blasted 36 winners and hit 16 aces to end Draper´s bid for a maiden final appearance at the Wimbledon warm-up event in west London. The 23-year-old will face French Open champion Carlos Alcaraz or Spanish veteran Roberto Bautista Agut in Sunday´s final.
""It means a lot. You don´t meet a player like Jack every day, he´s an amazing competitor,"" Lehecka said. ""It´s not easy to use my serve (on grass) but I´ve been working on it for the last few weeks. I´m happy with it.""
Draper was hoping to become the first British singles champion at Queen´s since five-time winner Andy Murray´s most recent victory in 2016. After booking his spot in the semi-finals Draper revealed he had held the Queen´s trophy as a child around 12 years ago.
But Draper, ranked sixth in the world, will have to wait at least another year to get his hands back on the silverware after producing an unusually error-strewn display in sweltering conditions.
Lehecka had already ended the hopes of one Briton at Queen´s after beating Jacob Fearnley in the quarter-finals on Friday. The 23-year-old also defeated world number 12 Alex de Minaur in his opening match of the tournament, but knocking out Draper was his biggest scalp yet.
Draper´s careless double-fault gifted Lehecka a break in the opening game of the first set. The ice-cool Lehecka ignored the searing temperatures as he cruised through the rest of the set. Draper needed to apply pressure on Lehecka to get back in the match and he did exactly that in the fourth game of the second set.
Even then, Lehecka staved off four break points and repelled another in the sixth. But Draper kept slugging away from the baseline and finally landed a big blow with a winner down the line on set point. Rock legend and avid tennis fan Jon Bon Jovi, watching in the stands, rose from his seat to salute Draper´s gritty fightback.

Benfica knock out Auckland in delayed Club World Cup romp,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323605-benfica-knock-out-auckland-in-delayed-club-world-cup-romp,"Orlando: Benfica sailed to a 6-0 win to eliminate Auckland City from the Club World Cup on Friday in Orlando in a match which suffered a long weather delay, with Angel Di Maria netting two penalties.
With the Portuguese side leading by a goal at half-time the match was suspended because of a storm, eventually resuming two hours later. ""This is the longest game of my career, a special thanks to our fans, who have been here for five hours supporting the team,"" said Benfica coach Bruno Lage.
""We played as well as we could. The (hot) temperature made it very difficult."" Auckland of New Zealand, the only Oceania Football Confederation representatives at the tournament, were thrashed 10-0 by Bayern Munich in their Group C opener and this defeat sealed their fate.
Despite their eventual collapse, Auckland battled hard in the first half and almost made it to the break unscathed. Auckland goalkeeper Nathan Garrow made several good saves to keep Benfica at bay and the Portuguese side grew frustrated.
Benfica took the lead deep into first half stoppage time when Gianluca Prestianni was clumsily felled in the area by Haris Zeb. Di Maria, who converted a spot-kick in the opening 2-2 draw against Boca Juniors, sent Garrow the wrong way.
At half-time the match became the fourth in the last four days at the tournament to be impacted by a suspension for adverse conditions, with a storm arriving at the Inter&Co Stadium.
When play eventually resumed, Benfica came back out strongly. Vangelis Pavlidis bundled his way through and smashed home to double Bruno Lage´s team´s lead in the 53rd minute, with Renato Sanches netting the third 10 minutes later from outside the box with a deflected effort.
Luxembourg midfielder Leandro Barreiro bagged a brace to expand Benfica´s lead, tucking home at the back post from Pavlidis´ cross for the fourth before netting from close range. Nikko Boxall brought down Di Maria in stoppage time and the Argentine World Cup winner beat Garrow from the spot again to wrap up Benfica´s emphatic triumph.
It was his third goal of the competition, bringing him level with Bayern Munich´s Jamal Musiala as the top scorers. Later Friday German giants Bayern take on Argentine outfit Boca Juniors in the other Group C match.
Auckland coach Paul Posa, back on the bench after minor surgery stopped him joining up earlier with the team, said despite elimination his side would try their hardest in the final match against Boca on Tuesday in Nashville. ""We will give it our absolute best shot, 100 percent guarantee that,"" he explained.
""We don´t get these opportunities, it´s very rare for us to play teams of these quality, it has just about never happened and may be a long time before it happens again. ""So we won´t lie down and do Boca any favours.""

Teams from ‘south’ have Club World Cup heat advantage: Kovac,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323606-teams-from-south-have-club-world-cup-heat-advantage-kovac,"Cincinnati: Borussia Dortmund coach Niko Kovac said Friday teams from the ""south"" have an advantage on European teams at the Club World Cup because of the current high temperatures in the United States.
South American teams have impressed at the tournament and are unbeaten to this point, while Dortmund´s South African opponents on Saturday, Mamelodi Sundowns, beat Ulsan HD in their first Group F match.
Temperatures are expected to rise up to 32 degrees Celsius during the game at TQL Stadium in Cincinnati, kicking off at 12:00 pm local time. Kovac´s uninspired Dortmund were held to a 0-0 draw by Brazilian side Fluminense in their opening match on Tuesday.
""At the moment in this tournament you see that the clubs from the south, I think they have a big advantage because of the conditions, of the heat,"" Croatian coach Kovac told reporters. ""We´re respecting every team and we know this is a very good team, from Africa, from South Africa.""
Brazilian side Botafogo stunned Champions League winners Paris Saint-Germain on Thursday, while Chelsea lost against another Brazilian team in Flamengo. Some players and coaches have complained about the heat and humidity they have been forced to play in at FIFA´s expanded competition, as well as fans who have also suffered.
""For the spectators in the stadium it is incredibly hot, (so) now you can imagine how difficult it is for the players,"" continued Kovac. ""(It´s) 32 degrees when you´re in the shade, and you´re not even in the sun. So when you play inside the stadium you can assume it is 3, 4 or 5 degrees even hotter. ""These are not excuses, it´s just an explanation... this is very difficult, especially for the Europeans.

Alvarez promises Crawford bout will be one of his ‘best’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323607-alvarez-promises-crawford-bout-will-be-one-of-his-best,"RIYADH: Mexico´s undisputed super middleweight world champion Canelo Alvarez promises his title bout with Terence Crawford in Las Vegas on September 13 will be one of the legend´s ""best"".
The 34-year-old became sole possessor of all the title belts at the weight for a second time when he beat IBF champion William Scull by unanimous points decision in Riyadh last month.  Crawford was at that bout and immediately threw down the gauntlet -- gladly accepted by Alvarez -- even though it means the 37-year-old American has to step up two weight divisions.
Alvarez, whose record is an impressive 63-2-2 with 39 knockouts, has been a world champion at four different weights, as indeed has Crawford.  ""This fight is going to be one of my best fights in my history, in my record,"" Canelo said at a joint press conference with Crawford in Riyadh to get the promotional show on the road.
""I´m very excited and motivated because this is all about I want to make history.""  Alvarez, whose two defeats have come at the hands of Floyd Mayweather at super middleweight in 2013 and then at light heavyweight to Dmitry Bivol in 2023, said he loved boxing but winning was primordial.
""For me it´s very important to win this fight. I love boxing. I love winning.  ""I´m a winner so I´m very excited to to be in the ring already.""  Alvarez, who had his first professional fight aged 15, said both pugilists needed to be in the same frame of mind on the night if it was to live up to its billing.
""I come to fight but you need to have both fighters think the same, right,""  ""Because you know, this fight is big, and for me making history is my goal, my whole life.""  Alvarez did not go down the trash talking route and indeed praised his opponent, whose record stands at 41 victories with 31 by knockout.  ""Don´t get me wrong, he´s a great fighter -- but like I said, he´s not Canelo,"" he said.

Marquez continues dominance with Italian MotoGP sprint win,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323608-marquez-continues-dominance-with-italian-motogp-sprint-win,"Mugello, Italy: Marc Marquez continued his march towards a seventh elite world title by winning Saturday´s sprint race at the Italian MotoGP and extending his lead at the top of the championship.
The Spanish motorcycling great had to battle back from a disastrous start from pole position to claim the full 12 points and move 35 points clear of his closest challenger and brother Alex Marquez.
Marc Marquez, who dropped back into the middle of the pack after fluffing his start on his Ducati bike, eventually finished 1.441sec ahead of his sibling after overtaking him on the fourth lap.
It was his eighth win from nine sprint races this season after conquering his 100th career pole earlier on Saturday, and sets him up for another perfect weekend in what has been a dream campaign in his first season with Ducati´s factory team. Marc Marquez has won the sprint and main race at the Thailand, Argentina, Qatar and Aragon MotoGP with eight race weekends completed so far this season.

Lions slump to warm-up defeat by Argentina,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323610-lions-slump-to-warm-up-defeat-by-argentina,"DUBLIN: The British & Irish Lions will set off for Australia on the back of a 28-24 defeat by Argentina in their warm-up Test in Dubin on Friday.
Bundee Aki and Tadhg Beirne both went over the Pumas line and the Lions were also awarded a penalty try but the visitors replied with three tries of their own including one for fly-half Tomas Albornoz who finished with 18 points.
It was the first opening tour match loss since 1971 but the performance against the fifth-ranked side in the world will give coach Andy Farrell plenty of cause for hope as the team prepares to set off on Saturday for their three-Test tour of Australia.
Seventeen players were not considered by Farrell because of their presence in domestic competitions last weekend or, in the case of Toulouse´s Blair Kinghorn, this weekend. In spite of that the Lions, a team drawn from the best of England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, produced long stretches of effective and eye-catching rugby.
The Lions, however, were under pressure from the start as the Pumas went on the attack from the kick-off, Albornoz stroking over a penalty in the fifth minute. The Lions then had a try ruled out when Luke Cowan-Dickie spilled the ball forwards as he reached for the line but Fin Smith levelled with a penalty.
The Pumas hit back straight away as wing Ignacio Mendy stepped in off his wing, wrong-footed Duhan van der Merwe and slid through for the try. The Lions had a second try, this time from Sione Tuipulotu, ruled out before his centre partner Bundee Aki barged through for their opener. Fin Smith added the conversion to put them into the lead 10-8.
The Lions continued to throw the ball around and take the game to the Argentinians but it was the visitors who looked the better-oiled machine. Albornoz knocked over two more penalties to make it 14-10 as the clock ticked towards the red.
The Lions had time to restart and had a chance to regain the lead before the half-time whistle as the Pumas coughed up possession. The Pumas, though, quickly retrieved it when Van der Merwe lost possession, allowing them to attack down the right with only full-back Marcus Smith to beat.
Albornoz skittered through under the posts for their second try of the half and added the conversion to take a 21-10 lead at the break. The Lions began the second half strongly and picked up a penalty try when Puma prop Mayc Vivas came in from the side of a maul to prevent it going over the line, collecting a yellow card in the process.
Shortly after, the Lions were in front, a bullocking run by prop Ellis Genge producing chaos in the Argentine defence and allowing Irish lock Tadhg Beirne to crash over. Just before the hour, the Pumas were back in front when Connacht´s Santiago Cordero beat Marcus Smith in a sprint to the line. The Lions camped on the Argentine line but Beirne gave away a soft penalty to allow the Pumas to clear their lines and claim a victory that left the Puma players in tears.

Macron says Europeans to ‘accelerate talks’ with Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323632-macron-says-europeans-to-accelerate-talks-with-iran,"PARIS: French President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that France and its European partners would ramp up talks with Iran following more than a week of hostilities between the Islamic republic and Israel.
On Friday, British, French, German and EU top diplomats held talks in Geneva with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi a week after Israel started its bombardment. They urged Iran to revive diplomatic efforts with the United States to find a solution in the standoff over its nuclear programme, but Tehran warned it could only consider diplomacy once Israel halted its bombardment.
On Saturday, Macron said talks will be stepped up in an effort to avoid greater conflict. “I am convinced that a path exists to end war and avoid even greater dangers,” Macron said in English on X after holding phone talks with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian.
“To achieve this, we will accelerate the negotiations led by France and its European partners with Iran.” Macron reiterated that “Iran must never acquire nuclear weapons.” “It is up to Iran to provide full guarantees that its intentions are peaceful,” he added.
He once again demanded that Iran must release French nationals Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris, who have been held since May 2022 on espionage charges their families reject. “Their inhumane detention is unjust,” Macron said. “I expect them to return to France.”

Yemen’s Huthis threaten to attack US ships if it strikes Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323633-yemen-s-huthis-threaten-to-attack-us-ships-if-it-strikes-iran,"SANAA: Yemen’s Huthi rebels threatened on Saturday to attack US vessels in the Red Sea, despite a recent truce, should Washington get involved in Israel’s bombardment campaign against Iran.
Israel launched unprecedented attacks on Iranian nuclear and military sites last week, drawing retaliation from Tehran. The United States, a key Israeli ally, has been weighing getting involved in the war.
Huthi military spokesman Yahya Saree, whose group is backed by Theran, warned in a video statement that “if the United States gets involved in an attack and aggression against Iran with the Israeli enemy”, the rebels “will target its ships and warships in the Red Sea”.
The Huthis, who control swathes of Yemen, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Israel-linked Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza war, claiming solidarity with Palestinians.
After pausing attacks earlier this year during a two-month ceasefire in the Gaza war, which was sparked by an October 2023 attack by Iran-backed Palestinian group Hamas, the Huthis renewed threats to shipping in March over Israel’s aid blockade of the Palestinian territory.

VP Vance says US troops still ‘necessary’ in LA,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1323634-vp-vance-says-us-troops-still-necessary-in-la,"LOS ANGELES, United States: US Vice President JD Vance said on Friday that the thousands of troops deployed to Los Angeles this month were still needed despite a week of relative calm in the protest-hit city.
President Donald Trump has sent roughly 4,000 National Guard members and 700 Marines, purportedly to protect federal property and personnel, after demonstrations over immigration raids.
“Unfortunately, the soldiers and Marines are still very much a necessary part of what’s going on here because they’re worried that it’s going to flare back up,” Vance told reporters in Los Angeles.
He was speaking the day after an appeals court ruled that Trump could continue to control the California National Guard, which would normally fall under Governor Gavin Newsom’s authority.
California officials have heavily criticized Trump over his use of the military, saying it escalated protests that local law enforcement could have handled. The demonstrations were largely peaceful and mostly contained to a small part of Los Angeles, the second-largest US city, although there were instances of violence and vandalism.
