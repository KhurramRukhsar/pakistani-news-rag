FMs of 20 Muslim states condemn Israeli attacks on Iran,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322076-fms-of-20-muslim-states-condemn-israeli-attacks-on-iran,"KARACHI: In light of the rapidly evolving regional developments and the unprecedented escalation of tensions in the Middle East, particularly owing to the ongoing military aggression of Israel against Iran, the foreign ministers of 20 Muslim countries issued a joint statement on Tuesday categorically rejecting and condemning Israel’s attacks on Iran since June 13.
According to the office of the spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the joint statement has been issued by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bahrain, Brunei Darussalam, Republic of Chad, the Union of the Comoros, Republic of Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Mauritania, Qatar, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Federal Republic of Somalia, Republic of the Sudan, Türkiye, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates.
The foreign ministers announced categorical rejection and condemnation of Israel’s recent attacks on the Islamic Republic of Iran, as well as any actions that contravene international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, while emphasizing the necessity of respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of states, adhering to the principles of good neighbourliness, and the peaceful settlement of disputes.
They stressed the imperative need to halt Israeli hostilities against Iran, “which come during a time of increasing tension in the Middle East, and to work towards de-escalation, to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire and restoration of calm, while expressing great concern regarding this dangerous escalation, which threatens to have serious consequences on the peace and stability of the entire region”.
They affirmed the urgent necessity of establishing a Middle East Zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, “which shall apply to all States in the region without exception in line with relevant international resolutions, as well as the urgent need for all countries of the Middle East to join the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT)”.
The foreign minister also emphasized the paramount importance of refraining from targeting nuclear facilities that are under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, in accordance with relevant IAEA resolutions and United Nations Security Council decisions, as such acts constitute a violation of international law and international humanitarian law, including the 1949 Geneva Conventions.
They stressed the urgency of a swift return to the path of negotiations as the only viable means to reach a sustainable agreement regarding the Iranian nuclear programme. They highlighted the importance of safeguarding the freedom of navigation in international waterways per the relevant rules of international law, and refraining from undermining maritime security.
The foreign minister also called for diplomacy, dialogue, and adherence to the principles of good neighbourliness, in accordance with international law and the UN Charter, as the only viable path to resolving crises in the region, and said that military means cannot bring about a lasting resolution to the ongoing crisis.

Pakistan’s deterrence ability for its own security: Dar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322077-pakistan-s-deterrence-ability-for-its-own-security-dar,"ISLAMABAD: Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar on Monday said Pakistan’s nuclear programme was for the purpose of its own defence.
He also strongly refuted the social media claims that Pakistan would launch a nuclear strike if Israel did so first. Speaking in the Senate, he referenced a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s 2011 interview, doing the rounds on the social media, being wrongly portrayed as recent.
He insisted that the irresponsible and fake news had also been picked by UK-based Daily Mail. The matter was raised by Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan of PPP during the budget speech and then Leader of Opposition Syed Shibli Faraz of PTI also expressed his concerns.
Dar pointed out that the fake news did the rounds on the social media for a few days particularly after June 13 and then mentioned a  14-year-old clip of Netanyahu’s interview, showing him saying that 70 percent of debt could be cleared if the nuclear programme was rolled back.
Dar also talked of a clip of US President Donald Trumps about Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and said they had checked and found it was an AI-generated fake clip.
He said in the latest social media intrigue, Iranian generals had purportedly said that Pakistan will nuke Israel if it dared attack the country.
Dar further remarked, “Israel dare not look at Pakistan,” shortly after informing the House that a clip of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was doing the rounds on social media and that was in fact an interview given by him back in 2011.
Dar emphasized that nothing was being taken lightly and explained that the armed forces were fully alert as they were during the conflict with India.
He said nuclear and missile programmes were the nation’s assets, the security of which was a collective responsibility. The deputy premier maintained that Pakistan’s nuclear programme was for the purpose of self-defence.
“It is our deterrence, as Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in response to the tests carried out by India, for parity, peace and security in the region,” he made it clear.
Dar said attacking nuclear installations was a serious crime because the consequential damage could be unimaginable.
Earlier, Shibli Faraz contended that it did not make a difference if the remarks came in 2011 or centuries ago and said these reflected a mindset and emphasized that these were the remarks by a satanic power which continues to attack Islamic countries one after another.
He argued, “We should not take it lightly. We should factor it in. Our readiness should not be a victim of complacency,” he said, adding that Israel had done with Iran could also be done with Pakistan because they could not digest the nuclear programme of an Islamic country.
Shibli made it clear that complacency was one word that was to be thrown out of the vocabulary of those responsible to protect and safeguard nuclear assets.
Earlier, taking part in the budget debate, PTI’s Parliamentary Party Leader in the House Barrister Syed Ali Zafar said there was no strategy to deal with the key challenges, like unemployment, growth issue and inflation and taxation challenges.
He alleged that the PMLN-led federal government was trying to paint a rosy picture of the economy in the finance bill but in reality the country was stuck in inflation, heavy taxation, unemployment and frustration.
Ali Zafar emphasized that every budget had a growth strategy, which was not visible in the present one and that the correct use of resources was required as a part of the strategy to set the country’s economy in the right direction.
However, he pointed out, “Instead of this, the PDM government has spent the entire year planning and strategizing how to involve (former prime minister) Imran Khan and his wife and other leaders of PTI in false cases and to keep them in jail.”
He also accused the government of suffering from bankruptcy of ideas and said his party would not vote for the budget not only because of injustices against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi but also because this budget was a road map toward destruction.
Ali Zafar said Pakistan had won the war against India, but the threat was not over yet and contended, “For this fight, we need unity which is only possible if there is political stability”.
He said the government should stop injustice, and what he called ‘political terrorism against the PTI and focus on improving the economy, which was not possible without political stability.
One of his major objections to the federal budget was that it lacked any strategy for increasing employment.
“This is why I say that this budget is a mutiny against every household, every farmer, every student, every child, every elderly, and every Pakistani man and woman,” he claimed.
He noted that the government predicted a GDP growth of 4.2 percent, which was totally unrealistic and asked how this could be achieved when the government was taxing everything from petrol to e-commerce and even pensions. He added that 42 percent of new taxes had been imposed in the budget.
This budget, which his party rejects, he charged, was a war against pensioners, who have also been taxed, besides the farmers, e-business owners, small businesses, and the entire middle class.
He said the powers of arrest were being given to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) through the finance bill, creating an atmosphere of fear among the business community.
He maintained that taxing solar panels at the rate of 18 percent was not a climate-friendly policy, but an anti-climate one.
“The claim by government that it has increased salaries by 10 percent and pensions by 7 percent was really a symbolic slap – not a relief,” he added.
PPP Senator Masroor Ahsan noted that the federal government had earmarked very meager allocations for the development schemes and Sindh, especially Karachi.
He explained that the government had earmarked only Rs15 billion out of the total proposed funds of Rs400 billion for the construction of Hyderabad Sukkur Motorway in the next fiscal year.
Senator Maulana Attaur Rehman of JUIF emphasized the need for the state institutions to confine themselves to their constitutional role, which he called was the prerequisite for restoration of peace, stability and economic progress in the country.
Taking part in the budget debate, he explained how recently his nephew Maulana Assad Mehmood was intercepted by 60-70 terrorists in Dera Ismail Khan, who was leaving for Lakki Marwat for funeral prayers, and was allowed to go only after some hectic efforts.
“Things have now reached our homes,” he said, adding, “Are we being punished for siding with the army and the state?” “Will we be forced to take up arms again against those terrorists,” Maulana Atta remarked.

Punjab unveils Rs5.335tr tax-free budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322078-punjab-unveils-rs5-335tr-tax-free-budget,"LAHORE: Punjab Finance Minister on Monday unveiled a tax-free provincial budget for the fiscal year 2025-26, with a total outlay of Rs5,335 billion.
The budget features a record-breaking Rs1,240 billion allocated for development projects, while Rs2,706.5 billion has been earmarked for non-development expenditures.
The salaries of provincial employees have been raised in line with the federal government by 10 per cent, but pension has been raised by only 5pc, which is two percent lower than the raise announced by the federal government. The minimum wage in Punjab has been increased from Rs37,000 to Rs40,000 per month.
Major chunk of the resources amounting to Rs4,062 billion would come from the federal divisible pool of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). The target of provincial tax collection is set at Rs851.1 billion, of which the Punjab Revenue Authority is to collect Rs380 billion; the Board of Revenue would contribute Rs135.5, Excise and Taxation Rs70 billion and Mines and Minerals Rs30 billion.
The non-development expenditure includes Rs935 billion to be distributed through Provincial Finance Commission to the districts. The increase in pay and pension is also part of non-development expenses.
Expected provincial surplus is estimated at Rs740 billion which is subject to disbursement of the amount that the province expects to receive from FBR (subject to achievement of its tax revenue target).
The provincial government has allocated Rs494 billion for the social sector in its ADP, which is 40 per cent of the total development outlay. Development expenditure includes Rs148 billion for the education sector. Education budget is Rs661 billion, which is 24.4pc of the total non-development expenditure.
Honhaar scholarship programme has been allocated Rs15 billion to ensure that deserving students get enrolled. In the same way, an amount of Rs5.9 billion would go to fund higher education scholarships against undergraduate scholarship programme.
The laptop scheme has been continued with allocation of Rs15.1 billion under which 112,000 students would get laptops on merit. Last year 40,000 students were provided free laptops. For missing facilities in schools, an amount of Rs40 billion has been earmarked. Rs4 billion would be spent on outsourcing the government schools.
Establishment of Nawaz Sharif Centre in 10 districts is planned to establish Schools of Excellence for Early Childhood Education, for which Rs3 billion have been earmarked. Punjab Education Foundation will get Rs35 billion to provide financial help to students to get enrolled in private schools. School children in south Punjab will get free meals in schools, for which Rs7 billion have been allocated. The number of districts of south Punjab has been increased from 3 to seven. Rs1.5 million would be spent on free school meals for handicapped children.
Health sector this year will get Rs181 billion from the development outlay. Moreover, an amount of Rs450 billion is allocated to the health sector from the non-development expenses. This amount would be spent on upgrading existing facilities in various Punjab hospitals. For Lahore, an amount of Rs54 billion is earmarked for establishing Children Hospital-II & Institute of Genetic Blood Diseases; Institute of Surgical Orthopaedic & Medical Rehabilitation; Specialised Medical Hospital & Medical College; 1000 bedded Cardiac Institute; Medical University; State of the Art Diagnostic Lab; and Centre of Excellence for Nursing Education. Different district hospitals have also been for various district hospitals. For providing free medicines to the patients Rs79.5 billion against Rs56 billion allocated last fiscal. Other initiatives include Rs25 billion for free treatment of different diseases. Punjab government plans to upgrade BHUs with an amount of Rs20 billion.
The Punjab government has earmarked Rs123 billion for agriculture, livestock, irrigation and water in the new budget. Subsidy on the Green Tractor Scheme in phase-II would be Rs5.5 billion. A tractor program is being introduced this year with an allocation of Rs10.1 billion. The Kissan card would continue this year with an allocation of 6.3 billion. For solarisation of agriculture tube-wells, an amount of Rs8.7 billion has been earmarked.
Revival of citrus sector will be done through allocation of Rs1 billion. CM’s water efficient agriculture initiative would line 1,200 small water channels with Rs8 billion. For upgrading livestock through herd transformation, Rs8 billion have been earmarked. To control foot and mouth disease, Rs2 billion have been budgeted. CM Punjab Livestock Card is being introduced with an allocation of Rs4.4 billion. Numerous other initiatives have been introduced for irrigation, seeds and other farm related activities.
The provincial government will continue with the Apni Chhat Apna Ghar programme with an allocation of Rs150 billion under which 50,000 families will get a 15-year loan for building their houses.
Also, the Punjab government Monday introduced negative list-based sales tax regime in a transition of Punjab Sales Tax on Service Act 2012 from positive list through the finance bill by bringing 26 services in tax-free category of the negative list.
The new regime is adopted following the international best practice of taxing of services based on negative list. The negative list system is not new, as it already exists in many countries and its implementation would give substantial increase in the revenues to the provincial government by broadening the tax base.
Furthermore, the government has increased the amount of penalty for compliance purposes especially in respect of Electronic Invoice Monitoring System (EIMS).
The Punjab government proposed amendments to the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012, mandating that all service providers must accept digital payments through debit/credit cards, mobile wallets, or QR codes. Non-compliance could result in penalties of up to Rs1 million, with a minimum fine of Rs400,000 on first offence and Rs300,000 for each subsequent violation. In the case of three violations, the authorities may seal the business premises for up to one month.
The proposed changes also introduce various technical adjustments, including restrictions on input tax adjustments to the standard rate of tax, apportionment in composite services, and bifurcation of tax liabilities between service providers and withholding agents in business-to-business transactions.
A substantial exemption list has also been issued, placing several services in the negative list, which makes them exempt from Punjab Sales Tax on Services (PSTS). These include:
*. Public healthcare services, including doctor consultation, hospital charges, and services provided by government hospitals.
*. Education services provided by public sector institutions.
*. Certain cosmetic and reconstructive treatments — exempt only for acid or burn victims.
*. Public transport and postal services provided by federal, provincial, or local governments.
*. Religious, charitable, and cultural services, including those provided by registered NGOs and international agencies with federal tax exemptions.
*. Construction services related to affordable housing schemes, foreign-aided projects, small-scale residential units, and diplomatic premises.
*. Personal care services (exempt only for non-air-conditioned parlours and salons).
*. Tour operator services for Hajj, Umrah, and Ziyarat.
*. Air travel services (exempt for Hajj/Umrah pilgrims, diplomats, and crew).
*. Agricultural storage services, but only for self-consumption of the produce.
*. Photography and filming (only for small, non-corporate roadside setups).
*. Residential property rentals, diplomatic missions, and book-printing contractors.
*. Government-sponsored or grant-funded advertisements, public health messages by WWF or UNICEF.
*. Medical diagnostic and pathology services.
*. Job-based manufacturing or packaging services.
*. Newspaper advertisements and services by currency exchange companies.
*. Port, airport, and bonded warehouse services — exempt only where the fee is collected under specific legal provisions.
These proposed amendments aim to broaden the digital economy, rationalise tax collection, and ensure relief for key public services and low-income groups.
Later on, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Monday declared that public funds are a sacred trust of the people, for which the government is accountable before Allah Almighty.
Presiding over the 27th meeting of the provincial cabinet, the CM said, “Success comes from sincerity and hard work. This year, we will work even harder than the last.” She highlighted that Punjab is presenting not only a zero-tax budget but also the largest development outlay in provincial history.
“We’ve already delivered a surplus budget of Rs740 billion despite meeting IMF conditions,” she noted. “More than 100 innovative programs have been launched, including the construction and expansion of 12,000 kilometres of roads and completion of 40,000 homes in just one year—something not achieved in the last four decades.”
The chief minister said that a record allocation has been made for health and education, ensuring free medicines and completion of essential facilities in government schools this fiscal year.
Addressing fiscal policy, Maryam said the government would focus on expanding the tax net instead of increasing tax rates. “The real impact isn’t in two or four mega projects — it’s in the 100 people-focused initiatives we’ve introduced,” she remarked.
She also noted that Punjab’s domestic debt has been reduced by a record 94pc, and that no financial scandal has emerged under her government thanks to transparency and e-tendering practices. She pledged that all expenditures would be presented before the provincial assembly.
“I’ve memorised figures for each department,” she added, calling the 2025–26 budget an “unprecedented” document. She also announced that performance-based bonuses for government employees are under consideration.
The cabinet, chaired by the CM, formally approved the Rs5,335 billion budget, including a Rs1,240 billion development package.
Maryam also directed the authorities to increase the minimum monthly wage to Rs40,000 and ensure digitisation of all wage payments. She further instructed that all wedding halls, marquees, restaurants, and farmhouses be registered by July 20, with immediate notification to be issued.
Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb and the finance minister briefed the cabinet in detail during the session. Maryam praised the efforts of her team and acknowledged the hard work of senior officials, noting that Nawaz Sharif had also commended their performance.

"Under IMF push Banks to flag big spenders as tax breaks end for new SEZs, STZs",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322079-under-imf-push-banks-to-flag-big-spenders-as-tax-breaks-end-for-new-sezs-stzs,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will no longer grant tax exemptions to the new Special Economic Zones (SEZs) under the IMF-mandated reforms, while a proposal to tap suspicious bank transactions where the banks will be bound to flag them is among fresh moves to tighten revenue collection.
The FBR has sought access to the Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs) from banks to detect high-net-worth individuals who remain outside the tax net or paying less tax while having times high transactions in their bank accounts.
Against the earlier provision, now the banks will flag such transactions and report to the FBR, the premier tax collection federal body’s Chairman Rashid Langrial told the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance on Monday that met here with MNA Naveed Qamar in the chair.
Explaining, Langrial said if someone is earning Rs10 million a month and making transactions worth Rs100 million, a notice will be issued.
He also confirmed that tax holidays for existing SEZs will end by 2035.  “New SEZs/STZs will not get any exemptions going forward,” he said, adding, “The IMF wanted all exemptions scrapped by 2027, but we negotiated to stretch it till 2035.”
On this, lawmakers said it would discourage any investment in the sector, while they were conveyed that negotiations with the IMF were “Locked and stoned.”
Defending a new withholding tax on online shopping, he said it could generate up to Rs59 billion in additional revenue.
He also backed the recently imposed tax on e-commerce transactions, calling it the only feasible way to tax digital vendors.
“This is not a sacred text that cannot be amended. If we don’t tax them through this system, we won’t be able to at all,” he told lawmakers.
However, instead of the current proposed different rates of levy ranging 1-2 percent, the finance ministry informed the committee that a single levy would be proposed after consultations and the committee would be informed accordingly.
Member Inland Revenue Policy explained that the new tax applies to local and foreign sellers using Pakistani online platforms, adding that a separate system is being developed for cross-border digital vendors.
“If a foreign seller keeps goods in Pakistan, they will be taxed the same way,” he clarified. Amid geopolitical tension in the Middle East, former energy minister Omar Ayub Khan warned that the ongoing Iran-Israel conflict could disrupt global oil supply routes, particularly through the Strait of Hormuz, driving up international prices and inflating Pakistan’s current account and fiscal deficits.
“Iran is the world’s sixth-largest oil producer — any disruption will hit us hard,” he cautioned. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb confirmed that the prime minister had formed a high-level committee to assess the situation.
“The committee met today to evaluate supply risks and review oil stockpiles,” he told the panel.
The secretary finance assured that if the international oil prices increase, the government will not increase the petroleum development levy (PDL), but pass its impact on to the consumers. The government has targeted to collect Rs1.486 trillion from PDL in FY2025-26.
Several lawmakers and business leaders pushed back on the FBR proposals to post its staff or security personnel at the industrial units to monitor production.
“If police walk into my factory tomorrow, I will shut it down,” said businessman and committee member Ikhtiar Baig.
Sharmila Faruqui warned such powers would turn the FBR into “another NAB.” The committee gave its nod for another IMF-backed proposal by removing the distinction between table -I and II. All Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs) are now subject to standard compliance requirements to qualify for 100 percent tax credit.
This ensures better oversight, reduces misuse of blanket exemptions and aligns tax benefits with clearly defined regulatory conditions, the FBR added.

PTI asks PPP to boycott budget,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322080-pti-asks-ppp-to-boycott-budget,"ISLAMABAD: Speaker National Assembly Raja Pervez Ashraf has told PTI’s Asad Qaiser that though the PPP has reservations and concerns about the budget, it is  a collation partner of the government.
While talking with The News, Raja Pervez Ashraf said during an informal meeting Asad Qaiser proposed developing a joint strategy to boycott the budget but he was told that the PPP is in alliance with the government. “We also have many reservations and concerns on the budget but we are coalition partners of the government,” he said.
Ashraf, who is also President of PPP Central Punjab, said in the Parliamentary Party meeting of the PPP, reservations and concerns of our MNAs especially from the Sindh and Punjab were raised and those will be definitely discussed with the government. Asked whether Chairman PPP will return prior to the passage of the budget, he respond in affirmative.
Ashraf, however, told Qaiser he would put the PTI’s proposal before the party’s Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and promised to let the PTI know about their strategy concerning the budget.
Meanwhile, PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate Barrister Syed Ali Zafar Monday said his party would not be part of voting on the budget, claiming that the budget passage would lead to Pakistan’s destruction.
The Pakistan People’s Party has slammed the federal budget 2025–26 as exclusionary and unjust while calling it a “dangerous game” being played against  Sindh.
Speaking to journalists outside Parliament after the meeting of the Parliamentary Party of the PPP Parliamentarians held on Monday, Spokesperson PPP Parliamentarians Shazia Marri accused the coalition government of deliberately undermining Sindh’s constitutional rights. “Under the guise of budgetary allocations, a systematic conspiracy has been hatched by transferring Sindh’s development schemes under PWD to federal ministries instead of the province itself,” she said. “Sindh is a constitutional unit — any attempt to divide it along urban-rural lines will not be tolerated.” She warned that if Sindh’s development schemes are not handed back to the province, the PPP would not hesitate to take extreme measures. “We will not compromise on the unity of Sindh,” she stressed.
Shazia Marri said the PPP had initially refrained from reacting harshly in the hope that ongoing talks with the ruling party would yield results, particularly regarding Sindh’s Public Sector Development programmeme (PSDP) commitments. “However, it’s now evident that not just Sindh but even Punjab — especially Central Punjab and the South Punjab — have been ignored,” she added.
Highlighting disparities in development allocations, she explained that Chief Minister Sindh had continuously represented the province’s position during federal consultations. “Yet, as noted by Naveed Qamar, the treatment meted out to Sindh in the PSDP is discriminatory,” she said. Marri argued that Sindh was clearly not treated equally. “PWD was abolished, and its schemes were transferred to the provinces — Punjab, KP, and Balochistan. But Sindh’s schemes, except for a few rural ones, were transferred to the federal Ministry of Housing and Works,” she said. Transferring urban PWD projects to the federal housing ministry has also violated provincial autonomy, she added. Shazia Marri further alleged that PPP lawmakers in Punjab were also denied funds, and higher education institutions in the Seraiki belt have received negligible allocations.
Similarly the Sindh’s educational institutions had been overlooked she said. “Instead of the committed Rs4.8 billion, only Rs 2.5 billion have been allocated for the universities.”   The PPPP spokesperson also noted that despite PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto’s proposal to allocate Rs25 billion for solar panels in Sindh, the federal government continued to ignore the province in budgetary planning. “For the Rs 400 billion-Sukkur Motorway project only a paltry Rs15 billion has been allocated. That’s peanuts.” Criticizing taxation policies, Shazia Marri said the imposition of an 18pc tax on solar panels was unacceptable.
Earlier, during the PPP parliamentary party meeting, some members suggested boycotting the budget approval process. Shazia confirmed this, saying, “The party’s objections will be raised at various forums, and the final decision will be made in consultation with Chairman Bilawal.” “We have discussed a tough strategy,” she concluded, “and if the government does not take us seriously, our response will be equally firm.”

SC can't misinterpret Constitution: Justice Mazhar,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322081-sc-can-t-misinterpret-constitution-justice-mazhar,"ISLAMABAD: Supreme Court Judge Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar Monday remarked that every word and phrase of the Constitution was important, and it could not be interpreted in such a way that people begin to assume that the Supreme Court itself had amended the Constitution.
He was heading a five-member constitutional bench, hearing identical petitions filed by five judges of Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the transfer and seniority adjustments of judges from the other provinces.
Barrister Salahuddin, counsel for five judges, argued that the interpretation of Article 200 applied only to subsection (3).
He drew comparisons with the civil service rules, stating that when an employee was transferred from one department to another, he/she became junior in seniority.
Justice Mazhar, however, responded that there was no concept of deputation or absorption of judges between courts, unlike in the civil service where such mechanisms exist.
Barrister Salahuddin maintained that transferring a judge without their consent was contrary to the principle of justice and called the current case an “additional appointment”.
He contrasted it with the Indian system, where judges cannot refuse transfers and their consent is not taken.
In this respect, he cited S.P. Gupta case, where it was initially suggested that judges should be consulted, but later the Indian Supreme Court ruled otherwise.
He argued that in Pakistan, transfers occur with judges’ consent, and if they voluntarily agree, then any resulting loss in seniority does not amount to injustice.
A judge may consider whether a transfer improves their seniority (e.g., from 15th to 8th). He added that in India, seniority moves with the judge because their consent isn’t taken.
He cited recent Indian examples, like a senior judge from Delhi High Court being appointed as Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court.
Salahuddin emphasized that transfers should not be only for the transferred judge, but also for the sending and receiving High Courts, suggesting that other judges should also be given the transfer opportunities.
Advocate General Punjab Amjad Pervez filed a miscellaneous petition.  Justice Salahuddin Panhwar inquired whether he had formally submitted any petition.
Pervez replied that he had presented a complete historical record of judges’ transfers from 1947 to 1976, and although they weren’t party to the main case, a 27-A notice had been issued.
Justice Mazhar responded that a 27-A notice was issued to make someone a party, and that Pervez should have given arguments after the attorney general.
He emphasized the importance of the notice, and said that since the registrar of the Lahore High Court had submitted comments, Pervez was indeed a central party to the case.
Justice Mazhar said the court would hear him after Barrister Salahuddin had completed his arguments.
Justice Mazhar asked whether there were judicial precedents stating that seniority should be counted from the date of appointment, and what happens to a judge’s seniority if transferred to another High Court.
Barrister Salahuddin replied that it needed to be considered whether the president was bound to act on the prime minister’s advice or he can exercise an independent judgment.
He referred to the Qazi Faez Isa case, where it was declared that the president must apply his own mind.
Justice Mazhar then questioned whether the president must apply an independent judgment even on recommendations from the Judicial Council, such as in the removal of a judge.
Salahuddin said for actions based on political advice, the president must apply his mind, but for Judicial Council recommendations (like dismissal), he must act upon them.
Justice Mazhar remarked that if a judge doesn’t consent, then the entire transfer process collapses. Even if the judge agrees, but the chief justice of the transferring or receiving High Court refuses, the transfer won’t happen,” Justice Mazhar remarked.
He further remarked that if the chief justice of Pakistan refuses, the transfer cannot be executed. Justice Mazhar remarked that every line of the Constitution had meaning and purpose adding that this issue had been created by the counsel.
“Every word of the Constitution is important and you can’t interpret it in a way that makes it look like the Supreme Court has amended it,” Justice Mazhar remarked.
Barrister Salahuddin, however, responded by referencing previous judgments, saying the Al-Jehad Trust case came earlier, followed by the Mustafa Impex case.
At this, Justice Mazhar noted that terms like “Prime Minister” and “Cabinet” had been part of the Constitution since 1985.
Barrister Salahuddin argued that in the appointment of the army chief, the cabinet plays no role. Justice Mazhar, however, countered with the example of the Supreme Court granting six months to parliament for legislation in the army chief’s extension case.
Salahuddin replied that the prime minister’s or Cabinet’s summary wasn’t issue in that case. The counsel pointed out that Justice Shakeel Ahmed had inquired about the Administrative Committee, which had recently been amended the Islamabad High Court.
Now, instead of the three most senior judges, the committee includes one senior and any two other judges. He criticized that the judges transferred just three days ago were included in the committee.
Justice Mazhar asked whether anyone had challenged the composition of the administrative committee. Salahuddin admitted that no one had challenged.
He noted that the IHC had recently drafted new rules in 2025, but the five petitioner judges were not even aware of them. At this, Justice Mazhar remarked that if five judges didn’t know, then the rules weren’t really made.”  Salahuddin responded that the rules had indeed been gazetted. But Justice Mazhar reminded him that such rules must be approved by the Full Court.

"Blue economy is a ‘game changer’, says PM",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322082-blue-economy-is-a-game-changer-says-pm,"ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday declared the blue economy as Pakistan’s “new economic frontier,” calling for a unified national effort to unlock its vast potential.
Speaking at the soft launch of the 2nd Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference (PIMEC 2025), the prime minister laid out the vision for transforming Pakistan into a regional maritime powerhouse.
“It is a great pleasure to see the Pakistan Navy, under the patronage of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and in collaboration with key partners, organising the second edition of PIMEC,” said the prime minister. He lauded the leadership of Naval Chief, Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, for their strategic foresight and dedication in steering this important initiative.
Highlighting the critical role of the Navy in national defence and regional security, he said, “The Pakistan Navy has been a formidable force through all conflicts and remains a strong pillar of our national security.”
Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to international peace and maritime law, he cited the AMAN Exercise — featuring participation from over 50 countries as a symbol of Pakistan’s global engagement and cooperative maritime posture.
With over 1,000 kilometers of coastline and a position at the crossroads of vital sea lanes, Pakistan, he said, was uniquely positioned to harness the trillion-dollar global blue economy. “Even tapping a fraction of this economy could be a real game-changer,” he asserted.
“Our coastal trade already brings in nearly $7 billion a year and just imagine the potential if we fully develop this sector,” he said.
He urged the nation to take inspiration from global success stories such as Japan, which rose from limited maritime resources to become a global leader in marine infrastructure and regional trade. “Let there be open competition,” he added, emphasising the importance of resilience, innovation, and strategic investment.
Shehbaz stressed the need to transform Pakistan’s maritime sector into a driver of inclusive, sustainable economic growth while calling for synergy among public and private sectors. “The time has come to take the lead,” he said.
The minister for maritime affairs outlined the government’s strategic roadmap for the maritime sector. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to building a vibrant blue economy and introduced the “Maritime at 100” Vision, a long-term plan to grow the sector into a $100 billion economic force by 2047 marking Pakistan’s centennial.
“PIMEC 2025 will be more than an exhibition; it will be a catalyst for investment, innovation, and regional cooperation,” the minister told a gathering of policymakers, maritime professionals, and international stakeholders.
The minister while underscoring the immense potential of the sector, highlighted key economic drivers such as a Rs88 billion fisheries industry, the Gaddani Ship Recycling Yard, with recovery potential exceeding Rs30 billion, and a strategic location linking global trade routes.
“The oceans are not just water bodies, they are economic lifelines. Pakistan must position itself as a regional maritime hub,” he said.
He also announced the creation of a Maritime Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a centralised Maritime Complaint Cell for transparency and efficiency, federal investment of Rs12 billion in the revival of the Gaddani Ship Recycling Yard, acquisition of four new ships for the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, raising the national fleet to 14 vessels, progress on a major dredging project at Port Qasim, and development of a multi-modal logistics corridor from Gwadar to bolster trade and connectivity.
Commodore Ahsan Ali Khan, Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff, emphasised the vast economic potential of oceans in his remarks. “Oceans are not only a source of countless marine species and seabed resources — they also serve as the most cost-effective medium for transportation and global trade,” he said.
He highlighted Pakistan’s strategic location, offering the shortest sea access to Central Asian republics, Afghanistan, and western China via Karachi and Gwadar ports. “CPEC is a practical demonstration of Pakistan’s commitment to unlocking the blue economy’s potential and enhancing regional connectivity,” he said, adding that PIMEC represents a key milestone in that direction.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz met a high-level delegation from the UAE led by Gulf country’s Deputy Minister of Cabinet Affairs for Competitiveness and Knowledge Exchange Abdulla Nasser Lootah, and also including UAE Ambassador Hamad Obaid Al Zaabi and Abdullah Al Balouki and Ibrahim Al Ali from the Government Knowledge Exchange Office.
During the meeting, the prime minister said the United Arab Emirates has positioned its country among the developed countries with its modern management system, and Pakistan was keen to benefit from its experiences, a PM Office news release said.
The prime minister said that Pakistan has taken steps such as digitisation and paperless economy to improve its administrative structure. In addition, a faceless Customs system has also been implemented.
He underlined that Pakistan wanted to benefit from the experiences of the UAE to achieve good governance so that these steps could be made more effective as effective steps were being taken to improve data-based decision-making.
The prime minister, recalling his meeting with UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his previous visit to Abu Dhabi, said that the meeting was very fruitful. The UAE played a significant role in reducing tensions between Pakistan and India during the Pakistan-India conflict, he added.
On the occasion, UAE Minister Abdulla Naseer said that the UAE and Pakistan have long-standing brotherly relations and appreciated the important role of the Pakistani community in the development of the UAE. He said that the UAE was happy to exchange experiences and information with Pakistan.
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Abdulla Naseer attended the signing ceremony of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two countries. Under this MoU, the two countries will cooperate in improving government performance by exchanging knowledge and mutual experience, guidance and development models in relevant fields.
The MoU covers cooperation in areas such as good governance, development planning, public sector reforms, human resource development, urban planning and science and technology among others.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan and Special Assistant Syed Tariq Fatemi were also present.
Meanwhile, the prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s condemnation of the recent Israeli aggression against Iran and expressed the nation’s sympathies with it over the martyrdom of innocent civilians.
The prime minister met Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam on the occasion of Pakistan International Maritime Expo and Conference, PM Office said in a press release.
Discussing the current regional situation, the prime minister expressed Pakistan’s solidarity with Iran and its people during this time of heightened tension.
Referring to his recent telephone conversation with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, the prime minister said that Pakistan supported Iran at the United Nations Security Council meeting, adding Israeli attacks were a complete violation of the UN Charter and the international laws.
Meanwhile, chairing a review meeting on IT training for youth and establishment of training ecosystem in Pakistan, the prime minister directed the authorities concerned to formulate modern training programmes for the youth to ensure their employability and develop Pakistan as a regional hub of information technology.
He said that a sustainable and advanced ICT (Information Communication Technology) system would be established to position Pakistan as a central hub for the IT sector in the region, according to a PM Office press release.
In this regard, local companies will be provided with a skilled workforce to enable them to meet international standards and generate foreign exchange.
Meanwhile, the prime minister took notice of media reports regarding the arrest of tax defaulters and issued strict instructions that no such legal amendments should be used to harass the business community or taxpayers under any circumstances.
He directed the formation of a special committee on this matter. He chaired a review meeting of matters related to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The prime minister was briefed that the legal provisions for the arrest of sales tax defaulters had been part of the law since the 1990s, however, in the light of decisions by the courts, amendments were being made to these clauses to make them more coherent.
The meeting was attended by the ministers for defence, law, commerce, economic affairs, information and broadcasting, minister of state for railways, FBR chairman, economic experts and senior officials.
After thoroughly reviewing the matter, the prime minister opined that harassing regular taxpayers was unacceptable.
“The respect and dignity of the business community and investors is of utmost importance to us and any unjustified harassment is intolerable,” he added.
He further instructed that the mandate of arrest under relevant tax laws should be limited only to cases involving defaulters of an extraordinary scale.
The prime minister also directed that an effective system of external review and checks and balances be put in place regarding arrests.
Provisions related to protection against misuse of these laws should be included in the Finance Act, he observed. He further directed that all allied parties in the parliament should be consulted on the issue.
In his message on the World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought, observed annually on 17 June, the prime minister said the Day highlights the global urgency to address land degradation and enhance resilience to the escalating impacts of drought.
The 2025 theme, “Restore the land. Unlock the opportunities,” is a timely call to action, reminding us that restoring degraded landscapes is essential not only for climate resilience but also for unlocking social, economic, and environmental benefits.
Land is a vital asset for Pakistan’s food security, water availability, biodiversity conservation, and rural livelihoods. However, nearly 50 percent of our land area is affected by various forms of degradation driven by deforestation, overgrazing, salinity, waterlogging, and unplanned urbanisation. These issues are compounded by climate change, which has intensified the frequency and severity of droughts, wildfires, and floods. The unprecedented 2022 floods and recurring dry spells illustrate the scale of challenges we face, he said.
The prime minister said Pakistan remains committed to the implementation of its international obligations, particularly those agreements that are vital to regional peace. India’s unilateral actions that aim to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance are a matter of serious concern for Pakistan. There is no provision for such actions under the Treaty, and the waters of the Indus are the lifeline of the 240 million people of Pakistan. The Government of Pakistan will defend its right to water, as provided under the Treaty, while simultaneously accelerating efforts to enhance its domestic water storage capacity.
The government has also prioritised sustainable land management and ecosystem restoration as key pillars of its climate resilience agenda. Landmark initiatives like the Up-scaling of the Green Pakistan Programme have resulted in the plantation of over 2.2 billion plants.
“We are also implementing the National Climate Change Policy and  National Adaptation Plan to guide integrated land use and enhance ecological integrity. These policy frameworks align with our commitments under the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), to which Pakistan has been a Party since 1997.”
“As we mark this important day, I urge all stakeholders to join hands in restoring our lands and securing a climate-resilient future for generations to come, the premier concluded.

Airline’s privatization: PIA employees join bidding race as two more submit offers,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322083-airline-s-privatization-pia-employees-join-bidding-race-as-two-more-submit-offers,"ISLAMABAD: Employees of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) have submitted a joint offer to acquire the national flag carrier, adding to the growing list of bidders ahead of the June 19 deadline, officials from the Privatization Commission confirmed Monday.
The bid was jointly filed by Hidayatullah Khan, President of the CBA-affiliated People’s Unity, and Aqeel Siddiqui, head of the PIA Senior Staff Association (SASA). The employees argue they should have the first right to purchase the airlines, which the federal government is seeking to privatise after a previous attempt failed.
In addition to the employees’ bid, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited has also submitted an offer to acquire PIA, according to officials familiar with the matter.
Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC), one of Pakistan’s top fertilizer firms, has submitted an Expression of Interest (EoI) and prequalification documents to the Privatization Commission seeking a stake in Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL), FFC announced Monday.
At a board meeting on June 13, FFC approved the move and plans to conduct full due diligence as Pakistan’s government works to sell 51–100 percent of its shares to shore up its $7billion IMF-backed reform programme.
Last month, the government extended the EoI deadline to June 19, following a failed first attempt last year when only one bid — well below the Rs85 billion asking price — was received from Blue World City consortium.
Previously, prominent business groups including Mian Mansha Group, Arif Habib Group, and the Tabba Group had also expressed interest in acquiring the debt-laden airline.
PIA’s privatisation is part of a broader government strategy to offload loss-making state-owned enterprises and stabilise public finances amid mounting economic challenges.

Low-profile Nawaz 'fully backs hybrid setup',https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322084-low-profile-nawaz-fully-backs-hybrid-setup,"ISLAMABAD: Former prime minister and PMLN supremo Nawaz Sharif is reportedly fully satisfied with the current political arrangement - commonly referred to as the “hybrid system”- and has no reservations about the role of the establishment in national affairs.
According to PMLN sources, Nawaz Sharif, while largely staying away from the media and direct political activity, remains a strong supporter of the Shehbaz Sharif-led federal government and the Punjab administration under his daughter, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.
“Nawaz Sharif has no issues with the current system. In fact, he understands its boundaries and accepts its functioning without complaint,” a senior party source said, adding that rumours suggesting Nawaz’s unease with the outside influence in governance are “entirely baseless.”
Despite being less politically visible than in the past, largely due to personal reasons, Nawaz is occasionally seen attending official meetings of the Punjab government and holds sessions with selected foreign dignitaries and diplomats at his residence, often accompanied by Maryam Nawaz. Sources said he frequently shares political advice with her to strengthen her leadership.
The PMLN leader is said to be pleased with the performance of both Shehbaz and Maryam, and does not interfere in day-to-day federal matters. “He trusts Shehbaz Sharif completely and is content with his governance,” a party official stated.
During the 2024 general elections, although the PMLN campaign slogan focused on making Nawaz prime minister for a fourth time, a source said that Nawaz had already informed his closest ones that he had no intention of assuming the office again. Instead, he had offered Shehbaz Sharif the opportunity to lead the government.
Though Nawaz has not attended any federal-level official meetings alongside Shehbaz Sharif, it is understood that the prime minister does consult his elder brother on critical national matters from time to time.
Nawaz Sharif is said to have played a key role in the appointment of General Asim Munir as Chief of Army Staff. Following a significant military victory against India, General Munir was elevated to the rank of Field Marshal - a move that Nawaz Sharif welcomed.
While there have been speculations about Nawaz’s “frustrations”, the source emphasised that Nawaz remains aligned with the party’s current course and leadership structure, and has full faith in both the civilian and military arms of the hybrid governance model.

SBP profit expected to reach Rs2.4tr in FY25: governor,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322085-sbp-profit-expected-to-reach-rs2-4tr-in-fy25-governor,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Monday that its profit is expected to reach Rs2.4 trillion for the fiscal year ending in June.
Central Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad told analysts in a briefing following the rate cut decision that the bank is on track to meet the government’s estimated target of Rs2.4 trillion.
The SBP reported a record profit of Rs3.42 trillion in the last fiscal year (FY24) due to higher interest rates and exchange gains.
According to the SBP, its profits will be transferred to the government after an audit and approval from the board in the early fiscal year 2026 (FY26). This amount has been validated by the SBP and is included in the FY26 budget. Following the amendment to the SBP Act in 2022, profits are now transferred annually instead of quarterly.
The SBP kept the policy rate unchanged at 11 percent, flagging the risk of accelerating inflation amid rising geopolitical tensions. It warned that the conflict between Israel and Iran added uncertainty to Pakistan’s economic outlook. The SBP thinks that while the 4.2 percent GDP growth target for the fiscal year 2025–26, which begins in July, is deemed achievable, it remains difficult, mostly because of risks in the agriculture sector.
The SBP stated that economic growth is expected to be driven by the industrial and services sectors, according to Arif Habib Limited’s note, citing analysts’ briefing.
This growth is supported by strong import volumes, a recovery in auto sales, rising capacity utilisation (as indicated by surveys), improving employment sentiment, and a Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) that has remained above 50 since December 2024. Additionally, the SBP plans to release its own economic assessment in July, which will include projections for GDP, inflation, the current account balance, and foreign exchange reserves. It is important to note that the SBP does not set specific targets but instead provides an evidence-based assessment.
The SBP’s governor highlighted that the total repayment for the fiscal year 2025 amounted to $25.8 billion, most of which has already been paid or rolled over. The remaining amount of $400 million will be settled within the next two weeks. Looking ahead to the fiscal year 2026, the governor indicated that external debt repayments are expected to be roughly the same. However, more details will be provided in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, which is anticipated to take place by the end of July 2025.
He noted that some inflows are expected this month, which will help maintain the target for foreign exchange reserves at around $14 billion by the end of June this year. The SBP anticipates a current account surplus for FY25, with improved external buffers entering FY26. Remittances for FY25 are projected to reach $38 billion, an increase from $31.3 billion last year. This $7 billion rise is primarily attributed to a one-time shift from informal to formal channels. Incentives are being developed in collaboration with banks and the government to encourage this trend of formal inflows. The SBP confirmed that it is on track to meet the June target for net international reserves (NIR) under the International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme. Additionally, the target for December 2024 was exceeded by a significant margin. The SBP reported that the stock of open market operations (OMO) increased mainly for two reasons: a rise in currency circulation during Eid (which is a temporary effect) and a time lag between debt repayments and incoming inflows. However, OMO levels are expected to decline in the coming weeks as these inflows materialise.

Sindh deficit budget hits fiscal framework agreed with IMF,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322086-sindh-deficit-budget-hits-fiscal-framework-agreed-with-imf,"ISLAMABAD: The fiscal framework struck with the IMF for the 2025-26 budget to restrict the overall deficit has fallen apart even before parliamentary assent, as Sindh has presented a deficit budget for the upcoming financial year.
The question also arises about the fate of the revenue surplus agreed with the IMF for the outgoing fiscal year 2024-25 ending on June 30, 2025 as the provinces argue in the closed door meeting that they would only be able to achieve the revised figure of revenue surplus if the FBR will achieve its revised down tax collection target of Rs 12.332 trillion.
Initially, the FBR had envisaged its annual tax collection target of Rs 12.97 trillion, but after witnessing a shortfall, the target was revised downward to Rs 12.33 trillion. However, in the budget documents, the FBR’s target was further revised down to Rs 11.9 trillion for the outgoing fiscal year. The FBR’s tax collection might hover around Rs 11.6 to Rs 11.7 trillion by the end of June 2025, but it requires the collection of Rs 1.4 to Rs 1.5 trillion to touch Rs 11.6 or Rs 11.7 trillion by the end of June 2025.
For the budget 2025-26, the federal budget deficit was envisaged at Rs 6.5 trillion, and provincial revenue surplus was envisaged at Rs 1.464 trillion so that the overall budget deficit would be restricted at Rs 5.03 trillion or 3.9 percent of GDP for the next budget.
Out of the revenue surplus of Rs 1.4 trillion agreed by the provinces under the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) struck by the Ministry of Finance and four provinces, all federating units agreed to generate the revenue surplus in their announced budgets for the next fiscal year.
This breach of the MoU under the IMF programme has raised eyebrows of finance ministers of other provinces and they might ask the Centre to review the situation before seeking approval of the budget from their respective provincial assemblies. Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) have presented their provincial budgets and generated revenue surplus but it is yet to analyse whether they generated the revenue surplus up to the desired level or not.
Balochistan is expected to announce its budget for 2025-26 on Tuesday (today). This scribe contacted Ministry of Finance’s former adviser Dr. Khaqan Najeeb on Monday, who said that the Sindh government’s projected provincial deficit of Rs. 38 billion for the upcoming fiscal year differs significantly from the federal budget’s projection of a Rs. 298 billion surplus for Sindh. This highlights the importance of a careful and constructive review to better reconcile these differing estimates.
He explained that additionally, the overall fiscal deficit (OFD) is anticipated to rise to 4.1 per cent, somewhat above the federal projection of 3.9 per cent for the next budget because of this development.
It is also worth noting that the Sindh deficit projection for FY25 depends on the FBR meeting its revenue targets, which have historically been challenging to fully achieve, with an acknowledged shortfall of approximately Rs. 1 trillion in the current year. Moreover, Sindh’s actual revenue share for 2024-25 was Rs. 104 billion lower than federal estimates. Given these considerations, a thorough and thoughtful evaluation of the Sindh budget would be valuable to ensure a realistic and balanced understanding of the fiscal outlook and the prospects for the projected surplus, Dr. Khaqan concluded.
When contacted, the Sindh government’ spokesman said the federal government had not released the required amount, leaving the province with no option but to present a deficit budget.

Punjab Assembly passes bill to counter violent extremism,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322087-punjab-assembly-passes-bill-to-counter-violent-extremism,"LAHORE: In a decisive move to curb the spread of violent extremism and radical ideologies, the Punjab Assembly on Monday passed a landmark piece of legislation 	 the Punjab Centre of Excellence on Countering Violent Extremism Act 2025 (Bill No 72 of 2025).
The bill was unanimously approved by the House, signaling a cross-party consensus on the urgent need to institutionalize efforts to combat terrorism and hate-based violence in the province. The Act paves the way for the creation of a dedicated research-driven institution 	 the Punjab Centre of Excellence on Countering Violent Extremism 	 which will function as a think tank, policy advisory body, and operational support system to confront all manifestations of violent extremism. This includes hate speech, misuse of religion for political or sectarian agendas, radicalization through digital platforms and glorification of terror.
The Centre is envisioned as a multidisciplinary hub that will engage with academic institutions, civil society actors, and religious scholars in developing counter-narratives and evidence-based policies. It will also directly assist the provincial government in implementing key strategies aligned with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) compliance requirements. Unlike past reactive measures, this initiative aims to proactively identify and dismantle the root causes of extremism through research, training, and coordinated action. The legislation mandates that the Centre will monitor and counter online radical content, cyber-propaganda and incitement to violence, which are seen as growing threats in the digital age.
The governance of the Centre will rest with a high-level Board of Governors chaired by the Punjab chief minister. Other members will include provincial ministers for Home and Higher Education, the chief secretary, the inspector general of police and leading experts from academia and civil society. This structure is designed to ensure a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to countering extremism.
An important component of the initiative is the establishment of a Punjab CVE Fund which will support the Centre’s operations. Funding will be sourced from the provincial government, international donor agencies and contributions from the private sector. Oversight and transparency of the fund will be ensured through annual audits conducted by the auditor general of Pakistan.
As part of its capacity-building mission, the Centre will organize training workshops, research fellowships and public engagement programs aimed at building resilience among vulnerable groups, especially youths, women and marginalized communities who are often the prime target of radicalization networks.
In the statement of objects and reasons accompanying the bill, the government emphasized that the rise of extremism in both physical and digital spaces required a comprehensive, long-term policy response rooted in research, civic engagement and inter-agency coordination. This Centre will act as Punjab’s strategic nucleus in the fight against extremism. It is a timely and critical response to the ideological and security threats facing the society. By investing in knowledge, policy and prevention, Pakistan is securing a more peaceful and united future for all citizens.
The passage of this bill comes at a time when security agencies and civil society organizations have expressed growing concern over the resurgence of banned outfits, sectarian hate speech and digital radicalization campaigns targeting youths. With Punjab being Pakistan’s most populous and politically-pivotal province, the establishment of the Centre is being hailed as a major step in the country’s broader counterterrorism strategy. The provincial government is now expected to formally notify the Board of Governors and begin the establishment of the Centre’s physical and administrative infrastructure in the coming months.

"SC adds KP speaker, govt as party to reserved seats case",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322088-sc-adds-kp-speaker-govt-as-party-to-reserved-seats-case,"ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday included the Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (KP) Assembly Speaker and provincial government as parties to the review petitions against the apex court judgement delivered on July 12, 2024, declaring that Pakistan Tehreek-e- Insaf (PTI) was entitled to get reserved seats for women and minorities in the National and provincial assemblies
An 11-member Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan resumed hearing in the review petitions filed by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PMLN) and Pakistan Peoples Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) against the apex court judgement delivered on July 12, 2024 in reserved seats case.
Other members of the bench included Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Musarat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakarh, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Aamir Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi.
The bench accepted the pleas of KP Assembly Speaker as well as the KP government seeking for impleadment as necessary parties in the review petitions and issued notices to the parties.
Both the Speaker and KP government through the provincial chief secretary had filed civil miscellaneous applications (CMAs) seeking for becoming necessary party in the review petitions, contending that despite the fact that the applicants were necessary parties to the proceedings, they were not impleaded as parties in the review petition.
That the applicants have valuable rights and interests in the matter, the pleas submitted. During the hearing on Monday, Attorney General Mansoor Usman Awan told the court that the KP government was not a party in the main case before the Peshawar High Court but later on became party in the Supreme Court.
Syed Kauser Ali Shah, KP Additional Advocate General, however, informed the court that they were party in the PHC as well as in the Supreme Court, therefore they should also be impleaded as necessary party in the review petitions too as well.
Later, the court accepted the KP government and Speaker’s pleas, impleaded them as necessary parties in the review petitions and issued notices to the respondents -- ECP, PMLN, PPPP. Earlier, during the hearing, Faisal Siddiqui, counsel for Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) continued his arguments in rebuttal.
Justice Aminuddin observed that the PTI was granted relief instead of the SIC. He asked Faisal Siddiqi, whether he agreed with the decision. The counsel responded in affirmative while Justice Mandokhail asked the counsel as to whether the reserved seats could have been left vacant and asked the lawyer to assist the court on that point.
Siddiqui submitted that the he would like to first review the majority decision, adding that the interests of the PTI and SIC were aligned, hence he had no objection to the reserved seats being allotted to the PTI.
At this, Justice Mazhar raised the point that the PTI and SIC had different constitutions and party structures, so how could their interests be the same. Justice Mandokhail, however, opined that their interest in the reserved seats was indeed common.
Siddiqi argued that Justice Mansoor Ali Shah had stated in the decision that the circumstances forced the members to join the SIC.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether any candidate had mentioned these circumstances themselves, or made any such excuse. Siddiqui replied that the majority decision did not consider this point critical—whether a party approached the court or not. He said that the issue arose due to the large number of independent candidates, even though reserved seats are allocated proportionally.
He further stated that PTI’s independent candidates demanded complete justice. One key point, according to him, was whether the reserved seats of independents could be distributed among three parties, and whether the PTI contested the elections as a party. He emphasised that this question needed the court’s attention.
Justice Aminuddin noted that this specific question wasn’t even before the court. Siddiqui responded that the majority decision had settled the matter. Justice Mandokhail noted that the judgement was issued on January 13, while nomination papers had been submitted in December, yet some candidates still declared themselves as independents.
Justice Mazhar remarked that even with an election symbol, the PTI existed as a party. Siddiqui countered that the ECP had withdrawn PTI’s symbol on December 22, 2023. Justice Aminuddin noted that the dispute centred on independent candidates joining the SIC. Siddiqui replied he was not advocating for either the PTI or the SIC, but merely supporting the majority judicial decision.
Justice Panhwar remarked that the decision on reserved seats corrected the previous injustice by the Supreme Court. Justice Mandokhail questioned how the Supreme Court could decide a candidate’s independent status when even the Returning Officer lacked such authority.
Siddiqui said the answer lied in a previous decision by Justices Aminuddin and Mandokhail, where eleven judges had declared it illegal to term PTI members as independents.
Justice Mandokhail clarified that this only applied to members who had submitted nomination papers and party tickets under the PTI—only 14 had submitted party certificates. The court assumed the others had submitted papers which later went missing, hence the figure of 39 members.
The counsel pointed out a disagreement between justices Qazi Faez Isa and Yahya Afridi regarding the count. Justice Aminuddin stated that a candidate can submit multiple nomination papers.
Siddiqui said the ECP order of February 2 did not recognise independent members as PTI members. Justice Mandokhail clarified that the order applied to only one candidate, but Siddiqui said returning officers had applied it to others as well.
Justice Mandokhail asked whether the inclusion in the list had been challenged when the symbol was denied. Siddiqui said the affected individuals deserved some benefit. Justice Mandokhail reiterated the court assumed that 39 candidates had joined no party.
The SIC counsel noted that the timeline was changed by the court itself. When asked which timeline, he said it related to nomination papers. Justice Mandokhail said he would correct any errors in his decision if found. Siddiqui replied, “No sir, please—we will defend your judgement, whatever you say.”
Justice Mandokhail stated that 41 members were not declared as candidates of any party in the majority decision, meaning the ECP was correct for 41 and wrong for 39. All judges had ruled that the SIC was not entitled to reserved seats.
The sole question was whether it was eligible for reserved seats. A party not contesting elections or winning any seats cannot claim reserved ones—though members can still join a party post-election, he added.
Siddiqui said there was a difference of opinion on the 15-day period and the number of PTI members. The majority extended the three-day window to 15 days. Justice Mandokhail noted that extensions apply only when the time hasn’t already been used.
Siddiqui in a lighter note said Article 254 seemed tailor-made for their case.
Justice Rizvi remarked that this would then be a miracle. Justice Panhwar said Article 254 actually worked against them.
Justice Mazhar added that case decisions depend on their specific circumstances. Siddiqui countered that Article 254 should protect someone wrongly declared a member of a party. Justice Mandokhail reiterated that the court had assumed 39 members joined no party.
Later, the court adjourned the hearing for today (Tuesday), and the SIC counsel would continue his arguments.

NAB chief vows to protect business community,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322089-nab-chief-vows-to-protect-business-community,"ISLAMABAD: National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Chairman Lt. Gen. (retd) Nazir Ahmed on Monday reaffirmed NAB’s commitment to fostering a business-friendly environment, assuring the business community of protection against harassment and full institutional support for economic progress.
Addressing businessmen at the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) Capital Office, Nazir Ahmed said, “No country can progress if its business community feels insecure. Where there is harassment, business cannot thrive.” He was accompanied by NAB Rawalpindi Director General Waqar Ahmed Chauhan.
The NAB chief stressed that the country’s future lies in bold, growth-oriented economic reforms. “Your problems are my problems. Do not succumb to undue pressure,” he told business leaders, adding, “It is NAB’s duty to shield you from harassment.” He urged entrepreneurs to help transform Pakistan into a ‘trillion-dollar economy’, citing the country’s natural resources, fertile land, and talented youth as key assets. “We were not created to beg — but to build,” he said, questioning Pakistan’s long-standing reliance on IMF loans.
Nazir Ahmed highlighted that NAB had recovered Rs780 billion between 2001 and 2024, but in 2025 alone, recoveries surged to Rs6,000 billion — without a single arrest or incident of coercion. “This proves that accountability and business facilitation can go hand-in-hand,” he remarked. The chairman also introduced a five-point reform plan to address systemic corruption in the real estate sector, terming fraudulent housing societies a “chronic disease”. Key reforms include:
1. Inclusion of regulators in all real estate transactions. 2. Complete ban on cash transactions in housing projects. 3. Abolition of file-based sales — only land-backed projects to be allowed. 4. Strict scrutiny of ownership documents and land title verification. 5. Enforcement through banking channels for all payments.
He further pledged zero tolerance for NAB officers engaging in harassment, promising that any such complaint would be handled strictly on merit.
FPCCI President Atif Ikram Sheikh welcomed the NAB chairman’s vision and stressed the need for stronger collaboration between NAB and the business community. “Past instances of harassment created fear among businessmen. But we support the new direction focused on facilitation and mutual trust,” he said.
Prominent business leaders, including Saquib Fayaz Magoo, Tariq Jadoon, Karim Aziz Malik, Ghazanfar Bilour, and Tariq Sadiq, also attended the meeting. A commemorative crest was presented to the NAB chairman, as both sides discussed key challenges and future cooperation. Nazir Ahmed concluded with a message of optimism: “Let’s build a corruption-free, confident, and prosperous Pakistan together.”

$6bn refinery upgrade: SIFC to work out new proposals as IMF rejects govt’s proposals,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322090-6bn-refinery-upgrade-sifc-to-work-out-new-proposals-as-imf-rejects-govt-s-proposals,"ISLAMABAD: Following the rejection of government proposals for $6 billion by the IMF, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) has convened an emergency meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) to work out new proposals for the Fund’s nod so that the work on upgrade projects could be initiated to ensure environment-friendly petrol and diesel of Euro-V specification.
“Yes, the authorities in the Petroleum Division would discuss the new proposals which may escalate the cost of the upgrade projects,” senior officials of the Petroleum Division told The News.
The escalation in the cost will be borne by the petroleum products consumers. The refineries have already been accommodated with the increase in IFEM (inland freight equalization margin) by Rs1.87 per liter to cope with the Rs34 billion loss the refineries absorbed because of sales tax exemption — a budgetary measure taken by the FBR’s top mandarins in the Finance Bill for FY25.
The increase in IFEM by Rs1.87 per liter will help cope with the loss in 12 months. Now the crude prices in the international market have increased to $75 per barrel which may further escalate in the months to come because of Iran-Israel war. So, further increase in IFEM will be a gigantic task for the sitting regime.
Earlier, the IMF denied accepting the government’s proposals aimed at facilitating $6 billion in refinery upgrade projects, dealing a blow to efforts to produce cleaner Euro-V standard fuels.
The IMF’s rejection has effectively stalled the planned investments, leaving top officials — including Federal Petroleum Minister Ali Parvaiz Malik — deeply frustrated.
“In the Finance Bill for FY26, the government financial managers as per their promises have not resolved the issue of sales tax exemption on POL products – a measure introduced in the Finance Bill for FY25 that has made the upgrade projects extremely unviable,” he said.
The sales tax exemption measure earlier imposed by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) in the Finance Bill for FY25 resulted in a loss of Rs34 billion to the refineries and oil marketing companies in the outgoing fiscal.
The IMF rejected the government proposals including i) for the restoration of zero-rated status and ii) imposition of 10 percent sales tax on POL products and asked the government to come up with new proposals. This issue will be debated at length in the SIFC meeting.
In addition, the Petroleum Division (Sui Southern) will also submit a progress report for making JJVL LPG-NGL extraction plant which has been non-operational since June 2020.
If the JJVL plant becomes operational, then the government will get $150 million relief in shape of a saving in foreign exchange reserves per annum.
“So far, the closure of the JJVL has inflicted a mammoth loss of Rs94 billion on the country’s economy till January 2024 which has further escalated to over Rs125 billion, according to the SDPI report.
The SIFC will also take up the issue of white oil pipeline which will be laid down from Machhikay to Taru Jabba in two phases. The FWO wants to execute this project in dollar term transportation tariff with a 25 percent equity from SOCAR — the state-owned company of Azerbaijan. The issue of gas supply to the national steel company also known as Tawarqi Steel Mill will also be figured out.

Historic temple in Lasbela declared world tourism site,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322059-historic-temple-in-lasbela-declared-world-tourism-site,"QUETTA: The government of Balochistan has decided to declare the historic Hinglaj Mata Temple, located in Lasbela district, as an international tourism site.
The announcement was made on Monday during a meeting between Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Senator Dinesh Kumar, where they discussed the promotion of minority tourism in the province.
The Hinglaj Mata Temple is a centuries-old spiritual site for the Hindu community in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan, attracting hundreds of thousands of pilgrims from across Pakistan and around the world every year. Recognizing its religious, cultural, and tourism significance, the Balochistan government has taken this step to enhance minority religious tourism and to project a positive image of Balochistan internationally.
Speaking on the occasion, Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said that Balochistan is a land that embraces all nationalities and cultures, and the Hinglaj Mata Temple stands as a symbol of the province’s rich heritage, history, and tolerance.
He emphasized that granting the temple international tourism status is not only a gesture of trust towards minority communities but also a significant effort to showcase Balochistan’s peaceful and inclusive identity to the world.
The chief minister further stated that the provincial government is taking concrete steps to protect and develop the religious and cultural sites of minorities. Special funds for the renovation and infrastructure development of Hinglaj Mata Temple are also being allocated in the upcoming provincial budget.

Security forces kill 5 Indian-sponsored terrorists in 2 KP IBOs,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322061-security-forces-kill-5-indian-sponsored-terrorists-in-2-kp-ibos,"RAWALPINDI: Security forces have killed five Khwarij belonging to an Indian proxy in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the last two days.
On June 15 and 16, five Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) in a statement said.
An intelligence-based operation (IBO) was conducted by the security forces in Peshawar District, on reported presence of Indian-sponsored Khwarij. During the IBO, troops skillfully surrounded and effectively engaged the Indian-sponsored Khwarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian-sponsored Khwarij, including Kharji Haris and Kharji Baseer, were sent to hell.
The other IBO was conducted in North Waziristan District and in ensuing fire exchange, one more Kharji was neutralised by the security forces.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the Indian-sponsored killed Khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas.
Sensitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored Kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, the ISPR concluded.

Sindh CM’s intervention sought over Rs40bn NICVD audit ‘irregularities’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322063-sindh-cm-s-intervention-sought-over-rs40bn-nicvd-audit-irregularities,"KARACHI: The Transparency International Pakistan (TIP) has urged the Chief Minister Sindh, Syed Murad Ali Shah, to take immediate and decisive action over what it termed “alarming and deep-rooted financial mismanagement” at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD).
The appeal comes in light of a damning audit report by the Director General Audit Sindh, which outlines financial and administrative irregularities amounting to nearly Rs40 billion during the fiscal year 2023-24.
In its formal letter to the CM, Shah, the TIP cited the Annual Audit and Inspection Report, highlighting 42 major irregularities that allegedly took place at NICVD — a key tertiary healthcare institution in the public sector, known for its free-of-cost cardiac treatment and satellite centers across Sindh. According to the audit report, widespread violations occurred in areas such as recruitment, salary disbursements, procurement, and financial controls. The auditors found that NICVD appointed several senior officials without following merit-based processes or conducting transparent recruitment procedures. These included positions such as Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Head of Human Resource, Head of Security, Manager, and Assistant Manager. The irregular salary payments made to these officials alone amounted to Rs170 million, with some individuals receiving as much as Rs 8.4 million annually, far exceeding public sector pay scales.
The auditors also flagged unauthorised expenditures on staff mess and hospitality, which crossed Rs10 million, allegedly without any competitive bidding, documentation, or approval from competent authorities. The TIP noted that procurement violations were rampant and involved the direct awarding of contracts without following Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules. Further, large cash withdrawals were made without audit trails or justifications, indicating potential misuse of public funds.
The report concluded that NICVD suffered from weak internal financial controls, unverified transactions, and inadequate oversight mechanisms, making it highly vulnerable to corruption, fraud, and inefficiency. Audit report added that during the audit of the office of Executive Director, National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, the management did not produce the record of total angioplasties, angiographies, bypass surgeries performed, and the number of deaths that occurred during the last three years. Besides, details of total surgeries pending during the last three years; details of NICVD Welfare Trust Account along with detail of collecting funds in the form of cash & non-cash or any form, details of Cardiovascular Foundation Funds and total fund received on behalf of NICVD during the financial year 2023-24, detail of Donations Endowment and Deposits, detail of Income from Investment and Deposits, and list of bank accounts along with bank statement were not provided to audit teams despite many times requests in written till the finalization of audit report.
NICVD, once regarded as a symbol of progressive public healthcare delivery in Pakistan, has been under scrutiny for several years for alleged financial and administrative lapses. The institute, which receives significant budgetary support from the Sindh government, expanded rapidly across the province with satellite centres offering free cardiac care.
This is not the first time NICVD has faced serious audit observations, in earlier audit reports — including those by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP), the Director General Audit, Sindh raised red flags over non-provision of auditable documents, misclassification of funds, over-invoicing, and double payments. In some cases, the institution delayed or refused to share complete financial records with auditors, further exacerbating concerns. Despite its high-profile public image, NICVD’s management has consistently been criticized for operating without a formal board of governors, functioning more as an autonomous body with limited external accountability.
In its recent letter, TIP has recommended that the Chief Minister, to immediately suspend those officials found responsible for mismanagement and financial irregularities; order an independent forensic audit of NICVD’s accounts and HR records; and ensure recovery of misappropriated funds through legal action. However, NICVD spokesman told media that Auditor General of Pakistan has issued observations to all government departments as a standard practice and these are preliminary remarks, and relevant institutions including of NICVD are required to submit explanations and justifications in response. The spokesman concluded that audit observations do not imply misconduct or corruption and drawing premature conclusions from these observations without verification is misleading and unjust.

Kamal calls for unified efforts to eradicate polio,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322064-kamal-calls-for-unified-efforts-to-eradicate-polio,"QUETTA: Federal Minister for Health Mustafa Kamal on Monday called for a renewed, collective national effort to eradicate polio from the country, urging politicians, religious scholars, parents, teachers, civil society, and the media to actively participate in the anti-polio campaign and use their influence to ensure every child was vaccinated.
Speaking at a press conference after chairing a high-level review meeting on polio eradication in Quetta, the minister stressed the urgent need to intensify vaccination efforts to protect children from the crippling disease. “If we do not take this issue seriously, Pakistan risks becoming the last country where polio persists, as the virus remains endemic in only two countries worldwide,” he warned.
The meeting was attended by key stakeholders, including National Polio Coordinator Capt (retd) Anwar-ul-Haq, Balochistan Health Secretary Mujeeb-ur-Rehman Panezai, Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Coordinator Balochistan Inam-ul-Haq, and representatives from the World Health Organisation (WHO), Unicef, and provincial health authorities.
Kamal highlighted that Afghanistan, which had long struggled with polio, was now on track to become polio-free due to the Afghan government’s extensive door-to-door vaccination campaigns covering all provinces. He emphasised that Muslim countries and the rest of the world had successfully eradicated polio using the same vaccine currently being administered in Pakistan.
“With the virus still present in the environment across all districts, unvaccinated children remain at risk. To prevent infection, it is essential that every child receives both recommended doses of the polio drops,” he said.
The health minister strongly urged parents to ensure their children were vaccinated, assuring them that the vaccine was safe, thoroughly tested, and remained the only protection against lifelong disability and death caused by polio.
Kamal also announced that no new polio cases had been reported in Balochistan so far this year, crediting the sustained efforts under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the coordinated work of frontline polio workers. “Our polio workers are the real heroes of this campaign. Despite severe weather and difficult conditions, they have demonstrated exceptional dedication and patriotism,” he remarked.
He called upon religious scholars, teachers, and community leaders to help dispel misinformation and build public confidence in vaccination campaigns. “Reject all negative propaganda. The success of this mission depends on national unity and the support of every citizen,” Kamal said.
Emphasising the gravity of the issue, the minister said: “Unlike other diseases, polio has no cure—vaccination is the only way to protect our children… This is not just a health campaign, it is a matter of securing our nation’s future.”
Kamal concluded by urging families to open their doors to polio workers and take personal responsibility for ensuring that children in their homes and neighborhoods receive the vaccine. “This is our national duty, and the decisions we make today will shape the future of our next generations,” he stated.

Rabbani slams federal govt over managing Sindh uplift schemes,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322065-rabbani-slams-federal-govt-over-managing-sindh-uplift-schemes,"ISLAMABAD: Former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani took a strong exception of the act of the federal government to manage development schemes of Sindh through Islamabad, while terming it as an act of encroachment on provincial autonomy and method of rolling back the 18th Amendment.
“This decision is motivated by vested interests, as a new company in Islamabad seeks to manage these schemes and an encroachment on provincial autonomy and method of rolling back the 18th Amendment,” he said in a statement on Monday.
Rabbani said the people of Sindh and Pakistan will not allow the gradual rollback of the 18th Amendment, which this government has stated. “On this bases alone the PPPP, should not vote for the budget which is anti-labour and anti-provincial autonomy,” he advised to his party.
Rabbani said at the behest of the IMF, the federal government has had an Act passed by the Balochistan Assembly and a similar bill is pending before the KP Assembly, where like the East India Company, the federal government has assumed control of the natural resources of the provinces.
He said in this budget the resource distribution is on the bases of the NFC Award passed in 2010, the provinces are being denied their financial rights under the Constitution, 1973.
Rabbani demanded that the federal government should transfer all development projects to the Sindh.
Raza Rabbani said the federal government is usurping the provincial autonomy guaranteed to Sindh under the Constitution, 1973.

"Pakistani nationals, Zaireen return home from Iraq, Iran",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322066-pakistani-nationals-zaireen-return-home-from-iraq-iran,"ISLAMABAD/QUETTA: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in close coordination with the Iraqi Airways, Monday successfully facilitated the repatriation of 268 Pakistani nationals by two special flights from Basra to Karachi and Islamabad. Both flights have safely reached Pakistan.
The ministry remains actively engaged with the Iraqi Airways and all other relevant authorities to ensure safe and timely return of the remaining Zaireen, says a press release.
The Zaireen have been advised to remain in close contact with their embassy in Baghdad, designated mandoobs, and their respective airlines for timely updates on their travel arrangements.
The Iraqi Airways is presently operating daily flights on Basra–Dubai route. On Monday, some Pakistani nationals availed themselves of this option.
Those interested in travelling via this route are encouraged to contact the nearest Iraqi Airways office for booking and assistance. The Zaireen have also been advised to get ready for repatriation on short notice.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues to monitor the situation closely and remains fully committed to facilitating the safe and orderly return of all Pakistani Zaireen.
In a related development, a large number of Pakistani students and pilgrims in Iran continue to return home. On Monday, eight coaches carrying 74 students and 545 pilgrims entered Pakistan through the Pakistan-Iran FIA Immigration Gate.
Following registration and health screening, all individuals were shifted to the Pakistan House. The district administration has assured that all returning Pakistani citizens from Iran will be provided with respectful, safe, and well-organized services to ensure they can proceed to their homes without any difficulty or distress.

Iran-Israel conflict: Pakistan shuts border with Iran for indefinite period,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322067-iran-israel-conflict-pakistan-shuts-border-with-iran-for-indefinite-period,"QUETTA: Pakistan has closed all its border crossings with neighbouring Iran for an indefinite period, provincial officials said on Monday, as Israel and Iran trade intense strikes and threaten further attacks.
“Border facilities in all five districts -- Chaghi, Washuk, Panjgur, Kech and Gwadar -- have been suspended,” Qadir Bakhsh Pirkani, a senior official in Balochistan, which borders Iran, told AFP.
Crossing into Iran “has been suspended until further notice”, said Atta ul Munim, an official at one of the crossings in Chaghi district. However, there was “no ban on trade” activities at the border and Pakistani nationals needing to return to their country from Iran can cross, he added. “We´re expecting around 200 Pakistani students coming today,” Atta said.
On Sunday, Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said 450 Pakistani pilgrims were evacuated from Iran, with more to follow, as well as from Iraq -- the two countries hosting the holiest sites in Islam.
Media reports have said Pakistan may support Tehran if the conflict was to widen, but officials in Islamabad have reiterated that their country is only showing “moral and diplomatic solidarity”.

Trump mulls extending travel ban to 36 more nations,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322069-trump-mulls-extending-travel-ban-to-36-more-nations,"WASHINGTON: The United States is considering extending its travel ban to 36 more countries, a person who has seen the memo said Monday, marking a dramatic potential expansion of entry restrictions to nearly 1.5 billion people.
The State Department early this month announced it was barring entry to citizens of 12 nations including Afghanistan, Haiti and Iran and imposing a partial ban on travelers from seven other countries, reviving a divisive measure from President Donald Trump´s first term. But expanding the travel ban to three dozen more nations, including US partners like Egypt along with other countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific, appears to escalate the president´s crackdown on immigration.
The Washington Post said it reviewed the internal memo and reported it was signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and sent to diplomats who work with the countries. A person who has seen the document confirmed its accuracy to AFP.
It reportedly gives the governments of the listed nations 60 days to meet new requirements established by the State Department. The countries include the most populous in Africa — Nigeria, Ethiopia, Egypt, Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania — as well as Cambodia, Kyrgyzstan, Saint Lucia, South Sudan, Syria and Vanuatu.
Should the ban expand to include all countries cited in the memo, nearly one in five people worldwide would live in a country targeted by US travel restrictions. The 19 countries facing full or partial entry bans to the United States, combined with the 36 cited in the latest memo, account for 1.47 billion people, or roughly 18 percent of the global population.
When the initial ban was announced this month, Trump warned it could be expanded to other countries “as threats emerge around the world.” The ban at first did not include Egypt, although the proposed follow-up list does. Trump said the initial measure was spurred by a recent “terrorist attack” on Jews in Colorado.
US officials said that the attack´s suspect Mohamed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national according to court documents, was in the country illegally having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.

Data of Pakistan’s $3.2m HIV survey under fire for ‘fabrication’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322070-data-of-pakistan-s-3-2m-hiv-survey-under-fire-for-fabrication,"ISLAMABAD: A major controversy has erupted over the credibility and validity of Pakistan’s 6th round of the Integrated Biological and Behavioral Surveillance (IBBS) on HIV, with global health agencies, the Ministry of National Health Services, and civil society groups alleging serious data manipulation, raising fears that the country’s HIV epidemic may be significantly misreported.
The $3.2 million exercise, led by a consortium including a public sector university, Progressive Development Initiative (PDI), and the WHO Collaborating Center on HIV Surveillance (HIVHUB Iran), is facing accusations of ignoring critical diagnostic findings and fabricating key data points.
The IBBS Round-6 aimed to assess HIV prevalence among key populations (KPs), including people who inject drugs (PWID), men who have sex with men (MSM), transgender persons (TGs), female sex workers (FSWs), and prisoners across 31 districts.
However, multiple emails, presentations, and official correspondence reviewed by The News reveal that key international and national stakeholders—including WHO, UNAIDS, MSM community and the Khawaja Sara Society—have expressed grave concerns about the survey’s methodology, reliability of data, and exclusion of critical test results that could have significantly raised prevalence figures.
At the center of the controversy is the failure of survey teams to retest thousands of individuals whose rapid diagnostic test (RDT) kits showed faint reactive lines—an indicator recognized by WHO and test manufacturers as potentially HIV positive.
According to internal review documents, out of 1,025 previously reviewed images, over 723 showed faint reactive lines—up from only 82 initially identified.
“Cross-referencing with gradient intensity templates has helped me better detect faint lines, and I now understand the visual cues better,” stated Norah Hoddidi, a reviewer involved in the image assessment, in a formal communication dated April 2025.
Yet despite repeated instructions, including meeting minutes from June 2024 advising that all faint-line cases be considered reactive and subject to confirmatory testing, IBBS implementers failed to follow protocols. This omission, stakeholders fear, could amount to deliberate downplaying of Pakistan’s HIV burden to meet pre-set targets or avoid negative publicity.
According to Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Dr. Shabana Saleem, Director General Health at the Ministry of National Health Services, urged colleagues to thoroughly review and discuss the Round-6 data before finalization, citing mounting concerns.
The Common Management Unit (CMU) for AIDS, TB, and Malaria also recommended an “independent, transparent third-party review” to restore credibility.
Preliminary IBBS results had reported a rise in HIV prevalence among TGs (10%), MSM (7%), and FSWs (3.8%), while showing a decline among PWID to 27%. But these numbers are now being challenged by internal data, which reveal thousands of cases with faint reactive results that were never retested.
Community groups have also condemned the findings. In a strongly worded response, Moon Ali (Hassan Amjad), Director of Programmes at the Khawaja Sara Society, highlighted discrepancies in condom use reporting and safer sex practices, especially among TG communities in Lahore, stating:
“These figures contradict ground realities and past IBBS data. Our CBOs’ data shows much higher intervention coverage.”
Further criticism was leveled at the definition of MSM used in the survey, which limited inclusion to individuals reporting risk behavior in the past 30 days—significantly reducing the estimated size of the population.
WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office (EMRO) recommended using a broader definition based on a 12-month recall period, which would yield higher and more realistic estimates.
According to UNAIDS’ response dated 22 May, 2025, the organization acknowledged the importance of the IBBS for HIV programming but refrained from endorsing the current draft due to the multiple unresolved issues.
This unfolding scandal has implications far beyond statistical errors. Health experts warn that underreporting HIV cases can result in reduced international funding, inadequate service provision, and dangerously misinformed public health policies.
A senior CMU official, requesting anonymity, told The News: “What’s most alarming is that despite clear WHO guidelines and internal flags, key evidence was excluded. Whether this was intentional or incompetence, it puts the entire national response at risk.”
The Iranian WHO Collaborating Center (HIVHUB) was reportedly sidelined during critical stages of implementation, and leading national institutions such as the University of Health Sciences (UHS) and Institute of Management Sciences (IMS) Peshawar were not taken on board.
Email evidences show Simon Nazariah from PDI allegedly played a central role in coordinating, approving, and overlooking key elements of the controversial exercise—raising questions over conflict of interest and lack of oversight.
The Ministry of National Health Services is now considering commissioning an independent third-party audit to verify the IBBS Round-6 data and ensure future surveys are community-inclusive, scientifically sound, and transparent, officials said.

Debate in KP Assembly Opposition demands review of budgetary figures,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322071-debate-in-kp-assembly-opposition-demands-review-of-budgetary-figures,"PESHAWAR: Opposition benches in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on Monday rejected the annual budget for 2025-26 and called for a review and correction of the budgetary figures.
The leader of the opposition in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Dr Ibadullah Khan, who is also the parliamentary party leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, termed the budget a “deficit” one that had been declared as surplus by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government.
“We reject the budgetary figures and demand a review, changes and corrections in the exaggerated and imaginary figures shown as revenue estimates for the next financial year,” he said during the general debate on the annual budget presented in the provincial assembly on June 13.
Dr Ibadullah said that several provincial ministers, including the adviser to the chief minister on finance, claimed that the federal government had allocated Rs550 million for the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), whereas the actual amount was Rs538 billion.
He said the KP government failed to implement PSDP projects during the current fiscal year, which led to a reduction in the province’s share for the next financial year by the federal government.
Dr Ibad added that KP generated only about 7 percent of its resources, while a large portion of its revenue came from the federal resources or foreign-funded projects.“I don’t understand why the PTI government has shown its revenue in surplus when most of the funding comes from the federal government,” he said.
He claimed the cash-strapped province had been pushed into huge debt, saying “In 2013, KP had a debt of Rs150 billion but it has now increased to Rs800 billion over the past last 12 years.”
Dr Ibad criticized the PTI for mismanagement and corruption during its 12-year rule in the province, citing scandals in BRT Peshawar, Malam Jabba, and the Billion Tree Tsunami Project.
He said PTI came to power promising to eliminate corruption and promote transparency, but major scams emerged during its tenure, including a Rs40 billion scandal in Kohistan.
The opposition leader also claimed that the current government had not constructed a single school or college building in the last one and a half years. He added that public universities and colleges were facing a financial crisis and that the rulers even failed to provide textbooks to government schools in the current academic.
On healthcare, he said the government failed to improve tertiary hospitals, Basic Health Units (BHUs), and Rural Health Centres (RHCs), claiming that 60 percent of BHUs were non-functional.
He also criticized the government for unequal distribution and allocation of developmental funds, stating that underdeveloped districts were ignored.
Adnan Wazir of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUIF) also expressed concerns over discrepancies in figures between the budget document and the whitepaper, claiming the revenue targets were exaggerated and inconsistent.
He acknowledged that KP received its due share in the federal divisible pool, net hydel profits, and other transfers, but alleged the government failed to utilize those funds for development.
In response, PTI lawmakers, including Munir Hussain Laghmani, Rajab Ali Abbasi, and Adeel Iqbal, defended the budget, calling it public-friendly, surplus, and tax-free. They said that adequate allocations were made for health, education and social welfare projects.The session was adjourned until Tuesday afternoon.

Senate panel okays Pakistan Navy bill,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322075-senate-panel-okays-pakistan-navy-bill,"ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Law and Justice on Monday unanimously approved the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2025, with the exception of Section 176 (C) giving mandate of national development, which was omitted based on concerns raised by the committee members by a vote of 3:2.
The committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Farooq H Naek, held its meeting at the Parliament House to deliberate on two important legislative proposals: the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Bill, 2025.
During the review of the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2025, the committee considered proposed provisions aimed at addressing cybercrimes committed by personnel of the Pakistan Navy. It took note that the bill was exclusively applicable to naval personnel and did not extend to civilians.
Minister for Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar endorsed the proposed amendments, reiterating the government’s resolve to reinforce internal disciplinary mechanisms within the armed forces while adhering to legal principles.
The committee also examined the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils (Amendment) Bill, 2025, introduced by Senator Farooq H. Naek. The bill sought to enhance regulatory oversight in the legal profession by introducing stricter eligibility criteria and disciplinary measures. However, in light of the reservations expressed by the Pakistan Bar Council, Farooq withdrew the bill, underscoring the importance of respecting the view of the bar council as a regulatory authority. He clarified that the intent behind the bill was to promote integrity and professionalism in the legal field, not to curtail the independence of the profession.

Rs25bn allocated in Sindh budget to reduce power costs through solarisation: Nasir,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322006-rs25bn-allocated-in-sindh-budget-to-reduce-power-costs-through-solarisation-nasir,"Sindh Energy Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah on Monday announced that Rs25 billion was allocated in the provincial budget to provide relief to the public by reducing electricity costs through solarisation.
Shah thanked the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman and the chief minister for spearheading the initiative. He said it was the PPP chief’s vision to provide affordable and, where possible, free electricity to people, especially to underprivileged and low-income households.
He added that the government is actively working to distribute solar panels, and implement solarisation initiatives across the province, with his energy department prioritising all the necessary steps.
He also said that various public welfare schemes would be executed through the block budget incorporated in the fiscal plan. He emphasised that the Sindh government holds a clear majority in the provincial assembly, and does not require external support to pass the budget.
Criticising the opposition’s conduct during the CM’s budget speech, Shah said their behaviour was unethical, and violated prior agreements regarding speech timings. “They crossed all limits by obstructing the CM’s dais. Leadership should not be targeted, and even the opposition had agreed on this point.”
He said elected representatives are the voice of the people, and development schemes proposed by assembly members would be included through block allocations. He described the opposition’s protest style in the assembly as unusual and disruptive.
Referring to an incident involving PA opposition leader Ali Khurshidi, he said false claims were made when Khurshidi approached PPP leader Faryal Talpur, who dismissed the opposition’s approach as inappropriate.
Shah reiterated that the PPP has delivered development projects across Sindh without discrimination. The party’s performance has been recognised by people, with particular attention now being given to Karachi, he added.
On international matters, he said the PPP does not support war, but acknowledged the recent destruction of Israeli military installations. “Muslims across the world are pleased to see the damage inflicted on Israel.”

‘Stability of law and order most important responsibility of IGP’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322007-stability-of-law-and-order-most-important-responsibility-of-igp,"Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar on Monday claimed that the remarks he made during the inauguration of the Model Police Station Thatta a day earlier have been twisted.
Holding a media talk at the provincial assembly, Lanjar said speculations and rumours are now becoming a tradition, but they are completely wrong and against our values.
He said his discussions with the Sindh police chief continue. “We’re engaged in efforts to align the Sindh police with the present era’s requirements. These series of effective policy-making are ongoing, and undoubtedly, providing government policy to police, bureaucracy and establishment proves to be an important tool going forward.”
He also said the establishment and stability of law and order is the most important responsibility of the IG.Replying to a query, the minister said he never even thought of hurting his officers’ feelings. Narcotics rackets have also come to light in the Armaghan case, he added.
He said the Sindh police are doing a good job against criminals in the Kutcha areas. Funds have been allocated in the budget for procuring weapons to further strengthen these measures, he added.
He also said media is the mirror of the government, and the true spokesperson of people. “We are determined to sabotage criminal activities in any city, including Karachi.” Lanjar said no criminal would be allowed to disrupt law and order. “The Sindh police fully possess the ability and courage to deal with such criminals.”
Later, he held a meeting at his office, where he reviewed the goals and objectives of the Karachi Range Task Force against drug mafias and central dealers. The meeting also reviewed the performances of the task force teams formed at range levels on June 4.
The minister ordered intensifying the crackdown on drugs at provincial level. He said regular targets should be set for taking vigorous action against crystal, ice, heroin and other drugs. He said he would personally check the overall performance of the task force against organised crime, drug mafias and their nexus at provincial level on a monthly basis.
“It’s necessary to conduct a thorough and systematic operation against major drug dealers and mafias. Drugs are a curse that not only cause crime in society but also destroy our young generation.”
He also said police should prove themselves in the war on drugs, and ensure a peaceful and crime-free society with their overall performance. If anti-drugs actions are not carried out in any locality, the relevant officer will be first warned, then suspended, he added.
IG Ghulam Nabi Memon said the primary responsibility against drugs and other crimes lies with the area officer, and it is necessary that the task force proves its performance. “I want police to move forward steadily in this war, and make actions against drugs successful with their action plan.”
The West Zone police chief, who heads the task force, said the team has started its work, and a coordinated and fruitful action against major dealers can soon be observed.

"One killed, five injured in Surjani Town shooting",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322008-one-killed-five-injured-in-surjani-town-shooting,"A rickshaw driver was killed and five others were injured in a firing incident near a restaurant in Surjani Town  on the night between Sunday and Monday.
The incident took place near the KDA Flats, where four armed suspects riding two motorcycles opened indiscriminate fire. The apparent target was a six-seater rickshaw, but bullets also struck several bystanders.

Intelligence agency official killing case: SHC commutes convict’s death sentence to life imprisonment,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322009-intelligence-agency-official-killing-case-shc-commutes-convict-s-death-sentence-to-life-imprisonment,"The Sindh High Court (SHC) has dismissed the appeal of a convict against his sentence in a case pertaining to the killing of an intelligence agency official. The high court, however, commuted his death sentence into life imprisonment stating that the prosecution had failed to establish the motive behind the killing.
The SHC also set aside the conviction of two other co-accused due to lack of sufficient evidence. Mohammad Ali was sentence to death while Younus Khan and Noman, alias Kabari, were sentenced to life imprisonment by an anti terrorism court (ATC) for murdering Tanveerul Islam, an intelligence agency official, on November 12, 2023, in the Nazimabad area.
According to the prosecution, Islam and another man, Qasim Ali, were sitting near a bus stop when three persons came on a motorcycle and shot Islam dead. The eyewitness, Qasim, identified all the three accused as assailants and identified Mohammad Ali as the shooter who killed Islam.
A division bench of the high court headed by Justice Omar Sial after hearing the arguments of the counsel observed that the prosecution witness had deposed that Mohammad Ali disembarked from the motorcycle and shot Islam dead. Noman and Khan accompanied the killer but no overt role was assigned to them.
The SHC observed that the trial court had erred in holding that the events of the incident and evidence produced at the trial showed that this was a case falling under the ambit of terrorism. The bench observed that the prosecution did not introduce a motive for the killing and for an offence to fall within the ambit of terrorism, it was essential to show that the conditions stipulated in the Section 6(1)(b) or (c) of the Anti-Terrorism Act were met.
The high court observed that prima facie, personal vendetta may have been the reason for the unfortunate incident and the evidence did not reflect that there was a design or intent to cause terrorism.
The SHC observed that it was obvious that the incident was sudden, and though capable of responding similarly, Qasim could not retaliate with gunfire. The high court also observed that no motive for the killing was explained by either side.
The bench observed that the evidence produced at the trial hinged on Qasim’s testimony who deposed that the co-accused did not fire. The SHC observed that no evidence was presented at the trial to establish a pre-arranged plan or a prior meeting of the minds.
It was quite possible that the three accused had not set out from their homes with the common intention to kill Islam, the high court observed, adding that the failure to establish the motive at the trial tilted the balance in favour of the accompanying accused.
The SHC dismissed the appeal of Mohammad Ali but reduced his death sentence into life imprisonment due to lack of motive and lapses in identification parade process. The high court also set aside the conviction of the appellants under the anti-terrorism law observing that the case did not fall within the ambit of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
The bench also set aside the conviction of co-accused Khan and Noman stating that sufficient evidence had not been produced at the trial to make them vicariously liable for Mohammad Ali’s shooting.
The SHC observed that the deceased was a member of a premium intelligence agency and in their line of duty, many would want to harm the members of this agency. The high court observed that an attack was made on a member of the agency, and he died. It added that such attacks had a potential to demoralise our law enforcement agencies, which could not be allowed as it would adversely impact national security.

Inter-family marriages a major cause of inherited diseases in Pakistan: experts,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322011-inter-family-marriages-a-major-cause-of-inherited-diseases-in-pakistan-experts,"Medical experts at a high-profile international symposium at the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) have raised serious alarm over the widespread practice of inter-family marriages in Pakistan, warning that such marriages are contributing to a growing burden of life-threatening genetic disorders among children.
Organised by the SIUT’s Paediatric Nephrology Department, the daylong event brought together leading national and international specialists who shared evidence linking consanguineous marriages—particularly between cousins—to conditions like thalassemia and congenital kidney diseases.
According to the experts, over 60 percent of marriages in Pakistan are between close relatives, leading to a severely compromised gene pool. “This is a silent genetic time bomb. With such a high rate of inter-family marriages, we are seeing more and more children born with inherited disorders that are difficult, if not impossible, to treat,” warned one of the keynote speakers at the symposium.
Dr Moin Salem from the UK and other speakers echoed the concern, pointing out that thalassemia major is a prominent example of a preventable genetic disorder. “Children with thalassemia are condemned to a lifetime of monthly blood transfusions and eventually face complications like organ damage,” said Dr Salman Kermani, a paediatric endocrinologist at Aga Khan University Hospital.
Dr Seema Hashmi and Dr Ali Lanewala of the SIUT added that inherited kidney diseases are increasingly common among Pakistani children, with early-onset renal failure becoming alarmingly frequent.
They stressed the importance of genetic counselling for at-risk families and called on general practitioners and pediatricians to refer patients to specialists at the earliest possible stage. Speakers urged the medical community to take a proactive role in public education and family counselling. “Preventing these disorders starts with awareness. Doctors must counsel families, especially in communities where cousin marriages are culturally entrenched,” said Dr Lanewala.
Speakers at the symposium called for coordinated national strategies, including mandatory pre-marital screening for certain hereditary conditions and the inclusion of genetic education in public health campaigns.

Customs seizes smuggled cell phones in Saddar mobile market raid,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322012-customs-seizes-smuggled-cell-phones-in-saddar-mobile-market-raid,"Personnel of the Pakistan Customs Enforcement carried out a raid at the Star City Mobile Market in Saddar on Monday and seized expensive smuggled mobile phones worth millions of rupees.
Syed Irfan Ali, a spokesman for the customs, said that on information received by Karachi Collectorate of Customs Enforcement Moinuddin Ahmed Wani, and acting on the orders of ASO Additional Collector Customs Enforcement Syed Muhammad Raza Naqvi, Anti-Smuggling Organisation staff led by Assistant Collector Customs Enforcement Bisma Jatoi conducted a successful raid on a shop-like warehouse located in Star City Mobile Market.
In the raid, the ASO team seized Apple iPhone, Apple MacBook, Apple Watches, Apple Pencils, Samsung Tablets, Air Pods worth Rs30 million. Moreover, Indian-made items were also seized.
The Pakistan government has imposed a ban on the import of any kind of Indian-made items, which reinforces the fact that these items are being smuggled illegally. The seized items have been shifted to the ASO warehouse.
An investigation is underway to find out how the banned Indian-made items reached here so that the persons involved in this smuggling and their facilitators can be identified and a case can be registered under the relevant provisions of the Customs Act and the strictest punishment can be given under the prevailing law.
Earlier, in February 2025, a large number of Indian origin mobile phones, tablets, iPads and gutka and other items were recovered and seized in a raid on Star City Mall.

The decision came amid rising incidents of drowning, growing threats to public safety and concerns over the security of the city’s critical water supply infrastructure. Recognising the gravity of the situation, the commissioner invoked the Section 144 of the Pakistan Penal Code to enforce the ban from June 16 till July 17, 2025.
According to the official notification, illegal activities along the Hub Canal not only pose a danger to human lives but also risk damaging Karachi’s already fragile water supply system. The commissioner directed all the relevant station house officers (SHOs) to take immediate legal action under the Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code against any violations of the ban and register cases accordingly.
A spokesperson for the water corporation has appealed to the public to cooperate with law enforcement agencies and refrain from engaging in unnecessary or hazardous activities near the Hub Canal.

"JI urges govt to adopt decisive policy on Palestine, Iran-Israel war",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321945-ji-urges-govt-to-adopt-decisive-policy-on-palestine-iran-israel-war,"LAHORE: Jamaat-i-Islami emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has urged the government to adopt a clear, courageous, and decisive policy not only on Palestine but also on the ongoing situation involving Iran.
Addressing the concluding session of the JI three-day Central Majlis-e-Shura meeting at Mansoora, he stressed that the case of Kashmir must be pursued with full national resolve. Rehman also called for immediate economic relief for the masses through reductions in essential commodities, electricity, and fuel prices. Emphasising the need for the government to restore peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, he called for emergency  measures to stabilise these regions and urged Islamabad and Kabul to improve bilateral ties and initiate meaningful dialogue for regional peace. “Afghan soil must never be allowed to be used against Pakistan under any circumstances,” he said.
Rehman further urged the government to heal the wounds of the Baloch people by addressing long-standing grievances and resolving the issue of missing persons. On the Palestinian issue, he said the rulers must truly reflect the sentiments of the Pakistani people. “If Israel is not restrained, the entire region could be engulfed in flames,” he warned. The government, he said, must not cower before the United States and nor should it treat Trump like a god of the earth. He lauded Hamas for its steadfast resistance and prayed for the success of the Palestinian fighters.
Speaking on Kashmir, he said, “The people of Kashmir are fighting the final battle for the completion of Pakistan.” He urged the government to expose to the international community the grave human rights violations and atrocities being committed by the Hindutva-driven Modi regime in occupied Kashmir.
Hafiz Naeemur Rehman also reminded that Jamaat-e-Islami had put aside political differences and fully supported the government during times of conflict with India. However, he stated that Jamaat cannot remain silent on the establishment’s interference in political and institutional matters. “All institutions must operate within their constitutional limits, which is in their own interest,” he added.
Criticising the recently announced budget, he said it overwhelmingly favored the elite, offering no relief to salaried workers, farmers, laborers, or the common citizen. He reiterated Jamaat-e-Islami’s commitment to intensify its struggle for public rights. “This is a four-front battle that our workers must lead. We must reshape public opinion through sound strategy and lay the foundation for real social change.”

"Agriculture, allied sectors’ budget enhanced",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321948-agriculture-allied-sectors-budget-enhanced,"LAHORE:Overall agriculture budget outlay for financial year 2022 has been set at Rs129.8 billion up from Rs117.2 billion in FY 2024-25, showing an impressive increase of 10.7 percent.
The provincial government has prioritised inclusive, evidence-based planning and targeted investments in agriculture other sectors to sustain growth, aligned with national and global priorities, as per budget documents. By doing so, Pakistan and Punjab are navigating together a cautious but deliberate path toward economic recovery and transformation.
Enhancing focus on Agriculture & Livestock sectors, Punjab introduced several initiatives like CM Green Tractor Programme under which 9,366 farmers have been provided with subsidised green tractors.
For promotion of Mechanised Agriculture for Increasing Crop Productivity with Rs4,258.774 million allocation, 1,050 farmers have been provided with different types of agricultural implements including Disc Plow, Chisel Plow, Rotavator, Wheat Reaper, Disc Harrow, Maize Bed Planter etc. at subsidy of Rs0.500 million per unit during 2024-25.
Other details of provincial govt’s projects include CM Hi Power Tractor Programme (2025-26) (allocation Rs10 billion), CM Green Tractor Programme (Phase-II) (2025-26) (allocation: Rs5.5 billion), CM Hi-Tech Farm Mechanisation Financing Programme (2025-26 to 2028-29) (Rs9 billion, allocation Rs1.5 billion), CM Programme for Water Efficient Agriculture (2025-26 to 2027-28) (Rs8 billion, allocation Rs2 billion), Agricultural Farm Mechanisation Project (2025-26 to 2027-28) (Rs7 billion, allocation Rs0.7 billion).
As many as Rs800 million has been allocated for CM Herd Transformation to enhance livestock productivity, Rs20 million for establishment of CM FMD Free Zone at Bahawalnagar, one billion rupees for CM Livestock Card.
Last but not the least, Punjab has made a candid acknowledgement of the fact that withdrawal from wheat procurement last year was its deliberate move. “In agriculture, govt has withdrawn from direct intervention in the commodity market,” according to budget documents. Instead, it has opted for targeted direct support to farmers through interest-free loans on inputs under the Kissan Card Programme as well as access to technology and high-yield seed varieties.

The deserving patients were transplanted free of cost, with the entire cost borne by the Punjab government under the initiative of Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz to provide free public health facilities.
The patients ranged from a 14-year-old boy to a 64-year-old man, who were either completely blind or could not see due to deep corneal injuries. The operations were performed by Prof Dr Asad Aslam Khan, Dr Sidra Latif, Dr Rana M Mohsin, and Dr Junaid Afzal under the leadership of Prof Dr Fawad Zafar from the US.
Prof Asad Aslam Khan, the founder of Cornea Transplant in the Eye Department, said that the COAVS has been a ray of hope for blind people for 30 years. Today's operations are not just about treatment, but also about giving people a new life. “COAVS is expanding its ties with international organisations that donate corneas so that more patients can be treated. At the same time, work is being done to train surgeons and acquire new equipment”.
Prof Dr M Moin said that it was difficult to restart this expensive treatment, but today it is a big success for the poor patients of Punjab. King Edward Medical University (KEMU) Vice Chancellor Prof Mahmood Ayaz said that Mayo Hospital Lahore is the hallmark of government eye care.

Dog bites and rabies – real threats in summer,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321963-dog-bites-and-rabies-real-threats-in-summer,"Rawalpindi:In extreme hot weather conditions, the number of cases of dog bites and rabies register a sharp upward trend making these serious health threats for the general public though majority of the people are unaware of the fact.
Data collected by ‘The News’ on Monday has revealed that soon after the setting in of summer, in May, the healthcare facilities in this region of the country had started receiving a significant number of dog-bite cases that are continuously on the rise.
It is alarming that the three teaching hospitals in town including Holy Family Hospital, Benazir Bhutto Hospital and Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital had received as many as 1482 dog-bite cases in the month of May while the number of cases being reported in June is recording a continuous increase.
Principal Rawalpindi Medical College and In-charge Allied Hospitals Professor Dr. Jahangir Sarwar Khan informed ‘The News’ that only in the month of May this year, as many as 677 victims of dog bites reached accident and emergency department of BBH while 490 victims reported at the emergency department of HFH after bitten by dog. The RTH received 315 cases of dog bites in the last month.
It is important that most of the dog bite victims reaching the allied hospitals in town are from the peripheries of the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. It is also alarming that a number of dog bite victims do not report at any healthcare facility instead follow home remedies for the treatment of wounds.
Health experts say that a dog bite victim must report to a public sector healthcare facility and follow a standard protocol to avoid rabies, which is 100 per cent fatal for both animals and humans after developing symptoms. People must be aware of the fact that rabies cases are more common in summer in this region of the world including Pakistan.
Studies reveal that in extreme hot weather conditions, the stray dogs get rabid more often. Also the dog bite cases register an upward trend in summer because animals including dogs tend to be more active during the warmer months and it increases the chances of their interactions with humans.
Rabies is one of the most neglected diseases in Pakistan though its incidence is very high with an estimated 2000 to 5000 cases every year meaning the disease claims 2000 to 5000 lives every year as it is 100 per cent fatal after developing symptoms. Rabies is said to be the mother of all infectious diseases and it is believed that nothing can be more painful and horrific than rabies.
Experts say that people must take measures to avoid dog bites particularly in warmer months and should not take dog bites as lightly. Studies reveal that rabies is an acute infectious zoonotic disease of the central nervous system, which can affect almost all mammals, including humans and is transmitted to other animals and humans through close contact with the saliva of infected animals through bites, scratches, licks on broken skin and mucous membranes.
In case of a rabid animal bite case, the virus spreads from the injured part to the nerves and on to the spinal cord that damaging victim’s brain ultimately results in death. It causes convulsions, inability to move and strange behaviour developing hydrophobia (an extremely intense aversion to water, especially the fear of drinking water or other liquids) in the victim exposed to the disease.

FAPUASA observes nationwide black day,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321964-fapuasa-observes-nationwide-black-day,"Islamabad:On the call of Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Associations (FAPUASA), faculty members across universities in Pakistan observed a Black Day on Monday under the banner of the ongoing ""Movement to Protect Higher Education.""
The protest witnessed large participation of university teachers who tied black ribbons, displayed banners and placards and raised slogans to press for their long-standing demands. Faculty members expressed serious concern over the government’s persistent neglect of higher education, demanding an immediate increase in the budget to Rs200 billion.
It is important to note that recurring grant in higher education budget from which salary and pension are paid is frozen to Rs65 billion since 2018 by not adding the effects of annual increments, addition of new universities, increases in salaries and pension and ignoring inflation.
Another key concern was the 25% tax rebate, which was presented in the Finance Bill with a restriction limiting it to the current fiscal year only. Faculty strongly rejected this limitation, demanding full restoration and continuation of the rebate in coming years. They also reiterated their long-pending demands for the implementation of a fair and transparent promotion policy for BPS faculty and revision of TTS salaries also stagnant since 2021.
As part of the ongoing protest campaign, FAPUASA announced a peaceful demonstration to be held in front of the National Press Club today (June 17), at 4 pm.
FAPUASA leadership emphasised that higher education is the backbone of a knowledge-based economy and its continued neglect not only undermines the welfare of university faculty, but also puts at risk the future of students, research and Pakistan’s national development. The federation reiterated its firm resolve to continue the peaceful struggle until the genuine demands of the academic community are addressed.

To ensure a clean and healthy environment, it is essential for the public to play a positive role. He emphasised that waste bins should be installed outside shops so that the waste generated from commercial activities can be collected in an organised manner, instead of being dumped on streets, markets, and roads, says a press release.

These views were expressed during a detailed visit to Rawalpindi city, conducted in light of the special directives of Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif.
On this occasion, CEO of Rawalpindi Waste Management Company Rana Sajid Safdar, Acting Senior Manager Operations Bilal Niazi, Manager Operations Urban Amir Naik, Senior Manager MIS Ahsan Azmat Malik, and Senior Manager Communication Nasir Mehmood were also present.
Asim Mahmood visited various areas including Murree Road, Committee Chowk, Liaquat Road, Gawalmandi Bridge, Fawara Chowk, Raja Bazaar, Mochi Bazaar, Bani Chowk, and others, where he personally inspected the cleanliness situation and obtained direct feedback from citizens. The residents appreciated the improved cleanliness arrangements and termed the ‘Suthra Punjab Programme’ a positive and effective initiative.
Particularly in view of Eidul Azha, citizens highly praised RWMC for the timely and efficient disposal of animal waste and remains. The in-charge of the ‘Suthra Punjab’ Programme expressed satisfaction over the cleanliness in the city and the public feedback, and commended the performance of RWMC’s sanitation staff.
During his visit, Asim Mehmood also met with representatives of the trader community and urged them to fully cooperate with RWMC staff in order to further improve the cleanliness system.
He said that the RWMC is implementing a comprehensive cleanliness plan aimed at providing a clean, green, and pleasant environment in the city. Traders also acknowledged the improvement in the cleanliness of the city and markets, stating that workers clean the markets in two shifts, which has significantly improved the standard of cleanliness. They assured their full cooperation for maintaining the city’s cleanliness. Earlier, the In-charge of the ‘Suthra’ Punjab Programme also visited the RWMC Control Room, where he was given a detailed briefing.

Highlighting the ministry’s commitment to excellence, Dr. Ata ur Rehman announced stricter criteria for selecting Seasonal Duty Staff (SDS), welfare staff, and medical personnel. ""Specialisation will be our focus,"" he stated. ""Candidates must demonstrate thorough knowledge of Mina and Arafat’s geography. Transparency and equity will be paramount in all appointments.""

‘GB ideal region for investment’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321970-gb-ideal-region-for-investment,"Islamabad:Chief Minister of Gilgit-Baltistan, Haji Gulbar Khan, has stated that Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) is an ideal region for investment compared to other areas of the country. It is the most peaceful region in Pakistan. There are vast opportunities for investment in key sectors such as power, minerals, agriculture, and tourism, says a press release.
He made these remarks during a meeting yesterday with a delegation of the United Business Group (UBG) led by S.M. Tanveer. He said the government is providing every possible support to investors and has undertaken special reforms to promote investment. A Board of Investment has been established, and the Public-Private Partnership law has been passed.
He added that work is progressing rapidly on the establishment of industrial and economic zones. A one-window facility for investors will be introduced soon. Major infrastructure projects are under construction to improve transportation, including the Gilgit-Chitral Expressway, Skardu-Astore Road, and Darail-Tangir Expressway. To permanently resolve the power crisis in the province, short-term and long-term policies are being implemented. He said that efforts are being made to complete the Prime Minister’s announced 100-megawatt solar power project in a short period. In addition, several other mega power projects are also under construction. The construction of an international airport in Skardu has led to a significant increase in both domestic and international tourism to Baltistan.
The government is also striving to construct an international airport in Gilgit and is inviting major investors in this regard. On this occasion, Special Assistant to the Chief Minister of Gilgit-Baltistan for Information Technology Muhammad Ali Quaid, Chairman Board of Investment Fatehullah Khan, Provincial Secretary Tourism, Provincial Secretary Agriculture and Additional Secretary Minerals gave a briefing on investment opportunities in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Speaking on the occasion, UB Chief Minister SM Tanveer said that the vision of the Chief Minister Gilgit-Baltistan regarding investment is commendable. The future of Gilgit-Baltistan looks bright. He said that due to the steps taken by the provincial government to attract investors, big investors will turn to Gilgit-Baltistan in the future. UBG will play its role in the construction of an international airport in Gilgit. Land reforms by the provincial government are a very important initiative that will remove obstacles to investment.
Speaking on the occasion, Secretary General UBG Zafar Bakhtawari said that the expansion and modernization of Gilgit Airport has been declared essential for the development and promotion of investment in Gilgit-Baltistan.
He stated that due to the limited number of flights and frequent cancellations at Gilgit Airport, investors are hesitant to invest in the region. If Gilgit Airport is upgraded to accommodate larger aircraft, similar to Skardu, it would not only boost tourism but also strengthen the local economy.
Zafar Bakhtawari cited the example of the Sialkot Chamber of Commerce, which successfully established its own airport and airline through a public-private partnership. He said this model could also be replicated in Gilgit-Baltistan. He urged both the government and the private sector to work together to improve Gilgit Airport in order to promote investment and tourism in the region.
He further mentioned that during Ahsan Bakhtawari’s tenure as president of the chamber, he led a large delegation to Gilgit-Baltistan, which significantly boosted tourism in the area.

IHC hears appeal of workers in May 9 case,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321974-ihc-hears-appeal-of-workers-in-may-9-case,"Islamabad:The Divisional Bench of the Islamabad High Court heard the appeal of two PTI workers convicted by the Anti-Terrorism Court in the May 9 incident, says a press release.
Senior Advocate Supreme Court Babar Awan gave detailed arguments on behalf of the petitioners. He told the court that Section 6 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 clearly states that political protests and rallies cannot be brought under the category of terrorism. He was of the view that the case in question was purely a political protest, which is a misinterpretation of the law to conduct under the provisions of terrorism.
After hearing the arguments, the court adjourned further hearing of the case till June 19, 2025. The application for suspension of sentences under Section 426 will be discussed in detail in the next hearing. The petitioners’ legal team includes Senior Advocate Supreme Court Dr. Babar Awan, Barrister Abdullah Babar Awan, Sardar Muhammad Shushid Khan Advocate, Amna Ali Advocate, Zahid Bashir Dar Advocate and Murtaza Hussain.

How Noor Muqaddam case galvanised public,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321975-how-noor-muqaddam-case-galvanised-public,"Islamabad:The ferocious murder of Noor Muqaddam, the 27-year-old daughter of a former Pakistani diplomat, in Islamabad in July 2021, sent shockwaves across Pakistan and the globe, sparking extensive outrage and a renewed debate on violence against women. The case, which involved abduction, torture, and decapitation, concluded with the prime accused, Zahir Jaffer, being sentenced to death, a verdict that was later upheld by higher courts.
On July 20, 2021, Noor Muqaddam was held captive and brutally murdered at the residence of Zahir Jaffer in the affluent F-7/4 sector of Islamabad. Investigations revealed a horrifying sequence of events. Noor had attempted to escape but was prevented from doing so by the household staff. Over the course of two days, she was subjected to vicious torture before being beheaded.
The gruesome nature of the crime was laid bare by the post-mortem report, which detailed multiple stab wounds and the eventual cause of death as beheading. The immediate aftermath saw the arrest of Zahir Jaffer from the scene of the crime. The police also took into custody his parents, Zakir Jaffer and Asmat Adamjee, and members of their household staff on charges of abetting the murder and concealing evidence.
The trial of Noor Muqaddam's murder began in October 2021. The prosecution presented a compelling case, built on forensic evidence, call data records, and witness testimonies. The DNA report confirmed that the victim had been raped before her death, and the fingerprints and DNA on the murder weapon, a knife, matched those of Zahir Jaffer.
Throughout the trial, Zahir Jaffer made several attempts to portray himself as mentally unstable, a claim that was refuted by medical evaluations. His erratic behaviour in court and attempts to disrupt the proceedings were widely reported.
On February 24, 2022, a sessions court in Islamabad delivered its much-anticipated verdict. Zahir Jaffer was found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced to death. He was also awarded a concurrent 25-year prison sentence with a fine of Rs200,000 for rape. His parents and a therapist were acquitted of all charges. Two of the household staff, a gardener and a watchman, were sentenced to 10 years in prison for their role in abetting the crime.
The convicts, including Zahir Jaffer, appealed their sentences in the Islamabad High Court (IHC). In a significant development on March 22, 2023, the IHC upheld the death sentence for Zahir Jaffer. In a move that was lauded by civil society, the court also converted the 10-year sentences of the two household staff members into life imprisonment.
The legal battle culminated in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. In January 2024, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court, led by Justice Sardar Tariq Masood, took up the appeals filed by Zahir Jaffer and the other convicts. After a series of hearings, the apex court upheld the death sentence for Zahir Jaffer, bringing a legal closure to a case that had gripped the nation.
The killing of Noor Muqaddam stands as a harrowing reminder of the vulnerability of women in Pakistan and the long and arduous path to justice. The case galvanized a nationwide movement demanding an end to gender-based violence and highlighted the critical need for robust legal and social frameworks to protect women. While the legal battle may have concluded, the memory of Noor Muqaddam continues to fuel the fight for a safer society for all.
The Brutal Murder of Noor Muqaddam: A Timeline from a Heinous Crime to a Landmark Verdict  The chilling murder of Noor Muqaddam, sent shockwaves across Pakistan and the globe, igniting a nationwide conversation on gender-based violence and the efficacy of the justice system. The case, which culminated in the death sentence for her killer, Zahir Jaffer, has become a landmark in the country's legal history, marked by public outrage, a high-profile trial, and a protracted legal battle that finally saw justice delivered.
On July 20, 2021, Noor Muqaddam was found brutally murdered at the residence of her acquaintance, Zahir Jaffer, in a posh neighbourhood of Islamabad. The investigation revealed a horrifying sequence of events. Noor had been held captive, tortured with brass knuckles, and ultimately beheaded. The gruesome nature of the crime, perpetrated by a scion of one of Pakistan's wealthiest families, sparked immediate and widespread condemnation.
The First Information Report (FIR) was registered with the Kohsar police station, on the same day, and Zahir Jaffer was arrested from the scene of the crime. The subsequent investigation uncovered harrowing details, including evidence of Noor's repeated attempts to escape her captor.
The trial of Zahir Jaffer and his alleged accomplices, began in October 2021. The prosecution presented compelling evidence, including CCTV footage, forensic reports, and witness testimonies, to build a strong case against the primary accused. Throughout the trial, Jaffer's defense team made several attempts to have him declared mentally unfit, a plea that was ultimately rejected by the courts.
On February 24, 2022, a sessions court in Islamabad delivered its verdict. Zahir Jaffer was found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced to death. He was also found guilty of rape and sentenced to 25 years of rigorous imprisonment. Two of his employees, a guard and a gardener, were sentenced to 10 years in prison for abetting the crime. Jaffer's parents, who were accused of attempting to cover up the murder, were acquitted.
Following the sessions court's verdict, both the prosecution and the convict filed appeals in the Islamabad High Court (IHC). In a significant development on March 13, 2023, the IHC not only upheld the death sentence for murder but also converted Jaffer's 25-year jail term for rape into a second death sentence, further underscoring the brutality of his crimes. The sentences of his two employees were also upheld.
The legal battle reached its final stage when Zahir Jaffer challenged the IHC's decision in the Supreme Court of Pakistan. After a series of hearings that were closely watched by the nation, a three-member bench of the Supreme Court delivered its final verdict on May 20, 2025.
The apex court upheld the death sentence handed down to Zahir Jaffer for the murder of Noor Muqaddam, bringing a long and arduous legal process to a close. However, the court converted the death sentence for rape back to life imprisonment. The sentences of the two co-accused employees were also taken into consideration, and they were ordered to be released, having served their time.
The final verdict was met with a sense of relief and vindication by Noor Muqaddam's family, civil society, and women's rights activists who had relentlessly campaigned for justice. The case is hailed as a significant victory against impunity and a testament to the resilience of those who fought for accountability in the face of a horrific crime that shook the conscience of a nation.

Temporary ramp built over stream in Kaghan,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321978-temporary-ramp-built-over-stream-in-kaghan,"MANSEHRA: The National Highway Authority (NHA) on Monday built a temporary ramp over the stream in the Mahandri area of the Kaghan Valley to maintain one-way traffic flow during the installation of a new steel bridge.
“This is peak tourism season, and a complete suspension of traffic for three days could have caused serious inconvenience for passengers and motorists. Building a temporary ramp to facilitate vehicle movement is a welcome step for the business community and tourists who already throng to the valley,” Hussan Deen, Chairman of the Hoteliers Association in Naran, told reporters.
The NHA, with the help of heavy machinery, began replacing the existing small steel bridge with a 33-foot-wide structure on the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad (MNJ) Road at Mahandri.According to the district administration, the installation of the new bridge is expected to be completed by Wednesday, after which traffic will be diverted onto the newly installed steel structure.
In the meantime, vehicles have been using the temporary ramp constructed with sand and mud over large culvert pipes to allow river water to flow underneath for the crossing of vehicles.
Eyewitnesses told reporters that passenger coaches travelling between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan were also successfully using the temporary ramp.They said police personnel deployed at Mahandri along the MNJ Road were managing one-way traffic to avoid congestion and ensure safety.
The original central bridge connecting KP with GB, and Kaghan Valley with the rest of Mansehra district, was swept away in flash floods last year, disrupting traffic for over two weeks.“We appreciate the district administration for keeping traffic moving, even if at a limited pace,” Deen said.

Serial killer and rapist handed death sentence,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321979-serial-killer-and-rapist-handed-death-sentence,"PESHAWAR: The Peshawar Child Protection Court on Monday sentenced a man to death on three counts and life imprisonment along with a total fine of Rs2.7 million after he was found guilty of sexually assaulting three minor girls and murdering two of them in the provincial capital.
The case was prosecuted by Public Prosecutors Bilal Arif and Ziaul Qamar Safi. The accused, Sohail alias Malang, was charged with assaulting minor girls in the jurisdictions of West Police Station, East Police Station, and Gulberg Police Station in July 2022. After the assaults, he murdered two of the girls, while a third miraculously survived.Police formed multiple teams to investigate the incidents and arrested the suspect after DNA testing.
The public prosecutors told the court that these crimes had shaken the entire society. The Child Protection Court conducted the trial, presenting all witnesses and medical evidence.The prosecutors stated that Sohail alias Malang had raped and murdered a minor girl in the Railway Quarters area in the jurisdiction of East Cantt Police Station.
The following week, he killed another minor girl near a mosque in the limits of West Cantt Police Station.
Days later, he assaulted a third girl in a commercial plaza in Nauthia locality and attempted to murder her, but she survived miraculously.The prosecutors argued that solid evidence, including the accused’s confession before a magistrate, proved his guilt, warranting strict punishment. They emphasized that such incidents not only tarnished Pakistan’s reputation globally but also spread fear among parents.The defense lawyer, however, claimed that the prosecution had failed to prove its case and demanded acquittal.

Protesters want locals recruited in Orakzai,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321981-protesters-want-locals-recruited-in-orakzai,"KALAYA: People hailing from various tribes on Monday staged a protest outside the office of the district health officer and demanded to recruit local youth for the vacant positions in the health department in Orakzai tribal district.
The protest was led by tribal elders Shakeel Orakzai, Qasim Gul, Malik Khai Badshah and others.Speaking at the protest, the elders said that the recent recruitments in the health department in Orakzai should give preference to local candidates instead of non-locals.
They said that many times, non-locals got appointed but then transferred out after a few months, leaving the positions vacant again.The speakers urged the government and senior health department officials to prioritize local candidates for employment to help reduce unemployment and improve healthcare services in the area.
On this occasion, District Health Officer Dr Inayatur Rehman said that all appointments were being conducted on merit and that local candidates had already been given concessions.He explained that the provincial government and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Health Department had reduced the passing score in the ETEA examination from 50 to 33 to benefit Orakzai’s youth.
The officer assured the protesters that selection would only take place after fulfilling all legal requirements and that preference would be given to local youth.However, if local candidates failed to meet the merit criteria, non-locals would be selected. He added that anyone with concerns or complaints was welcome to visit his office or approach higher authorities.

Saif says Imran prisoner of conscience,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321990-saif-says-imran-prisoner-of-conscience,"PESHAWAR: Adviser to the Chief Minister on Information and Public Relations, Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, said on Monday that the federal government could not weaken Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan’s resolve by keeping him in solitary confinement.
According to a handout, he said that the judiciary had been paralyzed by the 26th Constitutional Amendment. “Despite court orders, neither Imran Khan’s family members nor party leaders are being allowed to meet him,” he said, adding that the 26th Amendment had caused irreparable damage to the country.
The adviser termed the federal government a fake and accused it of having shackled the justice system with the chains of the 26th Amendment.  “Imran Khan, along with all PTI leaders, are prisoners of conscience. The fake regime cannot harm Imran Khan, but it has certainly pushed the country to the brink of disaster,” he alleged.
Saif said that Imran Khan would fight for the true freedom of the nation until his last drop of blood. He accused Pakistan Muslim League N chief Nawaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari of having struck deals to leave the country, but said Imran Khan would never go for such a deal.
The adviser said that fake cases had been instituted against Imran Khan by the federal government, which failed to prove them in court, leading to repeated adjournments.He concluded that by saying that Imran Khan was the last hope for the youth, and the day was not far when he and all PTI leaders would stand vindicated.

"Shipping disruption surges around Hormuz amid Israeli attacks on Iran, say naval agencies",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321888-shipping-disruption-surges-around-hormuz-amid-israeli-attacks-on-iran-say-naval-agencies,"LONDON: Electronic interference with commercial ship navigation systems has surged in recent days around the Strait of Hormuz and the wider Gulf, which is having an impact on vessels sailing through the region, naval forces said on Monday.
Iranian missiles struck major Israeli cities on Monday, while Israel’s prime minister said his country was on its way to eliminating “threats” from nuclear and missile facilities in Iran and civilian casualties mounted on both sides after four days of conflict.
Tehran has in the past threatened to close the critical Strait of Hormuz to traffic in retaliation for Western pressure. Any closure of the strait could restrict trade and impact global oil prices.“JMIC continue to receive reports of electronic interference stemming from the vicinity of Port of Bandar Abbas (in Iran),	in the SoH and several other areas in the Arabian Gulf,” the multinational, US-led Combined Maritime Force’s JMIC information centre said in an advisory.
“These interferences, which continue	to intensify throughout the region, are having significant impact within the Gulf itself. This disruption is affecting vessels’ ability to accurately transmit positional data via automated identification systems (AIS), posing operational and navigational challenges for maritime traffic.”
Every oceangoing ship has a number of navigation systems onboard, which includes the AIS public ship tracking system that is used extensively by merchant shipping across the world.The advisory followed an earlier note on Monday by UKMTO maritime agency, which also pointed to an increase in navigational interference in the Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, although no parties were identified as the source of the interference.
Greek authorities urged their merchant fleet last week to log all voyages through the strait. Greek operators are among the biggest tanker providers in the world.“The regional threat level remains significant as strikes continue from both Iran and Israel.		The maritime threat level remains elevated,” the JMIC said.

"Oil prices fall over 1%, stocks rise as fears of wider Middle East conflict ease",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321889-oil-prices-fall-over-1pc-stocks-rise-as-fears-of-wider-middle-east-conflict-ease,"LONDON: Stocks rose and oil prices retreated Monday as fears of a wider Middle East conflict eased even as Israel and Iran pounded each other with missiles for a fourth day.
The dollar and safe-haven gold declined slightly.“As things stand, investors seem less fearful than they were going into the weekend of the possibility that the war between Israel and Iran spreads across the Middle East, and beyond,” said David Morrison, senior market analyst at financial services provider Trade Nation.
“It appears that most of the Israeli airstrikes and missile launches avoided the most significant parts of Iran’s energy infrastructure. And so far Iran’s retaliation has done relatively little damage,” he added.Wall Street opened in the green, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq up around one percent in early deals, while London, Paris and Frankfurt were all higher in afternoon trading.
That tracked gains in Asia, where Tokyo closed up 1.3 percent, boosted by a weaker yen, while Hong Kong and Shanghai also advanced.Israel’s surprise strike against Iranian military and nuclear sites on Friday -- killing top commanders and scientists -- sent crude prices soaring as much as 13 per cent at one point on fears about supplies from the region.
However, concerns over the conflict spreading appeared to have eased, with both main oil contracts retreating by more than 1.0 per cent on Monday.Analysts said the recent decision by the OPEC+ group of crude producing nations, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, to raise output again in July also played a role.
“Financial markets are very good at absorbing geopolitical risk, and OPEC+’s supply boost is also helping to cushion the blow,” said Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading group XTB.
“There may need to be a major escalation in the conflict before we get another sharp upswing in oil and gold prices,” she added.Analysts had warned that the spike could send inflation surging globally again, dealing a blow to long-running efforts by governments and central banks to get it under control.
Investors were gearing up for monetary policy decisions this week from the US Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Japan.All are expected to stand pat but traders will be keeping a close watch on their statements for clues on interest-rate outlooks, with US officials under pressure from President Donald Trump to cut borrowing costs.
There was little major reaction to data showing China’s factory output grew slower than expected last month as trade war pressures bit, while retail sales topped forecasts.Also in focus is the G7 summit in the Canadian Rockies, which kicked off Sunday, where the Middle East crisis will be discussed along with trade after Trump’s tariff blitz.
In corporate news, shares in Nippon Steel rose more than 3.0 per cent in Tokyo after Trump on Friday signed an executive order approving its $14.9 billion merger with US Steel, bringing an end to the long-running saga.
Shares in Gucci owner Kering climbed over 11 per cent in Paris on reports that the outgoing boss of French automaker Renault would take over as chief executive of the struggling luxury group.Renault shares shed almost 8.0 per cent, following its announcement on Sunday that Luca de Meo would step down in July.

Stocks start week with gain of 82 points,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321891-stocks-start-week-with-gain-of-82-points,"KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed cautious activity on Monday, where the market closed slightly higher ahead of the monetary policy announcement.

Analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp said, “Stocks advanced despite geopolitical risk amid speculations over the SBP’s policy announcement later on Monday.”He said that trade remained high amid consolidation. Recovery in global equities, IMF-driven FY26 upbeat projections for privatisation, GDP growth and federal PSDP in the federal budget for FY26 played a catalytic role in the positive close at the PSX.

Positive contributions came from BAHL, OGDC, NBP, MARI, and MEBL, collectively adding 371 points to the index. On the other hand, selling in ENGROH, PKGP, and LUCK weighed on performance, subtracting a combined 255 points.

A significant decline was noted in PIA Holding Company Limited B, which fell by Rs1,888.91 to Rs17,000.19 per share, Khyber Textile Mills Limited followed it, which closed lower by Rs179.45 to Rs1,615.1 per share.
Analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala at JS Global said the market opened on a positive note, touching an intraday high of 122,903, but failed to sustain momentum, as profit-taking emerged later in the session.
On the economic front, the State Bank kept the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent, aligning with expectations. Trading activity was dominated by small-cap stocks, reflecting short-term speculative interest. “We advise investors to maintain a cautious stance and avoid aggressive exposure for now,” he said. “Risk management remains key amid geopolitical uncertainty and macro developments.”

"US-UK trade deal to be completed ‘very soon’, says Starmer",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321893-us-uk-trade-deal-to-be-completed-very-soon-says-starmer,"KANANASKIS: Britain and the US should finalise “very soon” the implementation of a trade deal agreed last month, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday ahead of a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Canada. “I’m very pleased that we made that trade deal, and we're in the final stages now of implementation, and I expect that to be completed very soon.”
Britain was the first country to agree a deal for lower tariffs from Trump, with the US reducing tariffs on imports of UK cars, aluminium and steel, and Britain agreeing to lower tariffs on US beef and ethanol. But implementation of the deal has been delayed while details were finalised.
On steel and aluminium, the US agreed to lower the 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Britain to zero, subject to setting a quota for British steel imports that must meet supply chain requirements.
Britain had avoided tariffs of up to 50 per cent on steel and aluminium that the US imposed on other countries earlier this month, but could face elevated tariffs from July 9 unless a deal to implement the tariff reduction is reached.

Rupee hits 18-month low amid Middle East tensions,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321894-rupee-hits-18-month-low-amid-middle-east-tensions,"KARACHI: The rupee fell to its lowest level in one-and-a-half years on Monday, weighed down by increased demand for dollars and investors’ concerns over volatility in global oil prices amid escalating geopolitical tensions.
In the interbank market, the rupee closed at 283.17 per dollar -- its lowest level since December 2023. The rupee had ended at 282.96 in the previous session. The local unit has depreciated by 1.71 per cent so far this fiscal year.
The rupee saw a decline in value in the open market as well, trading at 285.34 to the dollar from 285.13 in the previous session. Dealers said the dollar demand for imports and other payments pressured the rupee.
In addition, concerns over the surge in oil prices in response to the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict hurt the rupee.However, oil prices declined in Western markets on Monday, reversing Friday’s 7.0 per cent increase, as renewed military strikes by Israel and Iran over the weekend did not impact oil production and export facilities.
The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its main interest rate at 11 per cent, as the conflict between Israel and Iran, along with volatile global oil prices, posed additional risks to inflation.
“Going forward, the external outlook is susceptible to multiple risks, which mainly stem from heightened geopolitical tensions, volatility in international oil prices, possible adverse impact of proposed budgetary measures and potential shortfalls in planned financial inflows,” the central bank said in a statement issued following its monetary policy meeting.
Analysts expect the rupee to continue to face pressure and may fall to 284.5 against the dollar by the end of this fiscal year, ending in June, due to the central bank’s dollar buying from the currency market to meet its foreign exchange reserve target.

FDI to developing economies halves to 2.3% of GDP since 2008 peak: World Bank,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321895-fdi-to-developing-economies-halves-to-2-3pc-of-gdp-since-2008-peak-world-bank,"WASHINGTON: The World Bank said in a report on Monday that foreign direct investment (FDI) into developing economies has hit the lowest level since 2005, citing growing trade and investment barriers.
Developing countries received just $435 billion of such investment in 2023, the Washington-based development lender added, noting this was the latest year for which data was available.
As a share of gross domestic product (GDP), FDI flows to developing economies were at 2.3 per cent in 2023 -- about half the level of their peak in 2008. “What we’re seeing is a result of public policy,” said World Bank chief economist Indermit Gill, noting that investment is falling while public debt is reaching new highs.
“In recent years governments have been busy erecting barriers to investment and trade when they should be deliberately taking them down,” he added in a statement.Reversing this slowdown is “essential for job creation, sustained growth and achieving broader development goals,” urged World Bank deputy chief economist Ayhan Kose.
The bank stressed that FDI can be a strong boost to economic growth.But investment treaties, a catalyst for investment flows, have also fallen in numbers.
Between 2010 and 2024, just 380 new investment treaties came into force -- less than half the number between 2000 and 2009, when around 870 pacts took effect -- the World Bank report found.
“Global economic policy uncertainty and geopolitical risk have soared to the highest level since the turn of the century,” the report noted.
Meanwhile, FDI tends to be concentrated in larger economies.Two-thirds of FDI flows to developing economies between 2012 and 2023 went to just 10 countries, with China, India and Brazil jointly receiving almost half of total FDI inflows to emerging market and developing economies.
The 26 poorest countries received “barely two percent of the total”, the report added.The World Bank urged for stronger global cooperation to help direct funding towards developing economies with the biggest investment gaps.

What’s behind the surge in Japan’s rice prices?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321896-what-s-behind-the-surge-in-japan-s-rice-prices,"TOKYO: Rice prices in Japan have doubled since last year partly due to supply shortages that began last year, triggering a national crisis that has caught policymakers and consumers off-guard.
Rice is considered an almost sacred commodity in Japan, deeply engrained in its culture, language and tradition. The market is largely shielded from imports through high levies, but home-grown rice is now so expensive that shipments from abroad are skyrocketing, notwithstanding the tariffs.
The staple food has become a luxury item for many consumers, and responding to their pain is a top priority for policymakers ahead of key parliamentary elections in the coming weeks.
WHEN DID IT ALL BEGIN?
The crisis traces its genesis to the 2023 harvest.
An extreme heatwave contributed to a sub-standard crop that yielded far less marketable rice. Producers and businesses downstream had caught on to this phenomenon by early 2024 and prepared for the impending shortage by buying up what was available.
Adding fuel to the fire was a strong earthquake that hit southern Japan on August 8, 2024. The tremor triggered the government’s first-ever advisory on higher-than-usual risks of a mega-quake at the edge of the Nankai Trough, and panicked consumers sought to stock up on rice, emptying store shelves. A rise in demand from foreign visitors also contributed. Those factors led to a 400,000 metric tonne shortage by August and stocks from the 2024 harvest were sold roughly two months ahead of schedule. Wholesale prices in September shot up 41 per cent from August and have risen nearly every month since then.
Meanwhile, the agriculture ministry, relying on a crop index that measures production volumes of un-milled brown rice, continued to play down the shortage for months, saying there would be plenty to go around with the new harvest.
Since the early 1970s, the government has effectively controlled the amount of rice produced in the country to balance supply and demand, encouraging farmers to make less of it.
WHAT HAS THE GOVERNMENT DONE?
As soaring prices hogged headlines, the government announced plans in February to release rice from its emergency stockpile -- the first time it would do so in efforts to temper prices.
The rice was initially sold via auction to the highest bidder and distributed through the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) Group, a collection agency with an unwieldy supply chain, and failed to reach consumers quickly or ease retail costs.
Things started to speed up in late May with the appointment of Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, whose predecessor was forced to resign over a gaffe about rice.Koizumi immediately switched to selling directly to retailers at a price that would allow them to offer 5 kg of rice for about 2,000 yen ($13.85) -- less than half of average supermarket prices. That supply reached consumers within days.
So far, only the government’s stockpiled rice is cheap, and supply is limited.Nationwide supermarket prices for rice have stayed above 4,000 yen per 5 kg since March, exceeding Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba’s target below that.
Koizumi has pledged to release the government’s entire 910,000-tonne stockpile and rely on imports to swiftly bring down prices.
WHY NOT RELY ON IMPORTS?
Under a ‘minimum access’ agreement within the World Trade Organisation, Japan has an 770,000-tonne tariff-free import quota for rice, of which up to 100,000 tonnes is for staple rice -- equivalent to about 1.0 per cent of total consumption.
Beyond that amount, private imports carry a levy of 341 yen per kg. That’s usually enough to keep foreign products out.With the latest price surge, however, trading firms and wholesalers have been importing far more rice, mainly from the US.

Investors want clear ocean management rules to scale up funding,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321897-investors-want-clear-ocean-management-rules-to-scale-up-funding,"LONDON: A UN push for investment to protect the world’s oceans yielded around $10 billion in deals at a conference last week, way below the estimated annual need as many investors seek clearer regulation on ocean management before committing funds.
While political leaders at the UN conference in Nice took steps to tackle overfishing and pollution threatening delicate ecosystems and the people who depend on them, getting countries to agree to better governance has proven tough.
Just 50 countries have so far ratified a new High Seas treaty which sets out rules agreed by more than 130 nations in 2023 to govern international waters and clamp down on harmful practices. The US, pulled out of various climate initiatives by US President Donald Trump, is among those yet to ratify the treaty.
The lack of a clear governing framework and robust ocean-related data has stymied private sector finance to date, said Oliver Withers, head of nature at British lender Standard Chartered.
“The major dynamic that does not apply to terrestrial is the high seas do not belong to any one individual sovereign,” he said. “It is a significant challenge, there is no single sovereign responsible for the high seas.”
Of the deals chalked up in France, the bulk came from public sector banks, including $2.5 billion in funding by the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean (CAF) and 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) from a group of development banks to fight plastic pollution.
While a step up, the total figure falls far short of what is needed. Between 2015 and 2019, only $10 billion was invested against the UN estimate of $175 billion in required annual funding.
“Public finance isn’t enough but private finance is even less. So I think it’s a space in its infancy,” said Francine Pickup, Deputy Director, Bureau for Policy and Programme Support at the UN Development Programme.
Pickup said improving the policy backdrop and regulation, including removing subsidies she said encouraged harmful practices such as overfishing, was key, followed by the creation of a pipeline of investments including in start-ups focused on ocean-related technology.
To date, the sector has received just a small slice of overall funds, data shared with Reuters by industry tracker Sightline Climate showed.Between 2020 and 2025, ocean tech received just 0.4 per cent of the $202 billion invested across all sectors during that period, although the data showed a stronger start to 2025.
“What we seek as investors is that governments and the policymakers address systemic risks,” said Robert-Alexandre Poujade, biodiversity lead at BNP Paribas Asset Management, adding he would welcome the treaty “if it has lots of teeth and enforcement mechanisms”.
Fixing the funding shortfall also requires a concerted effort by policymakers and investors to tackle overlapping challenges to protecting marine biodiversity and ocean health.A warming planet is heating up the oceans, exacerbating effects such as water acidification and coral bleaching that climate scientists say will be improved if the world manages to cut carbon emissions as planned.
Overfishing and polluting sea vessels, offshore oil drilling and, potentially, deep-sea mining that collectively damage ocean health also require firmer policy action, scientists, ocean experts and investors say.
While action has hitherto been slow, there were signs of progress in Nice, as more than 20 countries backed a call by France to prevent deep sea mining; and a number of fresh Marine Protected Areas were created.
“In a sense the ocean is the last area that we have been pillaging without thinking about tomorrow,” said Flavien Jouber, Seychelles’ minister for agriculture climate change and environment, describing it as a “sense of free-for-all”.

Sri Lanka economy reports 4.8% growth in Q1,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321898-sri-lanka-economy-reports-4-8pc-growth-in-q1,"Sri Lanka’s economy grew 4.8 per cent year-on-year (YoY) in the first three months of 2025, official data showed on Monday, indicating a strengthening recovery from its worst financial crisis in decades.
Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector shrank by 0.7 per cent in the first quarter from a year earlier, but industrial output expanded by 9.7 per cent, and services grew by 2.8 per cent, the census and statistics department said in a statement.
Struck by a severe dollar shortfall, the economy went into free fall in 2022, contracting 7.3 per cent as it grappled with soaring inflation, a sharply weaker currency and foreign debt default.The economy shrank 2.3 per cent in 2023.
But it made a stronger-than-expected recovery last year, posting 5.0 per cent growth as measures implemented under a $2.9 billion, four-year bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), secured in March 2023, bore fruit.
“We expect growth to be less in the second quarter due to taxes and higher power prices, but we are bullish on growth in the second half of the year,” said Dimantha Mathew, head of research at First Capital.
“We expect full year growth to be between 4.0 per cent and 5.0 per cent.”Colombo hiked power prices by 15 per cent last week in its effort to secure IMF executive board approval for the fifth, $334 million, tranche in its programme.
Sri Lanka has made substantial progress on IMF-supported reforms, but more work is needed to reduce the Asian country’s 24.5 per cent poverty rate, tackle corruption and reduce domestic debt, Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s first deputy managing director, said during a meeting with officials and economists in Colombo on Monday.
Sri Lanka plans to discuss strategies with the IMF to lure foreign investment, President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said on Monday.Sri Lanka started talks with the United States after Washington imposed tariffs of 44 per cent in April on its exports of about $3 billion. The tariffs were later suspended.The World Bank estimates the island will grow 3.5 per cent this year.

"FBATI criticises federal, provincial budgets as anti-industry",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321899-fbati-criticises-federal-provincial-budgets-as-anti-industry,"KARACHI: President of the Federal B Area Association of Trade and Industries (FBATI) Shaikh Muhammad Tehseen has expressed strong dismay over the budgets presented by the federal and provincial governments, describing them as a roadmap of hardships for both industries and the public.
Tehseen criticised the introduction of new taxes, including sales tax on solar products and a carbon tax on petroleum, as measures that will significantly raise the cost of production and the cost of living nationwide.
He expressed concerns over the absence of relief for industries and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), saying the budgets failed to provide tax cuts, incentives or funding to support production for both export and domestic markets.
“Adding insult to injury, the government has increased petroleum prices, and policy rates remain elevated, leaving no room for industries to expand production,” he remarked.
He further highlighted the severe water crisis facing Karachi’s industries, noting that despite years of shortages, both the federal and provincial governments have failed to allocate adequate resources to address the issue. “Peanuts have been allocated to major water projects, and industries as well as citizens are left at the mercy of the tanker mafia,” he said.
Tehseen pointed out that the federal government has allocated Rs3.2 billion for the K-IV water project, while the Sindh government has pledged only Rs100 million for the same.
The FBATI president called on the government to revise the budget to address the needs of export-oriented industries, SMEs, and Karachi’s business community. He also urged authorities to withdraw the proposed increase in federal excise duty on packaged food items from 4.0 per cent to 20 per cent, warning it would further fuel inflation.
While he welcomed the tax relief granted to the salaried class, Tehseen stressed that the imposition of new taxes would exacerbate the financial burden on both businesses and consumers.

Russell triumphs in Canada as McLaren drivers crash,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321920-russell-triumphs-in-canada-as-mclaren-drivers-crash,"Montreal: George Russell secured Mercedes´ first win of the season in the Canadian Grand Prix on Sunday as McLaren´s championship-chasing drivers crashed in the final laps of an intriguing and hectic race.
The 27-year-old Briton beat close rival and four-time world champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull by 0.228 seconds under the safety car to claim his fourth career victory with his teenage Mercedes team-mate Kimi Antonelli finishing third.
The 18-year-old Italian rookie became the third-youngest podium finisher in Formula One history, showing composure in resisting late intense late pressure from championship leader Oscar Piastri of McLaren, who survived a collision with team-mate Lando Norris, on his way to fourth.
That ensured he extended his lead in the drivers´ standings to 22 points ahead of Norris who crashed into him on lap 67 of the 70-lap race, breaking his front wing as he attempted to pass on the straight.
“Yep, I´m sorry,” said Norris of his crash with Piastri. “It´s all my bad, all my fault. Unlucky, sorry. Stupid from me.” Charles Leclerc finished fifth ahead of Ferrari team-mate Lewis Hamilton, Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin and Sauber´s Nico Hulkenberg.
Esteban Ocon finished ninth for Haas, marking their 200th race with a solid points finish, ahead of Carlos Sainz for Williams. Russell was delighted to deliver his team´s first win since the Las Vegas Grand Prix last year.
“It´s amazing to be back on the top step. The last time was Vegas and last year here felt like it was a victory lost. But today we obviously got the victory thanks to that incredible pole lap and I am so happy to see Kimi on the podium as well.”
Verstappen was quick to congratulate both Mercedes drivers. “It was quite a good race although we were struggling on the tyres in the first two stints. We had an aggressive strategy and we managed to hang in there. And this was the maximum possible for us today.”
Antonelli was greeted enthusiastically by the big crowd at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve with his name chanted as he took his podium place. “It was so stressful,” he said. “But I am super happy! I had a good start, managed to jump to P3, and just stayed up there in the front. I am so happy to bring this podium home.”

Sky Warrior causes major upset at LRC,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321921-sky-warrior-causes-major-upset-at-lrc,"LAHORE: Lahore Race Club’s second day Summer meeting delivered surprises with outsiders dominating evening card Sunday night. The biggest shock was witnessed when Sky Warrior, dismissed at longer odds by most observers, powered up the rail in devastating fashion to claim victory in the Class-VII Division-V&VII event.
Thuse second day of Lahore Race Club’s Summer Meeting 2025 produced a series of stunning upsets, with long shot winners and surprise placings kept the packed crowd on their feet throughout the five-race programme.
The evening’s action demonstrated once again that form guides are merely suggestions when thoroughbreds take to the track. The opening maiden race saw pre-race favourite Noon Princess fail to deliver on her stretch potential, finishing a disappointing third as Leo Star flew to the front to capture victory ahead of interesting outsider Usman’s Love who ran his heart out to claim second place. The result immediately set the tone for an evening where predictions would prove unreliable.
The second contest delivered the night’s biggest shock when Sky Warrior, dismissed at longer odds by most observers, powered up the rail in devastating fashion to claim victory in the Class-VII Division-V&VII event.
Thunder Man, who had been tipped for place contention, managed to hold second place, while the heavily-backed Tango To Fire could only manage third after a lacklustre performance that left supporters stunned.
Race three continued the theme of surprises when Pocket Power, an unknown quantity at 2/1 odds, powered home to victory in emphatic style. The winner defeated intriguing outsider selection Zaman Sahib, who ran a creditable second, while Absolutely Not, despite being positioned favorably for place honors in pre-race analysis, had to settle for third place.
The penultimate contest saw pre-race predictions prove more accurate as Luckvir, identified as the leading contender, fought back gamely to secure victory. However, the placings again defied expectations with Mera Gondal producing a surprise second-place finish, while Thunder Boy, well-suited for place honors according to form students, managed to claim third.

No doubt Delap will be England number nine: Chelsea’s Maresca,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321925-no-doubt-delap-will-be-england-number-nine-chelsea-s-maresca,"Atlanta: Chelsea coach Enzo Maresca said Sunday he is confident new signing Liam Delap will become England´s number nine after Harry Kane.
Bayern Munich striker Kane, 31, has led the line for England for most of the last decade, but Delap is showing great potential, which led Chelsea to snap him up for Â£30 million ($41 million) from relegated Ipswich Town earlier this month.
“I don´t have any doubt that he can be in the future England´s number nine,” said Chelsea´s coach on the eve of their Club World Cup opener against Los Angeles FC, when asked if Delap could succeed Kane. Maresca would not confirm if the 22-year-old forward will start at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Monday but said Delap was not showing any nerves after taking the Blues´ number nine shirt.
Chelsea have signed several high-profile strikers in recent years who have struggled at the club, including Fernando Torres, Romelu Lukaku and Alvaro Morata. “Liam knows quite well how important is the number nine for this club... I see him quite relaxed, easy, he´s doing well, since he arrived he´s working well,” said Maresca.
The Italian coached Delap in Manchester City´s under-21 team previously and said the link between them would be mutually beneficial. “We know each other already from years ago, so I know what Liam can give us, he knows what we can give to him to improve and to become a better player,” explained Maresca.
“He was keen to join us because he knows the way we play, the season that we were together...he scored 24 goals. “We like Liam, Liam likes us, so it was an easy conversation.” The coach said he had not promised Delap he would be starting ahead of Nicolas Jackson.

Olympic champ Ingebrigtsen’s father acquitted of abusing son,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321926-olympic-champ-ingebrigtsen-s-father-acquitted-of-abusing-son,"OSLO: A Norway court on Monday acquitted Gjert Ingebrigtsen of abusing his son, Olympic champion runner Jakob Ingebrigtsen, but convicted him and handed him a 15-day suspended sentence for assaulting his daughter on one occasion.
Gjert Ingebrigtsen, 59, acted as trainer until 2022 to Jakob, 24, who won Olympic golds in the 5,000m in Paris in 2024 and the 1,500m in Tokyo in 2021. He was accused of physical and psychological violence against Jakob and his sister Ingrid, 19, between 2008 and 2022, but denied the charges.
At the conclusion of the lengthy trial that lasted from March 24 to May 15 at the Sandnes court, he was acquitted of the abuse alleged by Jakob. The court however found him guilty of one violent incident involving his daughter Ingrid.
In her testimony, Ingrid told the court her father hit her in the face with a wet towel in January 2022 -- a picture taken that day showed her with a red cheek. He said he was aiming for her finger, which she was pointing at him during a row.
In addition to a 15-day suspended prison sentence, Ingebrigtsen Sr was ordered to pay Ingrid 10,000 kroner ($1,000) in damages. Prosecutors had called for him to be jailed for two and a half years,
“They didn´t say they were disappointed. They said they were surprised,” Mette Yvonne Larsen, Jakob´s and Ingrid´s lawyer, told reporters when describing her clients´ reactions to the verdict.
Meanwhile, the accused´s lawyers noted that “what was decisive for the court´s conclusion was the lack of evidence proving that Gjert Ingebrigtsen had instilled constant fear in his children.”
“The court specifically highlighted that several close family members as well as external witnesses had neither observed nor witnessed mistreatment,” they said in a statement. The parties have 14 days to appeal the verdict. Throughout the trial, Jakob referred to his father as “the accused” and told the court he stopped calling him “dad” at the age of 11 or 12.
“My upbringing was very much characterised by fear,” he told the court. “I felt like I had no free choice and I wasn´t allowed to speak my mind. Everything was controlled and decided for me. An enormous amount of manipulation,” he said.
He recounted several episodes of physical violence, including slaps and kicks to the stomach, some of which occurred when he was seven years old. Ingebrigtsen Sr has called the trial a “textbook case of character assassination”.
He told the court he had been an “overly protective” father who had given his seven children a “traditional and patriarchal” upbringing. He was keen to contribute to their success but received only ingratitude in return, he said.
Jakob and two of his brothers, Henrik and Filip, who are also athletes, shocked Norway in October 2023 when they used a newspaper article to accuse their father of using physical violence during their upbringing.
The police investigated claims about all seven Ingebrigtsen siblings but retained only those relating to Jakob and Ingrid. Jakob -- who claimed the 1,500m and 3,000m world indoor titles right before the opening of the trial in March -- along with Henrik and Filip cut ties with their father in 2022.
On the final day of the trial, Jakob told the court the proceedings had “profound and heartbreaking consequences” for the siblings regardless of the verdict. “We have known that from the beginning, but it was nonetheless important to tell our story,” he said.

Salernitana players hospitalised with food poisoning after Samp play-off,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321927-salernitana-players-hospitalised-with-food-poisoning-after-samp-play-off,"ROME: Salernitana players have been hospitalised with food poisoning after returning south from a 2-0 defeat in the first leg of their Serie B relegation play-off with Sampdoria.
Salernitana said on Monday that training had been cancelled after 21 people among the playing and training staff picked up “serious food poisoning” which caused illness during Sunday´s trip back to Salerno from northern port city Genoa.
“The situation required the intervention of ambulances on arrival at Salerno airport and the hospitalisation of a significant number of those concerned,” added Salernitana. Italian media report that 16 people were hospitalised, eight of them from the playing squad, and that police had visited the hotel where Salernitana players stayed ahead of the first leg and which prepared the team´s in-flight meal for the return to Salerno.
Samp were relegated to the third tier for the first time in their history last month, only to be saved by a points deduction for Brescia which bumped the 1991 Italian champions into one of the division´s two relegation play-off positions.

Pakistan edge Japan to get closer to semis berth,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321928-pakistan-edge-japan-to-get-closer-to-semis-berth,"ISLAMABAD/KARACHI: Pakistan improved their chances of earning a place in the Nations Cup Hockey semi-finals with a 4-3 win against Japan in their second outing at the National Hockey Stadium in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) Monday.
Pakistan came back from 2-1 deficit to emerge winners leaving Japan on the cusp of going out of the tournament. It was Japan’s second successive defeat as they tasted 2-1 defeat earlier at the hands of New Zealand.
Pakistan started their second match of the Nations Cup against Japan on a high, striking the opening goal through Ghazanfar Ali in the 9th minute which was equalized by Matsumoto Kazimasa next minute. Japan’s Yamasaki Koji converted a penalty corner two minutes later to give Japan a 2-1 lead at the end of the first quarter.
Following a barren second quarter, Pakistan struck the equalizer through Rana Waheed Ashraf to make it 2-2 in the third quarter. Penalty corner specialist Sufyan Khan then banged the board in 53rd minute to give Pakistan 3-2 lead that stayed till the end despite some aggressive style of hockey played by Japan. Pakistan also got their opportunities but were unable to increase their lead.
France checked into the semi-finals from Group A with their second successive win, beating South Africa 2-1. Earlier, France defeated Korea 6-5 on the opening day. New Zealand also confirmed their place in the semi-finals from Group B beating Malaysia 4-3.
Malaysia were leading 3-0 at one point with New Zealand coming back strongly to make it 4-3. Pakistan now only need a draw against New Zealand on Wednesday to make it to the semis. A win against New Zealand will see Pakistan going on top of the table.
Hosts Malaysia now require a big win in their last match against Japan. However, before the last match scenario will be much clearer as Pakistan will lock horns with New Zealand in the penultimate match of the Pool engagements Wednesday.
With four points, Pakistan are currently occupying second position on the points table in Group B behind the New Zealand team having six points. Malaysia have just one point with Japan yet to open their account. In Group A, France with two wins of two matches are at No 1 with six points followed by Korea with three points. Wales and South Africa have one point each from two matches.

Spaun creates his magic moment to win first major at US Open,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321929-spaun-creates-his-magic-moment-to-win-first-major-at-us-open,"OAKMONT, United States:J.J. Spaun achieved his dream of winning his first major golf title by capturing the US Open. Doing it with a 65-foot birdie putt on the last hole was pure magic.
Spaun birdied four of the last seven holes to win at Oakmont on Sunday, firing a two-over 72 to defeat Scotland´s Robert MacIntyre by two strokes, clinching matters with his stunning putt at the 72nd hole.
“Just to finish it off like that is just a dream,” Spaun said. “You watch other people do it... you see crazy moments. To have my own moment like that at this championship, I´ll never forget this moment for the rest of my life.
Spaun drove the par-four 17th green to set up the tap-in birdie that put him ahead to stay, joining a list of birdie-birdie finishers to win the US Open that includes Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson and Jon Rahm. “It´s definitely like a storybook, fairytale ending, kind of underdog fighting back, not giving up, never quitting,” Spaun said. “With the rain and everything and then the putt, you couldn´t write a better story. I´m just so fortunate to be on the receiving end of that.”
Spaun, whose only prior PGA Tour win was the 2022 Texas Open, was a runner-up at the Cognizant Classic and Players Championship this year, losing a playoff to second-ranked Rory McIlroy at the latter.
“I just felt like you keep putting yourself in these positions, like eventually you´re going to tick one off,” Spaun said. Spaun made bogeys on five of the first six holes, including the first three, and birdied four of the last seven.
“As bad as things were going, I just still tried to just commit to every shot,” Spaun said. “I tried to just continue to dig deep. I´ve been doing it my whole life.”
Spaun has been resilient. In 2018 he was diagnosed with one type of diabetes but treatment was ineffective. In 2021, Spaun found he had been misdiagnosed and had another type of diabetes.
On Sunday morning, he made an early trip for medicine. “My daughter had a stomach bug and was vomiting all night long,” Spaun said. “Kind of a rough start to the morning. I´m not blaming that on my start, but it kind of fit the mold of what was going on, the chaos.”
A 96-minute storm delay was crucial, allowing Spaun to reset after his miserable start. “I just needed to reset everything, kind of like start the whole routine over,” Spaun said. “I felt like I had a really good chance to win the US Open at the start of the day. It just unravelled very fast.

Sri Lanka’s Mathews hails ‘dream run’ in final Test against Bangladesh,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1321930-sri-lanka-s-mathews-hails-dream-run-in-final-test-against-bangladesh,"GALLE, Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka are set to begin a two-Test series against Bangladesh in Galle on Tuesday that will mark the end of Angelo Mathews´s “dream run” in the game´s longest format, as the cricket season resumed following South Africa´s World Test Championship triumph at Lord´s.
The red-ball matches between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will be followed by a white-ball series of three one-day internationals and three T20s. Hosts Sri Lanka begin the contest as firm favourites, eager to turn a fresh page after a stuttering end to the previous WTC cycle.
Sri Lanka were firmly in the mix for a place in the WTC final until December before the wheels came off spectacularly. Two defeats in South Africa followed by a twin collapse at Galle against Australia saw them tumble down the rankings.
“We had one hand on a spot in the final but a few brain fades at crunch moments cost us dearly,” Sri Lankan captain Dhananjaya de Silva told reporters on Monday. “We´ve learnt our lessons. A strong home start lays the foundation for success on the road.”
Sri Lanka´s squad includes six uncapped players, with at least one debut cap set to be handed out. Spin remains Sri Lanka´s strength, with Prabath Jayasuriya the key and selectors also calling up off-spinner Akila Dananjaya.
Bangladesh enter the series without stalwarts Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan, and captain Najmul Hossain Shanto is realistic about the challenge. “Tamim and Shakib -- those are massive boots to fill,” he said. “But this is a chance for the young guys to put their hands up.”
Shanto, who is playing in Galle for the first time, said the team have “prepped well and we´re ready for the challenge”. The Test will also be the swansong of Sri Lanka´s veteran Angelo Mathews, who is retiring after 118 Tests.
The former skipper also played his first Test on the famous pitch perched beneath the fortress in Galle in 2009. “It´s been a dream run,” said 38-year-old Mathews.
“The wins in England in 2014 and whitewashing the Aussies in 2016 stand out. I´ve seen so many youngsters come through the ranks,” he said. “I truly believe Sri Lanka´s future is in good hands.”
Sri Lanka have won 20 of the 26 Tests they have played against Bangladesh, who have only managed a solitary win along with five draws. The second Test will begin in Colombo on June 25.

Relatives wait for remains after Air India crash,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322022-relatives-wait-for-remains-after-air-india-crash,"AHMEDABAD, India: Indian health officials have begun handing relatives the bodies of their loved ones after one of the world´s worst plane crashes in decades, but most families were still waiting on Monday for the results of DNA testing.
Mourners have held funerals for some of the 279 people killed when the Air India jet crashed in the western city of Ahmedabad on Thursday, but others are facing an anguished wait. “They said it would take 48 hours. But it´s been four days and we haven´t received any response,” said Rinal Christian, 23, whose elder brother was a passenger on the jetliner.
There was one survivor out of 242 passengers and crew on board the London-bound plane when it slammed into a residential area of Ahmedabad, killing at least 38 people on the ground as well.
“My brother was the sole breadwinner of the family,” Christian said on Sunday. “So what happens next?” Among the latest victims identified was Vijay Rupani, a senior member of India´s ruling party and former chief minister of Gujarat state.
His flag-draped coffin was carried in Ahmedabad by soldiers, along with a portrait of the politician draped in a garland of flowers. Crowds gathered in a funeral procession for passenger Kinal Mistry in Anand district, a two-hour journey from Ahmedabad. The 24-year-old had postponed her flight, leaving her father Suresh Mistry agonising that “she would have been alive” if she had stuck to her original plan.

France shuts Israeli weapons booths at Paris Air Show,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322023-france-shuts-israeli-weapons-booths-at-paris-air-show,"LE BOURGET, France: Geopolitical tensions roiled the opening of the Paris Air Show on Monday as French authorities sealed off Israeli weapons industry booths amid the conflicts in Iran and Gaza, a move that Israel condemned as “outrageous”.
The decision added drama to the major aerospace industry event, which was already under the shadow of last week´s deadly crash of Air India´s Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defence firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.
The booths displayed “offensive weapons” that could be used in Gaza -- in violation of agreements with Israeli authorities, a French government source told AFP. The French government has not given its exact definition of “offensive” weapons.
The companies -- Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Rafael, Uvision, Elbit and Aeronautics -- make drones and guided bombs and missiles. An Israeli exhibitor wrote a message in yellow chalk on one of the walls, saying the hidden defence systems “are protecting the state of Israel these days. The French government, in the name of discrimination is trying to hide them from you!”

Russia says US has cancelled next round of talks,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322024-russia-says-us-has-cancelled-next-round-of-talks,"MOSCOW: Russia said on Monday that the United States had cancelled the next round of talks between the two countries, an apparent setback in a process launched by presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump to improve bilateral ties.
In a statement, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova did not say if Washington had given any reason for the break in the talks, which began after Trump returned to the White House in January.
Russia had described relations as “below zero” under the previous administration of President Joe Biden, which provided advanced US weapons to Ukraine and imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on Moscow over the war.

How much damage has Israel inflicted on Iran’s nuclear programme?,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322025-how-much-damage-has-israel-inflicted-on-iran-s-nuclear-programme,"VIENNA: Israel´s strikes on Iran have targeted several of its nuclear facilities, as it claims the Islamic republic is seeking to develop nuclear weapons -- an accusation Tehran denies.
Experts told AFP that while the attacks have caused some damage to Iran´s nuclear programme, they are unlikely to have delivered a fatal blow. Israel´s operation included strikes on Iran´s underground uranium enrichment sites at Natanz and Fordow, and on its Isfahan nuclear site, the UN´s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said, citing Iranian officials.
A key, above-ground component of Iran´s Natanz nuclear site has been destroyed, including its power infrastructure. Agency chief Rafael Grossi said Monday that there has been “no indication of a physical attack on the underground cascade hall containing part of the Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant and the main Fuel Enrichment Plant”.
However, power loss at the cascade hall “may have damaged the centrifuges”, the machines used to enrich uranium.
There was “extensive” damage to the site´s power supply, according to a report from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), a US-based organisation specialising in nuclear proliferation, which analysed satellite images.
If backup power is lost, “at the least, the enrichment plant is rendered inoperable for the time being”, it said. At Iran´s underground Fordow enrichment plant, the country´s second uranium enrichment facility, the IAEA observed “no damage” following the attacks, Grossi said.
At the Isfahan nuclear site, however, “four buildings were damaged”: the central chemical laboratory, a uranium conversion plant, the Tehran reactor fuel manufacturing plant, and a metal processing facility under construction, the IAEA said.

Israeli fire kills 50 Palestinians waiting for aid in Gaza,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322026-israeli-fire-kills-50-palestinians-waiting-for-aid-in-gaza,"CAIRO/GAZA: Israeli fire killed at least 50 people on Monday, nearly half of them near an aid distribution site run by the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, the territory’s Health Ministry said, as UN officials denounced Israeli-backed aid delivery methods.
Medics said at least 23 of those people were killed and 200 others wounded near an aid distribution site in Rafah, the latest in daily mass shootings that have killed hundreds of Palestinians trying to reach food since Israel imposed a new distribution system after partly lifting a near three-month total blockade.
Israel has put responsibility for distributing much of the aid it allows into Gaza into the hands of a new US-backed group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which operates three sites in areas guarded by Israeli troops. The United Nations has rejected the plan, saying GHF distribution is inadequate, dangerous and violates humanitarian impartiality principles.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military about Monday’s reports of shootings. In previous incidents, it has occasionally acknowledged troops opening fire near aid sites, while blaming militants for provoking the violence.
The GHF said in a statement late on Monday that it has distributed more than 3 million meals at its four distribution sites without incident. Relatives arrived at Nasser Hospital to mourn the dead. Women and children wept beside bodies wrapped in white shrouds.

Britain appoints first female head of MI6 spy agency,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322027-britain-appoints-first-female-head-of-mi6-spy-agency,"LONDON: Britain on Sunday named Blaise Metreweli, a career intelligence officer, as the first female head of the Secret Intelligence Service, the foreign spy service known as MI6.
Metreweli, 47, who is currently MI6’s head of technology, known as “Q”, joined the Secret Intelligence Service in 1999, and has spent most of her career in operational roles in the Middle East and Europe, the government said in a statement.
Richard Moore, the current chief of MI6, will step down in the autumn after a five-year tenure. “I am proud and honoured to be asked to lead my service,” said Metreweli, who takes on one of the most powerful jobs in Western intelligence and will be known by the code name “C”.
MI6, founded in 1909, joins the other main British spy agencies, the domestic spy service MI5, and the intelligence communications agency GCHQ, in having appointed a female head. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who is currently in Canada for the G7 summit, said Metreweli’s appointment comes when Britain is “facing threats on an unprecedented scale”.
“I know Blaise will continue to provide the excellent leadership needed to defend our country,” he said. Metreweli’s biggest challenges are likely to be dealing with Russia, China and Iran.
Britain’s spy agencies have accused Russia of waging a campaign of sabotage across Europe to scare other countries off from backing Ukraine in its fight against a Russian invasion.

Bangladesh orders Hasina to return to face trial,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322028-bangladesh-orders-hasina-to-return-to-face-trial,"DHAKA: Bangladesh´s war crimes court ordered fugitive ex-leader Sheikh Hasina on Monday to return to face trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity.
Hasina, 77, fled Dhaka by helicopter to India in August 2024 at the culmination of a student-led mass uprising. She has defied an extradition order to return to Bangladesh. Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina´s government launched a crackdown in a failed bid to cling to power, according to the United Nations.
Hasina and former senior figures connected to her ousted government and her now-banned party, the Awami League, are being prosecuted in Bangladesh´s International Crimes Tribunal (ICT). Prosecutors have filed five charges against Hasina, including abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder -- charges that amount to crimes against humanity under Bangladeshi law.
“The court directed the prosecution team to issue a notice as soon as possible summoning them to appear before the court,” chief prosecutor Muhammad Tajul Islam said on Monday. The trial will resume on June 24 without her if she fails to return. The prosecution argues that Hasina ordered security forces, through directives from the interior ministry and police, to crush the protests.

UN slashes global aid plan over ‘deepest funding cuts ever’,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322029-un-slashes-global-aid-plan-over-deepest-funding-cuts-ever,"GENEVA: The United Nations said on Monday that it was drastically scaling back its global humanitarian aid plans due to the “deepest funding cuts ever” -- leaving tens of millions of people facing dire straits.
The UN´s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said it was seeking $29 billion in funding for 2025 compared to the $44 billion originally requested in December, in a “hyper-prioritised” appeal.
UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said later on Monday that it would have to terminate 3,500 jobs, cutting 30 percent of its workforce costs, as aid funding evaporates.
Since US President Donald Trump returned to office in January, the United States -- the world´s top donor -- has heavily slashed foreign aid, causing havoc in the humanitarian sector across the globe.
Drastic US funding cuts have had dramatic consequences for emergency aid, vaccination campaigns and the distribution of drugs to fight AIDS.
Other major donor countries have also cut back their contributions in the face of an uncertain economic outlook. “Brutal funding cuts leave us with brutal choices,” OCHA chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement.
“All we ask is one percent of what you chose to spend last year on war.” In late April, while visiting a hospital in Kandahar in Afghanistan, Fletcher warned: “The impact of aid cuts is that millions die.”
Almost halfway through 2025, the UN has received only $5.6 billion out of the $44 billion originally sought for this year -- a mere 13 percent. In total, the original plan covered more than 70 countries and aimed to assist nearly 190 million vulnerable people.
Even so, that plan acknowledged that there were 115 million people the UN would not be able to reach. “We have been forced into a triage of human survival,” Fletcher said on Monday. The mathematics “is cruel, and the consequences are heartbreaking”.
“Too many people will not get the support they need, but we will save as many lives as we can with the resources we are given,” he said.
Aid will now be directed so that it can “reach the people and places facing the most urgent needs”, with those in “extreme or catastrophic conditions” as the starting point, said Fletcher.
Fletcher´s call came as the UN´s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP) issued a joint early warning report identifying worsening hunger in 13 hotspots. Sudan, the Palestinian territories, South Sudan, Haiti and Mali have communities “already facing famine, at risk of famine or confronted with catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity”, said the report.
“The devastating crises are being exacerbated by growing access constraints and critical funding shortfalls,” it said. Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria are now considered of very high concern and requiring urgent attention to save lives, it added, with Burkina Faso, Chad, Somalia and Syria the other hotspots.
“This report is a red alert,” said WFP chief Cindy McCain. “Without funding and access, we cannot save lives. Urgent, sustained investment in food assistance and recovery support is crucial as the window to avert yet more devastating hunger is closing fast.”
Washington previously made up more than 40 percent of the UNHCR refugee agency´s budget -- $2 billion per year, the agency´s chief Filippo Grandi told the UN Security Council in April. “In light of difficult financial realities, UNHCR is compelled to reduce the overall scale of its operations,” Grandi said in Monday´s statement.
UNHCR estimates that it will end 2025 with available funding at about the same level as a decade ago -- despite the number of people forced to flee their homes having nearly doubled over the same period to more than 122 million.
“In total, approximately 3,500 staff positions will be discontinued,” the statement said, while hundreds of temporary workers have gone already. “Overall, UNHCR estimates a global reduction in staffing costs of around 30 percent,” the agency said.

Trump orders deportation drive targeting Democratic cities,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322030-trump-orders-deportation-drive-targeting-democratic-cities,"WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump directed federal authorities to ramp up deportation efforts in Democratic-led cities on Monday, doubling down on a politicized anti-immigration drive after major protests in Los Angeles.
“We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America´s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.
“These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center,” he claimed, citing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories that undocumented immigrants are voting in US elections in significant numbers.
Trump has made deporting undocumented immigrants a key priority for his second term, after successfully campaigning against an alleged “invasion” by criminals. Raids by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency in Los Angeles have sparked days of mainly peaceful protests, though they have seen sporadic violence at times.
Trump has pounced on the violent incidents to deploy 4,000 National Guards and 700 Marines to the Democrat-led city, against the wishes of local and state authorities. California has sued to regain control of the National Guardsmen from Trump, arguing he overstepped his authority. That suit is working its way through federal court.

Indian tribes visit UK museum to bring home ancestors’ remains,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322031-indian-tribes-visit-uk-museum-to-bring-home-ancestors-remains,"OXFORD, England: Tribes from the Indian state of Nagaland have held talks at a museum in Britain to secure the return of ancestral remains taken during the colonial era and put on display for decades.
Skulls and other body parts were often brought from Asia, Africa and elsewhere to Britain and to other former colonial powers, as “trophies”, to be traded, displayed or studied. There are growing calls worldwide for such remains, as well as stolen art, to be returned to their communities as part of a centuries-old movement demanding reparations for colonialism and slavery.
Just last month, skulls of 19 African Americans were returned to New Orleans from Germany to where they were sent for examination by phrenology - the now discredited belief that the shape and size of a head shows mental ability and character, especially when applied to different ethnic groups.
Historians say some of the remains were taken by colonial officers from burial sites and battlefields in Nagaland, where for centuries headhunting was common practice. Others were looted in acts of violence.
The Pitt Rivers Museum, which displays collections from Oxford University, holds the world’s largest Naga collection, including thousands of artefacts, 41 human remains, primarily skulls, and 178 objects that contain or may contain human hair.
It removed all remains from public display in 2020, including ancestors of Dolly Kikon, an anthropologist from Nagaland’s Lotha-Naga tribe, who teaches at the University of California and who travelled to Oxford last week.
“For the first time, there is a Naga delegation (at the museum) to connect and to reclaim our history, our culture and our belongings,” Kikon, 49, told Reuters.
Museum director Laura Van Broekhoven said the timing of the return of the remains was still uncertain due to the bureaucracy involved. The museum is also in talks with other groups to facilitate more items being returned.

Denmark deploys marine drones in Baltic and North seas,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322032-denmark-deploys-marine-drones-in-baltic-and-north-seas,"KOGE, Denmark: Denmark on Monday deployed two unmanned ships, developed by US company Saildrone, to bolster surveillance in the Baltic Sea and the North Sea, Danish officials and the firm said.
Two other drones were launched last week and are participating in the Nato mission Task Force X. These unmanned ships, which will be tested for three months by the Danish navy, are on “surveillance missions,” Kim Jorgensen, Danish National Armaments Director, told AFP.
“They will do it in the Baltic, they will do it in the North Sea, and they will do it in other Danish internal waters,” he said. “Some of our waters are quite busy, so I´m quite eager to see how this will work with an unmanned vessel.” The Baltic Sea, which can only be accessed through the Danish straits, accounts for over eight percent of global maritime traffic according to data from France´s ISEMAR institute of maritime economics.
Tensions over the Baltic Sea have heightened since Russia´s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Several undersea Baltic cables were damaged last year, with many experts calling it part of a “hybrid war” carried out by Russia against Western countries.
The unmanned ships -- called Voyagers -- are 10 meters long and can autonomously navigate for three months. The sensors equipped on them can scan down to a depth of 300 meters.

Zelensky says to discuss buying US weapons with Trump,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322033-zelensky-says-to-discuss-buying-us-weapons-with-trump,"VIENNA: Volodymyr Zelensky on Monday said that he will discuss buying US weapons with Donald Trump at the G7 summit, but added that US military aid was not on the agenda.
“We are not talking to America today about new assistance. Indeed, one of the issues I will discuss with President Trump at the meeting is the defence package that Ukraine is ready to buy,” Zelensky said during a visit to Vienna, from where he was to travel to Canada for this week´s G7 summit.
The Ukrainian president, who has overseen his country´s fightback against Russian forces for more than three years, said that “I can´t imagine and I don´t want to imagine... how to live without and fight without the help of the United States”.
He added: “I think we all have to work to make sure that the alliance between America and Europe doesn´t fall apart.” Zelensky also said that he viewed the G7 summit as a “very important” opportunity to see “what kind of pressure we can all exert to stop (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, so that he stops the fire, stops the war”.
He said that “we will discuss frozen Russian assets with the leaders, and we will also discuss sanctions”. Zelensky spoke alongside Austrian President Alexander Van der Bellen as he made his brief Vienna stopover.
In a statement, Zelensky´s office said that he and Van der Bellen spoke about an eventual Austrian contribution to Ukraine´s postwar reconstruction, including clearing landmines, energy cooperation and food security. The Austrian president noted that, while his country remained militarily neutral, “it is not so politically”.

"Tehran residents flee Israeli attacks, sparking huge jams",https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322034-tehran-residents-flee-israeli-attacks-sparking-huge-jams,"PARIS: Residents of Tehran have fled the Iranian capital in large numbers in the face of Israeli bombardments, creating immense traffic jams on the main road heading north, according to social media content posted on Monday.
Images verified by AFP, shot by a social media user from an overpass, showed near immobile traffic on a Tehran highway heading north with almost no vehicles in the opposite lane. Videos filmed inside Iran and posted by Persian-language TV channels based abroad, such as Iran International and Manoto, as well as widely followed bloggers including Vahid Online, showed long queues of cars barely moving as they tried to leave Tehran.
The congestion appears to be concentrated on Highway 49 which connects Tehran with Chalus on the Caspian Sea in the Mazandaran province. The region, about 150-kms north of Tehran and typically a three-hour drive even in normal times due to the mountain roads, has so far been largely spared.
It is popular with Tehranis for its mild climate, with many maintaining holiday homes there. Persian-language outlets meanwhile also posted images of hundreds of cars lining roads outside petrol stations in Tehran and its satellite city of Karaj, saying they were filling up ahead of long journeys outside of the city. While air travel is impossible, Iranians can still in theory cross borders by land to go abroad.

Suspected US shooter went to homes of four lawmakers during rampage,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322035-suspected-us-shooter-went-to-homes-of-four-lawmakers-during-rampage,"WASHINGTON: The suspected killer of a Minnesota lawmaker went to four state politicians´ homes on the night that he shot dead one and wounded another, a US attorney said on Monday.
Vance Boelter, 57, faces six federal charges, including two counts of murder by firearm, punishable by life imprisonment or even the death penalty, acting US Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joe Thompson told a press conference in Minneapolis.
The murderous nighttime spree began with the shooting of state Senator John Hoffman and his wife and ended with the killing of Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband. But it had two other stops in between, Thompson said.
Clad in a black tactical vest, body armor and a silicon mask, he banged on the door of a politician´s home in the Minneapolis suburb of Maple Grove, but found no one home, Thompson said.
He then travelled to a home in the adjacent town of New Hope, but left after he was spotted by a police officer. “The details of Boelter´s crimes are truly chilling. They are the stuff of nightmares,” Thompson said. Boelter, 57, was taken into custody late on Sunday in a rural area about an hour southwest of the Minneapolis suburbs where the killings occurred, police and state officials said.

US moves to protect all species of pangolin,https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/1322036-us-moves-to-protect-all-species-of-pangolin,"WASHINGTON: The United States on Monday moved to extend federal protections to all species of pangolins -- a step that would tighten trade restrictions and highlight the urgent conservation plight of the world´s only scaly mammals.
Found in the forests, woodlands, and savannas of Africa and Asia, pangolins are small, nocturnal creatures known for their distinctive appearance, slow and peaceful demeanor, and habit of curling into a ball when threatened. Often likened to a walking pinecone, they use long, sticky tongues to feast on ants and termites, give birth to a single pup each year -- and are the most heavily trafficked mammals on Earth. Their keratin scales are coveted in traditional medicine, and their meat is also considered a delicacy in some regions.
Despite steep population declines driven by poaching, habitat loss, and inbreeding, only one species - Temminck´s pangolin of Africa -- is currently protected under the US Endangered Species Act. Monday´s proposal by the US Fish and Wildlife Service would extend that status to all eight known species.
In a statement, the agency said it intends to list the four Asian species -- Chinese, Indian, Sunda, and Philippine -- as well as the three other African species: white-bellied, black-bellied. “I´m delighted the United States is doing its part to save these adorably odd creatures,” said Sarah Uhlemann, international program director at the Center for Biological Diversity.
